The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] [[Richard Nixon]], defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, incumbent vice president [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major [[realigning election]] as it permanently disrupted the New Deal coalition that had dominated presidential politics since [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]].\n\nIncumbent president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been the early front-runner for Democratic Party's nomination, but withdrew from the race after narrowly winning the [[New Hampshire primary]]. [[Eugene McCarthy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and Humphrey emerged as the three major candidates in [[1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries|the Democratic primaries]] until Kennedy [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|was assassinated]]. Humphrey won the nomination, sparking numerous anti-war protests. Nixon entered [[1968 Republican Party presidential primaries|the Republican primaries]] as the front-runner, defeating [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and other candidates to win his party's nomination. Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] ran on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, campaigning in favor of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]].\n\nThe election year was tumultuous; it was marked by the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[King assassination riots|subsequent riots]] across the nation, the assassination of Kennedy, and widespread [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] across university campuses. Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to the nation's cities and provide new leadership in the Vietnam War. A year later, he would popularize the term \"[[silent majority]]\" to describe those he viewed as being his target voters. He also pursued a \"[[Southern strategy]]\" designed to win conservative Southern white voters who had traditionally supported the Democrats. Humphrey promised to continue Johnson's [[war on poverty]] and to support the [[civil rights movement]]. Humphrey trailed significantly in polls taken in late August but narrowed Nixon's lead after Wallace's candidacy collapsed and Johnson suspended bombing in the Vietnam War.\n\nNixon won a plurality of the popular vote by a narrow margin, but won by a large margin in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], carrying most states outside of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. Wallace won five states in the [[Deep South]] and ran well in some [[ethnic enclave]] industrial districts in the North; he is the most recent [[third party (United States)|third party]] candidate to win a state.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/|title=Historical U.S. Presidential Elections 1789-2016|website=www.270towin.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref> It was the first presidential election after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which had led to mass enfranchisement of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|racial minorities]] throughout the country, especially in the South.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act|title=Voting Rights Act of 1965|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref> Nixon's victory marked the start of a period of Republican dominance in presidential elections, as Republicans won four of the next five elections.\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the [[1964 United States presidential election|election of 1964]], incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] won the largest popular vote landslide in [[U.S. Presidential election]] history over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]]. During the presidential term that followed, Johnson was able to achieve many political successes, including the passage of the [[Great Society]] domestic programs (including \"War on Poverty\" legislation), landmark [[civil rights]] legislation, and the continued exploration of space. Despite making significant achievements, his popular support would be short-lived. At the same time, the country endured large-scale race riots in the streets of its larger cities, along with a generational revolt of young people and violent debates over foreign policy. The emergence of the [[hippie]] [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the rise of [[New Left]] activism, and the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement exacerbated social and cultural clashes between classes, generations, and races. Adding to the national crisis, on April 4, 1968, [[Civil rights movement|civil rights leader]] Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], igniting further mass rioting and chaos, including [[Washington, D.C.]], where there was rioting within just a few blocks of the White House and machine guns were stationed on the Capitol steps to protect it.<ref>Thomas Adams Upchurch, ''Race relations in the United States, 1960\u20131980'' (2008) p. 7-50</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/timeline-seismic-180967503/|title=A Timeline of 1968: The Year That Shattered America|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe primary reason for the precipitous decline of President Lyndon B. Johnson's popularity was the [[Vietnam War]], which he greatly escalated during his time in office. By late 1967, over 500,000 American soldiers were fighting in Vietnam.  Draftees made up 42 percent of the military in Vietnam, but suffered 58% of the casualties as nearly 1000 Americans a month were killed and many more were injured.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Westheider|title=Fighting in Vietnam: The Experience of the US Soldier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9jS16CZh0YC&pg=PA136|year=2011|publisher=Stackpole Books|pages=136\u201338|isbn=978-0-8117-0831-9}}</ref> Johnson's position was particularly damaged when the national [[news media]] began to focus on the high costs and ambiguous results of escalation, despite his repeated efforts to downplay the seriousness of the situation.\n\nIn early January 1968, [[Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] stated that the war would be winding down as the North Vietnamese were losing their will to fight, but shortly thereafter, they launched the [[Tet Offensive]], in which they and Communist [[Vietcong]] forces launched simultaneous attacks on all government strongholds in South Vietnam. Though a U.S. military victory, Tet led many Americans to ponder whether the war was winnable or worth it. In addition, voters felt they could not trust their government's assessment and reporting of the war effort. The Pentagon called for sending several hundred thousand more soldiers to Vietnam. Johnson's approval ratings fell below 35%, and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] refused to let the president make public appearances on the campuses of American colleges and universities, due to his extreme unpopularity among college students. The Secret Service also prevented Johnson from appearing at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], because it could not guarantee his safety from assassination.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ben J.

Thus, the party machinery and many of the new congressmen and governors supported him. Still, there was wariness in the Republican ranks over Nixon, who had lost the 1960 election and then lost the 1962 California gubernatorial election. Some hoped a more \"electable\" candidate would emerge. To a great extent the story of the 1968 Republican primary campaign and nomination is the story of one Nixon opponent after another entering the race and then dropping out. Nixon was always clearly the front runner throughout the contest because of his superior organization, and he easily defeated the rest of the field.\n\nNixon's first challenger was [[List of governors of Michigan|Michigan Governor]] [[George W. Romney]]. A Gallup poll in mid-1967 showed Nixon with 39%, followed by Romney with 25%. However, Romney, after a fact finding trip to Vietnam, told Detroit talk show host [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]] that he had been \"brainwashed\" by the military and the [[diplomatic corps]] into supporting the Vietnam War; the remark led to weeks of ridicule in the national [[news media]]. Since he had turned against American involvement in Vietnam, Romney planned to run as the anti-war Republican version of Eugene McCarthy.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 18, 1968</ref> However, following his \"brainwashing\" comment, Romney's support faded steadily, and with polls showing him far behind Nixon he withdrew from the race on February 28, 1968.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 29, 1968</ref>\n\n[[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] was considered another potential threat to Nixon even before Romney's withdrawal, and had planned on potentially waging an active campaign after securing a role as Illinois's [[favorite son]]. Later however Percy declined to have his name presented on the ballot for the Illinois presidential primary, and while he never disclaimed his interest in the presidential nomination, he no longer actively sought it either.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/26/archives/percy-shunning-active-68-role-wants-to-stay-off-ballot-in.html |title=PERCY SHUNNING ACTIVE '68 ROLE \u2013 Wants to Stay Off Ballot in Presidential Primaries \u2013 Article \u2013 NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |accessdate=August 25, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times |date=1967-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nNixon won a resounding victory in the important New Hampshire primary on March 12, with 78% of the vote. Anti-war Republicans wrote in the name of [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the leader of the Republican Party's liberal wing, who received 11% of the vote and became Nixon's new challenger. Rockefeller had originally not intended to run, having discounted a campaign for the nomination in 1965 and planned on making [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Jacob K. Javits|Jacob Javits]] the [[favorite son]], either in preparation of a presidential campaign or to secure him the second spot on the ticket; as Rockefeller warmed to the idea of entering the race again however, Javits moved his attentions back towards seeking a third term in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/29/archives/javits-says-favoriteson-choice-for-68-is-still-an-open-matter.html |title=Javits Says Favorite-Son Choice For '68 Is Still an Open Matter \u2013 Article \u2013 NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=September 29, 1967 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> Nixon led Rockefeller in the polls throughout the primary campaign, and though Rockefeller defeated Nixon and [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[John A. Volpe|John Volpe]] from [[Massachusetts]] primary on April 30, he otherwise fared poorly in state primaries and conventions, having declared too late to place his name on state ballots.\n\nBy early spring, [[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]], the leader of the Republican Party's conservative wing, had become Nixon's chief rival. In the Nebraska primary on May 14, Nixon won with 70% of the vote to 21% for Reagan and 5% for Rockefeller. While this was a wide margin for Nixon, Reagan remained Nixon's leading challenger. Nixon won the next primary of importance, Oregon, on May 15 with 65% of the vote, and won all the following primaries except for California (June 4), where only Reagan appeared on the ballot. Reagan's victory in California gave him a plurality of the nationwide primary vote, but his poor showing in most other state primaries left him far behind Nixon in the actual delegate count.\n\nTotal popular vote:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Ronald Reagan]]: 1,696,632 (37.93%)\n* [[Richard Nixon]]: 1,679,443 (37.54%)\n* [[James A.

His only remaining obstacles were Reagan and Rockefeller, who were planning to unite their forces in a \"stop-Nixon\" movement.\n\nBecause Goldwater had done well in the [[Deep South]], delegates to the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] would be more Southern and conservative than past conventions. There was a real possibility that the conservative Reagan would be nominated if there was no victor on the first ballot. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination on the first ballot, with the aid of South Carolina [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]], who had switched parties in 1964.{{sfn|Perlstein}}{{page needed|date=March 2013}}{{sfn|Parmet|pp=503\u2013508}} He selected [[dark horse]] Maryland Governor [[Spiro Agnew]] as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.{{sfn|Parmet|p=509}}<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/1968-Presidential-Election/12303153093431-2/ | title=1968 Year In Review | publisher=UPI | accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> It was also reported that Nixon's first choice for running mate was his longtime friend and ally  [[Robert Finch (American politician)|Robert Finch]], who was the [[Lieutenant Governor of California]] at the time. Finch declined that offer,  but would later serve as the [[United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare|Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare]] in Nixon's Administration.

Johnson had been elected to the presidency only once, in 1964, and had served less than two full years of the term before that, the [[22nd Amendment]] did not disqualify him from running for another term.<ref>{{cite news|title=Johnson Can Seek Two Full Terms|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 1963|page=A2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Law Permits 2 Full Terms for Johnson|first=William|last=Moore|newspaper=The Chicago Tribune|date=November 24, 1963|page=7}}</ref> As a result, it was widely assumed when 1968 began that President Johnson would run for another term, and that he would have little trouble winning the Democratic nomination.\n\nDespite growing opposition to Johnson's policies in Vietnam, it appeared that no prominent Democratic candidate would run against a sitting president of his own party.  It was also accepted at the beginning of the year that Johnson's record of domestic accomplishments would overshadow public opposition to the Vietnam War and that he would easily boost his public image after he started campaigning.<ref name=johnman1967>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,712057,00.html|title=Man Of The Year: Lyndon B.

Kennedy]] from [[New York (state)|New York]], an outspoken critic of Johnson's policies with a large base of support, publicly declined to run against Johnson in the primaries.  Poll numbers also suggested that a large share of Americans who opposed the Vietnam War felt the growth of the anti-war [[hippie movement]] among younger Americans was not helping their cause.<ref name=johnman1967 />  On January 30, however, claims by the Johnson administration that a recent troop surge would soon bring an end to the war were severely discredited when the [[Tet Offensive]] broke out. Although the American military was eventually able to fend off the attacks, and also inflict heavy losses among the communist opposition, the ability of the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong to launch large scale attacks during the Tet Offensive's long duration greatly weakened American support for the military draft and further combat operations in Vietnam.<ref name=tetl>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/tet-offensive-shakes-cold-war-confidence|title=Jan 30, 1968: Tet Offensive shakes Cold War confidence|publisher =History.com:This Day In History|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> A recorded phone conversation which Johnson had with [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J.

Running as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire primary]], McCarthy hoped to pressure the Democrats into publicly opposing the Vietnam War. Since New Hampshire was the first presidential primary of 1968, McCarthy poured most of his limited resources into the state. He was boosted by thousands of young college students led by youth coordinator [[Sam Brown (activist)|Sam Brown]],<ref>[https://archive.is/20120714020341/http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:df96b4fbdd72ece621c2511b70c51217025f3845 Sam Brown discussing his involvement in the \"Clean for Gene\" campaign.] WGBH Open Vault.

These students organized get-out-the-vote drives, rang doorbells, distributed McCarthy buttons and leaflets, and worked hard in New Hampshire for McCarthy. On March 12, McCarthy won 42 percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49 percent, a shockingly strong showing against an incumbent president, which was even more impressive because Johnson had more than 24 supporters running for the Democratic National Convention delegate slots to be filled in the election, while McCarthy's campaign organized more strategically, McCarthy won 20 of the 24 delegates. This gave McCarthy's campaign legitimacy and momentum.\n\nSensing Johnson's vulnerability, Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy four days after the New Hampshire primary. Thereafter, McCarthy and Kennedy engaged in a series of state primaries. Despite Kennedy's high profile, McCarthy won most of the early primaries, including Kennedy's [[Massachusetts|native state of Massachusetts]] and some primaries in which he and Kennedy were in direct competition.<ref name=\"Rising1997\">{{cite book|author=George Rising|title=Clean for Gene: Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiO3P6SVttYC&pg=PA122|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-95841-1|pages=122\u2013}}</ref><ref>https://potus-geeks.livejournal.com/955258.html</ref> Following his victory in the key battleground state of [[Oregon]], it was assumed that McCarthy was the preferred choice among the young voters.<ref>https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2016/05/robert_kennedy_eugene_mccarthy.html</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Johnson withdraws}}Johnson withdraws===\n\nOn March 31, 1968, following the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy's entry into the election, the president announced to the nation in a televised speech that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks. Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing \"With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office\u2014the presidency of your country.

Indeed, he died on January 22, 1973, only two days after the new presidential term concluded. Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnson's withdrawal; internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly.<ref>https://time.com/5682760/incumbent-presidents-primary-challenges/</ref>\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon Johnson|Lyndon B.

Daley]]). This group had traditionally controlled the Democratic Party since the days of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and they feared loss of their control over the party. After Johnson's withdrawal this group rallied to support Hubert Humphrey, Johnson's vice-president; it was also believed that President Johnson himself was covertly supporting Humphrey, despite his public claims of neutrality.\n* The second faction, which rallied behind Senator Eugene McCarthy, was composed of college students, intellectuals, and upper-middle-class whites who had been the early activists against the war in Vietnam; they perceived themselves as the future of the Democratic Party.\n* The third group was primarily composed of Catholics, blacks and other minorities as well as several anti-war groups; these groups rallied behind Senator Robert F. Kennedy.\n* The fourth group consisted of white Southern Democrats. Some older men, remembering the [[New Deal]]'s positive impact upon the rural South, supported Vice-President Humphrey. Many would rally behind the third-party campaign of former Alabama Governor [[George C. Wallace]] as a \"law and order\" candidate.\n\nSince the Vietnam War had become the major issue that was dividing the Democratic Party, and Johnson had come to symbolize the war for many liberal Democrats, Johnson believed that he could not win the nomination without a major struggle, and that he would probably lose the election in November to the Republicans. However, by withdrawing from the race he could avoid the stigma of defeat, and he could keep control of the party machinery by giving the nomination to Humphrey, who had been a loyal vice-president.<ref>Dallek (1998); Woods (2006); Gould (1993).</ref>  Milne (2011) argues that, in terms of foreign-policy in the Vietnam War, Johnson at the end wanted Nixon to be president rather than Humphrey, since Johnson agreed with Nixon, rather than Humphrey, on the need to defend South Vietnam from communism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = David | year = 1968 | title = Paris peace negotiations: a two level game? | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 577\u2013599 }}</ref> However, Johnson's telephone calls show that Johnson believed the Nixon camp was deliberately sabotaging the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]]. He told Humphrey, who refused to use allegations based on illegal wiretaps of a presidential candidate. Nixon himself called Johnson and denied the allegations. Dallek concludes that Nixon's advice to Saigon made no difference, and that Humphrey was so closely identified with Johnson's unpopular policies that no last-minute deal with Hanoi could have affected the election.<ref>Robert Dallek, ''Nixon and Kissinger'' (2009) p 77</ref>\n\n===Contest===\n\n[[File:1968DemocraticPresidentialPrimaries.png|thumb|400px|Statewide contest by winner: Red = Kennedy, Orange = Smathers, Yellow = Young, Green = Johnson, Blue = McCarthy, Grey = No primary]]\nAfter Johnson's withdrawal, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Hubert Humphrey announced his candidacy. Kennedy was successful in four state primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California) and McCarthy won six (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey, and Illinois). However, in primaries where they campaigned directly against one another, Kennedy won three primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, and California) and McCarthy won one (Oregon).<ref>{{cite book |last= Cook |first= Rhodes |title=United States Presidential Primary Elections 1968\u20131996: A Handbook of Election Statistics |publisher=CQ Press |year=2000 |location= Washington, D.C. |pages=12\u201313 |isbn= 978-1-56802-451-6}}</ref> Humphrey did not compete in the primaries, leaving that job to [[favorite son]]s who were his surrogates, notably [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[George A. Smathers]] from [[Florida]], [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Stephen M. Young]] from [[Ohio]], and [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Roger D. Branigin]] of [[Indiana]]. Instead, Humphrey concentrated on winning the delegates in non-primary states, where party leaders such as [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] controlled the delegate votes in their states. Kennedy defeated Branigin and McCarthy in the Indiana primary, and then defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary. However, McCarthy upset Kennedy in the Oregon primary.\n\nAfter Kennedy's defeat in Oregon, the California primary was seen as crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy. McCarthy stumped the state's many colleges and universities, where he was treated as a hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war. Kennedy campaigned in the [[ghetto]]s and [[barrio]]s of the state's larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters. Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in a television debate a few days before the primary; it was generally considered a draw. On June 4, Kennedy narrowly defeated McCarthy in California, 46%\u201342%. However, McCarthy refused to withdraw from the race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming New York primary, where McCarthy had much support from anti-war activists in New York City. The New York primary quickly became a moot point, however, for [[Assassination of Robert F.

Although Humphrey appeared the presumptive favorite for the nomination, thanks to his support from the traditional power blocs of the party, he was an unpopular choice with many of the [[antiwar|anti-war]] elements within the party, who identified him with Johnson's controversial position on the Vietnam War. However, Kennedy's delegates failed to unite behind a single candidate who could have prevented Humphrey from getting the nomination. Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, refused to vote for him. Instead, these delegates rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota, a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries who had presidential ambitions himself. This division of the anti-war votes at the Democratic Convention made it easier for Humphrey to gather the delegates he needed to win the nomination.\n\nWhen the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] opened in Chicago, thousands of young activists from around the nation gathered in the city to [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|protest the Vietnam War]]. On the evening of August 28, in a clash which was covered on live television, Americans were shocked to see Chicago police brutally beating anti-war protesters in the streets of Chicago in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. While the protesters chanted \"[[the whole world is watching]]\", the police used clubs and [[tear gas]] to beat back or arrest the protesters, leaving many of them bloody and dazed. The tear gas wafted into numerous hotel suites; in one of them Vice President Humphrey was watching the proceedings on television. The police said that their actions were justified because numerous police officers were being injured by bottles, rocks, and broken glass that were being thrown at them by the protestors. The protestors had also yelled insults at the police, calling them \"pigs\" and other [[epithets]]. The anti-war and police riot divided the Democratic Party's base: some supported the protestors and felt that the police were being heavy-handed, but others disapproved of the violence and supported the police. Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicago's mayor Richard J. Daley (who was seen on television angrily cursing Senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]] from Connecticut, who made a speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police). In the end, the nomination itself was anti-climactic, with Vice-President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot.\n\nAfter the delegates nominated Humphrey, the convention then turned to selecting a vice-presidential nominee. The main candidates for this position were Senators [[Edward M. Kennedy]] from Massachusetts, [[Edmund Muskie]] from Maine, and [[Fred R. Harris]] from Oklahoma; Governors [[Richard J. Hughes|Richard Hughes]] of New Jersey and [[Terry Sanford]] of North Carolina; Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] of San Francisco, California; former Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Cyrus Vance]]; and Ambassador [[Sargent Shriver]] from Maryland. Another idea floated was to tap Republican Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York, one of the most liberal Republicans.  Ted Kennedy was Humphrey's first choice, but the senator turned him down. After narrowing it down to Senator Muskie and Senator Harris, Vice-President Humphrey chose Muskie, a moderate and [[environmentalist]] from [[Maine]], for the nomination. The convention complied with the request and nominated Senator Muskie as Humphrey's running mate.\n\nThe publicity from the anti-war riots crippled Humphrey's campaign from the start, and it never fully recovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58481 |title=White, pp. 377\u2013378 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Before 1968 the city of Chicago had been a frequent host for the political conventions of both parties; since 1968 only one national convention has been held there (the [[1996 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention of 1996]], which nominated [[Bill Clinton]] for a second term). Many believe that this is due in part to the violence and chaos of the 1968 convention.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|+Balloting\n|-\n!colspan=2|Presidential tally!! colspan=2|Vice Presidential tally\n|-\n![[Hubert Humphrey]] !!1759.25!!

The impact of the Wallace campaign was substantial, winning the electoral votes of several states in the [[Deep South]].

Wallace, however, won over many of the voters Nixon targeted, effectively splitting the conservative vote. Indeed, Wallace deliberately targeted many states he had little chance of carrying himself in the hope that by splitting the conservative vote with Nixon he would give those states to Humphrey and, by extension, boost his own chances of denying both opponents an Electoral College majority.<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>\n\nSince he was well behind Nixon in the polls as the campaign began, Humphrey opted for a slashing, fighting campaign style. He repeatedly \u2013 and unsuccessfully \u2013 challenged Nixon to a televised debate, and he often compared his campaign to the successful underdog effort of President [[Harry Truman]], another Democrat who had trailed in the polls, in the 1948 presidential election. Humphrey predicted that he, like Truman, would surprise the experts and win an upset victory.<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel S. Margolies|title=A Companion to Harry S.

Following the murder of [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] in April 1968, there was [[King-assassination riots|massive rioting in inner city areas]]. The police was overwhelmed and President Johnson had to call out the U.S. Army.

Many conservatives were critical of Chief Justice Warren for using the Supreme Court to promote liberal policies in the fields of [[civil rights]], [[civil liberties]], and the [[separation of church and state]]. Nixon promised that if he were elected president, he would appoint justices who would take a less-active role in creating social policy.<ref name=\"abe fortas\">{{cite book| title = Abe Fortas | author = Laura Kalman| publisher = [[Yale University Press]]| year = 1990 | url = https://archive.org/details/abefortasbiograp00kalm | url-access = registration | accessdate = October 20, 2008 | isbn = 978-0-300-04669-4 }}</ref> In another campaign promise, he pledged to end the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]].<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite web | url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/VolArm.html | title=The All-Volunteer Army After Twenty Years: Recruiting in the Modern Era | author=Thomas W.

However, Humphrey also felt constrained for most of his campaign in voicing any opposition to the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, due to his fear that Johnson would reject any peace proposals he made and undermine his campaign. As a result, early in his campaign Humphrey often found himself the target of anti-war protestors, some of whom heckled and disrupted his campaign rallies.\n\n===Humphrey's comeback and the October surprise===\nAfter the Democratic Convention in late August, Humphrey trailed Nixon by double digits in most [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#1968 United States presidential election|polls]], and his chances seemed hopeless. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, \"The old Democratic coalition was disintegrating, with untold numbers of blue-collar workers responding to Wallace's blandishments, Negroes threatening to sit out the election, liberals disaffected over the Vietnam War, the South lost. The war chest was almost empty, and the party's machinery, neglected by Lyndon Johnson, creaked in disrepair.\"<ref>''Time'' November 15, 1968</ref> Calling for \"the politics of joy,\" and using the still-powerful [[Trade union|labor unions]] as his base, Humphrey fought back. In order to distance himself from Johnson and to take advantage of the Democratic plurality in voter registration, Humphrey stopped being identified in ads as \"Vice-President Hubert Humphrey,\" instead being labelled \"Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey.\" Humphrey attacked Wallace as a racist bigot who appealed to the darker impulses of Americans. Wallace had been rising in the polls, and peaked at 21% in September, but his momentum stopped after he selected [[Curtis LeMay]] as his running mate. Curtis LeMay's suggestion of tactical nuclear weapons being used in Vietnam conjured up memories of the [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|1964 Goldwater campaign]].{{sfn|Perlstein}} Labor unions also undertook a major effort to win back union members who were supporting Wallace, with substantial success. Polls that showed Wallace winning almost one-half of union members in the summer of 1968 showed a sharp decline in his union support as the campaign progressed. As election day approached and Wallace's support in the North and Midwest began to wane, Humphrey finally began to climb in the polls.\n\nIn October, Humphrey\u2014who was rising sharply in the polls due to the collapse of the Wallace vote\u2014began to distance himself publicly from the Johnson administration on the Vietnam War, calling for a bombing halt. The key turning point for Humphrey's campaign came when President Johnson officially announced a bombing halt, and even a possible peace deal, the weekend before the election. The \"Halloween Peace\" gave Humphrey's campaign a badly needed boost. In addition, Senator Eugene McCarthy finally endorsed Humphrey in late October after previously refusing to do so, and by election day the polls were reporting a dead heat.<ref>Theodore H.

The key states proved to be California, Ohio, and Illinois, all of which Nixon won by three percentage points or less. Had Humphrey carried all three of these states, he would have won the election. Had he carried only two of them or just California among them, George Wallace would have succeeded in his aim of preventing an electoral college majority for any candidate, and the decision would have been given to the House of Representatives, at the time controlled by the Democratic Party. Nixon won the popular vote with a plurality of 512,000 votes, or a victory margin of about one percentage point. In the electoral college Nixon's victory was larger, as he carried 32 states with 301 electoral votes, compared to Humphrey's 13 states and 191 electoral votes and Wallace's five states and 46 electoral votes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1968|title=1968 Presidential General Election Results|last=Leip|first=David|website=David Leip's Atlas of Presidential Elections}}</ref>\n\nOut of all the states that Nixon had previously carried in 1960, Maine and Washington were the only two states that did not vote for him again; Nixon carried them during his re-election campaign in 1972. He also carried eight states that voted for John F. Kennedy in 1960: Illinois, New Jersey, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada and Delaware. This was the last time until 1988 that the state of Washington voted Democratic and until 1992 that Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan voted Democratic in the general election. Nixon was also the last Republican candidate to win a presidential election without carrying Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. This is the first time which the Republican candidate captured the White House without carrying Michigan, Minnesota, Maine and Pennsylvania. He would be the last Republican candidate to carry Minnesota (four years later, in 1972), as of 2012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is also the first time since 1916 that Minnesota voted for the candidate who did not eventually win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/1916_Election/?m=In+1916,+Woodrow+Wilson+won+the+election+while+losing+Minnesota|title=Presidential Election of 1916|website=www.270towin.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nRemarkably, Nixon won the election despite winning only two of the six states ([[Arizona]] and [[South Carolina]]) won by Republican Barry Goldwater four years earlier. He remains the only presidential candidate to win in spite of defending such a low number of his own party's states. All of the remaining four States carried by Goldwater were carried by Wallace in 1968.

From 1932 to 1964, the Democratic Party was undoubtedly the majority party, winning seven out of nine presidential elections, and their agenda influenced policies undertaken by the Republican [[Eisenhower administration]]. The 1968 election reversed the situation completely. From 1968 until 2004, Republicans won seven out of ten presidential elections, and its policies clearly affected those enacted by the Democratic [[Clinton administration]] via the [[Third Way]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/10/a_realigning_election.html|title=A Realigning Election? {{!}} RealClearPolitics|website=www.realclearpolitics.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe election was a seismic event in the long-term realignment in Democratic Party support, especially in the South.<ref name=\"Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/misunderstanding_the_southern_realignment_107084.html |title=Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment |publisher=RealClearPolitics.com|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> Nationwide, the bitter splits over civil rights, the new left, the Vietnam War, and other \"culture wars\" were slow to heal. Democrats could no longer count on white Southern support for the presidency, as Republicans made major gains in suburban areas and areas filled with Northern migrants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt|last=Lassiter|first=Matthew|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 17}}</ref> The rural Democratic \"courthouse cliques\" in the South lost power. While Democrats controlled local and state politics in the South, Republicans usually won the presidential vote. In 1968, Humphrey won less than ten percent of the white Southern vote, with two-thirds of his vote in the region coming from blacks, who now voted in full strength.<ref>Gould (1993) p 165; White (1969) p 401</ref>\n\nFrom 1968 until 2004, only two Democrats were elected President, both native Southerners \u2013 [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia and Bill Clinton of Arkansas.

Cohen, ''American Maelstrom: The 1968 Election and the Politics of Division'' (2016)</ref>\n\nAnother important result of this election was that it led to several reforms in how the Democratic Party chose its presidential nominees. In 1969, the [[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission]] adopted a set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for minorities, women, and youth. The reforms led most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections, instead of party leaders, to choose delegates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poliscinews.wordpress.com/tag/mcgovern-fraser-commission/|title=McGovern-Fraser Commission {{!}} Politics Matters|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1968, the only way to win the party's presidential nomination became through the primary process; Humphrey turned out to be the last nominee of either major party to win his party's nomination without having directly competed in the primaries.\n\nThis remains most recent presidential election in which a sitting president eligible for re-election did not seek another term (and one of only two such elections to occur under the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], the first being the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]]), and also the last election in which any third party candidate won an entire state's electoral votes, with Wallace carrying five states.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis election was the last time until 1992 that the Democratic nominee won Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan and the last until 1988 when Washington voted Democrat, and the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was also the first time since 1888 that [[bellwether]] [[Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire]] did not support the winning candidate,<ref>The Political Graveyard; [http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/NH/CO-votes.html Co\u00f6s County Votes for President]<br />David Leip's Atlas of US Presidential Elections; [http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2016&fips=33&f=0&off=0&elect=0 Presidential Election, 2016 in New Hampshire]</ref> which has occurred again only in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]. \n\nThis was the first time since 1928 that North Carolina voted for a Republican, and the first since 1912 (only the second time since 1852 and as of 2012, the last time) that Maine and Vermont did not support same party.\nDespite the narrow (0.7%) difference in the popular vote, Humphrey took only 35.5% of the electoral vote. This disparity prompted the introduction of the [[Electoral College (United States)#Bayh\u2013Celler Constitutional amendment|Bayh\u2013Celler Constitutional amendment]] in Congress, which would have replaced the Electoral College with a direct election of the presidency.

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee, former [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] [[Richard Nixon]], defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, incumbent vice president [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major [[realigning election]] as it permanently disrupted the New Deal coalition that had dominated presidential politics since [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]].\n\nIncumbent president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been the early front-runner for Democratic Party's nomination, but withdrew from the race after narrowly winning the [[New Hampshire primary]]. [[Eugene McCarthy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and Humphrey emerged as the three major candidates in [[1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries|the Democratic primaries]] until Kennedy [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|was assassinated]]. Humphrey won the nomination, sparking numerous anti-war protests. Nixon entered [[1968 Republican Party presidential primaries|the Republican primaries]] as the front-runner, defeating [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and other candidates to win his party's nomination. Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] ran on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, campaigning in favor of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]].\n\nThe election year was tumultuous; it was marked by the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[King assassination riots|subsequent riots]] across the nation, the assassination of Kennedy, and widespread [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition to the Vietnam War]] across university campuses. Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]] to the nation's cities and provide new leadership in the Vietnam War. A year later, he would popularize the term \"[[silent majority]]\" to describe those he viewed as being his target voters. He also pursued a \"[[Southern strategy]]\" designed to win conservative Southern white voters who had traditionally supported the Democrats. Humphrey promised to continue Johnson's [[war on poverty]] and to support the [[civil rights movement]]. Humphrey trailed significantly in polls taken in late August but narrowed Nixon's lead after Wallace's candidacy collapsed and Johnson suspended bombing in the Vietnam War.\n\nNixon won a plurality of the popular vote by a narrow margin, but won by a large margin in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], carrying most states outside of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]].

During the presidential term that followed, Johnson was able to achieve many political successes, including the passage of the [[Great Society]] domestic programs (including \"War on Poverty\" legislation), landmark [[civil rights]] legislation, and the continued exploration of space. Despite making significant achievements, his popular support would be short-lived. At the same time, the country endured large-scale race riots in the streets of its larger cities, along with a generational revolt of young people and violent debates over foreign policy. The emergence of the [[hippie]] [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the rise of [[New Left]] activism, and the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement exacerbated social and cultural clashes between classes, generations, and races. Adding to the national crisis, on April 4, 1968, [[Civil rights movement|civil rights leader]] Rev. [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], was [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassinated]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], igniting further mass rioting and chaos, including [[Washington, D.C.]], where there was rioting within just a few blocks of the White House and machine guns were stationed on the Capitol steps to protect it.<ref>Thomas Adams Upchurch, ''Race relations in the United States, 1960\u20131980'' (2008) p. 7-50</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/timeline-seismic-180967503/|title=A Timeline of 1968: The Year That Shattered America|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe primary reason for the precipitous decline of President Lyndon B. Johnson's popularity was the [[Vietnam War]], which he greatly escalated during his time in office. By late 1967, over 500,000 American soldiers were fighting in Vietnam.  Draftees made up 42 percent of the military in Vietnam, but suffered 58% of the casualties as nearly 1000 Americans a month were killed and many more were injured.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Westheider|title=Fighting in Vietnam: The Experience of the US Soldier|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9jS16CZh0YC&pg=PA136|year=2011|publisher=Stackpole Books|pages=136\u201338|isbn=978-0-8117-0831-9}}</ref> Johnson's position was particularly damaged when the national [[news media]] began to focus on the high costs and ambiguous results of escalation, despite his repeated efforts to downplay the seriousness of the situation.\n\nIn early January 1968, [[Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] stated that the war would be winding down as the North Vietnamese were losing their will to fight, but shortly thereafter, they launched the [[Tet Offensive]], in which they and Communist [[Vietcong]] forces launched simultaneous attacks on all government strongholds in South Vietnam. Though a U.S. military victory, Tet led many Americans to ponder whether the war was winnable or worth it. In addition, voters felt they could not trust their government's assessment and reporting of the war effort. The Pentagon called for sending several hundred thousand more soldiers to Vietnam. Johnson's approval ratings fell below 35%, and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] refused to let the president make public appearances on the campuses of American colleges and universities, due to his extreme unpopularity among college students. The Secret Service also prevented Johnson from appearing at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], because it could not guarantee his safety from assassination.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ben J.

Thus, the party machinery and many of the new congressmen and governors supported him. Still, there was wariness in the Republican ranks over Nixon, who had lost the 1960 election and then lost the 1962 California gubernatorial election. Some hoped a more \"electable\" candidate would emerge. To a great extent the story of the 1968 Republican primary campaign and nomination is the story of one Nixon opponent after another entering the race and then dropping out. Nixon was always clearly the front runner throughout the contest because of his superior organization, and he easily defeated the rest of the field.\n\nNixon's first challenger was [[List of governors of Michigan|Michigan Governor]] [[George W. Romney]]. A Gallup poll in mid-1967 showed Nixon with 39%, followed by Romney with 25%. However, Romney, after a fact finding trip to Vietnam, told Detroit talk show host [[Lou Gordon (journalist)|Lou Gordon]] that he had been \"brainwashed\" by the military and the [[diplomatic corps]] into supporting the Vietnam War; the remark led to weeks of ridicule in the national [[news media]]. Since he had turned against American involvement in Vietnam, Romney planned to run as the anti-war Republican version of Eugene McCarthy.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 18, 1968</ref> However, following his \"brainwashing\" comment, Romney's support faded steadily, and with polls showing him far behind Nixon he withdrew from the race on February 28, 1968.<ref>''The New York Times'', February 29, 1968</ref>\n\n[[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] was considered another potential threat to Nixon even before Romney's withdrawal, and had planned on potentially waging an active campaign after securing a role as Illinois's [[favorite son]]. Later however Percy declined to have his name presented on the ballot for the Illinois presidential primary, and while he never disclaimed his interest in the presidential nomination, he no longer actively sought it either.<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/26/archives/percy-shunning-active-68-role-wants-to-stay-off-ballot-in.html |title=PERCY SHUNNING ACTIVE '68 ROLE \u2013 Wants to Stay Off Ballot in Presidential Primaries \u2013 Article \u2013 NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |accessdate=August 25, 2015|newspaper=The New York Times |date=1967-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nNixon won a resounding victory in the important New Hampshire primary on March 12, with 78% of the vote.

Rockefeller had originally not intended to run, having discounted a campaign for the nomination in 1965 and planned on making [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Jacob K. Javits|Jacob Javits]] the [[favorite son]], either in preparation of a presidential campaign or to secure him the second spot on the ticket; as Rockefeller warmed to the idea of entering the race again however, Javits moved his attentions back towards seeking a third term in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/09/29/archives/javits-says-favoriteson-choice-for-68-is-still-an-open-matter.html |title=Javits Says Favorite-Son Choice For '68 Is Still an Open Matter \u2013 Article \u2013 NYTimes.com |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=September 29, 1967 |accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> Nixon led Rockefeller in the polls throughout the primary campaign, and though Rockefeller defeated Nixon and [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[John A.

In the Nebraska primary on May 14, Nixon won with 70% of the vote to 21% for Reagan and 5% for Rockefeller. While this was a wide margin for Nixon, Reagan remained Nixon's leading challenger. Nixon won the next primary of importance, Oregon, on May 15 with 65% of the vote, and won all the following primaries except for California (June 4), where only Reagan appeared on the ballot. Reagan's victory in California gave him a plurality of the nationwide primary vote, but his poor showing in most other state primaries left him far behind Nixon in the actual delegate count.\n\nTotal popular vote:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n* [[Ronald Reagan]]: 1,696,632 (37.93%)\n* [[Richard Nixon]]: 1,679,443 (37.54%)\n* [[James A.

His only remaining obstacles were Reagan and Rockefeller, who were planning to unite their forces in a \"stop-Nixon\" movement.\n\nBecause Goldwater had done well in the [[Deep South]], delegates to the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] would be more Southern and conservative than past conventions. There was a real possibility that the conservative Reagan would be nominated if there was no victor on the first ballot.

It was also accepted at the beginning of the year that Johnson's record of domestic accomplishments would overshadow public opposition to the Vietnam War and that he would easily boost his public image after he started campaigning.<ref name=johnman1967>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,712057,00.html|title=Man Of The Year: Lyndon B.

Although the American military was eventually able to fend off the attacks, and also inflict heavy losses among the communist opposition, the ability of the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong to launch large scale attacks during the Tet Offensive's long duration greatly weakened American support for the military draft and further combat operations in Vietnam.<ref name=tetl>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/tet-offensive-shakes-cold-war-confidence|title=Jan 30, 1968: Tet Offensive shakes Cold War confidence|publisher =History.com:This Day In History|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> A recorded phone conversation which Johnson had with [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J.

Running as an anti-war candidate in the [[New Hampshire primary]], McCarthy hoped to pressure the Democrats into publicly opposing the Vietnam War. Since New Hampshire was the first presidential primary of 1968, McCarthy poured most of his limited resources into the state. He was boosted by thousands of young college students led by youth coordinator [[Sam Brown (activist)|Sam Brown]],<ref>[https://archive.is/20120714020341/http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:df96b4fbdd72ece621c2511b70c51217025f3845 Sam Brown discussing his involvement in the \"Clean for Gene\" campaign.] WGBH Open Vault.

These students organized get-out-the-vote drives, rang doorbells, distributed McCarthy buttons and leaflets, and worked hard in New Hampshire for McCarthy. On March 12, McCarthy won 42 percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49 percent, a shockingly strong showing against an incumbent president, which was even more impressive because Johnson had more than 24 supporters running for the Democratic National Convention delegate slots to be filled in the election, while McCarthy's campaign organized more strategically, McCarthy won 20 of the 24 delegates. This gave McCarthy's campaign legitimacy and momentum.\n\nSensing Johnson's vulnerability, Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy four days after the New Hampshire primary. Thereafter, McCarthy and Kennedy engaged in a series of state primaries. Despite Kennedy's high profile, McCarthy won most of the early primaries, including Kennedy's [[Massachusetts|native state of Massachusetts]] and some primaries in which he and Kennedy were in direct competition.<ref name=\"Rising1997\">{{cite book|author=George Rising|title=Clean for Gene: Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RiO3P6SVttYC&pg=PA122|year=1997|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-95841-1|pages=122\u2013}}</ref><ref>https://potus-geeks.livejournal.com/955258.html</ref> Following his victory in the key battleground state of [[Oregon]], it was assumed that McCarthy was the preferred choice among the young voters.<ref>https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2016/05/robert_kennedy_eugene_mccarthy.html</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Johnson withdraws}}Johnson withdraws===\n\nOn March 31, 1968, following the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy's entry into the election, the president announced to the nation in a televised speech that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks. Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing \"With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world's hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office\u2014the presidency of your country.

Indeed, he died on January 22, 1973, only two days after the new presidential term concluded. Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnson's withdrawal; internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly.<ref>https://time.com/5682760/incumbent-presidents-primary-challenges/</ref>\n[[File:Hubert Humphrey and Lyndon Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Lyndon Johnson|Lyndon B.

Daley]]). This group had traditionally controlled the Democratic Party since the days of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and they feared loss of their control over the party. After Johnson's withdrawal this group rallied to support Hubert Humphrey, Johnson's vice-president; it was also believed that President Johnson himself was covertly supporting Humphrey, despite his public claims of neutrality.\n* The second faction, which rallied behind Senator Eugene McCarthy, was composed of college students, intellectuals, and upper-middle-class whites who had been the early activists against the war in Vietnam; they perceived themselves as the future of the Democratic Party.\n* The third group was primarily composed of Catholics, blacks and other minorities as well as several anti-war groups; these groups rallied behind Senator Robert F. Kennedy.\n* The fourth group consisted of white Southern Democrats. Some older men, remembering the [[New Deal]]'s positive impact upon the rural South, supported Vice-President Humphrey. Many would rally behind the third-party campaign of former Alabama Governor [[George C. Wallace]] as a \"law and order\" candidate.\n\nSince the Vietnam War had become the major issue that was dividing the Democratic Party, and Johnson had come to symbolize the war for many liberal Democrats, Johnson believed that he could not win the nomination without a major struggle, and that he would probably lose the election in November to the Republicans. However, by withdrawing from the race he could avoid the stigma of defeat, and he could keep control of the party machinery by giving the nomination to Humphrey, who had been a loyal vice-president.<ref>Dallek (1998); Woods (2006); Gould (1993).</ref>  Milne (2011) argues that, in terms of foreign-policy in the Vietnam War, Johnson at the end wanted Nixon to be president rather than Humphrey, since Johnson agreed with Nixon, rather than Humphrey, on the need to defend South Vietnam from communism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = David | year = 1968 | title = Paris peace negotiations: a two level game? | url = | journal = Review of International Studies | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 577\u2013599 }}</ref> However, Johnson's telephone calls show that Johnson believed the Nixon camp was deliberately sabotaging the [[Paris Peace Accords|Paris peace talks]].

Kennedy was successful in four state primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and California) and McCarthy won six (Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Oregon, New Jersey, and Illinois). However, in primaries where they campaigned directly against one another, Kennedy won three primaries (Indiana, Nebraska, and California) and McCarthy won one (Oregon).<ref>{{cite book |last= Cook |first= Rhodes |title=United States Presidential Primary Elections 1968\u20131996: A Handbook of Election Statistics |publisher=CQ Press |year=2000 |location= Washington, D.C. |pages=12\u201313 |isbn= 978-1-56802-451-6}}</ref> Humphrey did not compete in the primaries, leaving that job to [[favorite son]]s who were his surrogates, notably [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[George A. Smathers]] from [[Florida]], [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Stephen M. Young]] from [[Ohio]], and [[Governor of Indiana|Governor]] [[Roger D. Branigin]] of [[Indiana]]. Instead, Humphrey concentrated on winning the delegates in non-primary states, where party leaders such as [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] controlled the delegate votes in their states. Kennedy defeated Branigin and McCarthy in the Indiana primary, and then defeated McCarthy in the Nebraska primary. However, McCarthy upset Kennedy in the Oregon primary.\n\nAfter Kennedy's defeat in Oregon, the California primary was seen as crucial to both Kennedy and McCarthy. McCarthy stumped the state's many colleges and universities, where he was treated as a hero for being the first presidential candidate to oppose the war. Kennedy campaigned in the [[ghetto]]s and [[barrio]]s of the state's larger cities, where he was mobbed by enthusiastic supporters. Kennedy and McCarthy engaged in a television debate a few days before the primary; it was generally considered a draw. On June 4, Kennedy narrowly defeated McCarthy in California, 46%\u201342%. However, McCarthy refused to withdraw from the race and made it clear that he would contest Kennedy in the upcoming New York primary, where McCarthy had much support from anti-war activists in New York City. The New York primary quickly became a moot point, however, for [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Kennedy was assassinated]]  shortly after midnight on June 5; he died twenty-six hours later at [[Good Samaritan Hospital (Los Angeles)|Good Samaritan Hospital]]. Kennedy had just given his victory speech in a crowded ballroom of the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles; he and his aides then entered a narrow kitchen pantry on their way to a banquet room to meet with reporters.

Some historians, such as [[Theodore H. White]] and [[Arthur M.

Jack Newfield, author of ''RFK: A Memoir'', stated in a 1998 interview that on the night he was assassinated, \"[Kennedy] had a phone conversation with Mayor Daley of Chicago, and Mayor Daley all but promised to throw the Illinois delegates to Bobby at the convention in August 1968.

The journalist [[Richard Reeves (American writer)|Richard Reeves]] and historian [[Michael Beschloss]] have both written that Humphrey was the likely nominee, and future Democratic National Committee chairman [[Larry O'Brien]] wrote in his memoirs that Kennedy's chances of winning the nomination had been slim, even after his win in California.\n\nAt the moment of RFK's death, the delegate totals were:\n*[[Hubert Humphrey]] 561\n*[[Robert F.

Although Humphrey appeared the presumptive favorite for the nomination, thanks to his support from the traditional power blocs of the party, he was an unpopular choice with many of the [[antiwar|anti-war]] elements within the party, who identified him with Johnson's controversial position on the Vietnam War. However, Kennedy's delegates failed to unite behind a single candidate who could have prevented Humphrey from getting the nomination. Some of Kennedy's support went to McCarthy, but many of Kennedy's delegates, remembering their bitter primary battles with McCarthy, refused to vote for him. Instead, these delegates rallied around the late-starting candidacy of Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota, a Kennedy supporter in the spring primaries who had presidential ambitions himself. This division of the anti-war votes at the Democratic Convention made it easier for Humphrey to gather the delegates he needed to win the nomination.\n\nWhen the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] opened in Chicago, thousands of young activists from around the nation gathered in the city to [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|protest the Vietnam War]]. On the evening of August 28, in a clash which was covered on live television, Americans were shocked to see Chicago police brutally beating anti-war protesters in the streets of Chicago in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel. While the protesters chanted \"[[the whole world is watching]]\", the police used clubs and [[tear gas]] to beat back or arrest the protesters, leaving many of them bloody and dazed. The tear gas wafted into numerous hotel suites; in one of them Vice President Humphrey was watching the proceedings on television. The police said that their actions were justified because numerous police officers were being injured by bottles, rocks, and broken glass that were being thrown at them by the protestors. The protestors had also yelled insults at the police, calling them \"pigs\" and other [[epithets]]. The anti-war and police riot divided the Democratic Party's base: some supported the protestors and felt that the police were being heavy-handed, but others disapproved of the violence and supported the police. Meanwhile, the convention itself was marred by the strong-arm tactics of Chicago's mayor Richard J. Daley (who was seen on television angrily cursing Senator [[Abraham Ribicoff]] from Connecticut, who made a speech at the convention denouncing the excesses of the Chicago police). In the end, the nomination itself was anti-climactic, with Vice-President Humphrey handily beating McCarthy and McGovern on the first ballot.\n\nAfter the delegates nominated Humphrey, the convention then turned to selecting a vice-presidential nominee. The main candidates for this position were Senators [[Edward M. Kennedy]] from Massachusetts, [[Edmund Muskie]] from Maine, and [[Fred R. Harris]] from Oklahoma; Governors [[Richard J. Hughes|Richard Hughes]] of New Jersey and [[Terry Sanford]] of North Carolina; Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] of San Francisco, California; former Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Cyrus Vance]]; and Ambassador [[Sargent Shriver]] from Maryland. Another idea floated was to tap Republican Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] of New York, one of the most liberal Republicans.  Ted Kennedy was Humphrey's first choice, but the senator turned him down. After narrowing it down to Senator Muskie and Senator Harris, Vice-President Humphrey chose Muskie, a moderate and [[environmentalist]] from [[Maine]], for the nomination. The convention complied with the request and nominated Senator Muskie as Humphrey's running mate.\n\nThe publicity from the anti-war riots crippled Humphrey's campaign from the start, and it never fully recovered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58481 |title=White, pp. 377\u2013378 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |accessdate=June 17, 2010}}</ref> Before 1968 the city of Chicago had been a frequent host for the political conventions of both parties; since 1968 only one national convention has been held there (the [[1996 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention of 1996]], which nominated [[Bill Clinton]] for a second term). Many believe that this is due in part to the violence and chaos of the 1968 convention.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|+Balloting\n|-\n!colspan=2|Presidential tally!! colspan=2|Vice Presidential tally\n|-\n![[Hubert Humphrey]] !!1759.25!!

However, Humphrey also felt constrained for most of his campaign in voicing any opposition to the Vietnam War policies of President Johnson, due to his fear that Johnson would reject any peace proposals he made and undermine his campaign. As a result, early in his campaign Humphrey often found himself the target of anti-war protestors, some of whom heckled and disrupted his campaign rallies.\n\n===Humphrey's comeback and the October surprise===\nAfter the Democratic Convention in late August, Humphrey trailed Nixon by double digits in most [[Historical polling for U.S. Presidential elections#1968 United States presidential election|polls]], and his chances seemed hopeless. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, \"The old Democratic coalition was disintegrating, with untold numbers of blue-collar workers responding to Wallace's blandishments, Negroes threatening to sit out the election, liberals disaffected over the Vietnam War, the South lost. The war chest was almost empty, and the party's machinery, neglected by Lyndon Johnson, creaked in disrepair.\"<ref>''Time'' November 15, 1968</ref> Calling for \"the politics of joy,\" and using the still-powerful [[Trade union|labor unions]] as his base, Humphrey fought back. In order to distance himself from Johnson and to take advantage of the Democratic plurality in voter registration, Humphrey stopped being identified in ads as \"Vice-President Hubert Humphrey,\" instead being labelled \"Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey.\" Humphrey attacked Wallace as a racist bigot who appealed to the darker impulses of Americans. Wallace had been rising in the polls, and peaked at 21% in September, but his momentum stopped after he selected [[Curtis LeMay]] as his running mate. Curtis LeMay's suggestion of tactical nuclear weapons being used in Vietnam conjured up memories of the [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|1964 Goldwater campaign]].{{sfn|Perlstein}} Labor unions also undertook a major effort to win back union members who were supporting Wallace, with substantial success. Polls that showed Wallace winning almost one-half of union members in the summer of 1968 showed a sharp decline in his union support as the campaign progressed. As election day approached and Wallace's support in the North and Midwest began to wane, Humphrey finally began to climb in the polls.\n\nIn October, Humphrey\u2014who was rising sharply in the polls due to the collapse of the Wallace vote\u2014began to distance himself publicly from the Johnson administration on the Vietnam War, calling for a bombing halt. The key turning point for Humphrey's campaign came when President Johnson officially announced a bombing halt, and even a possible peace deal, the weekend before the election. The \"Halloween Peace\" gave Humphrey's campaign a badly needed boost. In addition, Senator Eugene McCarthy finally endorsed Humphrey in late October after previously refusing to do so, and by election day the polls were reporting a dead heat.<ref>Theodore H.

The key states proved to be California, Ohio, and Illinois, all of which Nixon won by three percentage points or less. Had Humphrey carried all three of these states, he would have won the election. Had he carried only two of them or just California among them, George Wallace would have succeeded in his aim of preventing an electoral college majority for any candidate, and the decision would have been given to the House of Representatives, at the time controlled by the Democratic Party. Nixon won the popular vote with a plurality of 512,000 votes, or a victory margin of about one percentage point. In the electoral college Nixon's victory was larger, as he carried 32 states with 301 electoral votes, compared to Humphrey's 13 states and 191 electoral votes and Wallace's five states and 46 electoral votes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1968|title=1968 Presidential General Election Results|last=Leip|first=David|website=David Leip's Atlas of Presidential Elections}}</ref>\n\nOut of all the states that Nixon had previously carried in 1960, Maine and Washington were the only two states that did not vote for him again; Nixon carried them during his re-election campaign in 1972. He also carried eight states that voted for John F. Kennedy in 1960: Illinois, New Jersey, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada and Delaware. This was the last time until 1988 that the state of Washington voted Democratic and until 1992 that Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan voted Democratic in the general election. Nixon was also the last Republican candidate to win a presidential election without carrying Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. This is the first time which the Republican candidate captured the White House without carrying Michigan, Minnesota, Maine and Pennsylvania. He would be the last Republican candidate to carry Minnesota (four years later, in 1972), as of 2012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is also the first time since 1916 that Minnesota voted for the candidate who did not eventually win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.270towin.com/1916_Election/?m=In+1916,+Woodrow+Wilson+won+the+election+while+losing+Minnesota|title=Presidential Election of 1916|website=www.270towin.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nRemarkably, Nixon won the election despite winning only two of the six states ([[Arizona]] and [[South Carolina]]) won by Republican Barry Goldwater four years earlier.

From 1932 to 1964, the Democratic Party was undoubtedly the majority party, winning seven out of nine presidential elections, and their agenda influenced policies undertaken by the Republican [[Eisenhower administration]]. The 1968 election reversed the situation completely. From 1968 until 2004, Republicans won seven out of ten presidential elections, and its policies clearly affected those enacted by the Democratic [[Clinton administration]] via the [[Third Way]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/10/a_realigning_election.html|title=A Realigning Election? {{!}} RealClearPolitics|website=www.realclearpolitics.com|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe election was a seismic event in the long-term realignment in Democratic Party support, especially in the South.<ref name=\"Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/misunderstanding_the_southern_realignment_107084.html |title=Misunderstanding the Southern Realignment |publisher=RealClearPolitics.com|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref> Nationwide, the bitter splits over civil rights, the new left, the Vietnam War, and other \"culture wars\" were slow to heal. Democrats could no longer count on white Southern support for the presidency, as Republicans made major gains in suburban areas and areas filled with Northern migrants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt|last=Lassiter|first=Matthew|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 17}}</ref> The rural Democratic \"courthouse cliques\" in the South lost power. While Democrats controlled local and state politics in the South, Republicans usually won the presidential vote. In 1968, Humphrey won less than ten percent of the white Southern vote, with two-thirds of his vote in the region coming from blacks, who now voted in full strength.<ref>Gould (1993) p 165; White (1969) p 401</ref>\n\nFrom 1968 until 2004, only two Democrats were elected President, both native Southerners \u2013 [[Jimmy Carter]] of Georgia and Bill Clinton of Arkansas.

Cohen, ''American Maelstrom: The 1968 Election and the Politics of Division'' (2016)</ref>\n\nAnother important result of this election was that it led to several reforms in how the Democratic Party chose its presidential nominees. In 1969, the [[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission]] adopted a set of rules for the states to follow in selecting convention delegates. These rules reduced the influence of party leaders on the nominating process and provided greater representation for minorities, women, and youth. The reforms led most states to adopt laws requiring primary elections, instead of party leaders, to choose delegates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://poliscinews.wordpress.com/tag/mcgovern-fraser-commission/|title=McGovern-Fraser Commission {{!}} Politics Matters|language=en|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1968, the only way to win the party's presidential nomination became through the primary process; Humphrey turned out to be the last nominee of either major party to win his party's nomination without having directly competed in the primaries.\n\nThis remains most recent presidential election in which a sitting president eligible for re-election did not seek another term (and one of only two such elections to occur under the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], the first being the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 election]]), and also the last election in which any third party candidate won an entire state's electoral votes, with Wallace carrying five states.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis election was the last time until 1992 that the Democratic nominee won Connecticut, Maine, and Michigan and the last until 1988 when Washington voted Democrat, and the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was also the first time since 1888 that [[bellwether]] [[Co\u00f6s County, New Hampshire]] did not support the winning candidate,<ref>The Political Graveyard; [http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/NH/CO-votes.html Co\u00f6s County Votes for President]<br />David Leip's Atlas of US Presidential Elections; [http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=2016&fips=33&f=0&off=0&elect=0 Presidential Election, 2016 in New Hampshire]</ref> which has occurred again only in [[2004 United States presidential election|2004]]. \n\nThis was the first time since 1928 that North Carolina voted for a Republican, and the first since 1912 (only the second time since 1852 and as of 2012, the last time) that Maine and Vermont did not support same party.\nDespite the narrow (0.7%) difference in the popular vote, Humphrey took only 35.5% of the electoral vote. This disparity prompted the introduction of the [[Electoral College (United States)#Bayh\u2013Celler Constitutional amendment|Bayh\u2013Celler Constitutional amendment]] in Congress, which would have replaced the Electoral College with a direct election of the presidency.

The initial gap between championships was variable, but since [[1970 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|1970]] they have been awarded every four years. The current champions are the [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]], which won their first title at the [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|2018 tournament]] in Japan.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Championship Finals''. 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 18 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams. [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] have won seven times (five as [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]). The other World Championship winners are [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], with three titles each; [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], with two titles; and [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]], [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] and [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]], with one title each.\n\nThe [[2014 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|2014 World Championship]] took place in Italy. The 2018 World Championship was hosted again by Japan in [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|2018]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|Men's World Championship]] was played in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\n\nThree years later, a women's version was introduced; the events were synchronized and expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from [[South America|South]], [[Central America|Central]] and North America.\n\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the [[Summer Olympics]]. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the second most important, surpassed in prestige only by the [[Olympic Games]].\n\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\n\n===Winners===\nIf the titles of the Women's World Championship are evenly distributed between Europe and Asia, the situation is quite different when nations are taken into account. Except for [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]]'s single&mdash;and for many, unexpected&mdash;victory in 2002 and [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] victory in 2014, the only winners so far have been the [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] (5 times as [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] and [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]].\n\nThe Soviets made a most impressive start by winning the first three editions of the tournament: 1952, 1956, 1960. They were halfway to making it four, since the following edition was to be played in Moscow. Former runners-up [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]], nevertheless, was the champions in 1962 and interrupted the winning streak, repeating the performance in 1967, when the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] national team did not participate.\n\nThe teams faced each other again in 1970, and this time the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] beat their opponents to collect the gold. In the following edition, [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] took revenge and defeated the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] in straight sets. Then something extraordinary happened: the world watched astonished as a young [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuban]] squad left behind the two longtime rivals and secured the first important volleyball title for a continent other than Europe or Asia.\n\nThe early 1980s saw the rise of a new Asian force: led by superstar [[Lang Ping]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] stamped their mark on the World Championship's history by winning two editions in a row (1982 and 1986). They also made it to the finals in 1990, but were overpowered by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] in their last participation at the competition.\n\n[[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]]'s 1978 title finally fructified in an aggressive style of play that virtually dominated the 1990s. Led by powerplayers [[Regla Torres]], [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Bell]], the Caribbeans won the 1994 and 1998 editions of the World Championship, beating newbies as well as tradition rivals such as [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] and [[China women's national volleyball team|China]].\n\nIn spite of being appointed as favourites in 2002, [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] lost at the semifinals to a rising [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]], which would eventually win the final against [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]]\n\nIn 2006, favourites [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] couldn't stop [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] and lost the gold medal match in a shocking final tie-breaker.\n\nIn 2010, [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] once again defeated [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a 5th-set tie-breaker.\n\nIn 2014, the [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] made it to the finals after an astonishing straight-set win against the 2012 Olympic champion and 2006 and 2010 runner-up [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]]. [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], on the other hand, reached the championship after winning over hosts [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]] in a four-set fashion. The finals saw two former World champions \u2013 [[Lang Ping]] and [[Karch Kiraly]] \u2013 at the helm of the champion squads. United States' momentum carried them to a 3\u20131 victory over the young Chinese squad, earning the first ever World title for the USA women's team after finishing as bridesmaids in several editions of the World Championship, World Cup and the Olympic Games.\n\n==Competition formula==\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship qualification}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Confederation\n!Slots\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[African Volleyball Confederation|CAVB]] (Africa)||2\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Asian Volleyball Confederation|AVC]] (Asia and Oceania)||4\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[European Volleyball Confederation|CEV]] (Europe)||8\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North, Central America and Caribbean Volleyball Confederation|NORCECA]] (North America)||6\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de Voleibol|CSV]] (South America)||2\n|-\n! Total || 24 (22+H+C)\n|}\n\n===Final tournament===\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition. The following rules usually apply:\n\n* Twenty-four teams participate in each event. \n* Qualification procedures for the World Championship are long and strenuous, lasting over two years. \n* Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n* The number of spots available per confederation is determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]: Europe has usually the highest, and Africa or South America the lowest.\n* To participate in the event, a team must survive a number of qualification tournaments depending on its position in the [[FIVB World Rankings]]. Low-ranked teams may have to engage in up to three tournaments to be granted a berth; high-ranked teams typically play only one.\n* The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round and a final round. Depending on the number of participating teams, one or more intermediary rounds may also be required.\n* In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. \n* When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the following round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition.  The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n* The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] has tried various different formats for the final round(s). For some years now (2004), there seems to be a  consensus that at least semifinals and finals must be played according to the Olympic format. \n* Quarterfinals may consist of groups of teams playing against each other, or of direct confrontation; in the latter case additional intermediary rounds might be required to reduce the number of surviving teams to eight.\n* The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{{See also|National team appearances in the FIVB

The initial gap between championships was variable, but since [[1970 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|1970]] they have been awarded every four years. The current champions are the [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]], which won their first title at the [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|2018 tournament]] in Japan.\n\nThe current format of the competition involves a qualification phase, which currently takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase, which is often called the ''World Championship Finals''. 24 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete in the tournament phase for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about a month.\n\nThe 18 World Championship tournaments have been won by seven different national teams. [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] have won seven times (five as [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]). The other World Championship winners are [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] and [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]], with three titles each; [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], with two titles; and [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]], [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] and [[Serbia women's national volleyball team|Serbia]], with one title each.\n\nThe [[2014 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|2014 World Championship]] took place in Italy. The 2018 World Championship was hosted again by Japan in [[2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|2018]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe history of the World Championship goes back to the beginnings of volleyball as a professional, high level sport. One of the first concrete measures taken by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] after its foundation in 1947 was the establishment of an international competition involving teams from more than one continent. In 1949, the first edition of the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship|Men's World Championship]] was played in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. At that point, the tournament was still restricted to Europe.\n\nThree years later, a women's version was introduced; the events were synchronized and expanded to include nations from Asia, and began to be held in 4-year cycles. By the following edition, there were also teams from [[South America|South]], [[Central America|Central]] and North America.\n\nSince volleyball was to be added to the Olympic Program in 1964, the 4-cycles were advanced in 2 years after the fourth edition (1960), so that the World Championship may alternate with the [[Summer Olympics]]. As of 1970, teams from Africa also took part in the competition, and the original goal of having members from all five continental confederations in the games was achieved.\n\nThe number of teams involved in the games has changed significantly over the years. Following volleyball's increase in popularity, they raised steadily to over 20 in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, were then cut short to 16 in the 1990s, and finally set up in 24 after 2002. Today, the World Championship is the most comprehensive of all events organized by the FIVB, and arguably the second most important, surpassed in prestige only by the [[Olympic Games]].\n\nUntil 1974, the host nation of the tournament organized both the men's and the women's events, with the single exception of the 1966/1967 games, which took place in different years. Since 1978, this practice has been only occasionally observed, for instance, in 1998 and in the 2006 edition, which was held, as the former was, in Japan.\n\n===Winners===\nIf the titles of the Women's World Championship are evenly distributed between Europe and Asia, the situation is quite different when nations are taken into account. Except for [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]]'s single&mdash;and for many, unexpected&mdash;victory in 2002 and [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] victory in 2014, the only winners so far have been the [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] (5 times as [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]]), [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] and [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]].\n\nThe Soviets made a most impressive start by winning the first three editions of the tournament: 1952, 1956, 1960. They were halfway to making it four, since the following edition was to be played in Moscow. Former runners-up [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]], nevertheless, was the champions in 1962 and interrupted the winning streak, repeating the performance in 1967, when the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] national team did not participate.\n\nThe teams faced each other again in 1970, and this time the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] beat their opponents to collect the gold. In the following edition, [[Japan women's national volleyball team|Japan]] took revenge and defeated the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] in straight sets. Then something extraordinary happened: the world watched astonished as a young [[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuban]] squad left behind the two longtime rivals and secured the first important volleyball title for a continent other than Europe or Asia.\n\nThe early 1980s saw the rise of a new Asian force: led by superstar [[Lang Ping]], [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] stamped their mark on the World Championship's history by winning two editions in a row (1982 and 1986). They also made it to the finals in 1990, but were overpowered by the [[Soviet Union women's national volleyball team|Soviet Union]] in their last participation at the competition.\n\n[[Cuba women's national volleyball team|Cuba]]'s 1978 title finally fructified in an aggressive style of play that virtually dominated the 1990s. Led by powerplayers [[Regla Torres]], [[Mireya Luis]] and [[Regla Bell]], the Caribbeans won the 1994 and 1998 editions of the World Championship, beating newbies as well as tradition rivals such as [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] and [[China women's national volleyball team|China]].\n\nIn spite of being appointed as favourites in 2002, [[China women's national volleyball team|China]] lost at the semifinals to a rising [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]], which would eventually win the final against [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]]\n\nIn 2006, favourites [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] couldn't stop [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] and lost the gold medal match in a shocking final tie-breaker.\n\nIn 2010, [[Russia women's national volleyball team|Russia]] once again defeated [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]] in a 5th-set tie-breaker.\n\nIn 2014, the [[United States women's national volleyball team|United States]] made it to the finals after an astonishing straight-set win against the 2012 Olympic champion and 2006 and 2010 runner-up [[Brazil women's national volleyball team|Brazil]]. [[China women's national volleyball team|China]], on the other hand, reached the championship after winning over hosts [[Italy women's national volleyball team|Italy]] in a four-set fashion. The finals saw two former World champions \u2013 [[Lang Ping]] and [[Karch Kiraly]] \u2013 at the helm of the champion squads. United States' momentum carried them to a 3\u20131 victory over the young Chinese squad, earning the first ever World title for the USA women's team after finishing as bridesmaids in several editions of the World Championship, World Cup and the Olympic Games.\n\n==Competition formula==\n===Qualification===\n{{Main|FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship qualification}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Confederation\n!Slots\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[African Volleyball Confederation|CAVB]] (Africa)||2\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Asian Volleyball Confederation|AVC]] (Asia and Oceania)||4\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[European Volleyball Confederation|CEV]] (Europe)||8\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North, Central America and Caribbean Volleyball Confederation|NORCECA]] (North America)||6\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de Voleibol|CSV]] (South America)||2\n|-\n! Total || 24 (22+H+C)\n|}\n\n===Final tournament===\nThe competition formula of the FIVB World Championship has been constantly changed to fit the different number of teams that participate in each edition. The following rules usually apply:\n\n* Twenty-four teams participate in each event. \n* Qualification procedures for the World Championship are long and strenuous, lasting over two years. \n* Host nations are always pre-qualified.\n* The number of spots available per confederation is determined by the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]]: Europe has usually the highest, and Africa or South America the lowest.\n* To participate in the event, a team must survive a number of qualification tournaments depending on its position in the [[FIVB World Rankings]]. Low-ranked teams may have to engage in up to three tournaments to be granted a berth; high-ranked teams typically play only one.\n* The competition is divided in at least two phases: a preliminary round and a final round. Depending on the number of participating teams, one or more intermediary rounds may also be required.\n* In the preliminary round, teams are organized in pools. Each team plays one match against all other teams in its pool. \n* When all the matches of the preliminary round have been played, the top ''n'' teams in each pool qualify for the following round(s), and the remaining ones leave the competition.  The value of ''n'' depends on the number of participating teams and the format that will be employed in the finals.\n* The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Volleyball|FIVB]] has tried various different formats for the final round(s). For some years now (2004), there seems to be a  consensus that at least semifinals and finals must be played according to the Olympic format. \n* Quarterfinals may consist of groups of teams playing against each other, or of direct confrontation; in the latter case additional intermediary rounds might be required to reduce the number of surviving teams to eight.\n* The tournament implements very tight line-up restrictions: only twelve players are allowed, and no replacement is permitted, even in case of injuries.\n\n==Results summary==\n{{See also|National team appearances in the FIVB

Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all [[Corvidae|corvids]]. There are at least eight [[subspecies]] with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the [[thick-billed raven]], and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=off}} in length a typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild,<ref name=euroring/> which among passerines only is surpassed by a few Australian species such as the [[satin bowerbird]]<ref>[[Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme]] ''[http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/biodiversity/abbbs/abbbs-search.pl?taxon_id=378 Satin Bowerbird]''</ref> and probably the [[lyrebird]]s. Young birds may travel in flocks but later [[mate for life]], with each [[mated pair]] defending a [[territory (animal)|territory]].\n\nCommon ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as [[pest (organism)|pests]]. Part of their success as a species is due to their [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet; they are extremely versatile and [[Opportunism#Biological opportunism|opportunistic]] in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on [[carrion]], insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, nesting birds, and food waste.\n\nSome notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually [[intelligence|intelligent]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.abc.es/ciencia/abci-cuervos-pueden-inteligentes-como-nino-tres-anos-201604262232_noticia.html | title=Los cuervos pueden ser tan inteligentes como un ni\u00f1o de tres a\u00f1os| date=2016-04-26}}</ref> Over the centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, [[Cultural depictions of ravens|art, and literature]].

Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk.<ref name=hbk/> The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the [[Chihuahuan raven]] (''C. cryptoleucus'') is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail.

Predators of its eggs include [[owl]]s, [[marten]]s, and sometimes [[eagle]]s. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by large birds of prey. Their attackers in America have reportedly included [[great horned owl]]s, [[northern goshawk]]s, [[bald eagle]]s, [[golden eagle]]s and [[red-tailed hawk]]s. It is possible that the two hawk species only attack young ravens, as had a [[peregrine falcon]] who in one instance swooped at a newly fledged raven but was successfully chased off by the parent ravens.<ref>{{cite thesis|author=Boal, C.

Young, unmated common ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other [[vertebrate]] to share this with humans.<ref>Bickerton, Derek (2009).

To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and \"the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable [[trial-and-error]] learning.\" This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are 'inventors', implying that they can solve problems.

There are at least eight [[subspecies]] with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the [[thick-billed raven]], and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|1.2|kg|lb|abbr=off}} in mass. Although their typical lifespan is considerably shorter, common ravens can live more than 23 years in the wild,<ref name=euroring/> which among passerines only is surpassed by a few Australian species such as the [[satin bowerbird]]<ref>[[Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme]] ''[http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/biodiversity/abbbs/abbbs-search.pl?taxon_id=378 Satin Bowerbird]''</ref> and probably the [[lyrebird]]s. Young birds may travel in flocks but later [[mate for life]], with each [[mated pair]] defending a [[territory (animal)|territory]].\n\nCommon ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as [[pest (organism)|pests]]. Part of their success as a species is due to their [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet; they are extremely versatile and [[Opportunism#Biological opportunism|opportunistic]] in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on [[carrion]], insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, nesting birds, and food waste.\n\nSome notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually [[intelligence|intelligent]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.abc.es/ciencia/abci-cuervos-pueden-inteligentes-como-nino-tres-anos-201604262232_noticia.html | title=Los cuervos pueden ser tan inteligentes como un ni\u00f1o de tres a\u00f1os| date=2016-04-26}}</ref> Over the centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, [[Cultural depictions of ravens|art, and literature]].

Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk.<ref name=hbk/> The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the [[Chihuahuan raven]] (''C. cryptoleucus'') is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black [[carrion crow]] (''C. corone'') in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.<ref>Boarman, William I. and Heinrich, Bernd  (1999) [http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/476/articles/introduction ''Common Raven (Corvus corax)''], The Birds of North America Online (A.

Predators of its eggs include [[owl]]s, [[marten]]s, and sometimes [[eagle]]s. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by large birds of prey. Their attackers in America have reportedly included [[great horned owl]]s, [[northern goshawk]]s, [[bald eagle]]s, [[golden eagle]]s and [[red-tailed hawk]]s. It is possible that the two hawk species only attack young ravens, as had a [[peregrine falcon]] who in one instance swooped at a newly fledged raven but was successfully chased off by the parent ravens.<ref>{{cite thesis|author=Boal, C.
