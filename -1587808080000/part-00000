If the response is not satisfactory, the employer will move to the more formal domestic inquiry. Domestic inquiry should be carried out as soon as possible following accusations of misconduct and all activities should be formalized and recorded in full. Legally it is important than the investigation be carried out objectively \u2013 the investigating officers, for example, should be unconnected to the incident, and the employee should be given full opportunity to state their own case and present evidence in their favor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pesaraonline.net/domestic-inquiry.htm|title=Domestic Inquiry|website=pesaraonline.net|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> Union representatives or colleagues should be allowed to sit in during the process if the employer requests their presence, although the employee can't insist on legal representation.

Minor misconduct is seen as unacceptable but is not a criminal offense (e.g. being late, faking qualifications).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dishonesty in Medical Research |publisher=Medico-legalsociety.org.uk |accessdate=1 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 }}</ref> Gross misconduct can lead to dismissal (e.g. stealing or sexual harassment).\n\n* \"Misconduct\" includes something seen as unacceptable as well as criminal offenses e.g. deceptive manipulation.\n* \"Gross misconduct\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Gross Misconduct|work=Access Solicitor|url=http://www.accesssolicitor.com/glossary/employment-law/disciplinary-and-procedures/gross-misconduct/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218073045/http://www.accesssolicitor.com/glossary/employment-law/disciplinary-and-procedures/gross-misconduct/|archivedate=February 18, 2013}}</ref> can lead to immediate dismissal because it is serious enough and possibly criminal, e.g. [[stealing]] or [[sexual harassment]].\n\nMisconduct refers to an action, rather than neglecting to take action, or inaction which could be referred to as poor performance.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n==Examples of gross misconduct==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe following may be classified as gross misconduct:\n* Being drunk or under the influence of any drug while on duty\n* Bribery\n* Conviction of a felony (in some jurisdictions)\n* Falsification of accounts\n* Falsifying time records\n* Financial misconduct\n* Fighting\n* Gross insubordination/disobedience/misappropriation\n* Illegal drug or alcohol use at work\n* Illicit use{{clarifyme|date=January 2020}}\n* Negligence\n* Sexual harassment in the workplace\n* Stealing\n* Subjecting people to discrimination\n\n== Organizational ==\nOrganization and management scholars have paid much attention to the causes, forms, modes of development, and consequences of misconduct within or among organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Greve|first=Henrich R.|last2=Palmer|first2=Donald|last3=Pozner|first3=Jo\u2010Ellen|date=2010|title=Organizations Gone Wild: The Causes, Processes, and Consequences of Organizational Misconduct|url=http://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/19416521003654186|journal=Academy of Management Annals|language=en|volume=4|issue=1|pages=53\u2013107|doi=10.5465/19416521003654186|issn=1941-6520|via=}}</ref> They have studied different types of misconduct, such as white-collar crimes, insider trading, or deceptive accounting<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Jared|last2=Bromiley|first2=Philip|date=2007|title=Incentives to Cheat: The Influence of Executive Compensation and Firm Performance on Financial Misrepresentation|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/25146106|journal=Organization Science|volume=18|issue=3|pages=350\u2013367|issn=1047-7039}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zahra|first=Shaker A.|last2=Priem|first2=Richard L.|last3=Rasheed|first3=Abdul A.|date=2005|title=The Antecedents and Consequences of Top Management Fraud|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1177/0149206305279598|journal=Journal of Management|language=en-US|volume=31|issue=6|pages=803\u2013828|doi=10.1177/0149206305279598|issn=0149-2063|via=}}</ref> and, more recently, considered the development of misconduct activities between different firms, such as cartels where firms reduce competition by agreeing on production or pricing.

The difference between bad business decisions and [[business]] misconduct can be hard to determine, and there is a thin line between the ethics of using only financial incentives to gauge performance and the use of holistic measures that include ethics, transparency and responsibility of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s. From CEO's to traders and brokers, all-too-tempting lucrative financial incentives existed for performance in the financial industry.<br />\nThe past widespread financial misconduct led to a call for financial reform. The [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]  was passed in 2010 to increase accountability and transparency in the financial industry and protect consumers from deceptive financial practices.<ref>Ferrell, Fraedrich: ''Business Ethics'', ''eleventh edition'' Ethical Decision Making and Case, Sexual Harassment in Workplace. February 17, 2017. p. 80</ref> [[Domestic inquiry]]  A domestic inquiry typically follows a \u2018show cause\u2019 letter, which is sent to the employee requesting an explanation for the alleged misconduct. If the response is not satisfactory, the employer will move to the more formal domestic inquiry. Domestic inquiry should be carried out as soon as possible following accusations of misconduct and all activities should be formalized and recorded in full. Legally it is important than the investigation be carried out objectively \u2013 the investigating officers, for example, should be unconnected to the incident, and the employee should be given full opportunity to state their own case and present evidence in their favor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pesaraonline.net/domestic-inquiry.htm|title=Domestic Inquiry|website=pesaraonline.net|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> Union representatives or colleagues should be allowed to sit in during the process if the employer requests their presence, although the employee can't insist on legal representation. An employer may, on the grounds of misconduct inconsistent with the fulfillment of the express or implied conditions of his services, after due inquiry:\n# dismiss without notice the employee\n# downgrade the employee\n# impose any other lesser punishment as he deems just and fit, and where a punishment of suspension without wages is imposed, it shall not exceed a period of two weeks.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* {{cite book |last = Ghaiye |first = B.

Knowle lies within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Warwickshire]], and since 1974 it has been part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull]] within the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]. It lies a few miles from the modern Warwickshire border and has a population of around 11,000 residents.\n\nKnowle is in the [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] of [[Meriden (UK Parliament constituency)|Meriden]].\n\n==Present day==\nKnowle still retains a considerable village charm, despite being on the outer edge of the [[West Midlands conurbation]]. It is contiguous to the south with the similar-sized communities of [[Dorridge]] and [[Bentley Heath]], both of which are mainly residential in nature. The district of Copt Heath is a suburb of Knowle to the north. The village is generally considered to be amongst the most prosperous areas in the English Midlands.\n\n===Shops and businesses===\nKnowle has many shops. Most of these are located on the High Street, though there are a number of side roads and a shopping precinct. Knowle Library is maintained by Solihull Council in a building called Chester House dating back to Tudor times. At the rear of the building a [[Knot garden]] has been restored. The small shopping area also has restaurants of all varieties, making Knowle a popular destination for dining out. In 2011 a [[Costa Coffee]] opened on the High Street. Tesco retains a medium-sized 'Metro' store in St. John's shopping precinct.\n\n===Recreation===\nKnowle is near to the [[Grand Union Canal]] which links Birmingham to London. Knowle Locks are a flight of five locks (originally six until around 1930) near the canal bridge on Kenilworth Road. Recreation areas include Knowle Park, which has a children's play area, tennis courts, football field and plenty of open space. There is also another children's playing field owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] near Knowle Primary School, and in the smaller village of Bentley Heath, there is a newly refurbished park, near the highly rated school, of the same name. There is also [[Knowle F.C.]], [[Knowle Village Cricket Club]] who play in Division 2 of the [[Warwickshire Cricket League]], after 3 promotions in three years, and the exclusive Copt Heath Golf Club. The Silhillians Sports Club is nearby, the home venue of [[Silhillians Rugby Union Football Club]] which is the home of Warwickshire Hockey as well as Old Silhillians Hockey Club.\n\nThere are also many clubs in the village for all ages. There are various [[The Scout Association|Scout]] and [[Girlguiding UK|Guide]] groups including a karate class and church groups. The Knowle Society exists to help maintain the village and its heritage. Knowle Local History Society also holds a wealth of historical information about the village and its people from very early times. Knowle also has drama groups and a Village Hall and Knowle and Dorridge Round Table meet locally.\n\n===Housing and schools=== \nKnowle has two schools, a [[Church of England]] primary school with a nursery and a secondary school, [[Arden School]], which also caters for [[Dorridge]] and [[Bentley Heath]]. In September 2006, a [[sixth form centre]] commenced with over 50 students. The project cost approximately \u00a34 million and has attracted students from many of the surrounding schools. A new design and technology block called \u2018The Smart Centre\u2019 has also been recently completed with another similar building which has also recently been completed. They are considered to be well performing schools, even considering the advantaged catchment area.\n[[File:Knowle Church.jpg|thumb|right|[[Knowle Parish Church|Church of St. John the Baptist, St. Lawrence and St. Anne]]]]\nThe main church is a [[Church of England]] Parish Church and there is a [[United Reformed Church]] on Station Road. The Parish Church offers many services using modern equipment, the old Guild house and much newer St. John's Hall.\n\nThe housing in Knowle is mainly detached or semi-detached with the occasional terraced street and some apartment blocks. More recently, developers have bought up housing for demolition and are building \"windfall developments\" of apartments on its outskirts. House prices are considerably higher than the national average due to the demand for housing in the highly affluent southeastern fringes of the West Midlands conurbation and high achieving schools.\n\n==Community Groups==\nThe village has strong local community organisations, including the Knowle Society, a Neighbourhood Forum, Round Table, Lions, and several Scout groups.\n\n===Neighbourhood Forum===\nKnowle, Dorridge and Bentley Heath Neighbourhood Forum was formed in 2015 with the purpose of bringing together the people from the three adjoining villages to define how they would like to see the villages develop in the future.  The Forum will collate the policies developed into a draft Neighbourhood Plan for the three villages during 2017, and subsequently arrange for a local referendum to create the Neighbourhood Plan as a statutory planning document for the area.  The Forum is run entirely by volunteers, and by Spring 2017 had a membership of over 800.\n\n==Transport==\nThe village lies on the [[A4141 road]] and is close to the [[M42 motorway]]. Knowle does not have its own railway station, but nearby [[Dorridge railway station]], on the [[Chiltern Main Line]], was previously known as ''Knowle and Dorridge'' and for a period just as' 'Knowle' '. Another station lies a few miles north at [[Hampton-in-Arden railway station|Hampton-in-Arden]] on the Coventry-Birmingham ([[West Coast Main Line|West Coast]]) line and [[Birmingham International railway station]] is nearby for express services to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]]. Knowle is also close to [[Birmingham Airport]] and is linked to [[Solihull]] by bus service S3. Junction 5 of the [[M42 motorway]] runs a little over a mile from the western edge of the village.\n\nThe [[Grand Union Canal]] Birmingham Main Line lies to the east of Knowle, between [[Birmingham]] to the north and [[Leamington Spa]] to the south and east.\n\n==Nearby places of interest==\nSurrounding villages include Bentley Heath, [[Dorridge]], [[Hampton-in-Arden]], [[Balsall Common]], [[Hockley Heath]] and [[Henley-in-Arden]]. To the northwest is [[Solihull]] and [[Birmingham]], to the east [[Coventry]], and to the south [[Warwick]], [[Leamington Spa]] and, further afield, [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2011}}\n\n*[[Jasper Carrott]], comedian\n*[[Karren Brady]], businesswoman\n*[[John Wyndham]], Science fiction writer<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/aug/26/sciencefictionspecial.sciencefictionfantasyandhorror The war of the words | Science | The Guardian]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.knowlefunrun.org.uk Knowle Fun Run] organised by\n*[http://www.knowleanddorridgelions.com Knowle and Dorridge Lions]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190121163611/http://www.knowleseascouts.org.uk/ Knowle Sea Scout Group]\n*[http://www.yokbc.co.uk Ye Olde Knowle Bowling Club]\n*[http://www.knowleparishchurch.org.uk/ Knowle Parish Church website]\n*[http://www.knowlehistory.org.uk/ Knowle Local History Society website]\n*[http://www.kandd.org.uk/ Knowle and Dorridge Round Table]\n*[http://www.1stknowlescouts.com/ 1st Knowle Scout Group]\n*[http://www.knowlevillage.play-cricket.com Knowle Village Cricket Club]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in the West Midlands (county)]]\n[[Category:Solihull]]\n[[Category:Conservation areas in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=February 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n|country =                England\n|official_name=           Knowle\n|coordinates = {{coord|52.388093|-1.73181|display=inline,title}}\n|civil_parish=\n| population =10,678\n| population_ref = ([[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001]].Ward)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13689796&c=Knowle&d=14&e=62&g=6367047&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1450277481422&enc=1|title=Solihull Ward population 2011|accessdate=16 December 2015}}</ref>\n |metropolitan_borough=     [[Metropolitan Borough of Solihull|Solihull]]\n|region=                   West Midlands\n|metropolitan_county=      [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]]\n|constituency_westminster=[[Meriden (UK Parliament constituency)|Meriden]]\n|post_town= Solihull\n|postcode_district = B93\n|postcode_area= B\n|dial_code=01564\n|os_grid_reference=     SP182767\n|static_image_name= knowle highstreet.JPG\n|static_image_caption=  High Street in 2006\n}}\n'''Knowle''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|n|o\u028a|l}} is a large village situated 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) east-southeast of the town of [[Solihull]], West Midlands, England.

The Forum will collate the policies developed into a draft Neighbourhood Plan for the three villages during 2017, and subsequently arrange for a local referendum to create the Neighbourhood Plan as a statutory planning document for the area.  The Forum is run entirely by volunteers, and by Spring 2017 had a membership of over 800.\n\n==Transport==\nThe village lies on the [[A4141 road]] and is close to the [[M42 motorway]]. Knowle does not have its own railway station, but nearby [[Dorridge railway station]], on the [[Chiltern Main Line]], was previously known as ''Knowle and Dorridge'' and for a period just as' 'Knowle' '. Another station lies a few miles north at [[Hampton-in-Arden railway station|Hampton-in-Arden]] on the Coventry-Birmingham ([[West Coast Main Line|West Coast]]) line and [[Birmingham International railway station]] is nearby for express services to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]]. Knowle is also close to [[Birmingham Airport]] and is linked to [[Solihull]] by bus service S3. Junction 5 of the [[M42 motorway]] runs a little over a mile from the western edge of the village.\n\nThe [[Grand Union Canal]] Birmingham Main Line lies to the east of Knowle, between [[Birmingham]] to the north and [[Leamington Spa]] to the south and east.\n\n==Nearby places of interest==\nSurrounding villages include Bentley Heath, [[Dorridge]], [[Hampton-in-Arden]], [[Balsall Common]], [[Hockley Heath]] and [[Henley-in-Arden]]. To the northwest is [[Solihull]] and [[Birmingham]], to the east [[Coventry]], and to the south [[Warwick]], [[Leamington Spa]] and, further afield, [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2011}}\n\n*[[Jasper Carrott]], comedian\n*[[Karren Brady]], businesswoman\n*[[John Wyndham]], Science fiction writer<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/aug/26/sciencefictionspecial.sciencefictionfantasyandhorror The war of the words | Science | The Guardian]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.knowlefunrun.org.uk Knowle Fun Run] organised by\n*[http://www.knowleanddorridgelions.com Knowle and Dorridge Lions]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20190121163611/http://www.knowleseascouts.org.uk/ Knowle Sea Scout Group]\n*[http://www.yokbc.co.uk Ye Olde Knowle Bowling Club]\n*[http://www.knowleparishchurch.org.uk/ Knowle Parish Church website]\n*[http://www.knowlehistory.org.uk/ Knowle Local History Society website]\n*[http://www.kandd.org.uk/ Knowle and Dorridge Round Table]\n*[http://www.1stknowlescouts.com/ 1st Knowle Scout Group]\n*[http://www.knowlevillage.play-cricket.com Knowle Village Cricket Club]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in the West Midlands (county)]]\n[[Category:Solihull]]\n[[Category:Conservation areas in England]]\n", "name_user": "Yourgfmama1234r23321", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowle,_West_Midlands"}

On 1 September 1930, she joined the party as volunteer activist, although never characterized as politically active, and '''rather amazingly''' despite her  partly Jewish parental decent, and regardless her obvious liberal attitude towards others' religion and culture.  From the local branch, Magda moved to the party headquarters in Berlin and for a brief period became secretary to Hans Meinshausen, Goebbels' deputy, before being invited to take charge of Goebbels' own private papers.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=82}} She and Goebbels became romantically involved while on a short trip with friends to Weimar in February 1931.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}} A relationship began and by April they began making plans for their future together.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=153}} Goebbels wrote in his diary, \"We have made a solemn vow to each other: When we have conquered the [[Reich]], we will become man and wife.

In 1936, Goebbels met the [[Czech people|Czech]] actress [[L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1]] and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=317, 318}} Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about the situation on 15 August 1938.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=392}} Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=170}} Thereafter, Goebbels and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=392}} The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=392\u2013395}} Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October 1938.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=391, 395}}{{efn|In 1939 at the premiere of the film ''[[The Journey to Tilsit]]'', Magda ostentatiously left because the plot had an accidental resemblance to her situation and the affair between her husband and Baarov\u00e1. {{harv|Romani|1994|p=86}}}} Magda also had affairs, including a relationship with [[Kurt Ludecke]] in 1933{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=317}} and [[Karl Hanke]] in 1938.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=204}}\n\n==War years==\nAt the outbreak of war, Magda's son by her first marriage, Harald Quandt, became a [[Luftwaffe]] pilot and fought at the front, while, at home, she lived up to the image of a patriotic mother by training as a [[German Red Cross|Red Cross]] nurse and working with the electronics company [[Telefunken]], and travelled to work on a bus, like her colleagues.<ref name=\"arditti\" /> She was also involved with entertaining the wives of the foreign heads of state, supporting the troops and comforting war widows.\n\nBoth Goebbels and Magda derived personal benefits and social status from their close association with Hitler, and the couple remained loyal to Hitler and publicly supported him. Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, \"My God, what a lot of rubbish.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=219}} In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, \"He no longer listens to voices of reason. Those who tell him what he wants to hear are the only ones he believes.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=222}}  There is no evidence that Magda attempted to intervene to save her Jewish stepfather from the [[Holocaust]]. Though his fate has not been established, it is widely assumed that he perished in the camps. Asked about her husband's [[antisemitism]], she answered: \"The F\u00fchrer wants it thus, and Joseph must obey.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=127}}\n\nFelix Franks, a German Jew who later became a British soldier, claimed that his grandparents got an [[exit visa]] from Germany with the help of Magda Goebbels:{{quote|My father and step-mother were left behind in Germany but, two days before the War started, they were asked to come to Gestapo Headquarters and given an exit visa.

Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nMagda was among the last to see both Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] before they [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on the afternoon of 30 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=827\u2013828}} On the following day, 1&nbsp;May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist [[Helmut Kunz]] to inject [[Goebbels children|their six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]] (Hitler's personal doctor) who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} Author [[James P. O'Donnell]] concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself. He surmises that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001}}\n\nMagda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=242}} According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.\n{{quote|We have demanded monstrous things from the German people, treated other nations with pitiless cruelty.

I make myself responsible. I belonged. I believed in Hitler and for long enough in Joseph Goebbels...Suppose I remain alive, I should immediately be arrested and interrogated about Joseph. If I tell the truth I must reveal what sort of man he was\u2014must describe all that happened behind the scenes. Then any respectable person would turn from me in disgust. It would be equally impossible to do the opposite\u2014that is to defend what he has done, to justify him to his enemies, to speak up for him out of true conviction...That would go against my conscience. So you see, Ello, it would be quite impossible for me to go on living. We will take the children with us, they are too good, too lovely for the world which lies ahead. In the days to come Joseph will be regarded as one of the greatest criminals that Germany has ever produced. His children would hear that said daily, people would torment them, despise and humiliate them. They would have to bear the burden of his sins and vengeance would be wreaked on them... It has all happened before. You know how I told you at the time quite frankly what the F\u00fchrer said in the Caf\u00e9 Anast in Munich when he saw the little Jewish boy, you remember?

In the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' she confided to Hitler's secretary [[Traudl Junge]], that \"I would rather have my children die, than live in disgrace, jeered at. My children stand no chance in Germany after the war\".<ref>Junge, Traudl, ''Until the Final Hour''</ref>\n\nThe last survivor of Hitler's bunker, [[Rochus Misch]], gave this account of the events to the [[BBC]]:\n\n{{quote|Straight after Hitler's death, Mrs. Goebbels came down to the bunker with her children.

He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw\u00e4germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw\u00e4germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}}{{efn|[[Johannes Hentschel]] later told Misch a singular conflicting story that Goebbels killed himself in his room in the bunker, and Magda in the ''Vorbunker'', during the early hours of 2&nbsp;May. {{harv|Misch|2014|pp=182, 183}}}} The bodies were then doused with [[gasoline|petrol]], but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}}\n\nThe charred corpses were found on the afternoon of 2 May 1945 by Soviet troops.

Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001}}\n\nMagda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=242}} According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.\n{{quote|We have demanded monstrous things from the German people, treated other nations with pitiless cruelty.
