The team was one of two IPL franchises from the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], the other being [[Mumbai Indians]]. It was also one of the two new franchises added to the IPL for the [[2011 Indian Premier League|2011 season]], alongside the also-defunct [[Kochi Tuskers Kerala]]. The team was owned by Sahara Group Sports Limited, a group company of the Indian business conglomerate [[Sahara India Pariwar]].<ref name=\"sahara\">[http://www.punewarriorsindia.com/about-us.php Pune Warriors owner]</ref> The team's home ground was the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]]<ref name=\"stadium\"/><ref name=\"subrata\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ipl-6.com/2013/03/subrata-roy-sahara-stadium-ipl-2013.html| title=Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium IPL 6 2013 Matches Schedule | accessdate=13 April 2013 | publisher=ipl6.com}}</ref> located in Gahunje, Pune.<ref name=\"gahunje\">[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-07/pune/31304652_1_wheelers-service-road-gahunje Gahunje stadium]</ref>\n\nOn 21 May 2013, Pune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL over financial differences with the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India]] (BCCI) stemming from the valuation of the annual franchise fee it had to pay.<ref name=\"pullout\">[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/637032.html Pune Warriors pull out of IPL]</ref> Their last match, before pulling out, was on 19 May 2013 against [[Delhi Daredevils]].

Along with [[Kochi Tuskers Kerala]], the team joined the existing eight teams in the IPL for the 2011 season.\n\n===2011 season===\n{{Main|2011 Indian Premier League}}\nBeing a new team in the IPL with a fresh auction purse, the Warriors bid very aggressively in the 2011 IPL auction held on 9 January 2011. The Warriors signed a number of top international cricketers including [[Yuvraj Singh]], Robin Uthappa, [[Jesse Ryder]], [[Angelo Mathews]], [[Murali Kartik]], [[Ashish Nehra]], [[Graeme Smith]], [[Mitchell Marsh]], [[Callum Ferguson]], [[Alfonso Thomas]], [[Wayne Parnell]] and [[Jerome Taylor]].<ref name=\"auction\">[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/news/IPL-4-auction-Who-got-whom/articleshow/11141834.cms IPL Auction 2011]</ref> Also a number of uncapped Indian players who had played for various franchises before were roped in including Rahul Sharma, [[Abhishek Jhunjhunwala]], [[Mithun Manhas]], [[Mohnish Mishra]], [[Ganesh Gaikwad]], [[Manish Pandey]] and [[Kamran Khan (Indian cricketer)|Kamran Khan]].

Ganguly had been discarded by his former team [[Kolkata Knight Riders]] prior to the 2011 IPL auction and was not bought by any of the teams in the auction.<ref name=\"auction\"/>\n\nThe Warriors got off to a successful start in the 2011 Indian Premier League by defeating [[Kings XI Punjab]] and Kochi Tuskers Kerala at home. Following this successful start, however, the team's performance went downhill and they only won another 2 matches that season, which were against Kings XI Punjab and [[Deccan Chargers]], both away. Their final match of the season against Delhi Daredevils away was abandoned due to rain.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/cricket/report/ipl-2011-delhi-end-at-bottom-after-washed-out-tie/20110521.htm Delhi end at bottom after washed out tie]</ref> Pune finished 9th and second-last that season with 4 wins, 9 losses and 1 no-result in 14 matches.\n\n===First withdrawal from IPL and return===\nSahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL along with the sponsorship of the Indian cricket team just hours before the 2012 IPL auction was about to start, providing a major blow to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the IPL, which was already reeling after the disbanding of Kochi Tuskers Kerala in late 2011.<ref name=\"withdraw\">{{cite web|title=Sahara withdraws Indian cricket team sponsorship and Pune Warriors ownership|date=13 April 2013|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/top-stories/Sahara-withdraws-Indian-cricket-team-sponsorship-and-Pune-Warriors-ownership/articleshow/11751668.cms|publisher=TOI}}</ref> They also boycotted the auction held on 4 February 2012. The main reason for the withdrawal was due to a problem in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by the Pune team. Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj. Yuvraj was set to miss the whole [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]] as he was undergoing treatment for [[germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]].<ref name=\"withdraw\"/> On 6 February 2012, [[Subrata Roy]], the chairman of Sahara India Pariwar, said that Sourav Ganguly will take a call on reconciliation.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/sourav-ganguly-to-take-call-on-reconciliation-subroto-roy/|title=Sourav Ganguly to take call on reconciliation: Subroto Roy}}</ref> A week later, the BCCI announced that they have allowed Yuvraj Singh's replacement for Pune Warriors India for the 2012 season, though a deadlock still persisted between the two parties on long-term sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/bcci-sahara-feud-unresolved-board-refuses-to-make-any-exceptions/articleshow/11872185.cms |title=BCCI-Sahara feud unresolved, Board refuses to make any exceptions \u2013 Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2012, the BCCI and Sahara ended their differences and announced that Pune Warriors India will play in IPL 5.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pune Warriors India to play in IPL 5|date=4 February 2012|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/pune-warriors-india-to-play-in-ipl-5/}}</ref> The BCCI agreed to give Sahara a total purse of $3.4 million, $1.6 million from the money that they had for the auction and $1.8 million as compensation due to the absence of Yuvraj. It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]]. They also signed Indian players including [[Raiphi Gomez]], [[Ali Murtaza]], [[Ashok Dinda]], [[Anustup Majumdar]] and [[Mahesh Rawat]]. Due to Yuvraj's unavailability for the entire season, Ganguly was made the captain of the franchise.<ref name=\"dada\">{{cite web|title=Sourav Ganguly's days as Pune captain over, to serve as mentor only|date=13 April 2013|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-10/news/31655144_1_sourav-ganguly-pune-warriors-bat-or-ball|publisher=TOI}}</ref> He was also made part of the coaching staff as a mentor.<ref name=\"mentor\">[http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/48689/ Ganguly, Donald part of Pune coaching staff]</ref> Former South African fast bowler [[Allan Donald]] and former Indian batsman [[Praveen Amre]] were also roped in as bowling and batting coaches respectively, replacing Marsh who had resigned to become the Sri Lankan coach.<ref name=\"mentor\"/>\n\nThe team started off their IPL 2012 campaign with wins against Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab away and at home respectively. But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain. In the auction which was held on 3 February 2013, Clarke was bought back by the franchise for $400,000.<ref name=\"mc\">[http://zeenews.india.com/sports/cricket/indian-premier-league-2013/clarke-could-be-paid-more-to-lead-pune-warriors-in-ipl-report_758541.html Clarke could be paid more to lead Pune Warriors in IPL: Report]</ref> The team also bought international players like [[Ajantha Mendis]] and [[Kane Richardson]] and signed domestic players like [[Abhishek Nayar]], [[Tirumalasetti Suman]], [[Ishwar Pandey]], [[Parvez Rasool]] and [[Udit Birla]] for the 2013 season. The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL. In a statement from Sahara after pulling out Pune Warriors India from the IPL, it stated that Sahara had to pull out of IPL due to the BCCI's stubborn and disinterested attitude towards the reduction of the Pune team's franchise fee.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> It also stated that Sahara was \"disgusted\" by the unsporting and biased attitude of the BCCI towards it and the Pune franchise despite its supporting of Indian cricket for more than a decade,<ref name=\"pune out\">[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/637036.html Full text of Pune Warriors' statement]</ref> the decision to withdraw from the IPL was final and it will not return to the IPL even if the entire franchise fee is waived by the BCCI.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> However, it added that Sahara would remain the sponsor of the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] until December 2013, when its contract with the BCCI expires, following which it asked the BCCI to find a new sponsor for the team.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Speaking to the media on 24 May 2013, Subrata Roy said that the attitude of BCCI president and [[India Cements]] chairman [[N. Srinivasan]] towards Sahara and the Pune franchise was the main reason for the withdrawal of Sahara from IPL and Indian cricket and also added that Sahara would never be associated with Indian cricket as long as Srinivasan is at the helm of BCCI affairs.<ref>[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sack-n-srinivasan-or-wont-sponsor-team-india-subrata-roy/1120155 Sack N Srinivasan or won't sponsor Team India: Subrata Roy]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2013, the BCCI officially terminated its agreement with the team, bringing an end to the team's IPL sojourn.<ref name=\"goodbye pwi\"/>\n\n==Home ground==\n\n[[File:DY Patil Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[DY Patil Stadium]], the initial \"home\" ground of Pune Warriors India]]\n[[File:Sahara Stadium Pune 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]] at Gahunje, the home ground of Pune Warriors India from 2012\u20132013]]\nIn their inaugural season in 2011, the team played their home matches at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] at [[Navi Mumbai]], as their designated home venue, the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]], was still under construction. Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar. It is located at Gahunje, a village located about {{convert|23|km}} north-west of Pune on the [[Mumbai Pune Expressway]].<ref name=\"gahunje\"/> It has a seating capacity of 55,000 spectators.<ref name=\"stadium\">[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ipl/venues/Subrata-Roy-Sahara-Stadium-Pune/iplvenueshow.cms Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune]</ref>\n\nThe stadium became a source of contention between Sahara India Pariwar and the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association]] (MCA). In early 2013, Sahara moved court over the termination of the agreement between it and the MCA over the stadium by the latter. MCA had terminated the agreement on the ground due to Sahara defaulting over payments to the MCA and had renamed the stadium as the MCA Pune International Cricket Centre.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-08/top-stories/36216126_1_subrata-roy-sahara-stadium-mca-interim-relief Sahara moves court against MCA over stadium in Pune]</ref> Sahara decided to play all their home matches outside Pune till the issue was resolved.<ref name=\"stad\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thatscricket.com/news/2013/03/10/pune-warriors-play-home-games-at-mha-stadium-ipl-6-066409.html |title=Pune Warriors to play home games at MCA Stadium |publisher=That's Cricket |date=10 March 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> On 15 March 2013, the issue was finally resolved, with Sahara agreeing to pay all existing dues within three months.<ref name=\"resolve\">[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-03-16/news/37766988_1_subrata-roy-sahara-stadium-sahara-chairman-sahara-group Sahara-Maharashtra Cricket Association row settled]</ref> The stadium was renamed back to Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium and MCA also allowed Pune Warriors India to play all its home matches in the stadium.<ref name=\"stad\"/><ref name=\"resolve\"/>\n\n==Team identity==\n\n===Team name and logo===\n\nThe Pune franchise named the team Pune Warriors India in honour of the [[Maratha Empire]] which once ruled from the city.

The jersey also incorporated the attacking warrior logo in the top-left corner of the shirt. From the 2012 season onwards, the primary colour of the jersey was changed to [[Turquoise (color)#Turquoise Blue|turquoise blue]]. [[Adidas]] was the kit manufacturer for the first two seasons, but for the third season, T. K. Sportswear was the kit manufacturer.

The video of the song showed a warrior riding on a horse and inspiring the Pune residents to come to the stadium where they witnessed the team cricketers. Then the team cricketers as well as the residents performed the Sahara salute (putting the right hand over the heart and saying \"Jai Sahara\").\n\n===Indian cheerleaders===\nPune Warriors India was the only IPL franchise which used Indian [[cheerleading|cheerleaders]] unlike the other franchises which use foreign cheerleaders.

Sahara insisted that it had bid a huge amount for the Pune franchise under the notion that there would be 94 matches in the 2011 IPL season. As the BCCI later reduced the number of IPL matches to 74, Sahara demanded for a reduction in the amount of franchise fee to be paid by them to maintain viable IPL proposition.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Other reasons included disputes between Sahara and the BCCI regarding the IPL rules, such as player retention and the 4-foreign player rule and also the refusal on the part of the BCCI to allow Pune to add Yuvraj Singh's price to their auction purse so that they could buy another player as a replacement for Yuvraj. Yuvraj was set to miss the whole [[2012 Indian Premier League|2012 season]] as he was undergoing treatment for [[germ cell tumor|germ cell cancer]].<ref name=\"withdraw\"/> On 6 February 2012, [[Subrata Roy]], the chairman of Sahara India Pariwar, said that Sourav Ganguly will take a call on reconciliation.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/sourav-ganguly-to-take-call-on-reconciliation-subroto-roy/|title=Sourav Ganguly to take call on reconciliation: Subroto Roy}}</ref> A week later, the BCCI announced that they have allowed Yuvraj Singh's replacement for Pune Warriors India for the 2012 season, though a deadlock still persisted between the two parties on long-term sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/bcci-sahara-feud-unresolved-board-refuses-to-make-any-exceptions/articleshow/11872185.cms |title=BCCI-Sahara feud unresolved, Board refuses to make any exceptions \u2013 Economic Times |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 February 2012, the BCCI and Sahara ended their differences and announced that Pune Warriors India will play in IPL 5.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pune Warriors India to play in IPL 5|date=4 February 2012|url=http://www.ipl-schedule.net/pune-warriors-india-to-play-in-ipl-5/}}</ref> The BCCI agreed to give Sahara a total purse of $3.4 million, $1.6 million from the money that they had for the auction and $1.8 million as compensation due to the absence of Yuvraj. It was also decided that Pune could replace Yuvraj with one player, whose fees would be up to $1.8 million. IPL's trading window was extended up to 29 February 2012 to allow the team to purchase players. Pune was also allowed the compensation of playing 5 foreign players in the squad, subject to the consent of the other 8 franchises. The BCCI also allowed Sahara to have a strategic partner in the franchise. Pune's new stadium would be allowed to host one of the play-off matches, provided [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] gave consent, because according to a BCCI rule, the right to host the play-off matches is given to the finalist of the previous edition. (RCB were the runners-up in the previous tournament).<ref>{{cite news|title=Sahara stays sponsor, Pune will play IPL|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> BCCI agreed to negotiate with Sahara regarding the amount of franchise fee to be paid and also agreed to start arbitration proceedings for the same.<ref name=\"pune out\"/>\n\n===2012 season===\n[[File:PWI VS DD.jpg|thumb|right|Pune Warriors India in action against [[Delhi Daredevils]] at the [[Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium]]]]\n{{Main|2012 Indian Premier League}}\nThough Pune boycotted the IPL auction, they signed international cricketers outside the auction including [[Marlon Samuels]], [[Luke Wright]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]], [[Tamim Iqbal]], [[James Hopes]] and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]]. They also signed Indian players including [[Raiphi Gomez]], [[Ali Murtaza]], [[Ashok Dinda]], [[Anustup Majumdar]] and [[Mahesh Rawat]]. Due to Yuvraj's unavailability for the entire season, Ganguly was made the captain of the franchise.<ref name=\"dada\">{{cite web|title=Sourav Ganguly's days as Pune captain over, to serve as mentor only|date=13 April 2013|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-05-10/news/31655144_1_sourav-ganguly-pune-warriors-bat-or-ball|publisher=TOI}}</ref> He was also made part of the coaching staff as a mentor.<ref name=\"mentor\">[http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/48689/ Ganguly, Donald part of Pune coaching staff]</ref> Former South African fast bowler [[Allan Donald]] and former Indian batsman [[Praveen Amre]] were also roped in as bowling and batting coaches respectively, replacing Marsh who had resigned to become the Sri Lankan coach.<ref name=\"mentor\"/>\n\nThe team started off their IPL 2012 campaign with wins against Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab away and at home respectively. But just like in 2011, the team could not maintain the initial momentum and again won only two more matches that season, against defending champions [[Chennai Super Kings]] at home and Delhi Daredevils away. Midway through the season, Ganguly was sacked as captain and was dropped from the team due to lack of results, but was retained as mentor.<ref name=\"dada\"/> However, this decision was later reversed and he returned to the team as captain. For the home match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Ganguly rested himself, with Steve Smith taking up the captaincy, but still, the team lost by 35 runs. Pune finished last that season with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches.\n\n===2013 season===\n{{Main|2013 Indian Premier League}}\nFor the 2013 season, Pune Warriors India retained Steve Smith, Tamim Iqbal, Marlon Samuels and Luke Wright but released Clarke, James Hopes, Callum Ferguson, Alfonso Thomas, Murali Kartik and Jesse Ryder. Ganguly announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in October 2012,<ref name=\"bye dada\">[http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1757445/report-sourav-ganguly-quits-ipl-retires-from-all-forms-of-cricket Ganguly retires]</ref> leaving the franchise without a captain.

The franchise also swapped a player with the Delhi Daredevils, trading Nehra for [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] batsman [[Ross Taylor]].<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/604641.html Delhi swap Taylor for Pune's Nehra]</ref> Yuvraj also returned to the team following his recovery from cancer. Unfortunately for the franchise, Clarke, who was the frontrunner to lead the team, was ruled out of the entire season with a recurring back and hamstring injury, which was aggravated during the [[Australian cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|Australian tour of India]] held earlier.<ref>[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/205416-michael-clarke-out-for-10-weeks-pune-warriors-have-to-hunt-for-new-captain Michael Clarke ruled out of IPL 6, Pune Warriors have to hunt for new captain]</ref> On 28 March 2013, the franchise named Sri Lankan Test and ODI captain and all-rounder Angelo Mathews as the captain for the 2013 season<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2013/content/story/627151.html Angelo Mathews named Pune Warriors' captain]</ref> and also signed Australian batsman [[Aaron Finch]] as a replacement for Clarke.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ipl-pune/content/story/627230.html Finch to replace Clarke for Pune Warriors]</ref>\n\nThe team's performance in the 2013 season was pathetic and mirrored its performance in 2012 with 4 wins and 12 losses in 16 matches, finishing 8th and second-last in the league. The only matches the team won were against [[Rajasthan Royals]] (home), Chennai Super Kings (away), Kolkata Knight Riders (away) and Delhi Daredevils (home). The Warriors were thoroughly humiliated in their away match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, courtesy [[Chris Gayle]]'s 175 not out off only 66 balls and later became the first team in the 2013 season to be knocked out of contention for the playoffs after a loss to Chennai Super Kings at home. Like the previous seasons, the main cause for the team's poor performance was their constant squandering of winning chances and the lack of balance in the side, with more than 30 players being used during the season. The team was the only IPL franchise to use three captains that season. Mathews was sacked as captain following a poor start by the Warriors in the tournament and his own poor form and was replaced by Taylor for the away match against Chennai Super Kings. Following this match, Taylor was also sacked as captain due to his poor form, in spite of the team winning in Chennai, and was replaced by Finch, who captained the Warriors for the rest of the season.\n\n===Second and final withdrawal from IPL===\nOn 21 May 2013, just two days after finishing its league campaign, Sahara withdrew Pune Warriors India from the IPL for the second time in three years.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> The reason, according to BCCI, was the encashing of the team's bank guarantee after Sahara defaulted on paying the entire franchise fee.<ref name=\"pullout\"/> BCCI sources said that Sahara paid 20% of the franchise fee in January 2013 and had promised to pay the remaining amount by 19 May 2013 but they failed to do so.<ref name=\"pune gone\">[http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2013/news/208101-ipl-6-bcci-encashes-bank-guarantee-after-pune-warriors-fail-to-pay-franchisee-fee BCCI encashes bank guarantee after Pune Warriors fail to pay franchisee fee]</ref> But Sahara blamed BCCI for the decision to pull out the Pune franchise from the IPL. In a statement from Sahara after pulling out Pune Warriors India from the IPL, it stated that Sahara had to pull out of IPL due to the BCCI's stubborn and disinterested attitude towards the reduction of the Pune team's franchise fee.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> It also stated that Sahara was \"disgusted\" by the unsporting and biased attitude of the BCCI towards it and the Pune franchise despite its supporting of Indian cricket for more than a decade,<ref name=\"pune out\">[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/637036.html Full text of Pune Warriors' statement]</ref> the decision to withdraw from the IPL was final and it will not return to the IPL even if the entire franchise fee is waived by the BCCI.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> However, it added that Sahara would remain the sponsor of the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] until December 2013, when its contract with the BCCI expires, following which it asked the BCCI to find a new sponsor for the team.<ref name=\"pune out\"/> Speaking to the media on 24 May 2013, Subrata Roy said that the attitude of BCCI president and [[India Cements]] chairman [[N. Srinivasan]] towards Sahara and the Pune franchise was the main reason for the withdrawal of Sahara from IPL and Indian cricket and also added that Sahara would never be associated with Indian cricket as long as Srinivasan is at the helm of BCCI affairs.<ref>[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/sack-n-srinivasan-or-wont-sponsor-team-india-subrata-roy/1120155 Sack N Srinivasan or won't sponsor Team India: Subrata Roy]</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2013, the BCCI officially terminated its agreement with the team, bringing an end to the team's IPL sojourn.<ref name=\"goodbye pwi\"/>\n\n==Home ground==\n\n[[File:DY Patil Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[DY Patil Stadium]], the initial \"home\" ground of Pune Warriors India]]\n[[File:Sahara Stadium Pune 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]] at Gahunje, the home ground of Pune Warriors India from 2012\u20132013]]\nIn their inaugural season in 2011, the team played their home matches at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] at [[Navi Mumbai]], as their designated home venue, the [[Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium]], was still under construction. Only from the 2012 season onwards did the team actually begin to play their home matches in Pune at the Subrata Roy Sahara Stadium, named after the Chairman of Sahara India Pariwar.

Fronted by singer-songwriter [[Jay Kay]], the band were a prominent component of the London-based funk/jazz movement of the 1990s.

They also drew from [[Rock music|rock]], [[electronica]] and [[Latin music]], and on stage perform with several musicians in the band playing live. Over the years, Kay has consistently remained as the leader through several line-up changes.\n\nThe band d\u00e9buted with \"[[When You Gonna Learn]]\" under [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz records]], which led to Kay signing a record deal with [[S2_Records|Sony Soho<sup>2</sup>]]. While under this label, the group released a string of million-selling albums containing singles that have reached various charts worldwide, including the 1998 single \"[[Deeper Underground]]\", which topped in the UK, while having moderate success in the US within the Dance charts. All eight of the band's albums have entered the UK top 10. Three of them, ''[[Emergency on Planet Earth]]'' (1993), ''[[Synkronized]]'' (1999), ''[[A Funk Odyssey]]'' (2001), along with [[High Times: Singles 1992\u20132006|their greatest hits compilation]], charted at number 1.\n\nJamiroquai have sold more than 26 million albums worldwide as of 2017. Their third album ''[[Travelling Without Moving]]'' (1996), received a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the best-selling funk album in history. The music video for the album's lead single, \"[[Virtual Insanity]]\", was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[1997 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The group has won an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]], as well as one [[Grammy Award]], two [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, and two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]]s.

The district is well known for its [[Pangkor Island]], a major attraction in Perak and the home of the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] (TLDM) Lumut Naval Base and dockyard. Since the population is increasing, residential and commercial infrastructure is being developed. Dinding was once part of the British [[Straits Settlements]] colony.\n\n[[Seri Manjung]] is the district's principal urban centre while smaller towns include [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] town, [[Sitiawan]] town, [[Ayer Tawar]], [[Pantai Remis]] and [[Beruas]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Pulo Pangkor, Malaya 1874 (7886261828).jpg|thumb|right|View of Dindings taken from a hill in Pulau Pangkor, 1874.]]\n[[File:British Malaya circa 1922.PNG|thumb|Malaya in 1922 with the Straits Settlements, including Dinding, in red]]\n{{see also|Straits Settlements}}\nPrior to 1973 the district was called '''Dindings'''. It used to be part of the Straits Settlements then under the administration of Penang. Dindings district became part of the [[Pangkor]] Engagement (also commonly known as the Pangkor Treaty), signed by Britain and the British appointed Sultan of Perak, Sultan Abdullah, in January 1874. This agreement was signed to stop bloodshed resulting from two major events, the struggle for the throne between relatives of Perak royalty upon the death of Sultan Ali and Chinese clan wars between Ghee Hin and Hai San to grab tin mining areas in Late Colonial [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]].\n\nThe agreement required the [[Sultan of Perak]] to surrender Dindings to the British, to accept a British Resident, Sir JWW Birch, and the appointment of Assistant Resident in Taiping, Captain [[Tristram Speedy]]. Sultan Ismail was to step down from the throne of Perak.\n\nDuring the British colonial era, Colonial Dindings comprised three main areas: [[Sitiawan]], [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] and [[Pangkor Island]].\n\nIn 1937, the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Iskandar Alang successfully appealed to the British for the return of Dindings to Perak. The Perak Government united the former colony with Bruas and coastal areas to the south, forming the Dindings district. In 1973, Dindings district was given the current name Manjung.\n\nOn 24 April 2009, Lumut was declared by the Sultan Perak as the Royal Malaysian Navy's Town \u2013 or simply called as TLDM Town or Navy Town. Manjung also was declared as \"Bandar Pelancongan Dan Maritim\" (Tourism and Maritime Town) by government of Perak.\n\nIn August 2016, Sembilan Island was separated from Manjung District and incorporated into [[Bagan Datuk District]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/edisi/perak/pulau-sembilan-kini-bawah-bagan-datoh-1.549401|title=Pulau Sembilan kini bawah Bagan Datoh|first=MOHAMAD HAFIZI MOHD|last=SAID|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Map of Manjung District, Perak.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Manjung District]]\nManjung District is divided into five [[mukim]]s:<ref name=\"perak.gov.my\">{{cite web|url=http://pdtmanjung.perak.gov.my/profil-organisasi/maklumat-daerah/profil-daerah|title=Portal Rasmi Pejabat Daerah Dan Tanah - Profil Daerah|website=pdtmanjung.perak.gov.my}}</ref>\n*[[Beruas]]\n*Lekir\n*[[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]]\n*Pengkalan Baharu\n*[[Sitiawan]]\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.{{my10|2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Ethnic groups in Manjung , 2015 census\n|-\n!

It is located approximately 90&nbsp;km southwest of Ipoh. The main tourist drawer to Pangkor Island are beaches on the western coastline, such as Pantai Puteri Dewi, Pasir Bogak Beach, Teluk Belanga, Teluk Segadas, Teluk Nipah, and Teluk Cempedak.\n\nThe main island of Pangkor is populated mainly by fisherfolk who occupy the eastern coastline. The island is famous for its [[anchovies]] and squid.\n\nThere are also ruins of a 330-year-old [[Netherlands|Dutch]] fort which was one of the Dutch strongholds against pirates and local Malays. Another historical interest on Pangkor Island is the Pangkor Stone Tablet (''Batu Bersurat Pangkor'' in Malay) which is near the Dutch fort.\n\n[[Pangkor Laut Island]], a small privately owned island to the southwest of the main island, is the second largest of the nine islands that make up the Pangkor archipelago. Pangkor Laut is known for its white beaches and crystal clear waters. It has three main beaches, Emerald Bay, Coral Beach and Royal Bay.\n\n=== Marina Island ===\n\nMarina Island<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marinaisland.com|title=Marina Island Pangkor - An Integrated Man-made World|website=Marina Island - Pangkor}}</ref> is one of the man-made island in Malaysia, built on the coast of Teluk Muruh, opposite [[Pangkor Island]] and Pangkor Laut Resort, in the state of [[Perak]], [[Malaysia]]. The island covers an area of 316.9 acres located 400 meters from the mainland's shoreline. Marina Island took five years of methodical planning and exhaustive feasibility studies to ensure that the making of the island would not disrupt the environment.\n\nMarina Island is also a gateway to Pangkor Island with the establishment of a domestic jetty terminal in the island. The journey to Pangkor Island takes only 10 minutes from the Marina Island Jetty.\n\n=== Beaches ===\n[[File:Teluk Senangin.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset view in Teluk Senangin]]\nAside from beaches on Pangkor Island, there are other beaches in Manjung that are popular among locals and tourists.

The district is well known for its [[Pangkor Island]], a major attraction in Perak and the home of the [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] (TLDM) Lumut Naval Base and dockyard. Since the population is increasing, residential and commercial infrastructure is being developed. Dinding was once part of the British [[Straits Settlements]] colony.\n\n[[Seri Manjung]] is the district's principal urban centre while smaller towns include [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] town, [[Sitiawan]] town, [[Ayer Tawar]], [[Pantai Remis]] and [[Beruas]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Pulo Pangkor, Malaya 1874 (7886261828).jpg|thumb|right|View of Dindings taken from a hill in Pulau Pangkor, 1874.]]\n[[File:British Malaya circa 1922.PNG|thumb|Malaya in 1922 with the Straits Settlements, including Dinding, in red]]\n{{see also|Straits Settlements}}\nPrior to 1973 the district was called '''Dindings'''. It used to be part of the Straits Settlements then under the administration of Penang. Dindings district became part of the [[Pangkor]] Engagement (also commonly known as the Pangkor Treaty), signed by Britain and the British appointed Sultan of Perak, Sultan Abdullah, in January 1874. This agreement was signed to stop bloodshed resulting from two major events, the struggle for the throne between relatives of Perak royalty upon the death of Sultan Ali and Chinese clan wars between Ghee Hin and Hai San to grab tin mining areas in Late Colonial [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]].\n\nThe agreement required the [[Sultan of Perak]] to surrender Dindings to the British, to accept a British Resident, Sir JWW Birch, and the appointment of Assistant Resident in Taiping, Captain [[Tristram Speedy]]. Sultan Ismail was to step down from the throne of Perak.\n\nDuring the British colonial era, Colonial Dindings comprised three main areas: [[Sitiawan]], [[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]] and [[Pangkor Island]].\n\nIn 1937, the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Iskandar Alang successfully appealed to the British for the return of Dindings to Perak. The Perak Government united the former colony with Bruas and coastal areas to the south, forming the Dindings district. In 1973, Dindings district was given the current name Manjung.\n\nOn 24 April 2009, Lumut was declared by the Sultan Perak as the Royal Malaysian Navy's Town \u2013 or simply called as TLDM Town or Navy Town. Manjung also was declared as \"Bandar Pelancongan Dan Maritim\" (Tourism and Maritime Town) by government of Perak.\n\nIn August 2016, Sembilan Island was separated from Manjung District and incorporated into [[Bagan Datuk District]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/edisi/perak/pulau-sembilan-kini-bawah-bagan-datoh-1.549401|title=Pulau Sembilan kini bawah Bagan Datoh|first=MOHAMAD HAFIZI MOHD|last=SAID|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:Map of Manjung District, Perak.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Manjung District]]\nManjung District is divided into five [[mukim]]s:<ref name=\"perak.gov.my\">{{cite web|url=http://pdtmanjung.perak.gov.my/profil-organisasi/maklumat-daerah/profil-daerah|title=Portal Rasmi Pejabat Daerah Dan Tanah - Profil Daerah|website=pdtmanjung.perak.gov.my}}</ref>\n*[[Beruas]]\n*Lekir\n*[[Lumut, Malaysia|Lumut]]\n*Pengkalan Baharu\n*[[Sitiawan]]\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.{{my10|2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Ethnic groups in Manjung , 2015 census\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "System F", "text_new": "{{short description|Typed lambda calculus}}\n{{For|the electronic trance music artist|Ferry Corsten}}\n'''System F''', also known as the ('''Girard\u2013Reynolds''') '''polymorphic lambda calculus''' or the '''second-order lambda calculus''', is a [[typed lambda calculus]] that differs from the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] by the introduction of a mechanism of [[universal quantification]] over types. System F thus formalizes the notion of [[parametric polymorphism]] in [[programming language]]s, and forms a theoretical basis for languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. System F was discovered independently by [[logician]] [[Jean-Yves Girard]] (1972) and [[computer scientist]] [[John C. Reynolds]] (1974).\n\nWhereas [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has variables ranging over terms, and binders for them, System F additionally has variables ranging over ''types'', and binders for them. As an example, the fact that the identity function can have any type of the form A\u2192 A would be formalized in System F as the judgment\n\n:<math>\\vdash \\Lambda\\alpha. \\lambda x^\\alpha.x: \\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is a '''[[type variable]]'''.  The upper-case <math>\\Lambda</math> is traditionally used to denote type-level functions, as opposed to the lower-case <math>\\lambda</math> which is used for value-level functions. (The superscripted <math>\\alpha</math> means that the bound ''x'' is of type <math>\\alpha</math>; the expression after the colon is the type of the lambda expression preceding it.)\n\nAs a [[term rewriting system]], System F is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. However, type inference in System F (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable. Under the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]], System F corresponds to the fragment of second-order [[intuitionistic logic]] that uses only universal quantification. System F can be seen as part of the [[lambda cube]], together with even more expressive typed lambda calculi, including those with [[dependent types]].\n\nAccording to Girard, the \"F\" in ''System F'' was picked by chance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Girard|first=Jean-Yves|title=The system F of variable types, fifteen years later|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=45|page=160|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90044-7|quote=However, in [3] it was shown that the obvious rules of conversion for this system, called F by chance, were converging.|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n== Typing rules ==\n\nThe typing rules of System F are those of simply typed lambda calculus with the addition of the following:\n\n{| align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"9\"\n| align=\"center\" | <math>{\\frac{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\mathbin{:}\\forall\\alpha.\\sigma}{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\tau\\mathbin{:}\\sigma[\\tau/\\alpha]} }</math> (1)\n| align=\"center\" | <math>{\\frac{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\mathbin{:}\\sigma}{\\Gamma\\vdash\\lambda\\alpha.M\\mathbin{:}\\forall\\alpha.\\sigma}}</math> (2)\n|}\n\nwhere <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> are types and <math>\\alpha</math> is a type variable. The first rule is that of application, and the second is that of abstraction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/Extra/lectnotes_vol1.pdf |title=Proofs of Programs and Formalisation of Mathematics |vauthors=Geuvers H, Nordstr\u00f6m B, Dowek G}}</ref>\n\n== Logic and predicates ==\nThe <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean}</math> type is defined as:\n<math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>, where <math>\\scriptstyle\\alpha</math> is a [[type variable]]. This means: <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean}</math> is the type of all functions which take as input a type &alpha; and two expressions of type &alpha;, and produce as output an expression of type &alpha; (note that we consider <math>\\to</math> to be [[right-associative]].)\n\nThe following two definitions for the boolean values <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{T}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{F}</math> are used, extending the definition of [[Church encoding#Church Booleans|Church booleans]]:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{T} = \\Lambda\\alpha{.}\\lambda x^{\\alpha} \\lambda y^\\alpha{.}x</math> <!-- These didn't render without the {}-wrapped around the . -->\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = \\Lambda\\alpha{.}\\lambda x^{\\alpha} \\lambda y^{\\alpha}{.}y</math>\n\n(Note that the above two functions require ''three'' &mdash; not two &mdash; arguments. The latter two should be lambda expressions, but the first one should be a type. This fact is reflected in the fact that the type of these expressions is <math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>; the universal quantifier binding the &alpha; corresponds to the &Lambda; binding the alpha in the lambda expression itself. Also, note that <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math> is a convenient shorthand for <math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>, but it is not a symbol of System F itself, but rather a \"meta-symbol\". Likewise, <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{T}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{F}</math> are also \"meta-symbols\", convenient shorthands, of System F \"assemblies\" (in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=IL-SI67hjI4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nicolas+Bourbaki&source=bl&ots=nbfmxi9gJK&sig=4nPo8EFXrQYwAC2y0pD0uGv-EGY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3sYBUOukIMLW2AX4t_inCw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Nicolas%20Bourbaki&f=false Bourbaki sense]); otherwise, if such functions could be named (within System F), then there would be no need for the lambda-expressive apparatus capable of defining functions anonymously and for the [[fixed-point combinator]], which works around that restriction.)\n\nThen, with these two <math>\\scriptstyle\\lambda</math>-terms, we can define some logic operators (which are of type <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Boolean} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Boolean}</math>):\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{AND} &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} \\lambda y^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x y\\, \\mathbf{F}\\\\\n\\mathrm{OR}  &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} \\lambda y^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \\mathbf{T}\\, y\\\\\n\\mathrm{NOT} &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{T} \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs in Church encodings, there is no need for an <tt>IFTHENELSE</tt> function as one can just use raw <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math>-typed terms as decision functions. However, if one is requested:\n: <math>\\mathrm{IFTHENELSE} = \\Lambda \\alpha.\\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}\\lambda y^{\\alpha}\\lambda z^{\\alpha}. x \\alpha y z </math>\nwill do.\nA ''predicate'' is a function which returns a <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math>-typed value. The most fundamental predicate is <tt>ISZERO</tt> which returns <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{T}</math> if and only if its argument is the [[Church encoding#Church numerals|Church numeral]]  <tt>0</tt>:\n: <math>\\mathrm{ISZERO} = \\lambda n^{\\forall \\alpha. (\\alpha \\rightarrow \\alpha) \\rightarrow \\alpha \\rightarrow \\alpha}{.}n^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} (\\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.}\\mathbf{F})\\, \\mathbf{T}</math>\n\n==System F structures==\n\nSystem F allows recursive constructions to be embedded in a natural manner, related to that in [[Martin-L\u00f6f's type theory]]. Abstract structures (S) are created using ''constructors''. These are functions typed as:\n:<math>K_1\\rightarrow K_2\\rightarrow\\dots\\rightarrow S</math>.\n\nRecursivity is manifested when <math>S</math> itself appears within one of the types <math>K_i</math>. If you have <math>m</math> of these constructors, you can define the type of <math>S</math> as:\n:<math>\\forall \\alpha.(K_1^1[\\alpha/S]\\rightarrow\\dots\\rightarrow \\alpha)\\dots\\rightarrow(K_1^m[\\alpha/S]\\rightarrow\\dots\\rightarrow \\alpha)\\rightarrow \\alpha</math>\n\nFor instance, the natural numbers can be defined as an inductive datatype <math>N</math> with constructors\n: <math>\\mathit{zero} : \\mathrm{N}</math>\n: <math>\\mathit{succ} : \\mathrm{N} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{N}</math>\nThe System F type corresponding to this structure is\n<math>\\forall \\alpha. \\alpha \\to (\\alpha \\to \\alpha) \\to \\alpha</math>.  The terms of this type comprise a typed version of the [[Church numeral]]s, the first few of which are:\n: <tt>0 := </tt><math>\\Lambda \\alpha . \\lambda x^\\alpha . \\lambda f^{\\alpha\\to\\alpha} . x</math>\n: <tt>1 := </tt><math>\\Lambda \\alpha . \\lambda x^\\alpha . \\lambda f^{\\alpha\\to\\alpha} . f x</math>\n: <tt>2 := </tt><math>\\Lambda \\alpha . \\lambda x^\\alpha . \\lambda f^{\\alpha\\to\\alpha} . f (f x)</math>\n: <tt>3 := </tt><math>\\Lambda \\alpha . \\lambda x^\\alpha . \\lambda f^{\\alpha\\to\\alpha} . f (f (f x))</math>\n\nIf we reverse the order of the curried arguments (''i.e.,'' <math>\\forall \\alpha. (\\alpha \\rightarrow \\alpha) \\rightarrow \\alpha \\rightarrow \\alpha</math>), then the Church numeral for <math>n</math> is a function that takes a function <tt>''f''</tt> as argument and returns the <math>n</math><sup>th</sup> power of <tt>''f''</tt>. That is to say, a Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]] \u2013 it takes a single-argument function <tt>''f''</tt>, and returns another single-argument function.\n\n==Use in programming languages==\n\nThe version of System F used in this article is as an explicitly typed, or Church-style, calculus.  The typing information contained in \u03bb-terms makes [[type-checking]] straightforward.  [[Joe Wells]] (1994) settled an \"embarrassing open problem\" by proving that type checking is [[decision problem|undecidable]] for a Curry-style variant of System F, that is, one that lacks explicit typing annotations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/research-summary.html |title= Joe Wells's Research Interests |date=2005-01-20 |publisher=Heriot-Watt University |first=J.B. |last=Wells }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Wells |title=Typability and type checking in System F are equivalent and undecidable |journal=Ann.

System F thus formalizes the notion of [[parametric polymorphism]] in [[programming language]]s, and forms a theoretical basis for languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. System F was discovered independently by [[logician]] [[Jean-Yves Girard]] (1972) and [[computer scientist]] [[John C. Reynolds]] (1974).\n\nWhereas [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has variables ranging over terms, and binders for them, System F additionally has variables ranging over ''types'', and binders for them. As an example, the fact that the identity function can have any type of the form A\u2192 A would be formalized in System F as the judgment\n\n:<math>\\vdash \\Lambda\\alpha. \\lambda x^\\alpha.x: \\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is a '''[[type variable]]'''.  The upper-case <math>\\Lambda</math> is traditionally used to denote type-level functions, as opposed to the lower-case <math>\\lambda</math> which is used for value-level functions. (The superscripted <math>\\alpha</math> means that the bound ''x'' is of type <math>\\alpha</math>; the expression after the colon is the type of the lambda expression preceding it.)\n\nAs a [[term rewriting system]], System F is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. However, type inference in System F (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable. Under the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]], System F corresponds to the fragment of second-order [[intuitionistic logic]] that uses only universal quantification. System F can be seen as part of the [[lambda cube]], together with even more expressive typed lambda calculi, including those with [[dependent types]].\n\nAccording to Girard, the \"F\" in ''System F'' was picked by chance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Girard|first=Jean-Yves|title=The system F of variable types, fifteen years later|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=45|page=160|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90044-7|quote=However, in [3] it was shown that the obvious rules of conversion for this system, called F by chance, were converging.|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n== Typing rules ==\n\nThe typing rules of System F are those of simply typed lambda calculus with the addition of the following:\n\n{| align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"9\"\n| align=\"center\" | <math>{\\frac{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\mathbin{:}\\forall\\alpha.\\sigma}{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\tau\\mathbin{:}\\sigma[\\tau/\\alpha]} }</math> (1)\n| align=\"center\" | <math>{\\frac{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\mathbin{:}\\sigma}{\\Gamma\\vdash\\lambda\\alpha.M\\mathbin{:}\\forall\\alpha\\mathbin{:}\\sigma}}</math> (2)\n|}\n\nwhere <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> are types and <math>\\alpha</math> is a type variable. The first rule is that of application, and the second is that of abstraction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/Extra/lectnotes_vol1.pdf |title=Proofs of Programs and Formalisation of Mathematics |vauthors=Geuvers H, Nordstr\u00f6m B, Dowek G}}</ref>\n\n== Logic and predicates ==\nThe <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean}</math> type is defined as:\n<math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>, where <math>\\scriptstyle\\alpha</math> is a [[type variable]]. This means: <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean}</math> is the type of all functions which take as input a type &alpha; and two expressions of type &alpha;, and produce as output an expression of type &alpha; (note that we consider <math>\\to</math> to be [[right-associative]].)\n\nThe following two definitions for the boolean values <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{T}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{F}</math> are used, extending the definition of [[Church encoding#Church Booleans|Church booleans]]:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{T} = \\Lambda\\alpha{.}\\lambda x^{\\alpha} \\lambda y^\\alpha{.}x</math> <!-- These didn't render without the {}-wrapped around the . -->\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = \\Lambda\\alpha{.}\\lambda x^{\\alpha} \\lambda y^{\\alpha}{.}y</math>\n\n(Note that the above two functions require ''three'' &mdash; not two &mdash; arguments. The latter two should be lambda expressions, but the first one should be a type. This fact is reflected in the fact that the type of these expressions is <math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>; the universal quantifier binding the &alpha; corresponds to the &Lambda; binding the alpha in the lambda expression itself. Also, note that <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math> is a convenient shorthand for <math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>, but it is not a symbol of System F itself, but rather a \"meta-symbol\". Likewise, <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{T}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{F}</math> are also \"meta-symbols\", convenient shorthands, of System F \"assemblies\" (in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=IL-SI67hjI4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nicolas+Bourbaki&source=bl&ots=nbfmxi9gJK&sig=4nPo8EFXrQYwAC2y0pD0uGv-EGY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3sYBUOukIMLW2AX4t_inCw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Nicolas%20Bourbaki&f=false Bourbaki sense]); otherwise, if such functions could be named (within System F), then there would be no need for the lambda-expressive apparatus capable of defining functions anonymously and for the [[fixed-point combinator]], which works around that restriction.)\n\nThen, with these two <math>\\scriptstyle\\lambda</math>-terms, we can define some logic operators (which are of type <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Boolean} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Boolean}</math>):\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{AND} &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} \\lambda y^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x y\\, \\mathbf{F}\\\\\n\\mathrm{OR}  &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} \\lambda y^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \\mathbf{T}\\, y\\\\\n\\mathrm{NOT} &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{T} \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs in Church encodings, there is no need for an <tt>IFTHENELSE</tt> function as one can just use raw <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math>-typed terms as decision functions. However, if one is requested:\n: <math>\\mathrm{IFTHENELSE} = \\Lambda \\alpha.\\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}\\lambda y^{\\alpha}\\lambda z^{\\alpha}. x \\alpha y z </math>\nwill do.\nA ''predicate'' is a function which returns a <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math>-typed value. The most fundamental predicate is <tt>ISZERO</tt> which returns <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{T}</math> if and only if its argument is the [[Church encoding#Church numerals|Church numeral]]  <tt>0</tt>:\n: <math>\\mathrm{ISZERO} = \\lambda n^{\\forall \\alpha. (\\alpha \\rightarrow \\alpha) \\rightarrow \\alpha \\rightarrow \\alpha}{.}n^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} (\\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.}\\mathbf{F})\\, \\mathbf{T}</math>\n\n==System F structures==\n\nSystem F allows recursive constructions to be embedded in a natural manner, related to that in [[Martin-L\u00f6f's type theory]]. Abstract structures (S) are created using ''constructors''. These are functions typed as:\n:<math>K_1\\rightarrow K_2\\rightarrow\\dots\\rightarrow S</math>.\n\nRecursivity is manifested when <math>S</math> itself appears within one of the types <math>K_i</math>. If you have <math>m</math> of these constructors, you can define the type of <math>S</math> as:\n:<math>\\forall \\alpha.(K_1^1[\\alpha/S]\\rightarrow\\dots\\rightarrow \\alpha)\\dots\\rightarrow(K_1^m[\\alpha/S]\\rightarrow\\dots\\rightarrow \\alpha)\\rightarrow \\alpha</math>\n\nFor instance, the natural numbers can be defined as an inductive datatype <math>N</math> with constructors\n: <math>\\mathit{zero} : \\mathrm{N}</math>\n: <math>\\mathit{succ} : \\mathrm{N} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{N}</math>\nThe System F type corresponding to this structure is\n<math>\\forall \\alpha. \\alpha \\to (\\alpha \\to \\alpha) \\to \\alpha</math>.  The terms of this type comprise a typed version of the [[Church numeral]]s, the first few of which are:\n: <tt>0 := </tt><math>\\Lambda \\alpha . \\lambda x^\\alpha . \\lambda f^{\\alpha\\to\\alpha} . x</math>\n: <tt>1 := </tt><math>\\Lambda \\alpha . \\lambda x^\\alpha . \\lambda f^{\\alpha\\to\\alpha} . f x</math>\n: <tt>2 := </tt><math>\\Lambda \\alpha . \\lambda x^\\alpha . \\lambda f^{\\alpha\\to\\alpha} . f (f x)</math>\n: <tt>3 := </tt><math>\\Lambda \\alpha . \\lambda x^\\alpha . \\lambda f^{\\alpha\\to\\alpha} . f (f (f x))</math>\n\nIf we reverse the order of the curried arguments (''i.e.,'' <math>\\forall \\alpha. (\\alpha \\rightarrow \\alpha) \\rightarrow \\alpha \\rightarrow \\alpha</math>), then the Church numeral for <math>n</math> is a function that takes a function <tt>''f''</tt> as argument and returns the <math>n</math><sup>th</sup> power of <tt>''f''</tt>. That is to say, a Church numeral is a [[higher-order function]] \u2013 it takes a single-argument function <tt>''f''</tt>, and returns another single-argument function.\n\n==Use in programming languages==\n\nThe version of System F used in this article is as an explicitly typed, or Church-style, calculus.  The typing information contained in \u03bb-terms makes [[type-checking]] straightforward.  [[Joe Wells]] (1994) settled an \"embarrassing open problem\" by proving that type checking is [[decision problem|undecidable]] for a Curry-style variant of System F, that is, one that lacks explicit typing annotations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~jbw/research-summary.html |title= Joe Wells's Research Interests |date=2005-01-20 |publisher=Heriot-Watt University |first=J.B. |last=Wells }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=J.B. |last=Wells |title=Typability and type checking in System F are equivalent and undecidable |journal=Ann.
