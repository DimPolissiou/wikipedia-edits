Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding [[Chinese white]].\n\nIn East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as [[brush painting]] or scroll painting. In [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Korean painting|Korean]] and [[Japanese painting]] it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns, often using [[inkstick]] or other pigments. India, Ethiopia and other countries have long watercolor painting traditions as well.\n\nAmerican artists in the early 19th century seemed to regard watercolor primarily as a sketching tool in preparation for the \"finished\" work in oil or engraving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa043.shtml|title=THE COLLECTOR\u2019S GUIDE: WHAT IS WATERCOLOR?|website=www.collectorsguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n\nWet the paper with a spray bottle to make the pain spread. Another tip is to build up layers, and don\u2019t go straight in with the harshest color. If you want to use a liner for your art make sure that is not water based ink or else your liner will bleed. You can make many colors with a few. You can turn the darkest colors into the lightest colors ; just water them down. Another tick is to wait for your layers to dry before adding another layer. Do some research before buying a palette of colors. Make a sketch ,then gently remove some of the graphite before painting. Lastly make sure the paper that you are using is watercolor paper; or else the watercolor will tear up you your paper ,and ruin your art.\n\n==History==\n\nWatercolor painting is extremely old, dating perhaps to the cave paintings of paleolithic Europe, and has been used for [[illustrated manuscript|manuscript illustration]] since at least [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian times]] but especially in the [[Middle Ages|European Middle Ages]]. However, its ''continuous'' history as an art medium begins with [[the Renaissance]]. The German [[Northern Renaissance]] artist [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] (1471\u20131528), who painted several fine botanical, wildlife, and landscape watercolors, is generally considered among the earliest exponents of watercolor. An important school of watercolor painting in Germany was led by [[Hans Bol]] (1534\u20131593) as part of the [[D\u00fcrer Renaissance]].\n\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], ''[[Young Hare]]'', 1502, watercolor and [[body color]], [[Albertina, Vienna]]|alt=A painting of a hare with large ears.]]\n \nDespite this early start, watercolors were generally used by Baroque easel painters only for sketches, copies or [[modello|cartoons]] (full-scale design drawings). Notable early practitioners of watercolor painting were [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] (during his stay in England), [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], and many [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artists. However, [[botanical illustration]] and wildlife illustration perhaps form the oldest and most important traditions in watercolor painting. Botanical illustrations became popular during the Renaissance, both as hand-tinted [[woodcut|woodblock]] illustrations in books or broadsheets and as tinted ink drawings on [[vellum]] or paper. Botanical artists have traditionally been some of the most exacting and accomplished watercolor painters, and even today, watercolors\u2014with their unique ability to summarize, clarify, and idealize in full color\u2014are used to illustrate scientific and museum publications. Wildlife illustration reached its peak in the 19th century with artists such as [[John James Audubon]], and today many naturalist [[field guide]]s are still illustrated with watercolor paintings.\n\n===English school===\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the spread of watercolor painting during the 18th century, particularly in England. Among the elite and aristocratic classes, watercolor painting was one of the incidental adornments of a good education; mapmakers, military officers, and engineers used it for its usefulness in depicting properties, terrain, fortifications, field geology, and for illustrating public works or commissioned projects. Watercolor artists were commonly brought with the geological or archaeological expeditions, funded by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] (founded in 1733), to document discoveries in the Mediterranean, Asia, and the New World. These expeditions stimulated the demand for topographical painters, who churned out memento paintings of famous sites (and sights) along the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour to Italy]] that was undertaken by every fashionable young man of the time.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the English cleric [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]] wrote a series of hugely popular books describing his [[picturesque]] journeys throughout rural England, and illustrated them with self-made sentimentalized monochrome watercolors of river valleys, ancient castles, and abandoned churches. This example popularized watercolors as a form of personal tourist journal. The confluence of these cultural, engineering, scientific, tourist, and amateur interests culminated in the celebration and promotion of watercolor as a distinctly English \"national art\". [[William Blake]] published several books of hand-tinted engraved poetry, provided illustrations to [[Dante's Inferno|Dante's ''Inferno'']], and he also experimented with large [[monotype]] works in watercolor. Among the many other significant watercolorists of this period were [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[John Robert Cozens]], [[Francis Towne]], [[Michael Angelo Rooker]], [[William Pars]], [[Thomas Hearne (artist)|Thomas Hearne]], and [[John Warwick Smith]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Girtin 006.JPG|thumb|[[Thomas Girtin]], ''[[Jedburgh Abbey]] from the River'', 1798\u201399, watercolor on paper]]\n \nFrom the late 18th century through the 19th century, the market for printed books and domestic art contributed substantially to the growth of the medium. Watercolors were used as the basic document from which collectible landscape or tourist engravings were developed, and hand-painted watercolor originals or copies of famous paintings contributed to many upper class art portfolios. Satirical broadsides by [[Thomas Rowlandson]], many published by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], were also extremely popular.\n \nThe three English artists credited with establishing watercolor as an independent, mature painting medium are [[Paul Sandby]] (1730\u20131809), often called the \"father of the English watercolor\"; [[Thomas Girtin]] (1775\u20131802), who pioneered its use for large format, romantic or picturesque landscape painting; and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] (1775\u20131851), who brought watercolor painting to the highest pitch of power and refinement, and created hundreds of superb historical, topographical, architectural, and mythological watercolor paintings. His method of developing the watercolor painting in stages, starting with large, vague color areas established on wet paper, then refining the image through a sequence of [[wash (visual arts)|washes]] and glazes, permitted him to produce large numbers of paintings with \"workshop efficiency\" and made him a multimillionaire, partly by sales from his personal art gallery, the first of its kind. Among the important and highly talented contemporaries of Turner and Girtin were [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], [[John Sell Cotman]], [[Copley Fielding|Anthony Copley Fielding]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[William Havell]], and [[Samuel Prout]]. The Swiss painter [[Abraham-Louis-Rodolphe Ducros]] was also widely known for his large format, romantic paintings in watercolor.\n\n[[File:Jamaica hut4.jpg|thumb|left|An unfinished watercolor by [[William Berryman]], created between 1808 and 1816, using watercolor, ink, and pencil. The use of partial pigmentation draws attention to the central subject.]]\n\nThe confluence of amateur activity, publishing markets, middle class [[art collecting]], and 19th-century technique led to the formation of English watercolor painting societies: the ''Society of Painters in Water Colours'' (1804, now known as the [[Royal Watercolour Society]]) and the ''New Water Colour Society'' (1832, now known as the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]]). (A ''Scottish Society of Painters in Water Colour'' was founded in 1878, now known as the [[Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour]].) These societies provided annual exhibitions and buyer referrals for many artists. They also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates, particularly between advocates of traditional (\"transparent\") watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with [[gouache|body color or gouache]] (\"opaque\" watercolor). The late Georgian and Victorian periods produced the zenith of the British watercolor, among the most impressive 19th-century works on paper,<ref>{{Citation | first = Graham | last = Reynolds | title = Watercolours, A Concise History | place = London | publisher = [[Thames and Hudson]] | year = 1992 | page = 102}}</ref> due to artists Turner, Varley, Cotman, [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], [[Peter de Wint]], [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Henry Hunt]], [[John Frederick Lewis]], [[Myles Birket Foster]], [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]], [[Thomas Collier]], [[Arthur Melville]] and many others. In particular, the graceful, lapidary, and atmospheric watercolors (\"genre paintings\") by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] created an international fad for watercolor painting, especially in England and France in the 1820s.\n \nThe popularity of watercolors stimulated many innovations, including heavier and more [[sizing|sized]] [[wove paper]]s, and brushes (called \"pencils\") manufactured expressly for watercolor. Watercolor tutorials were first published in this period by Varley, Cox, and others, establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today; ''The Elements of Drawing'', a watercolor tutorial by English art critic [[John Ruskin]], has been out of print only once since it was first published in 1857. Commercial brands of watercolor were marketed and paints were packaged in metal tubes or as dry cakes that could be \"rubbed out\" (dissolved) in studio porcelain or used in portable metal paint boxes in the field. Breakthroughs in chemistry made many new pigments available, including synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cobalt violet]], [[cadmium yellow]], [[aureolin]] ([[potassium cobaltinitrite]]), [[zinc white]], and a wide range of [[carmine]] and [[madder lake]]s. These pigments, in turn, stimulated a greater use of color with all painting media, but in English watercolors, particularly by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].\n\n[[File:The Blue Boat 1892 Winslow Homer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Winslow Homer]], ''The Blue Boat'', 1892]]\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - White Ships - John Singer Sargent.jpg|thumb|right|John Singer Sargent, ''White Ships''. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nWatercolor painting also became popular in the United States during the 19th century; outstanding early practitioners included [[John James Audubon]], as well as early [[Hudson River School]] painters such as [[William H. Bartlett]] and [[George Harvey (painter)|George Harvey]]. By mid-century, the influence of John Ruskin led to increasing interest in watercolors, particularly the use of a detailed \"Ruskinian\" style by such artists as John W. Hill Henry, [[William Trost Richards]], [[Roderick Newman]], and [[Fidelia Bridges]]. The ''American Society of Painters in Watercolor'' (now the [[American Watercolor Society]]) was founded in 1866. Late-19th-century American exponents of the medium included [[Thomas Moran]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[John LaFarge]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Childe Hassam]], and, preeminently, [[Winslow Homer]].\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski]], ''Pejza\u017c jesienny z Rybiniszek'' (Autumn landscape of [[Riebi\u0146i|Rybiniszki]]), watercolor, 1902]]\nWatercolor was less popular in Continental Europe. In the 18th century, [[gouache]] was an important medium for the Italian artists [[Marco Ricci]] and [[Francesco Zuccarelli]], whose landscape paintings were widely collected.<ref>Brown, David Blayney. \"Watercolour.\" ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved April 26, 2014.</ref> Gouache was used by a number of artists in France as well. In the 19th century, the influence of the English school helped popularize \"transparent\" watercolor in France, and it became an important medium for [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Marius Granet]], [[Henri-Joseph Harpignies]], and the satirist [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]]. Other European painters who worked frequently in watercolor were [[Adolph Menzel]] in Germany and [[Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski]] in Poland.\n\n[[File:Paul C\u00e9zanne 151.jpg|thumb|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], self-portrait]]\nUnfortunately, the careless and excessive adoption of brightly colored, petroleum-derived aniline dyes (and pigments compounded from them), which all fade rapidly on exposure to light, and the efforts to properly conserve the twenty thousand [[J. M. W. Turner]] paintings inherited by the British Museum in 1857, led to an examination and negative reevaluation of the permanence of pigments in watercolor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} This caused a sharp decline in their status and market value. Nevertheless, isolated practitioners continued to prefer and develop the medium into the 20th century. Gorgeous landscape and maritime watercolors were done by [[Paul Signac]], and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] developed a watercolor painting style consisting entirely of overlapping small glazes of pure color.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nAmong the many 20th-century artists who produced important works in watercolor, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Egon Schiele]], and [[Raoul Dufy]] must be mentioned. In America, the major exponents included [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Charles Demuth]], and [[John Marin]] (80% of his total work is watercolor). In this period, American watercolor painting often imitated European Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, but significant individualism flourished in \"regional\" styles of watercolor painting from the 1920s to 1940s. In particular, the \"[[Cleveland School (arts community)|Cleveland School]]\" or \"Ohio School\" of painters centered around the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], and the [[California Scene Painting|California Scene]] painters were often associated with Hollywood animation studios or the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (now [[California Institute of the Arts]]). The California painters exploited their state's varied geography, Mediterranean climate, and \"[[Car culture|automobility]]\" to reinvigorate the outdoor or \"plein air\" tradition. The most influential among them were [[Phil Dike]], [[Millard Sheets]], [[Rex Brandt]], [[Dong Kingman]], and [[Milford Zornes]]. The California Water Color Society, founded in 1921 and later renamed the National Watercolor Society, sponsored important exhibitions of their work. The largest watercolor in the world at the moment is ''Building 6 Portrait: Interior.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/story-behind-worlds-largest-known-watercolor-painting-180963798/|title=The Story Behind the World\u2019s Largest Watercolor Painting|last=Nalewicki|first=Jennifer|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en}}</ref> Produced by American artist Barbara Ernst Prey on commission for MASS MoCA,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/8x4w54/mass-moca-worlds-largest-watercolor|title=The World's Largest Watercolor Goes on Display at MASS MoCA|date=2017-05-30|work=Creators|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-us}}</ref> the work can be seen at MASS MoCA's Robert W.

In Spain, [[Cefer\u00ed Oliv\u00e9]] created an innovative style followed by his students, such as [[Rafael Alonso L\u00f3pez-Montero]] and [[Francesc Torn\u00e9 Gavald\u00e0]]. In [[Mexico]], the major exponents are [[Ignacio Barrios]], [[Edgardo Coghlan]], [[\u00c1ngel Mauro]], [[Vicente Mendiola]], and [[Pastor Vel\u00e1zquez]]. In the [[Canary Islands]], where this pictorial technique has many followers, there are stand-out artists such as Francisco Bonn\u00edn Guer\u00edn, [[Jos\u00e9 Comas Quesada]], and Alberto Manrique.\n\n==Watercolor paint==\n[[File:Watercolours.jpg|thumb|A set of watercolors]]\n\nWatercolor paint consists of four principal ingredients: a [[pigment]]; [[gum arabic]] as a binder to hold the pigment in suspension; additives like [[glycerin]], [[ox gall]], [[honey]], and preservatives to alter the viscosity, hiding, durability or color of the pigment and vehicle mixture; and evaporating water, as a solvent used to thin or dilute the paint for application.\n\nThe more general term ''[[watermedia]]'' refers to any painting medium that uses water as a solvent and that can be applied with a [[brush]], [[pen]], or sprayer. This includes most [[ink]]s, [[watercolor]]s, [[tempera]]s, [[casein paint|casein]]s, [[gouache]]s, and modern [[acrylic paint]]s.\n\nThe term \"watercolor\" refers to paints that use water-soluble, complex carbohydrates as a binder. Originally (in the 16th to 18th centuries), watercolor binders were sugars and/or hide glues, but since the 19th century, the preferred binder is natural [[gum arabic]], with [[glycerin]] and/or [[honey]] as additives to improve plasticity and solubility of the binder, and with other chemicals added to improve product shelf life.\n\nThe term \"[[bodycolor]]\" refers to paint that is opaque rather than transparent. It usually refers to opaque watercolor, known as [[gouache]].<ref>The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists, Ian Chilvers, Oxford University Press USA, 2009</ref> Modern acrylic paints use an [[acrylic resin]] dispersion as a binder.\n\n===Commercial watercolors===\nWatercolor painters before the turn of the 18th century had to make paints themselves using pigments purchased from an [[apothecary]] or specialized \"colorman\", and mixing them with gum arabic or some other binder. The earliest commercial paints were small, resinous blocks that had to be wetted and laboriously \"rubbed out\" in water to obtain a usable color intensity. [[William Reeves (colourman)|William Reeves]] started his business as a colorman around 1766. In 1781, he and his brother, Thomas Reeves, were awarded the Silver Palette of the [[Society of Arts]], for the invention of the moist watercolor ''paint-cake'', a time-saving convenience, introduced in the \"golden age\" of English watercolor painting. The \"cake\" was immediately soluble when touched by a wet brush.\n[[File:Watercolors by William Reeves, London, inventor of watercolors in cakes, undated - Joseph Allen Skinner Museum - DSC07847.JPG|left|thumb|upright|A Reeves box]]\nModern commercial watercolor paints are available in two forms: tubes or pans. The majority of paints sold today are in collapsible small metal tubes in standard sizes and formulated to a consistency similar to toothpaste by being already mixed with a certain water component. For use, this paste has to be further diluted with water. Pan paints (actually small dried cakes or bars of paint in an open plastic container) are usually sold in two sizes, full pans and half pans.\n\nOwing to modern [[Industrial technology|industrial]] [[organic chemistry]], the variety, [[colorfulness|saturation]], and permanence of artists' colors available today has been vastly improved. Correct and non-toxic [[primary colors]] are now present through the introduction of [[hansa yellow]], [[phthalo blue]] and [[quinacridone]] (PV 122). From such a set of three colors, in principle all others can be mixed, as in a classical technique no white is used. The modern development of pigments was not driven by artistic demand. The [[art materials]] industry is too small to exert any market leverage on global dye or pigment manufacture. With rare exceptions such as aureolin, all modern watercolor paints utilize pigments that have a wider industrial use. Paint manufacturers buy, by industrial standards very small, supplies of these pigments, [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] them with the vehicle, solvent, and additives, and package them. The milling process with inorganic pigments, in more expensive brands, reduces the particle size to improve the color flow when the paint is applied with water.\n\n===Transparency===\nIn the partisan debates of the 19th-century English art world, gouache was emphatically contrasted to traditional watercolors and denigrated for its high hiding power or lack of \"transparency\"; \"transparent\" watercolors were exalted. The aversion to opaque paint had its origin in the fact that well into the 19th century [[lead white]] was used to increase the covering quality. That pigment tended to soon discolor into black under the influence of sulphurous air pollution, totally ruining the artwork.<ref>D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) ''Het kunstschilderboek \u2014 handboek voor materialen en technieken'', Cantecleer, p. 187</ref> The traditional claim that \"transparent\" watercolors gain \"luminosity\" because they function like a pane of stained glass laid on paper\u2014the color intensified because the light passes through the pigment, reflects from the paper, and passes a second time through the pigment on its way to the viewer\u2014is false. Watercolor paints typically do not form a cohesive paint layer, as do acrylic or [[oil paint|oil]] paints, but simply scatter pigment particles randomly across the [[paper]] surface; the transparency is caused by the paper being visible between the particles.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\">D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) ''Het kunstschilderboek \u2014 handboek voor materialen en technieken'', Cantecleer, p. 183</ref> Watercolors may appear more vivid than acrylics or oils because the pigments are laid down in a purer form, with few or no fillers (such as kaolin) obscuring the pigment colors. Typically, most or all of the gum binder will be absorbed by the paper, preventing the binder from changing the visibility of the pigment.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/> The absorption of the gum increases the adhesion of the pigment to the paper, and the pigment particles will penetrate the fibres more easily. In fact, an important function of the gum is to facilitate the \"lifting\" (removal) of color, should the artist want to create a lighter spot in a painted area.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/> Furthermore, the gum prevents  [[flocculation]] of the pigment particles.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ink wash painting]]\n* [[Acrylic paint]]\n* [[Acrylic painting techniques]]\n* [[History of painting]]\n* [[Gouache]]\n* [[Oil paint]]\n* [[:Category:Watercolorists]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===History===\n* Andrew Wilton & Anne Lyles.

Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding [[Chinese white]].\n\nIn East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as [[brush painting]] or scroll painting. In [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Korean painting|Korean]] and [[Japanese painting]] it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns, often using [[inkstick]] or other pigments. India, Ethiopia and other countries have long watercolor painting traditions as well.\n\nAmerican artists in the early 19th century seemed to regard watercolor primarily as a sketching tool in preparation for the \"finished\" work in oil or engraving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa043.shtml|title=THE COLLECTOR\u2019S GUIDE: WHAT IS WATERCOLOR?|website=www.collectorsguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Tips & tricks==\n\nWet the paper with a spray bottle to make the pain spread. Another tip is to build up layers, and don\u2019t go straight in with the harshest color. If you want to use a liner for your art make sure that is not water based ink or else your liner will bleed. You can make many colors with a few. You can turn the darkest colors into the lightest colors ; just water them down. Another tick is to wait for your layers to dry before adding another layer. Do your research before buying a palette of colors. Make a sketch ,then gently remove some of the graphite before painting. Lastly make sure the paper that you are using is watercolor paper; or else the watercolor will tear up you your paper ,and ruin your art.\n\n==History==\n\nWatercolor painting is extremely old, dating perhaps to the cave paintings of paleolithic Europe, and has been used for [[illustrated manuscript|manuscript illustration]] since at least [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian times]] but especially in the [[Middle Ages|European Middle Ages]]. However, its ''continuous'' history as an art medium begins with [[the Renaissance]]. The German [[Northern Renaissance]] artist [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] (1471\u20131528), who painted several fine botanical, wildlife, and landscape watercolors, is generally considered among the earliest exponents of watercolor. An important school of watercolor painting in Germany was led by [[Hans Bol]] (1534\u20131593) as part of the [[D\u00fcrer Renaissance]].\n\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], ''[[Young Hare]]'', 1502, watercolor and [[body color]], [[Albertina, Vienna]]|alt=A painting of a hare with large ears.]]\n \nDespite this early start, watercolors were generally used by Baroque easel painters only for sketches, copies or [[modello|cartoons]] (full-scale design drawings). Notable early practitioners of watercolor painting were [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] (during his stay in England), [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], and many [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artists. However, [[botanical illustration]] and wildlife illustration perhaps form the oldest and most important traditions in watercolor painting. Botanical illustrations became popular during the Renaissance, both as hand-tinted [[woodcut|woodblock]] illustrations in books or broadsheets and as tinted ink drawings on [[vellum]] or paper. Botanical artists have traditionally been some of the most exacting and accomplished watercolor painters, and even today, watercolors\u2014with their unique ability to summarize, clarify, and idealize in full color\u2014are used to illustrate scientific and museum publications. Wildlife illustration reached its peak in the 19th century with artists such as [[John James Audubon]], and today many naturalist [[field guide]]s are still illustrated with watercolor paintings.\n\n===English school===\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the spread of watercolor painting during the 18th century, particularly in England. Among the elite and aristocratic classes, watercolor painting was one of the incidental adornments of a good education; mapmakers, military officers, and engineers used it for its usefulness in depicting properties, terrain, fortifications, field geology, and for illustrating public works or commissioned projects. Watercolor artists were commonly brought with the geological or archaeological expeditions, funded by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] (founded in 1733), to document discoveries in the Mediterranean, Asia, and the New World. These expeditions stimulated the demand for topographical painters, who churned out memento paintings of famous sites (and sights) along the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour to Italy]] that was undertaken by every fashionable young man of the time.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the English cleric [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]] wrote a series of hugely popular books describing his [[picturesque]] journeys throughout rural England, and illustrated them with self-made sentimentalized monochrome watercolors of river valleys, ancient castles, and abandoned churches. This example popularized watercolors as a form of personal tourist journal. The confluence of these cultural, engineering, scientific, tourist, and amateur interests culminated in the celebration and promotion of watercolor as a distinctly English \"national art\". [[William Blake]] published several books of hand-tinted engraved poetry, provided illustrations to [[Dante's Inferno|Dante's ''Inferno'']], and he also experimented with large [[monotype]] works in watercolor. Among the many other significant watercolorists of this period were [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[John Robert Cozens]], [[Francis Towne]], [[Michael Angelo Rooker]], [[William Pars]], [[Thomas Hearne (artist)|Thomas Hearne]], and [[John Warwick Smith]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Girtin 006.JPG|thumb|[[Thomas Girtin]], ''[[Jedburgh Abbey]] from the River'', 1798\u201399, watercolor on paper]]\n \nFrom the late 18th century through the 19th century, the market for printed books and domestic art contributed substantially to the growth of the medium. Watercolors were used as the basic document from which collectible landscape or tourist engravings were developed, and hand-painted watercolor originals or copies of famous paintings contributed to many upper class art portfolios. Satirical broadsides by [[Thomas Rowlandson]], many published by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], were also extremely popular.\n \nThe three English artists credited with establishing watercolor as an independent, mature painting medium are [[Paul Sandby]] (1730\u20131809), often called the \"father of the English watercolor\"; [[Thomas Girtin]] (1775\u20131802), who pioneered its use for large format, romantic or picturesque landscape painting; and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] (1775\u20131851), who brought watercolor painting to the highest pitch of power and refinement, and created hundreds of superb historical, topographical, architectural, and mythological watercolor paintings. His method of developing the watercolor painting in stages, starting with large, vague color areas established on wet paper, then refining the image through a sequence of [[wash (visual arts)|washes]] and glazes, permitted him to produce large numbers of paintings with \"workshop efficiency\" and made him a multimillionaire, partly by sales from his personal art gallery, the first of its kind. Among the important and highly talented contemporaries of Turner and Girtin were [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], [[John Sell Cotman]], [[Copley Fielding|Anthony Copley Fielding]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[William Havell]], and [[Samuel Prout]]. The Swiss painter [[Abraham-Louis-Rodolphe Ducros]] was also widely known for his large format, romantic paintings in watercolor.\n\n[[File:Jamaica hut4.jpg|thumb|left|An unfinished watercolor by [[William Berryman]], created between 1808 and 1816, using watercolor, ink, and pencil. The use of partial pigmentation draws attention to the central subject.]]\n\nThe confluence of amateur activity, publishing markets, middle class [[art collecting]], and 19th-century technique led to the formation of English watercolor painting societies: the ''Society of Painters in Water Colours'' (1804, now known as the [[Royal Watercolour Society]]) and the ''New Water Colour Society'' (1832, now known as the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]]). (A ''Scottish Society of Painters in Water Colour'' was founded in 1878, now known as the [[Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour]].) These societies provided annual exhibitions and buyer referrals for many artists. They also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates, particularly between advocates of traditional (\"transparent\") watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with [[gouache|body color or gouache]] (\"opaque\" watercolor). The late Georgian and Victorian periods produced the zenith of the British watercolor, among the most impressive 19th-century works on paper,<ref>{{Citation | first = Graham | last = Reynolds | title = Watercolours, A Concise History | place = London | publisher = [[Thames and Hudson]] | year = 1992 | page = 102}}</ref> due to artists Turner, Varley, Cotman, [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], [[Peter de Wint]], [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Henry Hunt]], [[John Frederick Lewis]], [[Myles Birket Foster]], [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]], [[Thomas Collier]], [[Arthur Melville]] and many others. In particular, the graceful, lapidary, and atmospheric watercolors (\"genre paintings\") by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] created an international fad for watercolor painting, especially in England and France in the 1820s.\n \nThe popularity of watercolors stimulated many innovations, including heavier and more [[sizing|sized]] [[wove paper]]s, and brushes (called \"pencils\") manufactured expressly for watercolor. Watercolor tutorials were first published in this period by Varley, Cox, and others, establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today; ''The Elements of Drawing'', a watercolor tutorial by English art critic [[John Ruskin]], has been out of print only once since it was first published in 1857. Commercial brands of watercolor were marketed and paints were packaged in metal tubes or as dry cakes that could be \"rubbed out\" (dissolved) in studio porcelain or used in portable metal paint boxes in the field. Breakthroughs in chemistry made many new pigments available, including synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cobalt violet]], [[cadmium yellow]], [[aureolin]] ([[potassium cobaltinitrite]]), [[zinc white]], and a wide range of [[carmine]] and [[madder lake]]s. These pigments, in turn, stimulated a greater use of color with all painting media, but in English watercolors, particularly by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].\n\n[[File:The Blue Boat 1892 Winslow Homer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Winslow Homer]], ''The Blue Boat'', 1892]]\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - White Ships - John Singer Sargent.jpg|thumb|right|John Singer Sargent, ''White Ships''. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nWatercolor painting also became popular in the United States during the 19th century; outstanding early practitioners included [[John James Audubon]], as well as early [[Hudson River School]] painters such as [[William H. Bartlett]] and [[George Harvey (painter)|George Harvey]]. By mid-century, the influence of John Ruskin led to increasing interest in watercolors, particularly the use of a detailed \"Ruskinian\" style by such artists as John W. Hill Henry, [[William Trost Richards]], [[Roderick Newman]], and [[Fidelia Bridges]]. The ''American Society of Painters in Watercolor'' (now the [[American Watercolor Society]]) was founded in 1866. Late-19th-century American exponents of the medium included [[Thomas Moran]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[John LaFarge]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Childe Hassam]], and, preeminently, [[Winslow Homer]].\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski]], ''Pejza\u017c jesienny z Rybiniszek'' (Autumn landscape of [[Riebi\u0146i|Rybiniszki]]), watercolor, 1902]]\nWatercolor was less popular in Continental Europe. In the 18th century, [[gouache]] was an important medium for the Italian artists [[Marco Ricci]] and [[Francesco Zuccarelli]], whose landscape paintings were widely collected.<ref>Brown, David Blayney. \"Watercolour.\" ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved April 26, 2014.</ref> Gouache was used by a number of artists in France as well. In the 19th century, the influence of the English school helped popularize \"transparent\" watercolor in France, and it became an important medium for [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Marius Granet]], [[Henri-Joseph Harpignies]], and the satirist [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]]. Other European painters who worked frequently in watercolor were [[Adolph Menzel]] in Germany and [[Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski]] in Poland.\n\n[[File:Paul C\u00e9zanne 151.jpg|thumb|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], self-portrait]]\nUnfortunately, the careless and excessive adoption of brightly colored, petroleum-derived aniline dyes (and pigments compounded from them), which all fade rapidly on exposure to light, and the efforts to properly conserve the twenty thousand [[J. M. W. Turner]] paintings inherited by the British Museum in 1857, led to an examination and negative reevaluation of the permanence of pigments in watercolor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} This caused a sharp decline in their status and market value. Nevertheless, isolated practitioners continued to prefer and develop the medium into the 20th century. Gorgeous landscape and maritime watercolors were done by [[Paul Signac]], and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] developed a watercolor painting style consisting entirely of overlapping small glazes of pure color.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nAmong the many 20th-century artists who produced important works in watercolor, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Egon Schiele]], and [[Raoul Dufy]] must be mentioned. In America, the major exponents included [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Charles Demuth]], and [[John Marin]] (80% of his total work is watercolor). In this period, American watercolor painting often imitated European Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, but significant individualism flourished in \"regional\" styles of watercolor painting from the 1920s to 1940s. In particular, the \"[[Cleveland School (arts community)|Cleveland School]]\" or \"Ohio School\" of painters centered around the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], and the [[California Scene Painting|California Scene]] painters were often associated with Hollywood animation studios or the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (now [[California Institute of the Arts]]). The California painters exploited their state's varied geography, Mediterranean climate, and \"[[Car culture|automobility]]\" to reinvigorate the outdoor or \"plein air\" tradition. The most influential among them were [[Phil Dike]], [[Millard Sheets]], [[Rex Brandt]], [[Dong Kingman]], and [[Milford Zornes]]. The California Water Color Society, founded in 1921 and later renamed the National Watercolor Society, sponsored important exhibitions of their work. The largest watercolor in the world at the moment is ''Building 6 Portrait: Interior.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/story-behind-worlds-largest-known-watercolor-painting-180963798/|title=The Story Behind the World\u2019s Largest Watercolor Painting|last=Nalewicki|first=Jennifer|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en}}</ref> Produced by American artist Barbara Ernst Prey on commission for MASS MoCA,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/8x4w54/mass-moca-worlds-largest-watercolor|title=The World's Largest Watercolor Goes on Display at MASS MoCA|date=2017-05-30|work=Creators|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-us}}</ref> the work can be seen at MASS MoCA's Robert W.

In Spain, [[Cefer\u00ed Oliv\u00e9]] created an innovative style followed by his students, such as [[Rafael Alonso L\u00f3pez-Montero]] and [[Francesc Torn\u00e9 Gavald\u00e0]]. In [[Mexico]], the major exponents are [[Ignacio Barrios]], [[Edgardo Coghlan]], [[\u00c1ngel Mauro]], [[Vicente Mendiola]], and [[Pastor Vel\u00e1zquez]]. In the [[Canary Islands]], where this pictorial technique has many followers, there are stand-out artists such as Francisco Bonn\u00edn Guer\u00edn, [[Jos\u00e9 Comas Quesada]], and Alberto Manrique.\n\n==Watercolor paint==\n[[File:Watercolours.jpg|thumb|A set of watercolors]]\n\nWatercolor paint consists of four principal ingredients: a [[pigment]]; [[gum arabic]] as a binder to hold the pigment in suspension; additives like [[glycerin]], [[ox gall]], [[honey]], and preservatives to alter the viscosity, hiding, durability or color of the pigment and vehicle mixture; and evaporating water, as a solvent used to thin or dilute the paint for application.\n\nThe more general term ''[[watermedia]]'' refers to any painting medium that uses water as a solvent and that can be applied with a [[brush]], [[pen]], or sprayer. This includes most [[ink]]s, [[watercolor]]s, [[tempera]]s, [[casein paint|casein]]s, [[gouache]]s, and modern [[acrylic paint]]s.\n\nThe term \"watercolor\" refers to paints that use water-soluble, complex carbohydrates as a binder. Originally (in the 16th to 18th centuries), watercolor binders were sugars and/or hide glues, but since the 19th century, the preferred binder is natural [[gum arabic]], with [[glycerin]] and/or [[honey]] as additives to improve plasticity and solubility of the binder, and with other chemicals added to improve product shelf life.\n\nThe term \"[[bodycolor]]\" refers to paint that is opaque rather than transparent. It usually refers to opaque watercolor, known as [[gouache]].<ref>The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists, Ian Chilvers, Oxford University Press USA, 2009</ref> Modern acrylic paints use an [[acrylic resin]] dispersion as a binder.\n\n===Commercial watercolors===\nWatercolor painters before the turn of the 18th century had to make paints themselves using pigments purchased from an [[apothecary]] or specialized \"colorman\", and mixing them with gum arabic or some other binder. The earliest commercial paints were small, resinous blocks that had to be wetted and laboriously \"rubbed out\" in water to obtain a usable color intensity. [[William Reeves (colourman)|William Reeves]] started his business as a colorman around 1766. In 1781, he and his brother, Thomas Reeves, were awarded the Silver Palette of the [[Society of Arts]], for the invention of the moist watercolor ''paint-cake'', a time-saving convenience, introduced in the \"golden age\" of English watercolor painting. The \"cake\" was immediately soluble when touched by a wet brush.\n[[File:Watercolors by William Reeves, London, inventor of watercolors in cakes, undated - Joseph Allen Skinner Museum - DSC07847.JPG|left|thumb|upright|A Reeves box]]\nModern commercial watercolor paints are available in two forms: tubes or pans. The majority of paints sold today are in collapsible small metal tubes in standard sizes and formulated to a consistency similar to toothpaste by being already mixed with a certain water component. For use, this paste has to be further diluted with water. Pan paints (actually small dried cakes or bars of paint in an open plastic container) are usually sold in two sizes, full pans and half pans.\n\nOwing to modern [[Industrial technology|industrial]] [[organic chemistry]], the variety, [[colorfulness|saturation]], and permanence of artists' colors available today has been vastly improved. Correct and non-toxic [[primary colors]] are now present through the introduction of [[hansa yellow]], [[phthalo blue]] and [[quinacridone]] (PV 122). From such a set of three colors, in principle all others can be mixed, as in a classical technique no white is used. The modern development of pigments was not driven by artistic demand. The [[art materials]] industry is too small to exert any market leverage on global dye or pigment manufacture. With rare exceptions such as aureolin, all modern watercolor paints utilize pigments that have a wider industrial use. Paint manufacturers buy, by industrial standards very small, supplies of these pigments, [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] them with the vehicle, solvent, and additives, and package them. The milling process with inorganic pigments, in more expensive brands, reduces the particle size to improve the color flow when the paint is applied with water.\n\n===Transparency===\nIn the partisan debates of the 19th-century English art world, gouache was emphatically contrasted to traditional watercolors and denigrated for its high hiding power or lack of \"transparency\"; \"transparent\" watercolors were exalted. The aversion to opaque paint had its origin in the fact that well into the 19th century [[lead white]] was used to increase the covering quality. That pigment tended to soon discolor into black under the influence of sulphurous air pollution, totally ruining the artwork.<ref>D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) ''Het kunstschilderboek \u2014 handboek voor materialen en technieken'', Cantecleer, p. 187</ref> The traditional claim that \"transparent\" watercolors gain \"luminosity\" because they function like a pane of stained glass laid on paper\u2014the color intensified because the light passes through the pigment, reflects from the paper, and passes a second time through the pigment on its way to the viewer\u2014is false. Watercolor paints typically do not form a cohesive paint layer, as do acrylic or [[oil paint|oil]] paints, but simply scatter pigment particles randomly across the [[paper]] surface; the transparency is caused by the paper being visible between the particles.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\">D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) ''Het kunstschilderboek \u2014 handboek voor materialen en technieken'', Cantecleer, p. 183</ref> Watercolors may appear more vivid than acrylics or oils because the pigments are laid down in a purer form, with few or no fillers (such as kaolin) obscuring the pigment colors. Typically, most or all of the gum binder will be absorbed by the paper, preventing the binder from changing the visibility of the pigment.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/> The absorption of the gum increases the adhesion of the pigment to the paper, and the pigment particles will penetrate the fibres more easily. In fact, an important function of the gum is to facilitate the \"lifting\" (removal) of color, should the artist want to create a lighter spot in a painted area.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/> Furthermore, the gum prevents  [[flocculation]] of the pigment particles.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ink wash painting]]\n* [[Acrylic paint]]\n* [[Acrylic painting techniques]]\n* [[History of painting]]\n* [[Gouache]]\n* [[Oil paint]]\n* [[:Category:Watercolorists]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===History===\n* Andrew Wilton & Anne Lyles.

Since [[biomass]] technically can be used as a fuel directly (e.g. wood logs), some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably. More often than not however, the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of, or some form of thermally/chemically altered ''solid'' end product, like torrefied pellets or briquettes. The word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels, used for transportation. The EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) follow this naming practice.<ref>The IEA states: \"Biofuels are transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel that are made from biomass materials.\" https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=biofuel_home</ref> If the [[biomass]] used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly, the fuel is generally considered to be a form of [[renewable energy]]. \n[[File:Biofuel - The Noun Project.svg|thumb|Biofuel logo]]\nBiofuels can be produced from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes (if the waste has a biological origin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]].\n\nSome argue that biofuel can be [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because all biomass crops [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]] carbon to a certain extent \u2013 basically all crops move CO<sub>2</sub> from above-ground circulation to below-ground storage in the roots and the surrounding soil.

Basically, the higher the yield, the more land is usable as a GHG mitigation tool (including relatively carbon rich land.)|alt=]]\nHowever, the simple proposal that biofuel is [[carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] almost by definition has been superseded by the more nuanced proposal that for a particular biofuel project to be carbon neutral, the total carbon sequestered by the energy crop's root system must compensate for all the above-ground emissions (related to this particular biofuel project). This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect [[ILUC|land use change]]. Many first generation biofuel projects are not carbon neutral given these demands. Some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives.<ref>\u00abThe environmental costs and benefits of bioenergy have been the subject of significant debate, particularly for first\u2010generation biofuels produced from food (e.g. grain and oil seed). Studies have reported life\u2010cycle GHG savings ranging from an 86% reduction to a 93% increase in GHG emissions compared with fossil fuels (Searchinger et\u00a0al., 2008; Davis et\u00a0al., 2009; Liska et\u00a0al., 2009; Whitaker et\u00a0al., 2010). In addition, concerns have been raised that N2O emissions from biofuel feedstock cultivation could have been underestimated (Crutzen et\u00a0al., 2008; Smith & Searchinger, 2012) and that expansion of feedstock cultivation on agricultural land might displace food production onto land with high carbon stocks or high conservation value (i.e. iLUC) creating a carbon debt which could take decades to repay (Fargione et\u00a0al., 2008). Other studies have shown that direct nitrogen\u2010related emissions from annual crop feedstocks can be mitigated through optimized management practices (Davis et\u00a0al., 2013) or that payback times are less significant than proposed (Mello et\u00a0al., 2014). However, there are still significant concerns over the impacts of iLUC, despite policy developments aimed at reducing the risk of iLUC occurring (Ahlgren & Di Lucia, 2014; Del Grosso et\u00a0al., 2014).\u00bb\nWhitaker, J. , Field, J.

This is controversial, as the allocation of GHG emissions to the management and the use of coproducts can have a large effect on the total carbon footprint of resulting bioenergy products (Whitaker et\u00a0al., 2010; Davis et\u00a0al., 2013). The potential consequences of land use change (LUC) to bioenergy on GHG balance through food crop displacement or \u2018indirect\u2019 land use change (iLUC) are also an important consideration (Searchinger et\u00a0al., 2008).\u00bb\nMilner, S. , Holland, R.

More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)</ref><ref>\u00abWhile the initial premise regarding bioenergy was that carbon recently captured from the atmosphere into plants would deliver an immediate reduction in GHG emission from fossil fuel use, the reality proved less straightforward. Studies suggested that GHG emission from energy crop production and land-use change might outweigh any CO2 mitigation (Searchinger et al., 2008; Lange, 2011). Nitrous oxide (N2O) production, with its powerful global warming potential (GWP), could be a significant factor in offsetting CO2 gains (Crutzen et al., 2008) as well as possible acidification and eutrophication of the surrounding environment (Kim & Dale, 2005). However, not all biomass feedstocks are equal, and most studies critical of bioenergy production are concerned with biofuels produced from annual food crops at high fertilizer cost, sometimes using land cleared from natural ecosystems or in direct competition with food production (Naik et al., 2010). Dedicated perennial energy crops, produced on existing, lower grade, agricultural land, offer a sustainable alternative with significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration when produced with appropriate management (Crutzen et al., 2008; Hastings et al., 2008, 2012; Cherubini et al., 2009; Don- dini et al., 2009a; Don et al., 2012; Zatta et al., 2014; Rich- ter et al., 2015).\u00bb\nMcCalmont, J.

More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)</ref>\n\nSome are carbon neutral or even negative, though, especially perennial crops. The amount of carbon sequestrated and the amount of GHG (greenhouse gases) emitted will determine if the total GHG life cycle cost of a biofuel project is positive, neutral or negative. A carbon negative life cycle is possible if the total below-ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for the total life-cycle GHG emissions above ground. In other words, to achieve carbon neutrality yields should be high and emissions should be low.\n\nHigh-yielding energy crops are thus prime candidates for carbon neutrality. The graphic on the right displays two CO<sub>2</sub> negative [[Miscanthus giganteus|Miscanthus x giganteus]] production pathways, represented in gram CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents per megajoule. The yellow diamonds represent mean values.\n<ref>\u00abA life\u2010cycle perspective of the relative contributions and variability of soil carbon stock change and nitrogen\u2010related emissions to the net GHG intensity (g CO2\u2010eq\u00a0MJ\u22121) [gram CO2-equivalents per megajoule] of biofuel production via select production pathways (feedstock/prior land\u2010use/fertilizer/conversion type). Positive and negative contributions to life\u2010cycle GHG emissions are plotted sequentially and summed as the net GHG intensity for each biofuel scenario, relative to the GHG intensity of conventional gasoline (brown line) and the 50% and 60% GHG savings thresholds (US Renewable Fuel Standard and Council Directive 2015/1513); orange and red lines, respectively.

The varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact. \n<ref>\u00abWhilst these values represent the extremes, they demonstrate that site selection for bioenergy crop cultivation can make the difference between large GHG savings or losses, shifting life\u2010cycle GHG [green house gas] emissions above or below mandated thresholds. Reducing uncertainties in \u2206C [carbon increase or decrease] following LUC [land use change] is therefore more important than refining N2O [nitrous oxide] emission estimates (Berhongaray et\u00a0al., 2017). Knowledge on initial soil carbon stocks could improve GHG savings achieved through targeted deployment of perennial bioenergy crops on low carbon soils (see section 2). [\u2026] The assumption that annual cropland provides greater potential for soil carbon sequestration than grassland appears to be over\u2010simplistic, but there is an opportunity to improve predictions of soil carbon sequestration potential using information on the initial soil carbon stock as a stronger predictor of \u2206C [change in carbon amount] than prior land use.\u00bb\nWhitaker, J. , Field, J.

Soils already rich in carbon includes [[Mire|peatland]] and mature forest. [[Grassland]] can also be carbon rich, however Milner et al. argues that the most successful carbon sequestration in the UK takes place below improved grasslands. \n<ref>\u00abFig.\u00a03 confirmed either no change or a gain of SOC [soil organic carbon] (positive) through planting Miscanthus on arable land across England and Wales and only a loss of SOC (negative) in parts of Scotland. The total annual SOC change across GB in the transition from arable to Miscanthus if all nonconstrained land was planted with would be 3.3 Tg C yr\u22121 [3.3 million tonnes carbon per year]. The mean changes for SOC for the different land uses were all positive when histosols were excluded, with improved grasslands yielding the highest Mg C ha\u22121\u00a0yr\u22121 [tonnes carbon per hectare per year] at 1.49, followed by arable lands at 1.28 and forest at 1. Separating this SOC change by original land use (Fig.\u00a04) reveals that there are large regions of improved grasslands which, if planted with bioenergy crops, are predicted to result in an increase in SOC. A similar result was found when considering the transition from arable land; however for central eastern England, there was a predicted neutral effect on SOC. Scotland, however, is predicted to have a decrease for all land uses, particularly for woodland due mainly to higher SOC and lower Miscanthus yields and hence less input.\u00bb\nMilner, S. , Holland, R.

The higher the yield, the more likely CO<sub>2</sub> negativity becomes.\n\nThe two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel.\n\n[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]].\n\n[[Biodiesel]] is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. It can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles.\n\nIn 2018, worldwide biofuel production reached 152 billion liters (40 billion gallons US), up 7% from 2017,<ref name=\"Transport biofuels\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/tcep/transport/biofuels/|title=Transport biofuels|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and biofuels provided 3% of the world's fuels for road transport. The [[International Energy Agency]] want biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050, in order to reduce dependency on petroleum.<ref name=\"Transport biofuels\"/> However, the production and consumption of biofuels are not on track to meet the IEA's sustainable development scenario. From 2020 to 2030 global biofuel output has to increase by 10% each year to reach IEA's goal.

The resulting gas mixture, syngas, is more efficient than direct combustion of the original biofuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted.\n\nSyngas may be burned directly in internal combustion engines, [[turbines]] or high-temperature fuel cells.<ref name=\"e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch\">[http://e-collection.ethbib.ethz.ch/view/eth:41553 Electricity from wood through the combination of gasification and solid oxide fuel cells], Ph.D. Thesis by Florian Nagel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, 2008</ref> The [[wood gas generator]], a wood-fueled gasification reactor, can be connected to an internal combustion engine.\n\nSyngas can be used to produce [[methanol]], [[Dimethyl ether|DME]] and [[hydrogen]], or converted via the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] to produce a diesel substitute, or a mixture of alcohols that can be blended into gasoline.

[[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.\n\n[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory<ref>[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | L\u00e4r dig mer om energi - E.ON<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \u2013 where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.\n\nEthanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.\n\nEthanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]]. As they do not require a chimney and are \"flueless\", bioethanol fires<ref>Bio ethanol fires information [http://www.prestigiousfires.co.uk/ bio ethanol fireplace]. (2009)</ref> are extremely useful for newly built homes and apartments without a flue.\nThe downsides to these fireplaces is that their heat output is slightly less than electric heat or gas fires, and precautions must be taken to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nCorn-to-ethanol and other food stocks has led to the development of [[cellulosic ethanol]]. According to a joint research agenda conducted through the US Department of Energy,<ref>see \"Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol\"</ref> the fossil energy ratios ([[Fossil Energy Ratio|FER]]) for cellulosic ethanol, corn ethanol, and gasoline are 10.3, 1.36, and 0.81, respectively.<ref>Brinkman, N. et al., \"Well-to-Wheels Analysis of Advanced/Vehicle Systems\", 2005.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Farrell | first1 = A.E. |display-authors=et al | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol can Contribute to Energy and Environmental Goals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5760| pages = 506\u20138 | doi=10.1126/science.1121416 | pmid=16439656}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hammerschlag | first1 = R | year = 2006 | title = Ethanol's Energy Return on Investment: A Survey of the Literature 1999-Present | url = | journal = Environ.

It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]].

It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.<ref>[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]</ref>\n\nIn some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100<!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) -->. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.\n\nElectronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.\nSince biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714031730/http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk/ |archive-date=14 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel.

Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.\n\nAs with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&W Diesel]], [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.\n\nVegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-\"Pumpe Duse\" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]].

These are discussed within three major sections of the full report and include:\n\n* oleochemical processes, such as the hydroprocessing of lipid feedstocks obtained from oilseed crops, algae or tallow; \n* thermochemical processes, such as the thermochemical conversion of biomass to fluid intermediates (gas or oil) followed by catalytic upgrading and hydroprocessing to hydrocarbon fuels; and \n* biochemical processes, such as the biological conversion of biomass (sugars, starches or lignocellulose-derived feedstocks) to longer chain alcohols and hydrocarbons.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Karatzos |first1=Sergios |last2=McMillan |first2=James D. |last3=Saddler |first3=Jack N. |date=July 2014 |title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels |url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |url-status=live |publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39 |page=3 |isbn=978-1-910154-07-6 |id=Report T39-T1 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA fourth category is also briefly described that includes \"hybrid\" thermochemical/biochemical technologies such as fermentation of synthesis gas and catalytic reforming of sugars/carbohydrates.\n\nThe report concludes by stating:\n\n<blockquote>Tremendous entrepreneurial activity to develop and commercialize drop-in biofuels from aquatic and terrestrial feedstocks has taken place over the past several years. However, despite these efforts, drop-in biofuels represent only a small percentage (around 2%) of global biofuel markets. ... Due to the increased processing and resource requirements (e.g., hydrogen and catalysts) needed to make drop-in biofuels as compared to conventional biofuels, large scale production of cost-competitive drop-in biofuels is not expected to occur in the near to midterm. Rather, dedicated policies to promote development and commercialization of these fuels will be needed before they become significant contributors to global biofuels production. Currently, no policies (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies etc.) differentiate new, more fungible and infrastructure ready drop-in type biofuels from less infrastructure compatible oxygenated biofuels. ...  Thus, while tremendous technical progress has been made in developing and improving the various routes to drop-in fuels, supportive policies directed specifically towards the further development of drop-in biofuels are likely to be needed to ensure their future commercial success.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Karatzos |first1=Sergios |last2=McMillan |first2=James D. |last3=Saddler |first3=Jack N. |date=July 2014 |title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels |url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |url-status=live |publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39 |pages=177, 182 |isbn=978-1-910154-07-6 |id=Report T39-T1 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== By region==\n{{Main|Biofuels by region}}\n{{See also|Biodiesel by region}}\n[[File:Bio Diesel Powered Fast Attack Craft Of Indian Navy.jpg|alt=|thumb|Bio Diesel Powered Fast Attack Craft Of [[Indian Navy]] patrolling during [[International Fleet Review 2016|IFR 2016]].

Since [[biomass]] technically can be used as a fuel directly (e.g. wood logs), some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably. More often than not however, the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is made of, or some form of thermally/chemically altered ''solid'' end product, like torrefied pellets or briquettes. The word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels, used for transportation. The EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) follow this naming practice.<ref>The IEA states: \"Biofuels are transportation fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel that are made from biomass materials.\" https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.php?page=biofuel_home</ref> If the [[biomass]] used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly, the fuel is generally considered to be a form of [[renewable energy]]. \n[[File:Biofuel - The Noun Project.svg|thumb|Biofuel logo]]\nBiofuels can be produced from plants (i.e. [[energy crop]]s), or from agricultural, commercial, domestic, and/or industrial wastes (if the waste has a biological origin).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/biofuel.html|title=What is biofuel? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary [[carbon fixation]], such as those that occur in [[plants]] or [[microalgae]] through the process of [[photosynthesis]].\n\nSome argue that biofuel can be [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon-neutral]] because all biomass crops [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]] carbon to a certain extent \u2013 basically all crops move CO<sub>2</sub> from above-ground circulation to below-ground storage in the roots and the surrounding soil.

This includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect [[ILUC|land use change]]. Many first generation biofuel projects are not carbon neutral given these demands. Some have even higher total GHG emissions than some fossil based alternatives.<ref>\u00abThe environmental costs and benefits of bioenergy have been the subject of significant debate, particularly for first\u2010generation biofuels produced from food (e.g. grain and oil seed). Studies have reported life\u2010cycle GHG savings ranging from an 86% reduction to a 93% increase in GHG emissions compared with fossil fuels (Searchinger et\u00a0al., 2008; Davis et\u00a0al., 2009; Liska et\u00a0al., 2009; Whitaker et\u00a0al., 2010). In addition, concerns have been raised that N2O emissions from biofuel feedstock cultivation could have been underestimated (Crutzen et\u00a0al., 2008; Smith & Searchinger, 2012) and that expansion of feedstock cultivation on agricultural land might displace food production onto land with high carbon stocks or high conservation value (i.e. iLUC) creating a carbon debt which could take decades to repay (Fargione et\u00a0al., 2008). Other studies have shown that direct nitrogen\u2010related emissions from annual crop feedstocks can be mitigated through optimized management practices (Davis et\u00a0al., 2013) or that payback times are less significant than proposed (Mello et\u00a0al., 2014). However, there are still significant concerns over the impacts of iLUC, despite policy developments aimed at reducing the risk of iLUC occurring (Ahlgren & Di Lucia, 2014; Del Grosso et\u00a0al., 2014).\u00bb\nWhitaker, J. , Field, J.

This is controversial, as the allocation of GHG emissions to the management and the use of coproducts can have a large effect on the total carbon footprint of resulting bioenergy products (Whitaker et\u00a0al., 2010; Davis et\u00a0al., 2013). The potential consequences of land use change (LUC) to bioenergy on GHG balance through food crop displacement or \u2018indirect\u2019 land use change (iLUC) are also an important consideration (Searchinger et\u00a0al., 2008).\u00bb\nMilner, S. , Holland, R.

Studies suggested that GHG emission from energy crop production and land-use change might outweigh any CO2 mitigation (Searchinger et al., 2008; Lange, 2011). Nitrous oxide (N2O) production, with its powerful global warming potential (GWP), could be a significant factor in offsetting CO2 gains (Crutzen et al., 2008) as well as possible acidification and eutrophication of the surrounding environment (Kim & Dale, 2005). However, not all biomass feedstocks are equal, and most studies critical of bioenergy production are concerned with biofuels produced from annual food crops at high fertilizer cost, sometimes using land cleared from natural ecosystems or in direct competition with food production (Naik et al., 2010). Dedicated perennial energy crops, produced on existing, lower grade, agricultural land, offer a sustainable alternative with significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions and soil carbon sequestration when produced with appropriate management (Crutzen et al., 2008; Hastings et al., 2008, 2012; Cherubini et al., 2009; Don- dini et al., 2009a; Don et al., 2012; Zatta et al., 2014; Rich- ter et al., 2015).\u00bb\nMcCalmont, J.

The amount of carbon sequestrated and the amount of GHG (greenhouse gases) emitted will determine if the total GHG life cycle cost of a biofuel project is positive, neutral or negative. A carbon negative life cycle is possible if the total below-ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for the total life-cycle GHG emissions above ground. In other words, to achieve carbon neutrality yields should be high and emissions should be low.\n\nHigh-yielding energy crops are thus prime candidates for carbon neutrality.

The varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact. \n<ref>\u00abWhilst these values represent the extremes, they demonstrate that site selection for bioenergy crop cultivation can make the difference between large GHG savings or losses, shifting life\u2010cycle GHG [green house gas] emissions above or below mandated thresholds. Reducing uncertainties in \u2206C [carbon increase or decrease] following LUC [land use change] is therefore more important than refining N2O [nitrous oxide] emission estimates (Berhongaray et\u00a0al., 2017). Knowledge on initial soil carbon stocks could improve GHG savings achieved through targeted deployment of perennial bioenergy crops on low carbon soils (see section 2). [\u2026] The assumption that annual cropland provides greater potential for soil carbon sequestration than grassland appears to be over\u2010simplistic, but there is an opportunity to improve predictions of soil carbon sequestration potential using information on the initial soil carbon stock as a stronger predictor of \u2206C [change in carbon amount] than prior land use.\u00bb\nWhitaker, J. , Field, J.

Soils already rich in carbon includes [[Mire|peatland]] and mature forest. [[Grassland]] can also be carbon rich, however Milner et al. argues that the most successful carbon sequestration in the UK takes place below improved grasslands. \n<ref>\u00abFig.\u00a03 confirmed either no change or a gain of SOC [soil organic carbon] (positive) through planting Miscanthus on arable land across England and Wales and only a loss of SOC (negative) in parts of Scotland. The total annual SOC change across GB in the transition from arable to Miscanthus if all nonconstrained land was planted with would be 3.3 Tg C yr\u22121 [3.3 million tonnes carbon per year]. The mean changes for SOC for the different land uses were all positive when histosols were excluded, with improved grasslands yielding the highest Mg C ha\u22121\u00a0yr\u22121 [tonnes carbon per hectare per year] at 1.49, followed by arable lands at 1.28 and forest at 1. Separating this SOC change by original land use (Fig.\u00a04) reveals that there are large regions of improved grasslands which, if planted with bioenergy crops, are predicted to result in an increase in SOC. A similar result was found when considering the transition from arable land; however for central eastern England, there was a predicted neutral effect on SOC. Scotland, however, is predicted to have a decrease for all land uses, particularly for woodland due mainly to higher SOC and lower Miscanthus yields and hence less input.\u00bb\nMilner, S. , Holland, R.

The higher the yield, the more likely CO<sub>2</sub> negativity becomes.\n\nThe two most common types of biofuel are bioethanol and biodiesel.\n\n[[Ethanol#Fuel|Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]], [[sugarcane]], or [[sweet sorghum]]. [[Cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form (E100), but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|United States]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]].\n\n[[Biodiesel]] is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. It can be used as a [[fuel]] for vehicles in its pure form (B100), but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles.\n\nIn 2018, worldwide biofuel production reached 152 billion liters (40 billion gallons US), up 7% from 2017,<ref name=\"Transport biofuels\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/tcep/transport/biofuels/|title=Transport biofuels|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and biofuels provided 3% of the world's fuels for road transport.

[[Biobutanol]] (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a direct replacement for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.\n\n[[Ethanol fuel]] is the most common biofuel worldwide, particularly [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|in Brazil]]. [[Alcohol fuel]]s are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from [[wheat]], [[Maize|corn]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sugar cane]], [[molasses]] and any sugar or starch from which [[alcoholic beverage]]s such as [[whiskey]], can be made (such as [[potato]] and [[fruit]] waste, etc.). The ethanol production methods used are [[digestive enzyme|enzyme digestion]] (to release sugars from stored starches), fermentation of the sugars, [[distillation]] and drying. The distillation process requires significant energy input for heat (sometimes unsustainable [[natural gas]] fossil fuel, but cellulosic biomass such as [[bagasse]], the waste left after sugar cane is pressed to extract its juice, is the most common fuel in Brazil, while pellets, wood chips and also [[waste heat]] are more common in Europe) Waste steam fuels ethanol factory<ref>[http://www.eon.se/om-eon/Om-energi/Produktion-av-el-gas-varme-och-kyla/Kraftvarme/Vara-kraftvarmeverk/Handeloverket/Handeloverket-Panna-15/Energikombinatet_bild/ Energikunskap | L\u00e4r dig mer om energi - E.ON<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \u2013 where waste heat from the factories also is used in the district heating grid.\n\nEthanol can be used in petrol engines as a replacement for gasoline; it can be mixed with gasoline to any percentage. Most existing car petrol engines can run on blends of up to 15% bioethanol with petroleum/gasoline. Ethanol has a smaller [[energy density]] than that of gasoline; this means it takes more fuel (volume and mass) to produce the same amount of work. An advantage of ethanol ({{chem|CH|3|CH|2|OH}}) is that it has a higher [[octane rating]] than ethanol-free gasoline available at roadside gas stations, which allows an increase of an engine's [[compression ratio]] for increased [[thermal efficiency]]. In high-altitude (thin air) locations, some states mandate a mix of gasoline and ethanol as a winter [[oxidizer]] to reduce atmospheric pollution emissions.\n\nEthanol is also used to fuel bioethanol [[fireplaces]].

It is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is a liquid similar in composition to fossil/mineral diesel. Chemically, it consists mostly of fatty acid methyl (or ethyl) esters ([[Fatty acid methyl ester|FAMEs]]). Feedstocks for biodiesel include animal fats, vegetable oils, [[soy]], [[rapeseed]], [[Jatropha curcas|jatropha]], [[Madhuca longifolia|mahua]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], [[flax]], [[sunflower]], [[palm oil]], [[hemp]], [[thlaspi arvense|field pennycress]], ''[[Pongamia pinnata]]'' and [[algae fuel|algae]]. Pure biodiesel (B100, also known as \"neat\" biodiesel) currently reduces emissions with up to 60% compared to diesel Second generation B100.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ |title=Perstop Press release: Verdis Polaris Aura \u2013 second generation B100 \u2013 The advanced green one |access-date=21 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804182248/https://www.perstorp.com/en/Media/Pressreleases/2013/20130701_Verdis_Polaris_Aura_second_generation_B100/ |archive-date=4 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Targray Biodiesel Railcar.png|thumb|Targray Biofuels Division railcar transporting Biodiesel.]]Biodiesel can be used in any [[diesel engine]] when mixed with mineral diesel. It can also be used in its pure form (B100) in diesel engines, but some maintenance and performance problems may then occur during wintertime utilization, since the fuel becomes somewhat more [[viscosity|viscous]] at lower temperatures, depending on the feedstock used.<ref>[http://www.inforse.org/europe/dieret/altfuels/biodiesel.htm BIODIESEL]</ref>\n\nIn some countries, manufacturers cover their diesel engines under warranty for B100 use, although [[Volkswagen]] of [[Germany]], for example, asks drivers to check by telephone with the VW environmental services department before switching to B100<!-- (see [[Biodiesel#Use|biodiesel use]]) -->. In most cases, biodiesel is compatible with diesel engines from 1994 onwards, which use '[[Viton]]' (by [[DuPont]]) [[synthetic rubber]] in their mechanical [[fuel injection]] systems. Note however, that no vehicles are certified for using pure biodiesel before 2014, as there was no emission control protocol available for biodiesel before this date.\n\nElectronically controlled '[[common rail]]' and '[[Unit Injector|unit injector]]' type systems from the late 1990s onwards may only use biodiesel blended with conventional diesel fuel. These engines have finely metered and atomized multiple-stage injection systems that are very sensitive to the viscosity of the fuel. Many current-generation diesel engines are made so that they can run on B100 without altering the engine itself, although this depends on the [[fuel rail]] design.\nSince biodiesel is an effective [[solvent]] and cleans residues deposited by mineral diesel, [[oil filter|engine filters]] may need to be replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine [[combustion chamber]] of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiesel.de/ |title=ADM Biodiesel: Hamburg, Leer, Mainz |publisher=Biodiesel.de |accessdate=2010-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=RRI Limited for Biodiesel Filling Stations |url=http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |title=Welcome to Biodiesel Filling Stations |publisher=Biodieselfillingstations.co.uk |accessdate=2010-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714031730/http://www.biodieselfillingstations.co.uk/ |archive-date=14 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Biodiesel is also an [[oxygenated diesel|oxygenated fuel]], meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel.

Used vegetable oil is increasingly being processed into biodiesel, or (more rarely) cleaned of water and particulates and then used as a fuel.\n\nAs with 100% biodiesel (B100), to ensure the [[fuel injector]]s atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, [[vegetable oil fuel]] must be heated to reduce its [[viscosity]] to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. [[MAN B&W Diesel]], [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]], and [[Deutz AG]], as well as a number of smaller companies, such as [[Elsbett]], offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.\n\nVegetable oil can also be used in many older diesel engines that do not use [[common rail]] or [[Unit Injector|unit injection]] electronic diesel injection systems. Due to the design of the combustion chambers in [[indirect injection]] engines, these are the best engines for use with vegetable oil. This system allows the relatively larger oil molecules more time to burn. Some older engines, especially Mercedes, are driven experimentally by enthusiasts without any conversion, a handful of drivers have experienced limited success with earlier pre-\"Pumpe Duse\" [[VW TDI]] engines and other similar engines with [[Direct fuel injection|direct injection]]. Several companies, such as [[Elsbett]] or Wolf, have developed professional conversion kits and successfully installed hundreds of them over the last decades.\n\nOils and fats can be [[hydrogenation|hydrogenated]] to give a diesel substitute. The resulting product is a straight-chain hydrocarbon with a high [[cetane number]], low in [[aromatics]] and [[sulfur]] and does not contain oxygen. [[Hydrogenated oil]]s can be blended with diesel in all proportions. They have several advantages over biodiesel, including good performance at low temperatures, no storage stability problems and no susceptibility to microbial attack.<ref name=evans>Evans, G.

Due to the increased processing and resource requirements (e.g., hydrogen and catalysts) needed to make drop-in biofuels as compared to conventional biofuels, large scale production of cost-competitive drop-in biofuels is not expected to occur in the near to midterm. Rather, dedicated policies to promote development and commercialization of these fuels will be needed before they become significant contributors to global biofuels production. Currently, no policies (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies etc.) differentiate new, more fungible and infrastructure ready drop-in type biofuels from less infrastructure compatible oxygenated biofuels. ...  Thus, while tremendous technical progress has been made in developing and improving the various routes to drop-in fuels, supportive policies directed specifically towards the further development of drop-in biofuels are likely to be needed to ensure their future commercial success.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Karatzos |first1=Sergios |last2=McMillan |first2=James D. |last3=Saddler |first3=Jack N. |date=July 2014 |title=The Potential and Challenges of Drop-in Biofuels |url=http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112021600/http://task39.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/01/Task-39-Drop-in-Biofuels-Report-FINAL-2-Oct-2014-ecopy.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2017 |url-status=live |publisher=IEA Bioenergy Task 39 |pages=177, 182 |isbn=978-1-910154-07-6 |id=Report T39-T1 |access-date=October 9, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== By region==\n{{Main|Biofuels by region}}\n{{See also|Biodiesel by region}}\n[[File:Bio Diesel Powered Fast Attack Craft Of Indian Navy.jpg|alt=|thumb|Bio Diesel Powered Fast Attack Craft Of [[Indian Navy]] patrolling during [[International Fleet Review 2016|IFR 2016]].

Eggs are laid on the water surface; they hatch into motile larvae that feed on aquatic [[algae]] and [[wikt:organic|organic]] material. The adult females of most species have tube-like mouthparts (called a [[proboscis]]) that can pierce the skin of a [[Host (biology)|host]] and [[Hematophagy|feed on blood]], which contains [[protein]] and [[iron]] needed to produce [[egg]]s. Thousands of mosquito [[species]] feed on the blood of various hosts\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a[[vertebrate]]s, including [[mammals]], [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, and some [[fish]]; along with some [[invertebrate]]s, primarily other [[arthropod]]s. This loss of blood is seldom of any importance to the host.\n\nThe mosquito's [[saliva]] is transferred to the host during the bite, and can cause an itchy [[rash]]. In addition, many species can ingest [[pathogen]]s while biting, and transmit them to future hosts. In this way, mosquitoes are important [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s of diseases such as [[malaria]], [[yellow fever]], [[Chikungunya]], [[West Nile virus|West Nile]], [[dengue fever]], [[filariasis]], [[Zika virus|Zika]] and other [[arboviruses]].

Their wings are long and narrow, same with their long, thin legs. They have slender and dainty bodies of length typically from 3 mm to 6 mm, with a color of dark grey to black, some species have specific patterns. When at rest, they tend to hold their first pair of legs outward. They look similar to midge flies (''[[Chironomidae]]''), another ancient family of flies. ''[[Tokunagayusurika akamusi]],'' for example, is a midge fly that look very much alike mosquitoes in that they also have slender and dainty bodies of similar colors, though larger in size. They also have only one pair of wings, but without scales on the surface. Another distinct feature to tell the two families of flies apart is the way they hold their first pair of legs - mosquitoes hold them outward, while midges hold them forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nature.mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/midges|title=Midges|website=MDC Discover Nature|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Wyeomyia smithii 1.jpg|right|thumb|Image of pitcher plant mosquito ''[[Wyeomyia smithii]]'', showing segmentation and partial anatomy of circulatory system]]\n\n===Overview===\nLike all flies, mosquitoes go through four stages in their life cycles: [[egg (biology)|egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]], and adult or [[imago]]. The first three stages\u2014egg, larva, and pupa\u2014are largely aquatic. Each of the stages typically lasts 5 to 14 days, depending on the species and the ambient temperature, but there are important exceptions.<ref>American Mosquito Control Association https://www.mosquito.org/page/faq</ref> Mosquitoes living in regions where some seasons are freezing or waterless spend part of the year in ''[[diapause]]''; they delay their development, typically for months, and carry on with life only when there is enough water or warmth for their needs. For instance, ''Wyeomyia'' larvae typically get frozen into solid lumps of ice during winter and only complete their development in spring. The eggs of some species of ''Aedes'' remain unharmed in diapause if they dry out, and hatch later when they are covered by water.\n\nEggs hatch to become [[larva]]e, which grow until they are able to change into [[pupa]]e. The adult mosquito emerges from the mature pupa as it floats at the water surface. Bloodsucking mosquitoes, depending on species, sex, and weather conditions, have potential adult lifespans ranging from as short as a week to as long as several months. Some species can overwinter as adults in diapause.<ref>Kosova, Jonida (2003) [http://digitalcommons.unf.edu/ojii_volumes/94 \"Longevity Studies of Sindbis Virus Infected Aedes Albopictus\"].

Michigan Department of Agriculture June 2002</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nIn most species, adult females lay their eggs in stagnant water: some lay near the water's edge while others attach their eggs to aquatic plants. Each species selects the situation of the water into which it lays its eggs and does so according to its own ecological adaptations. Some breed in lakes, some in temporary puddles. Some breed in marshes, some in salt-marshes. Among those that breed in salt water, some are equally at home in fresh and salt water up to about one-third the concentration of seawater, whereas others must acclimatize themselves to the salinity.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wigglesworth VB |year=1933|journal=J Exp Biol |volume=10|pages=27\u201336|title=The Adaptation of Mosquito Larvae to Salt Water|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/10/1/27|issue=1}}</ref> Such differences are important because certain ecological preferences keep mosquitoes away from most humans, whereas other preferences bring them right into houses at night.\n\nSome species of mosquitoes prefer to breed in [[phytotelma]]ta (natural reservoirs on plants), such as rainwater accumulated in holes in tree trunks, or in the leaf-axils of [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]]. Some specialize in the liquid in pitchers of particular species of [[pitcher plant]]s, their larvae feeding on decaying insects that had drowned there or on the associated bacteria; the genus ''Wyeomyia'' provides such examples \u2014 the harmless ''Wyeomyia smithii'' breeds only in the pitchers of ''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]''.<ref>Crans, Wayne J.; [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp27.htm ''Wyeomyia smithii'' (Coquillett)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605173233/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp27.htm |date=2013-06-05 }}. Rutgers University, Center for Vector Biology.</ref>\n\nHowever, some of the species of mosquitoes that are adapted to breeding in phytotelmata are dangerous disease vectors. In nature, they might occupy anything from a hollow tree trunk to a cupped leaf. Such species typically take readily to breeding in artificial water containers. Such casual puddles are important breeding places for some of the most serious disease vectors, such as species of ''[[Aedes]]'' that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Some with such breeding habits are disproportionately important vectors because they are well-placed to pick up [[pathogen]]s from humans and pass them on. In contrast, no matter how voracious, mosquitoes that breed and feed mainly in remote wetlands and salt marshes may well remain uninfected, and if they do happen to become infected with a relevant pathogen, might seldom encounter humans to infect, in turn.\n\n===Eggs and oviposition===\n[[File:Mosquito egg SEM.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning electron microscope|Electron micrograph]] of a mosquito egg]]\nMosquito habits of [[oviposition]], the ways in which they lay their eggs, vary considerably between species, and the [[Morphology (biology)|morphologies]] of the eggs vary accordingly. The simplest procedure is that followed by many species of ''[[Anopheles]]''; like many other [[Gracility|gracile]] species of aquatic insects, females just fly over the water, bobbing up and down to the water surface and dropping eggs more or less singly. The bobbing behavior occurs among some other aquatic insects as well, for example [[Mayfly|mayflies]] and [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]]; it is sometimes called \"[[dapping]]\". The eggs of ''Anopheles'' species are roughly cigar-shaped and have floats down their sides. Females of many common species can lay 100\u2013200 eggs during the course of the adult phase of their life cycles. Even with high egg and intergenerational mortality, over a period of several weeks, a single successful breeding pair can create a population of thousands.\n\n[[File:Gelege1.jpg|thumb|An egg raft of a ''Culex'' species, partly broken, showing individual egg shapes]]\n\nSome other species, for example members of the genus ''[[Mansonia]]'', lay their eggs in arrays, attached usually to the under-surfaces of waterlily pads. Their close relatives, the genus ''Coquillettidia'', lay their eggs similarly, but not attached to plants. Instead, the eggs form layers called \"rafts\" that float on the water. This is a common mode of oviposition, and most species of ''Culex'' are known for the habit, which also occurs in some other genera, such as ''[[Culiseta]]'' and ''[[Uranotaenia]]''. ''Anopheles'' eggs may on occasion cluster together on the water, too, but the clusters do not generally look much like compactly glued rafts of eggs.\n\nIn species that lay their eggs in rafts, rafts do not form adventitiously; the female ''Culex'' settles carefully on still water with its hind legs crossed, and as it lays the eggs one by one, it twitches to arrange them into a head-down array that sticks together to form the raft.<ref name=\"Spielman, D'Antonio\">{{cite book |author1=Spielman, Andrew |author2=D'Antonio, M. |title=Mosquito : a natural history of our most persistent and deadly foe |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7868-6781-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/mosquitonaturalh00spie }}</ref>\n\n''Aedes'' females generally drop their eggs singly, much as ''Anopheles'' do, but not as a rule into water. Instead, they lay their eggs on damp mud or other surfaces near the water's edge. Such an oviposition site commonly is the wall of a cavity such as a hollow stump or a container such as a bucket or a discarded vehicle tire. The eggs generally do not hatch until they are flooded, and they may have to withstand considerable desiccation before that happens. They are not resistant to desiccation straight after oviposition, but must develop to a suitable degree first. Once they have achieved that, however, they can enter diapause for several months if they dry out. Clutches of eggs of the majority of mosquito species hatch as soon as possible, and all the eggs in the clutch hatch at much the same time. In contrast, a batch of ''Aedes'' eggs in diapause tends to hatch irregularly over an extended period of time. This makes it much more difficult to control such species than those mosquitoes whose larvae can be killed all together as they hatch. Some ''Anopheles'' species do also behave in such a manner, though not to the same degree of sophistication.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Walker ED, Vulule J, Miller JR |title=Daily temperature profiles in and around Western Kenyan larval habitats of Anopheles gambiae as related to egg mortality |journal=Malaria Journal |volume=5 |issue= |pages=87 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17038186 |pmc=1617108 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-5-87 }}</ref>\n\n=== Larva ===\n[[File:Culex restuans larva diagram en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of a ''[[Culex]]'' larva]]\nThe mosquito larva has a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] with no legs, and a segmented [[abdomen]].\n\nLarvae breathe through [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s located on their eighth abdominal segments, or through a siphon, so must come to the surface frequently. The larvae spend most of their time feeding on [[algae]], [[bacteria]], and other microbes in the surface [[Pleuston|microlayer]]. \n\nMosquito larvae have been investigated as prey of other Dipteran flies. Species such as ''[[Bezzia nobilis]]'' within the family [[Ceratopogonidae]] have been observed in experiments to prey upon mosquito larvae.<ref>Hribar, L. J. & G. R.

Larvae swim either through [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] with their mouth brushes, or by jerky movements of their entire bodies, giving them the common name of \"wigglers\" or \"wrigglers\".\n\nLarvae develop through four stages, or [[instar]]s, after which they [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into [[pupae]]. At the end of each instar, the larvae molt, shedding their skins to allow for further growth.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Anopheles larve.jpg|''[[Anopheles]]'' larva from southern Germany, about 8&nbsp;mm long\nFile:Comstock Immature Mosquito IMG 6217.JPG|''Culex'' larva and pupa\nFile:Culex sp larvae.png|''Culex'' larvae plus one pupa\n</gallery>\n\n=== Pupa ===\nAs seen in its [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] aspect, the mosquito pupa is comma-shaped. The head and thorax are merged into a [[cephalothorax]], with the abdomen curving around underneath. The pupa can swim actively by flipping its abdomen, and it is commonly called a \"tumbler\" because of its swimming action. As with the larva, the pupa of most species must come to the surface frequently to breathe, which they do through a pair of respiratory trumpets on their cephalothoraxes. However, pupae do not feed during this stage; typically they pass their time hanging from the surface of the water by their respiratory trumpets. If alarmed, say by a passing shadow, they nimbly swim downwards by flipping their abdomens in much the same way as the larvae do. If undisturbed, they soon float up again.\n\nAfter a few days or longer, depending on the temperature and other circumstances, the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] surface of its cephalothorax splits, and the adult mosquito emerges. The pupa is less active than the larva because it does not feed, whereas the larva feeds constantly.<ref name=\"Spielman, D'Antonio\"/>\n\n=== Adult ===\n[[File:Culex pipiens diagram en.svg|thumb|right|Anatomy of an adult mosquito]]\n\nThe period of development from egg to adult varies among species and is strongly influenced by ambient temperature. Some species of mosquitoes can develop from egg to adult in as few as five days, but a more typical period of development in tropical conditions would be some 40 days or more for most species. The variation of the body size in adult mosquitoes depends on the density of the larval population and food supply within the breeding water.\n\nAdult mosquitoes usually mate within a few days after emerging from the pupal stage. In most species, the males form large [[swarm]]s, usually around dusk, and the females fly into the swarms to mate.\n\nMales typically live for about 5\u20137 days, feeding on [[nectar]] and other sources of [[sugar]]. After obtaining a full blood meal, the female will rest for a few days while the blood is digested and eggs are developed. This process depends on the temperature, but usually takes two to three days in tropical conditions. Once the eggs are fully developed, the female lays them and resumes host-seeking.\n\nThe cycle repeats itself until the female dies. While females can live longer than a month in captivity, most do not live longer than one to two weeks in nature. Their lifespans depend on temperature, humidity, and their ability to successfully obtain a blood meal while avoiding host defenses and predators.\n\nThe length of the adult is typically between 3 mm and 6 mm. The smallest known mosquitoes are around {{convert|2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the largest around {{convert|19|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Service|first=Mike|title=Medical Entomology for Students|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|edition=5th|isbn=978-1-107-66818-8}}</ref> Mosquitoes typically weigh around 5&nbsp;mg.

Some species feed selectively on monkeys, while others prefer particular kinds of birds, but they become less selective as conditions become more difficult. For example, ''[[Culiseta]] melanura'' sucks the blood of [[passerine]] birds for preference, and such birds are typically the main reservoir of the [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] in North America. Early in the season while mosquito numbers are low, they concentrate on passerine hosts, but as mosquito numbers rise and the birds are forced to defend themselves more vigorously, the mosquitoes become less selective of hosts. Soon the mosquitoes begin attacking mammals more readily, thereby becoming the major vector of the virus, and causing epidemics of the disease, most conspicuously in humans and horses.<ref name=\"Lehane2005\">{{cite book|author=M.

Apart from bloodsucking, the females generally also drink assorted fluids rich in dissolved sugar, such as nectar and honeydew, to obtain the energy they need. For this, their blood-sucking mouthparts are perfectly adequate. In contrast, male mosquitoes are not bloodsuckers; they only drink sugary fluids. Accordingly, their mouthparts do not require the same degree of specialization as those of females.<ref name=\"WSM\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wahid I, Sunahara T, Mogi M |title=Maxillae and mandibles of male mosquitoes and female autogenous mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=150\u20138 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12693842 |doi=10.1603/0022-2585-40.2.150 }}</ref>\n\nExternally, the most obvious feeding structure of the mosquito is the proboscis. More specifically, the visible part of the proboscis is the [[Labium (insect)|labium]], which forms the sheath enclosing the rest of the mouthparts. When the mosquito first lands on a potential host, its mouthparts are enclosed entirely in this sheath, and it will touch the tip of the labium to the skin in various places. Sometimes, it will begin to bite almost straight away, while other times, it will prod around, apparently looking for a suitable place. Occasionally, it will wander for a considerable time, and eventually fly away without biting. Presumably, this probing is a search for a place with easily accessible blood vessels, but the exact mechanism is not known. It is known that there are two taste receptors at the tip of the labium which may well play a role.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\">{{cite book |first1=Gary |last1=Mullen |first2=Lance |last2=Durden | name-list-format = vanc |year=2009 |title=Medical and Veterinary Entomology |publisher=Academic Press |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe female mosquito does not insert its labium into the skin; it bends back into a bow when the mosquito begins to bite. The tip of the labium remains in contact with the skin of the victim, acting as a guide for the other mouthparts. In total, there are six mouthparts besides the labium: two [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]], two [[Galea (insects)|maxillae]], the [[Insect mouthparts#Hypopharynx|hypopharynx]], and the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]].\n\nThe mandibles and the maxillae are used for piercing the skin. The mandibles are pointed, while the maxillae end in flat, toothed \"blades\". To force these into the skin, the mosquito moves its head backwards and forwards. On one movement, the maxillae are moved as far forward as possible. On the opposite movement, the mandibles are pushed deeper into the skin by levering against the maxillae. The maxillae do not slip back because the toothed blades grip the skin.\n\nThe hypopharynx and the labrum are both hollow. Saliva with anticoagulant is pumped down the hypopharynx to prevent clotting, and blood is drawn up the labrum.\n\nTo understand the mosquito mouthparts, it is helpful to draw a comparison with an insect that chews food, such as a [[dragonfly]]. A dragonfly has two mandibles, which are used for chewing, and two maxillae, which are used to hold the food in place as it is chewed. The labium forms the floor of the dragonfly's mouth, the labrum forms the top, while the hypopharynx is inside the mouth and is used in swallowing. Conceptually, then, the mosquito's proboscis is an adaptation of the mouthparts that occur in other insects. The labium still lies beneath the other mouthparts, but also enfolds them, and it has been extended into a proboscis. The maxillae still \"grip\" the \"food\" while the mandibles \"bite\" it. The top of the mouth, the labrum, has developed into a channeled blade the length of the proboscis, with a cross-section like an inverted \"U\". Finally, the hypopharynx has extended into a tube that can deliver saliva at the end of the proboscis. Its upper surface is somewhat flattened so, when the lower part of the hypopharynx is pressed against it, the labrum forms a closed tube for conveying blood from the victim.<ref name=\"isbn0-412-61390-5\">{{cite book |author1=Richards, O.

Females with poor larval nutrition may need to ingest sugar or a preliminary blood meal bring ovarian follicles to their resting stage. Once the follicles have reached the resting stage, digestion of a sufficiently large blood meal triggers a hormonal cascade that leads to egg development.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/> Upon completion of feeding, the mosquito withdraws her [[proboscis]], and as the gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a [[Peritrophic matrix|peritrophic membrane]] that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from anything else in the stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the [[Hemiptera]], many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding ''Anopheles stephensi'': Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested over a period of several days.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/><ref name=\"pmid24315597\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Curic G, Hercog R, Vrselja Z, Wagner J |title=Identification of person and quantification of human DNA recovered from mosquitoes (Culicidae) |journal=Forensic Science International.

These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of [[vitellogenin]], which are the precursors for egg yolk protein.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/>\n\nIn the mosquito ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'', trypsin activity is restricted entirely to the posterior midgut lumen. No trypsin activity occurs before the blood meal, but activity increases continuously up to 30 hours after feeding, and subsequently returns to baseline levels by 60 hours. Aminopeptidase is active in the anterior and posterior midgut regions before and after feeding. In the whole midgut, activity rises from a baseline of approximately three enzyme units (EU) per midgut to a maximum of 12 EU at 30 hours after the blood meal, subsequently falling to baseline levels by 60 hours. A similar cycle of activity occurs in the posterior midgut and posterior midgut lumen, whereas aminopeptidase in the posterior midgut epithelium decreases in activity during digestion. Aminopeptidase in the anterior midgut is maintained at a constant, low level, showing no significant variation with time after feeding. Alpha-glucosidase is active in anterior and posterior midguts before and at all times after feeding. In whole midgut homogenates, alpha-glucosidase activity increases slowly up to 18 hours after the blood meal, then rises rapidly to a maximum at 30 hours after the blood meal, whereas the subsequent decline in activity is less predictable. All posterior midgut activity is restricted to the posterior midgut lumen. Depending on the time after feeding, greater than 25% of the total midgut activity of alpha-glucosidase is located in the anterior midgut. After blood meal ingestion, proteases are active only in the posterior midgut. Trypsin is the major primary hydrolytic protease and is secreted into the posterior midgut lumen without activation in the posterior midgut epithelium. Aminopeptidase activity is also luminal in the posterior midgut, but cellular aminopeptidases are required for peptide processing in both anterior and posterior midguts. Alpha-glucosidase activity is elevated in the posterior midgut after feeding in response to the blood meal, whereas activity in the anterior midgut is consistent with a nectar-processing role for this midgut region.<ref name=\"Billingsley\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Billingsley PF, Hecker H |title=Blood digestion in the mosquito, Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae): activity and distribution of trypsin, aminopeptidase, and alpha-glucosidase in the midgut |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=865\u201371 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1770523 |doi=10.1093/jmedent/28.6.865 }}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Mosquito Tasmania crop.jpg|thumb|Female ''[[Ochlerotatus notoscriptus]]'' feeding on a human arm, Tasmania, Australia]]\n\n===Distribution===\nMosquitoes are [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] (world-wide): they are in every land region except Antarctica<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/> and a few islands with polar or [[subpolar climate]]s.

At the start of the uninterrupted [[continental climate|continental]] winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The [[imago]] [[Pupa#Emergence|emerges]] only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently warms up suddenly, causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any [[Anautogeny|anautogenous]] adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not be realistic in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.<ref name=\"Visindavefur.hi.is\"/>\n\nSome other aquatic Diptera, such as [[Simuliidae]], do survive in Iceland, but their habits and adaptations differ from those of mosquitoes; Simuliidae for example, though they, like mosquitoes, are bloodsuckers, generally inhabit stones under running water that does not readily freeze and which is totally unsuited to mosquitoes; mosquitoes are generally not adapted to running water.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson BV |year=1977 |url=|journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=109 |issue=3|pages=449\u2013472 |doi=10.4039/Ent109449-3 |title=The Black Flies of Iceland (Diptera: Simuliidae) }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gislason G.

Their wings are long and narrow, same with their long, thin legs. They have slender and dainty bodies of length typically from 3 mm to 6 mm, with a color of dark grey to black, some species have specific patterns. When at rest, they tend to hold their first pair of legs outward. They look similar to midge flies (''[[Chironomidae]]''), another ancient family of flies. ''[[Tokunagayusurika akamusi]],'' for example, is a midge fly that look very much alike mosquitoes in that they also have slender and dainty bodies of similar colors, though larger in size. They also have only one pair of wings, but without scales on the surface. Another distinct feature to tell the two families of flies apart is the way they hold their first pair of legs - mosquitoes hold them outward, while midges hold them forward.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nature.mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/midges|title=Midges|website=MDC Discover Nature|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref>\n\n== Life cycle ==\n[[File:Wyeomyia smithii 1.jpg|right|thumb|Image of pitcher plant mosquito ''[[Wyeomyia smithii]]'', showing segmentation and partial anatomy of circulatory system]]\n\n===Overview===\nLike all flies, mosquitoes go through four stages in their life cycles: [[egg (biology)|egg]], [[larva]], [[pupa]], and adult or [[imago]]. The first three stages\u2014egg, larva, and pupa\u2014are largely aquatic. Each of the stages typically lasts 5 to 14 days, depending on the species and the ambient temperature, but there are important exceptions.<ref>American Mosquito Control Association https://www.mosquito.org/page/faq</ref> Mosquitoes living in regions where some seasons are freezing or waterless spend part of the year in ''[[diapause]]''; they delay their development, typically for months, and carry on with life only when there is enough water or warmth for their needs. For instance, ''Wyeomyia'' larvae typically get frozen into solid lumps of ice during winter and only complete their development in spring. The eggs of some species of ''Aedes'' remain unharmed in diapause if they dry out, and hatch later when they are covered by water.\n\nEggs hatch to become [[larva]]e, which grow until they are able to change into [[pupa]]e. The adult mosquito emerges from the mature pupa as it floats at the water surface. Bloodsucking mosquitoes, depending on species, sex, and weather conditions, have potential adult lifespans ranging from as short as a week to as long as several months. Some species can overwinter as adults in diapause.<ref>Kosova, Jonida (2003) [http://digitalcommons.unf.edu/ojii_volumes/94 \"Longevity Studies of Sindbis Virus Infected Aedes Albopictus\"].

Michigan Department of Agriculture June 2002</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\nIn most species, adult females lay their eggs in stagnant water: some lay near the water's edge while others attach their eggs to aquatic plants. Each species selects the situation of the water into which it lays its eggs and does so according to its own ecological adaptations. Some breed in lakes, some in temporary puddles. Some breed in marshes, some in salt-marshes. Among those that breed in salt water, some are equally at home in fresh and salt water up to about one-third the concentration of seawater, whereas others must acclimatize themselves to the salinity.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Wigglesworth VB |year=1933|journal=J Exp Biol |volume=10|pages=27\u201336|title=The Adaptation of Mosquito Larvae to Salt Water|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/10/1/27|issue=1}}</ref> Such differences are important because certain ecological preferences keep mosquitoes away from most humans, whereas other preferences bring them right into houses at night.\n\nSome species of mosquitoes prefer to breed in [[phytotelma]]ta (natural reservoirs on plants), such as rainwater accumulated in holes in tree trunks, or in the leaf-axils of [[Bromeliaceae|bromeliads]]. Some specialize in the liquid in pitchers of particular species of [[pitcher plant]]s, their larvae feeding on decaying insects that had drowned there or on the associated bacteria; the genus ''Wyeomyia'' provides such examples \u2014 the harmless ''Wyeomyia smithii'' breeds only in the pitchers of ''[[Sarracenia purpurea]]''.<ref>Crans, Wayne J.; [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp27.htm ''Wyeomyia smithii'' (Coquillett)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605173233/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~insects/sp27.htm |date=2013-06-05 }}. Rutgers University, Center for Vector Biology.</ref>\n\nHowever, some of the species of mosquitoes that are adapted to breeding in phytotelmata are dangerous disease vectors. In nature, they might occupy anything from a hollow tree trunk to a cupped leaf. Such species typically take readily to breeding in artificial water containers. Such casual puddles are important breeding places for some of the most serious disease vectors, such as species of ''[[Aedes]]'' that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Some with such breeding habits are disproportionately important vectors because they are well-placed to pick up [[pathogen]]s from humans and pass them on. In contrast, no matter how voracious, mosquitoes that breed and feed mainly in remote wetlands and salt marshes may well remain uninfected, and if they do happen to become infected with a relevant pathogen, might seldom encounter humans to infect, in turn.\n\n===Eggs and oviposition===\n[[File:Mosquito egg SEM.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scanning electron microscope|Electron micrograph]] of a mosquito egg]]\nMosquito habits of [[oviposition]], the ways in which they lay their eggs, vary considerably between species, and the [[Morphology (biology)|morphologies]] of the eggs vary accordingly. The simplest procedure is that followed by many species of ''[[Anopheles]]''; like many other [[Gracility|gracile]] species of aquatic insects, females just fly over the water, bobbing up and down to the water surface and dropping eggs more or less singly. The bobbing behavior occurs among some other aquatic insects as well, for example [[Mayfly|mayflies]] and [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]]; it is sometimes called \"[[dapping]]\". The eggs of ''Anopheles'' species are roughly cigar-shaped and have floats down their sides. Females of many common species can lay 100\u2013200 eggs during the course of the adult phase of their life cycles. Even with high egg and intergenerational mortality, over a period of several weeks, a single successful breeding pair can create a population of thousands.\n\n[[File:Gelege1.jpg|thumb|An egg raft of a ''Culex'' species, partly broken, showing individual egg shapes]]\n\nSome other species, for example members of the genus ''[[Mansonia]]'', lay their eggs in arrays, attached usually to the under-surfaces of waterlily pads. Their close relatives, the genus ''Coquillettidia'', lay their eggs similarly, but not attached to plants. Instead, the eggs form layers called \"rafts\" that float on the water. This is a common mode of oviposition, and most species of ''Culex'' are known for the habit, which also occurs in some other genera, such as ''[[Culiseta]]'' and ''[[Uranotaenia]]''. ''Anopheles'' eggs may on occasion cluster together on the water, too, but the clusters do not generally look much like compactly glued rafts of eggs.\n\nIn species that lay their eggs in rafts, rafts do not form adventitiously; the female ''Culex'' settles carefully on still water with its hind legs crossed, and as it lays the eggs one by one, it twitches to arrange them into a head-down array that sticks together to form the raft.<ref name=\"Spielman, D'Antonio\">{{cite book |author1=Spielman, Andrew |author2=D'Antonio, M. |title=Mosquito : a natural history of our most persistent and deadly foe |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-7868-6781-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/mosquitonaturalh00spie }}</ref>\n\n''Aedes'' females generally drop their eggs singly, much as ''Anopheles'' do, but not as a rule into water. Instead, they lay their eggs on damp mud or other surfaces near the water's edge. Such an oviposition site commonly is the wall of a cavity such as a hollow stump or a container such as a bucket or a discarded vehicle tire. The eggs generally do not hatch until they are flooded, and they may have to withstand considerable desiccation before that happens. They are not resistant to desiccation straight after oviposition, but must develop to a suitable degree first. Once they have achieved that, however, they can enter diapause for several months if they dry out. Clutches of eggs of the majority of mosquito species hatch as soon as possible, and all the eggs in the clutch hatch at much the same time. In contrast, a batch of ''Aedes'' eggs in diapause tends to hatch irregularly over an extended period of time. This makes it much more difficult to control such species than those mosquitoes whose larvae can be killed all together as they hatch. Some ''Anopheles'' species do also behave in such a manner, though not to the same degree of sophistication.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang J, Walker ED, Vulule J, Miller JR |title=Daily temperature profiles in and around Western Kenyan larval habitats of Anopheles gambiae as related to egg mortality |journal=Malaria Journal |volume=5 |issue= |pages=87 |date=October 2006 |pmid=17038186 |pmc=1617108 |doi=10.1186/1475-2875-5-87 }}</ref>\n\n=== Larva ===\n[[File:Culex restuans larva diagram en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of a ''[[Culex]]'' larva]]\nThe mosquito larva has a well-developed head with mouth brushes used for feeding, a large [[Thorax (insect anatomy)|thorax]] with no legs, and a segmented [[abdomen]].\n\nLarvae breathe through [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s located on their eighth abdominal segments, or through a siphon, so must come to the surface frequently.

Larvae swim either through [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] with their mouth brushes, or by jerky movements of their entire bodies, giving them the common name of \"wigglers\" or \"wrigglers\".\n\nLarvae develop through four stages, or [[instar]]s, after which they [[metamorphosis|metamorphose]] into [[pupae]]. At the end of each instar, the larvae molt, shedding their skins to allow for further growth.\n\n<gallery mode=\"nolines\">\nFile:Anopheles larve.jpg|''[[Anopheles]]'' larva from southern Germany, about 8&nbsp;mm long\nFile:Comstock Immature Mosquito IMG 6217.JPG|''Culex'' larva and pupa\nFile:Culex sp larvae.png|''Culex'' larvae plus one pupa\n</gallery>\n\n=== Pupa ===\nAs seen in its [[Anatomical terms of location|lateral]] aspect, the mosquito pupa is comma-shaped. The head and thorax are merged into a [[cephalothorax]], with the abdomen curving around underneath. The pupa can swim actively by flipping its abdomen, and it is commonly called a \"tumbler\" because of its swimming action. As with the larva, the pupa of most species must come to the surface frequently to breathe, which they do through a pair of respiratory trumpets on their cephalothoraxes. However, pupae do not feed during this stage; typically they pass their time hanging from the surface of the water by their respiratory trumpets. If alarmed, say by a passing shadow, they nimbly swim downwards by flipping their abdomens in much the same way as the larvae do. If undisturbed, they soon float up again.\n\nAfter a few days or longer, depending on the temperature and other circumstances, the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]] surface of its cephalothorax splits, and the adult mosquito emerges. The pupa is less active than the larva because it does not feed, whereas the larva feeds constantly.<ref name=\"Spielman, D'Antonio\"/>\n\n=== Adult ===\n[[File:Culex pipiens diagram en.svg|thumb|right|Anatomy of an adult mosquito]]\n\nThe period of development from egg to adult varies among species and is strongly influenced by ambient temperature. Some species of mosquitoes can develop from egg to adult in as few as five days, but a more typical period of development in tropical conditions would be some 40 days or more for most species. The variation of the body size in adult mosquitoes depends on the density of the larval population and food supply within the breeding water.\n\nAdult mosquitoes usually mate within a few days after emerging from the pupal stage. In most species, the males form large [[swarm]]s, usually around dusk, and the females fly into the swarms to mate.\n\nMales typically live for about 5\u20137 days, feeding on [[nectar]] and other sources of [[sugar]]. After obtaining a full blood meal, the female will rest for a few days while the blood is digested and eggs are developed. This process depends on the temperature, but usually takes two to three days in tropical conditions. Once the eggs are fully developed, the female lays them and resumes host-seeking.\n\nThe cycle repeats itself until the female dies. While females can live longer than a month in captivity, most do not live longer than one to two weeks in nature. Their lifespans depend on temperature, humidity, and their ability to successfully obtain a blood meal while avoiding host defenses and predators.\n\nThe length of the adult is typically between 3 mm and 6 mm. The smallest known mosquitoes are around {{convert|2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the largest around {{convert|19|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Service|first=Mike|title=Medical Entomology for Students|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|edition=5th|isbn=978-1-107-66818-8}}</ref> Mosquitoes typically weigh around 5&nbsp;mg.

Some species feed selectively on monkeys, while others prefer particular kinds of birds, but they become less selective as conditions become more difficult. For example, ''[[Culiseta]] melanura'' sucks the blood of [[passerine]] birds for preference, and such birds are typically the main reservoir of the [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus]] in North America. Early in the season while mosquito numbers are low, they concentrate on passerine hosts, but as mosquito numbers rise and the birds are forced to defend themselves more vigorously, the mosquitoes become less selective of hosts. Soon the mosquitoes begin attacking mammals more readily, thereby becoming the major vector of the virus, and causing epidemics of the disease, most conspicuously in humans and horses.<ref name=\"Lehane2005\">{{cite book|author=M.

Apart from bloodsucking, the females generally also drink assorted fluids rich in dissolved sugar, such as nectar and honeydew, to obtain the energy they need. For this, their blood-sucking mouthparts are perfectly adequate. In contrast, male mosquitoes are not bloodsuckers; they only drink sugary fluids. Accordingly, their mouthparts do not require the same degree of specialization as those of females.<ref name=\"WSM\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wahid I, Sunahara T, Mogi M |title=Maxillae and mandibles of male mosquitoes and female autogenous mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=150\u20138 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12693842 |doi=10.1603/0022-2585-40.2.150 }}</ref>\n\nExternally, the most obvious feeding structure of the mosquito is the proboscis. More specifically, the visible part of the proboscis is the [[Labium (insect)|labium]], which forms the sheath enclosing the rest of the mouthparts. When the mosquito first lands on a potential host, its mouthparts are enclosed entirely in this sheath, and it will touch the tip of the labium to the skin in various places. Sometimes, it will begin to bite almost straight away, while other times, it will prod around, apparently looking for a suitable place. Occasionally, it will wander for a considerable time, and eventually fly away without biting. Presumably, this probing is a search for a place with easily accessible blood vessels, but the exact mechanism is not known. It is known that there are two taste receptors at the tip of the labium which may well play a role.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\">{{cite book |first1=Gary |last1=Mullen |first2=Lance |last2=Durden | name-list-format = vanc |year=2009 |title=Medical and Veterinary Entomology |publisher=Academic Press |location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe female mosquito does not insert its labium into the skin; it bends back into a bow when the mosquito begins to bite. The tip of the labium remains in contact with the skin of the victim, acting as a guide for the other mouthparts. In total, there are six mouthparts besides the labium: two [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]], two [[Galea (insects)|maxillae]], the [[Insect mouthparts#Hypopharynx|hypopharynx]], and the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]].\n\nThe mandibles and the maxillae are used for piercing the skin. The mandibles are pointed, while the maxillae end in flat, toothed \"blades\". To force these into the skin, the mosquito moves its head backwards and forwards. On one movement, the maxillae are moved as far forward as possible. On the opposite movement, the mandibles are pushed deeper into the skin by levering against the maxillae. The maxillae do not slip back because the toothed blades grip the skin.\n\nThe hypopharynx and the labrum are both hollow. Saliva with anticoagulant is pumped down the hypopharynx to prevent clotting, and blood is drawn up the labrum.\n\nTo understand the mosquito mouthparts, it is helpful to draw a comparison with an insect that chews food, such as a [[dragonfly]]. A dragonfly has two mandibles, which are used for chewing, and two maxillae, which are used to hold the food in place as it is chewed. The labium forms the floor of the dragonfly's mouth, the labrum forms the top, while the hypopharynx is inside the mouth and is used in swallowing. Conceptually, then, the mosquito's proboscis is an adaptation of the mouthparts that occur in other insects. The labium still lies beneath the other mouthparts, but also enfolds them, and it has been extended into a proboscis. The maxillae still \"grip\" the \"food\" while the mandibles \"bite\" it. The top of the mouth, the labrum, has developed into a channeled blade the length of the proboscis, with a cross-section like an inverted \"U\". Finally, the hypopharynx has extended into a tube that can deliver saliva at the end of the proboscis. Its upper surface is somewhat flattened so, when the lower part of the hypopharynx is pressed against it, the labrum forms a closed tube for conveying blood from the victim.<ref name=\"isbn0-412-61390-5\">{{cite book |author1=Richards, O.

Females with poor larval nutrition may need to ingest sugar or a preliminary blood meal bring ovarian follicles to their resting stage. Once the follicles have reached the resting stage, digestion of a sufficiently large blood meal triggers a hormonal cascade that leads to egg development.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/> Upon completion of feeding, the mosquito withdraws her [[proboscis]], and as the gut fills up, the stomach lining secretes a [[Peritrophic matrix|peritrophic membrane]] that surrounds the blood. This membrane keeps the blood separate from anything else in the stomach. However, like certain other insects that survive on dilute, purely liquid diets, notably many of the [[Hemiptera]], many adult mosquitoes must excrete unwanted aqueous fractions even as they feed. (See the photograph of a feeding ''Anopheles stephensi'': Note that the excreted droplet patently is not whole blood, being far more dilute). As long as they are not disturbed, this permits mosquitoes to continue feeding until they have accumulated a full meal of nutrient solids. As a result, a mosquito replete with blood can continue to absorb sugar, even as the blood meal is slowly digested over a period of several days.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/><ref name=\"pmid24315597\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Curic G, Hercog R, Vrselja Z, Wagner J |title=Identification of person and quantification of human DNA recovered from mosquitoes (Culicidae) |journal=Forensic Science International.

These are used as building blocks for the synthesis of [[vitellogenin]], which are the precursors for egg yolk protein.<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/>\n\nIn the mosquito ''[[Anopheles stephensi]]'', trypsin activity is restricted entirely to the posterior midgut lumen. No trypsin activity occurs before the blood meal, but activity increases continuously up to 30 hours after feeding, and subsequently returns to baseline levels by 60 hours. Aminopeptidase is active in the anterior and posterior midgut regions before and after feeding. In the whole midgut, activity rises from a baseline of approximately three enzyme units (EU) per midgut to a maximum of 12 EU at 30 hours after the blood meal, subsequently falling to baseline levels by 60 hours. A similar cycle of activity occurs in the posterior midgut and posterior midgut lumen, whereas aminopeptidase in the posterior midgut epithelium decreases in activity during digestion. Aminopeptidase in the anterior midgut is maintained at a constant, low level, showing no significant variation with time after feeding. Alpha-glucosidase is active in anterior and posterior midguts before and at all times after feeding. In whole midgut homogenates, alpha-glucosidase activity increases slowly up to 18 hours after the blood meal, then rises rapidly to a maximum at 30 hours after the blood meal, whereas the subsequent decline in activity is less predictable. All posterior midgut activity is restricted to the posterior midgut lumen. Depending on the time after feeding, greater than 25% of the total midgut activity of alpha-glucosidase is located in the anterior midgut. After blood meal ingestion, proteases are active only in the posterior midgut. Trypsin is the major primary hydrolytic protease and is secreted into the posterior midgut lumen without activation in the posterior midgut epithelium. Aminopeptidase activity is also luminal in the posterior midgut, but cellular aminopeptidases are required for peptide processing in both anterior and posterior midguts. Alpha-glucosidase activity is elevated in the posterior midgut after feeding in response to the blood meal, whereas activity in the anterior midgut is consistent with a nectar-processing role for this midgut region.<ref name=\"Billingsley\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Billingsley PF, Hecker H |title=Blood digestion in the mosquito, Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae): activity and distribution of trypsin, aminopeptidase, and alpha-glucosidase in the midgut |journal=Journal of Medical Entomology |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=865\u201371 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1770523 |doi=10.1093/jmedent/28.6.865 }}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Mosquito Tasmania crop.jpg|thumb|Female ''[[Ochlerotatus notoscriptus]]'' feeding on a human arm, Tasmania, Australia]]\n\n===Distribution===\nMosquitoes are [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] (world-wide): they are in every land region except Antarctica<ref name=\"Mullen2009\"/> and a few islands with polar or [[subpolar climate]]s.

At the start of the uninterrupted [[continental climate|continental]] winter of Greenland and the northern regions of Eurasia and America, the pupa enters diapause under the ice that covers sufficiently deep water. The [[imago]] [[Pupa#Emergence|emerges]] only after the ice breaks in late spring. In Iceland however, the weather is less predictable. In mid-winter it frequently warms up suddenly, causing the ice to break, but then to freeze again after a few days. By that time the mosquitoes will have emerged from their pupae, but the new freeze sets in before they can complete their life cycle. Any [[Anautogeny|anautogenous]] adult mosquito would need a host to supply a blood meal before it could lay viable eggs; it would need time to mate, mature the eggs and oviposit in suitable wetlands. These requirements would not be realistic in Iceland and in fact the absence of mosquitoes from such subpolar islands is in line with the islands' low biodiversity; Iceland has fewer than 1,500 described species of insects, many of them probably accidentally introduced by human agency. In Iceland most ectoparasitic insects live in sheltered conditions or actually on mammals; examples include lice, fleas and bedbugs, in whose living conditions freezing is no concern, and most of which were introduced inadvertently by humans.<ref name=\"Visindavefur.hi.is\"/>\n\nSome other aquatic Diptera, such as [[Simuliidae]], do survive in Iceland, but their habits and adaptations differ from those of mosquitoes; Simuliidae for example, though they, like mosquitoes, are bloodsuckers, generally inhabit stones under running water that does not readily freeze and which is totally unsuited to mosquitoes; mosquitoes are generally not adapted to running water.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson BV |year=1977 |url=|journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=109 |issue=3|pages=449\u2013472 |doi=10.4039/Ent109449-3 |title=The Black Flies of Iceland (Diptera: Simuliidae) }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gislason G.

The Afrofuturist approach to music was first propounded by [[Sun Ra]]. Born in Alabama, Sun Ra's music coalesced in Chicago in the mid-1950s, when with the Arkestra he began recording music that drew from [[hard bop]] and modal sources, creating a new synthesis that used [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and space-themed titles to reflect Ra's linkage of ancient African culture, specifically [[Afrocentrism#Egypt and the argument of African cultural unity|Egypt]], and the cutting edge of the [[Space Age]].\n\nFor many years, Ra and his bandmates lived, worked and performed in Philadelphia while touring festivals worldwide. Ra's film ''[[Space Is the Place]]'' shows The Arkestra in Oakland in the mid-1970s in full space regalia, replete with science-fiction imagery as well as other comedic and musical material. As of 2018, the band was still composing and performing, under the leadership of [[Marshall Allen]].\n\nAfrofuturist ideas were taken up in 1975 by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] with his magnum opus ''[[Mothership Connection]]'' and the subsequent ''[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]'', [[P-Funk Earth Tour]], ''[[Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]'', and ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]''. In the thematic underpinnings to [[P-Funk mythology]] (\"pure cloned funk\"), Clinton in his alter ego ''Starchild'' spoke of \"certified Afronauts, capable of funkitizing galaxies\".\n\nIn 1975, Japanese artist [[Tadanori Yokoo]] used elements of Afrofuturism, along with [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] subterranean myths, to depict an advanced civilization in his design of the cover art for jazz musician [[Miles Davis]]'s live album ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Buchwald|first=Dagmar|chapter=Black Sun Underground: The Music of AlieNation|year=2012|editor1-first=Hanjo|editor1-last=Berressem|editor2-first=Michael|editor2-last=Bucher|editor3-first=Uwe|editor3-last=Schwagmeier|title=Between Science and Fiction: The Hollow Earth as Concept and Conceit|publisher=LIT Verlag Munster|isbn=978-3-643-90228-3|page=109}}</ref>\n\nOther musicians typically regarded as working in or greatly influenced by the Afrofuturist tradition include reggae producers [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] and [[Scientist (musician)|Scientist]], hip-hop artists [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], electronic musicians [[Larry Heard]], [[A Guy Called Gerald]], [[Juan Atkins]], [[Jeff Mills]],<ref name=reddell>{{cite journal |last=Reddell |first=Trace|year=2013 |title=Ethnoforgery and Outsider Afrofuturism |journal=Dancecult |publisher=[[Griffith University]] ePress |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=89\u201390 |doi=10.12801/1947-5403.2013.05.02.05 |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Newcleus]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/forever-out-there-25-contributors-to-the-space-disco-era-1976-1986/P2/ |title=Forever Out There: 25 Contributors to the Space Disco Era 1976\u20131986 |last1=Loudermilk |first1=A. |date=3 October 2016 |website=[[PopMatters]] |access-date=23 October 2016 }}</ref> and [[Lotti Golden]] & Richard Scher, writers of \"[[Light Years Away (Warp 9 song)|Light Years Away]]\", described as a \"cornerstone of early 80's beatbox afrofuturism\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Rob |title=The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Warp 9 \u2013 It's A Beat Wave |date=May 14, 2014 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/14/the-101-strangest-records-on-spotify-warp-9-its-a-beat-wave |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural criticism in the 1990s===\nIn the early 1990s, a number of [[cultural critic]]s, notably [[Mark Dery]] in his 1993 essay \"Black to the Future,\"<ref name=\"Dery 1993 736\"/> began to write about the features they saw as common in African-American science fiction, music, and art.

Yaszek illustrates that Ellison draws upon Afrofuturist ideas that were not yet prevalent in African-American literature. Ellison critiques the traditional visions of black people's future in the United States, but does not provide readers a different future to imagine. Yaszek believes that Ellison does not offer any other futures so that the next generation of authors can. ''Invisible Man'' may not be Afrofuturist in the sense that it does not provide a better \u2013 or even any \u2013  future for black people in the United States, but it can be thought of as a call for people to start thinking and creating art with an Afrofuturist mindset.

It is consistent with the New Black Aesthetic in that the art seeks to disturb. It samples from old art pieces updating them with current images. This technique calls to the forefront those past images and the sentiments, memories, or ideas around them and combines them with new images in a way that those of the current generation can still identify. Both seek to disturb, but there is more of a \"mutant\" psychology that is going on. Afro-Futuristic artists seek to propose a deviant beauty, a beauty in which disembodiment is both inhumane, yet distinct; Afro-Futuristic artists speculate on the future, where Afro-Surrealism is about the present.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=D.

By analyzing the ways in which alienation has occurred, Afrofuturism works to connect the African diaspora with its histories and knowledge of racialized bodies. Space and aliens function as key products of the science fiction elements; black people are envisioned to have been the first aliens by way of the [[Middle Passage]]. Their alien status connotes being in a foreign land with no history, but as also being disconnected from the past via the traditions of slavery where slaves were made to renounce their ties to Africa in service of their slave master.<ref name=\"Mayer\">{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Ruth|date=2000|title='Africa As an Alien Future': The Middle Passage, Afrofuturism, and Postcolonial Waterworlds|journal=Amerikastudien / American Studies|volume=45|issue=4|pages=558|jstor=41157608}}</ref>\n\n[[Kodwo Eshun]] locates the first alienation within the context of the Middle Passage. He writes that Afrofuturist texts work to reimagine slavery and alienation by using \"extraterrestriality as a hyperbolic trope to explore the historical terms, the everyday implications of forcibly imposed dislocation, and the constitution of Black Atlantic subjectivities\". This location of dystopian futures and present realities places science fiction and novels built around dystopian societies directly in the tradition of black realities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|authorlink=Kodwo Eshun|title=Further Considerations of Afrofuturism|journal=CR: The New Centennial Review|volume=3|issue=2|year=2003|pages=287\u2013302|doi=10.1353/ncr.2003.0021}}</ref>\n\n=== Water ===\nIn Afrofuturism, water in many different works symbolizes both erasure and the existence of black life. These dual meanings while seemingly contradictory actually play off and inform each other. For instance, the middle passage can be considered where the first erasure happened of African- American history. There are no stories that survived that passage. As Ruth Mayer states, in the United States, \"black history is both there and not there, evident in countless traces, scars, and memories, yet largely submerged when it comes to written accounts and first person documentations of the past from the viewpoint of the victims.\"<ref name=\"Mayer\"/> Yet, it is through this erasure that Afrofuturism is able to craft histories. These histories live both in fact and in fiction, as the true history was lost in the waters of the Atlantic. Water erased the history, but it also allowed for the creation of a new history.\n\nThis is where Afrofuturism comes into play. To have a future, one's past must be defined. However, for African Americans, though their \"history\" has been drowned, Afrofuturism resuscitates this history. By its creation, it creates new possibilities for the future. In [[Carrie Mae Weems]]' triptych ''Untitled'' (Ebo Landing), the Afrofuturism piece crafts a space with two pictures that could be both African and America with its depiction of lush greenery. In this way, the piece highlights how the original space of water has given way in which Afrofuturism can imagine a past or future that lives in the space of truth and fiction, the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat of African American past.\n\nAnother example of an Afrofuturist work that deals specifically with the theme of water is 2009 film ''[[Pumzi]]'', which depicts an enclosed society in which water is utterly scarce and totally conserved. The film's ambiguous ending leaves viewers wondering whether there was a neighboring society with access to water the whole time, or if the main character has died a heroine by planting a tree that will eventually bloom into a whole forest.\n\n=== Reclamation ===\nAfrofuturism has to do with reclaiming the lost identities or lost perspectives that have been subverted or overlooked. When Mark Dery coined the term, he saw Afrofuturism as giving rise to \"a troubling antinomy: Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose energies have subsequently been consumed by the search for legible traces of its history, imagine possible futures?\" Furthermore, Afrofuturism is not restricted to any single medium; there are Afrofuturist novels and essays, academic writings and musical works. But whatever the medium, Afrofuturism involves reclaiming some type of agency over one's story, a story that has been told, throughout much of history, by official culture in the name of white power. It is for this reason that Dery says, \"African-American culture is Afrofuturist at its heart.\" Because the ancestors of African-Americans were forcibly removed from their homelands and stripped of their history, any culture that has found its way into the Black lexicon is at its roots an Afrofuturist notion. It is at its heart reclaiming a past erased and creating a future based on that reimagined past.\n\n== Afrofuturism 2.0 ==\nAfrofuturism 2.0 was coined during an exchange between Alondra Nelson and Reynaldo Anderson at the Alien Bodies conference in 2013; where Anderson noted that the previous definition was insufficient due to the rise of social media and new technology. Following the publication of the co-edited volume Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness, in the late 2010s, the ''Black Speculative Arts Movement'', a traveling art, comic, and film convention, released a manifesto called ''Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: Notes on a Manifesto''.<ref name=\"BSAM Manifesto\">{{cite web |first=Reynaldo  |last=Anderson |title=Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: NOTES ON A MANIFESTO |website=Black Speculative Arts Movement |url=https://blackspeculativeartsmovement.wordpress.com/bsam-manifesto/}}</ref> The manifesto was written by Reynaldo Anderson at Harris-Stowe State University as an attempt to redefine and refit Afrofuturism for the 21st century. The 2.0 volume and the manifesto defines Afrofuturism 2.0 as \"The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences, enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement\".<ref name=\"BSAM Manifesto\"/> Afrofuturism 2.0 is characterized by five dimensions to include metaphysics, aesthetics, theoretical and applied science, social sciences and programmatic spaces; and in the twenty-first century is no longer bound to its original definition, as a term once dealing with cultural aesthetics and the digital divide, but has been broadened to be known also as a philosophy of science, metaphysics and geopolitics.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Reynaldo|title=Afrofuturism: The Digital Turn and the Visual Art of Kanye West|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sr436/Visual%20Art%20of%20Kanye%20West.pdf|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn this manifesto, Anderson acknowledges and accounts for the changes in technology, social movements, and even philosophical changes in modern society while also speculating as to how the Afrofuturist narrative will be changed because of it. This is particularly in regards to the rise and boom of social media platforms.\n\nIn conjunction with this, Los Angeles-based artist [[Martine Syms]] penned an online article in 2013 called ''The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto'' that is composed of a list of tenets that, supposedly, all Mundane Afrofuturists recognize. Though the article is in part parodic and sarcastic, it aims to identify and make light of overused tropes within Afrofuturist works like \"magical Negroes\" or \"references to Sun Ra\". Through this identification of \"overused tropes\" and a later definition of rules to actually subvert these tropes entitled \"The Mundane Afrofuturist promise\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/dec/17/mundane-afrofuturist-manifesto/|title=The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto|last=Syms|first=Martine|date=December 17, 2013|website=Rhizome|access-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref> Syms requests a new, updated vision for Afrofuturist works, which falls in line with the framework of Afrofuturism 2.0.\n\n== List of Afrofuturists ==\nThis list is in alphabetical order, by genre then by last name or by the first letter of a band/group name.\n\n=== Multimedia artists ===\n*[[Solange Knowles]] \u2014 visual artist, performance artist, musician and director.\n* [[Lonnie Holley]] \u2014 visual artist, performance artist, and musician.\n* [[Kid Cudi]] \u2014 rapper and actor.\n* [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]] \u2014 visual artist, film-maker, and musician\n* [[Rammellzee]] \u2014 visual artist, hip hop musician, sculptor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Musicians and music groups ===\n\n* [[Solange Knowles]]\n* [[4 Hero]]\n* [[A Guy Called Gerald]]\n* [[A Tribe Called Quest]]\n* [[Erykah Badu]]\n* [[Chino Amobi]]\n* [[Clipping.]]\n* [[Jonzun Crew]]\n* [[Deltron 3030]]\n* [[Dexter Wansel]]\n* [[Drexciya]]\n* [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]\n* [[Fishbone]]\n* [[FKA twigs]]\n* [[Flying Lotus]]\n* [[Future Man]]\n* [[Griot Galaxy]]\n* [[Jamila Woods]]\n* [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Janet Jackson]]\n* [[Jimi Hendrix]]\n* [[Jlin (musician)|Jlin]]\n* [[Kelela]]\n* [[King Britt]]\n* [[Klein (musician)|Klein]]\n*[[Kool Keith]]- also known under the alias as [[Dr. Octagonecologyst|Dr. Octagon]]\n* [[Kendrick Lamar]]\n* [[Living Color]]\n* [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/sv/article/nnmgdx/afrofuturism|title=Afrofuturism|website=Vice|language=en-dk|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n* [[MF Doom|MF DOOM]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Michael Jackson]]\n* [[Missy Elliott]]\n* [[Moor Mother]]\n* Orrin{{efn|In an appearance on ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'' in January 2020, independent rapper Orrin described and expressed themselves as a cyborg from the year 2050, also referring to themselves as a plural.|}}\n* [[N A T U R E]]\n* [[Outkast]]\n* [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry|Lee Scratch Perry]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]\n* [[Soul Basement]]\n* [[Sun Ra]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Shabazz Palaces]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[The Spaceape]]\n* [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]]\n* [[Willow Smith]]\n* [[Warp 9]]\n* [[Wu-Tang Clan]]\n* [[SZA (singer)|SZA]]\n* [[Ryan Jack Kay]]\n\n=== Visual artists ===\n* [[Emo de Medeiros]]\n* [[Shala.

The Afrofuturist approach to music was first propounded by [[Sun Ra]]. Born in Alabama, Sun Ra's music coalesced in Chicago in the mid-1950s, when with the Arkestra he began recording music that drew from [[hard bop]] and modal sources, creating a new synthesis that used [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and space-themed titles to reflect Ra's linkage of ancient African culture, specifically [[Afrocentrism#Egypt and the argument of African cultural unity|Egypt]], and the cutting edge of the [[Space Age]].\n\nFor many years, Ra and his bandmates lived, worked and performed in Philadelphia while touring festivals worldwide. Ra's film ''[[Space Is the Place]]'' shows The Arkestra in Oakland in the mid-1970s in full space regalia, replete with science-fiction imagery as well as other comedic and musical material. As of 2018, the band was still composing and performing, under the leadership of [[Marshall Allen]].\n\nAfrofuturist ideas were taken up in 1975 by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and his bands [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]] and [[Funkadelic]] with his magnum opus ''[[Mothership Connection]]'' and the subsequent ''[[The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein]]'', [[P-Funk Earth Tour]], ''[[Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome]]'', and ''[[Motor Booty Affair]]''.

Yaszek illustrates that Ellison draws upon Afrofuturist ideas that were not yet prevalent in African-American literature. Ellison critiques the traditional visions of black people's future in the United States, but does not provide readers a different future to imagine. Yaszek believes that Ellison does not offer any other futures so that the next generation of authors can. ''Invisible Man'' may not be Afrofuturist in the sense that it does not provide a better \u2013 or even any \u2013  future for black people in the United States, but it can be thought of as a call for people to start thinking and creating art with an Afrofuturist mindset. In this sense, Yaszek concludes that Ellison's novel is a canon in Afrofuturistic literature by serving as call for \"this kind of future-historical art\" to those who succeed him.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yaszek|first=Lisa|year=2005|title=An Afrofuturist Reading of Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man|url=http://www.wright.edu/~david.wilson/eng2050/afrofuturistreading.pdf|journal=Rethinking History|volume=9|issue=2\u20133|pages=297\u2013313|doi=10.1080/13642520500149202}}</ref>\n\nA number of contemporary [[Black science fiction]] and speculative fiction authors have also been characterized as Afrofuturist or as employing Afrofuturist themes.

Through the exploration of women's power in the time of slavery to the more current time, Butler is able to demonstrate the endurance of women through the harsh social factors.\n\n===The grotesque===\n\nIn the Afro-Surreal Manifesto, [[Afro-Surrealism]] is juxtaposed with European surrealism, with European surrealism being empirical. It is consistent with the New Black Aesthetic in that the art seeks to disturb. It samples from old art pieces updating them with current images. This technique calls to the forefront those past images and the sentiments, memories, or ideas around them and combines them with new images in a way that those of the current generation can still identify. Both seek to disturb, but there is more of a \"mutant\" psychology that is going on. Afro-Futuristic artists seek to propose a deviant beauty, a beauty in which disembodiment is both inhumane, yet distinct; Afro-Futuristic artists speculate on the future, where Afro-Surrealism is about the present.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=D.

By analyzing the ways in which alienation has occurred, Afrofuturism works to connect the African diaspora with its histories and knowledge of racialized bodies. Space and aliens function as key products of the science fiction elements; black people are envisioned to have been the first aliens by way of the [[Middle Passage]]. Their alien status connotes being in a foreign land with no history, but as also being disconnected from the past via the traditions of slavery where slaves were made to renounce their ties to Africa in service of their slave master.<ref name=\"Mayer\">{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Ruth|date=2000|title='Africa As an Alien Future': The Middle Passage, Afrofuturism, and Postcolonial Waterworlds|journal=Amerikastudien / American Studies|volume=45|issue=4|pages=558|jstor=41157608}}</ref>\n\n[[Kodwo Eshun]] locates the first alienation within the context of the Middle Passage. He writes that Afrofuturist texts work to reimagine slavery and alienation by using \"extraterrestriality as a hyperbolic trope to explore the historical terms, the everyday implications of forcibly imposed dislocation, and the constitution of Black Atlantic subjectivities\". This location of dystopian futures and present realities places science fiction and novels built around dystopian societies directly in the tradition of black realities.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eshun|first=Kodwo|authorlink=Kodwo Eshun|title=Further Considerations of Afrofuturism|journal=CR: The New Centennial Review|volume=3|issue=2|year=2003|pages=287\u2013302|doi=10.1353/ncr.2003.0021}}</ref>\n\n=== Water ===\nIn Afrofuturism, water in many different works symbolizes both erasure and the existence of black life. These dual meanings while seemingly contradictory actually play off and inform each other. For instance, the middle passage can be considered where the first erasure happened of African- American history. There are no stories that survived that passage. As Ruth Mayer states, in the United States, \"black history is both there and not there, evident in countless traces, scars, and memories, yet largely submerged when it comes to written accounts and first person documentations of the past from the viewpoint of the victims.\"<ref name=\"Mayer\"/> Yet, it is through this erasure that Afrofuturism is able to craft histories. These histories live both in fact and in fiction, as the true history was lost in the waters of the Atlantic. Water erased the history, but it also allowed for the creation of a new history.\n\nThis is where Afrofuturism comes into play. To have a future, one's past must be defined. However, for African Americans, though their \"history\" has been drowned, Afrofuturism resuscitates this history. By its creation, it creates new possibilities for the future. In [[Carrie Mae Weems]]' triptych ''Untitled'' (Ebo Landing), the Afrofuturism piece crafts a space with two pictures that could be both African and America with its depiction of lush greenery. In this way, the piece highlights how the original space of water has given way in which Afrofuturism can imagine a past or future that lives in the space of truth and fiction, the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat of African American past.\n\nAnother example of an Afrofuturist work that deals specifically with the theme of water is 2009 film ''[[Pumzi]]'', which depicts an enclosed society in which water is utterly scarce and totally conserved. The film's ambiguous ending leaves viewers wondering whether there was a neighboring society with access to water the whole time, or if the main character has died a heroine by planting a tree that will eventually bloom into a whole forest.\n\n=== Reclamation ===\nAfrofuturism has to do with reclaiming the lost identities or lost perspectives that have been subverted or overlooked. When Mark Dery coined the term, he saw Afrofuturism as giving rise to \"a troubling antinomy: Can a community whose past has been deliberately rubbed out, and whose energies have subsequently been consumed by the search for legible traces of its history, imagine possible futures?\" Furthermore, Afrofuturism is not restricted to any single medium; there are Afrofuturist novels and essays, academic writings and musical works. But whatever the medium, Afrofuturism involves reclaiming some type of agency over one's story, a story that has been told, throughout much of history, by official culture in the name of white power. It is for this reason that Dery says, \"African-American culture is Afrofuturist at its heart.\" Because the ancestors of African-Americans were forcibly removed from their homelands and stripped of their history, any culture that has found its way into the Black lexicon is at its roots an Afrofuturist notion. It is at its heart reclaiming a past erased and creating a future based on that reimagined past.\n\n== Afrofuturism 2.0 ==\nAfrofuturism 2.0 was coined during an exchange between Alondra Nelson and Reynaldo Anderson at the Alien Bodies conference in 2013; where Anderson noted that the previous definition was insufficient due to the rise of social media and new technology. Following the publication of the co-edited volume Afrofuturism 2.0: The Rise of Astro-Blackness, in the late 2010s, the ''Black Speculative Arts Movement'', a traveling art, comic, and film convention, released a manifesto called ''Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: Notes on a Manifesto''.<ref name=\"BSAM Manifesto\">{{cite web |first=Reynaldo  |last=Anderson |title=Afrofuturism 2.0 and the Black Speculative Arts Movement: NOTES ON A MANIFESTO |website=Black Speculative Arts Movement |url=https://blackspeculativeartsmovement.wordpress.com/bsam-manifesto/}}</ref> The manifesto was written by Reynaldo Anderson at Harris-Stowe State University as an attempt to redefine and refit Afrofuturism for the 21st century. The 2.0 volume and the manifesto defines Afrofuturism 2.0 as \"The early twenty-first century technogenesis of Black identity reflecting counter histories, hacking and or appropriating the influence of network software, database logic, cultural analytics, deep remixability, neurosciences, enhancement and augmentation, gender fluidity, posthuman possibility, the speculative sphere with transdisciplinary applications and has grown into an important Diasporic techno-cultural Pan African movement\".<ref name=\"BSAM Manifesto\"/> Afrofuturism 2.0 is characterized by five dimensions to include metaphysics, aesthetics, theoretical and applied science, social sciences and programmatic spaces; and in the twenty-first century is no longer bound to its original definition, as a term once dealing with cultural aesthetics and the digital divide, but has been broadened to be known also as a philosophy of science, metaphysics and geopolitics.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Reynaldo|title=Afrofuturism: The Digital Turn and the Visual Art of Kanye West|url=http://people.exeter.ac.uk/sr436/Visual%20Art%20of%20Kanye%20West.pdf|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn this manifesto, Anderson acknowledges and accounts for the changes in technology, social movements, and even philosophical changes in modern society while also speculating as to how the Afrofuturist narrative will be changed because of it. This is particularly in regards to the rise and boom of social media platforms.\n\nIn conjunction with this, Los Angeles-based artist [[Martine Syms]] penned an online article in 2013 called ''The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto'' that is composed of a list of tenets that, supposedly, all Mundane Afrofuturists recognize. Though the article is in part parodic and sarcastic, it aims to identify and make light of overused tropes within Afrofuturist works like \"magical Negroes\" or \"references to Sun Ra\". Through this identification of \"overused tropes\" and a later definition of rules to actually subvert these tropes entitled \"The Mundane Afrofuturist promise\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/dec/17/mundane-afrofuturist-manifesto/|title=The Mundane Afrofuturist Manifesto|last=Syms|first=Martine|date=December 17, 2013|website=Rhizome|access-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref> Syms requests a new, updated vision for Afrofuturist works, which falls in line with the framework of Afrofuturism 2.0.\n\n== List of Afrofuturists ==\nThis list is in alphabetical order, by genre then by last name or by the first letter of a band/group name.\n\n=== Multimedia artists ===\n*[[Solange Knowles]] \u2014 visual artist, performance artist, musician and director.\n* [[Lonnie Holley]] \u2014 visual artist, performance artist, and musician.\n* [[Kid Cudi]] \u2014 rapper and actor.\n* [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]] \u2014 visual artist, film-maker, and musician\n* [[Rammellzee]] \u2014 visual artist, hip hop musician, sculptor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Musicians and music groups ===\n\n* [[Solange Knowles]]\n* [[4 Hero]]\n* [[A Guy Called Gerald]]\n* [[A Tribe Called Quest]]\n* [[Erykah Badu]]\n* [[Chino Amobi]]\n* [[Clipping.]]\n* [[Jonzun Crew]]\n* [[Deltron 3030]]\n* [[Dexter Wansel]]\n* [[Drexciya]]\n* [[Earth, Wind & Fire]]\n* [[Fishbone]]\n* [[FKA twigs]]\n* [[Flying Lotus]]\n* [[Future Man]]\n* [[Griot Galaxy]]\n* [[Jamila Woods]]\n* [[Janelle Mon\u00e1e]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Janet Jackson]]\n* [[Jimi Hendrix]]\n* [[Jlin (musician)|Jlin]]\n* [[Kelela]]\n* [[King Britt]]\n* [[Klein (musician)|Klein]]\n*[[Kool Keith]]- also known under the alias as [[Dr. Octagonecologyst|Dr. Octagon]]\n* [[Kendrick Lamar]]\n* [[Living Color]]\n* [[Derrick May (musician)|Derrick May]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/sv/article/nnmgdx/afrofuturism|title=Afrofuturism|website=Vice|language=en-dk|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n* [[MF Doom|MF DOOM]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Michael Jackson]]\n* [[Missy Elliott]]\n* [[Moor Mother]]\n* Orrin{{efn|In an appearance on ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'' in January 2020, independent rapper Orrin described and expressed themselves as a cyborg from the year 2050, also referring to themselves as a plural.|}}\n* [[N A T U R E]]\n* [[Outkast]]\n* [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry|Lee Scratch Perry]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]\n* [[Soul Basement]]\n* [[Sun Ra]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Shabazz Palaces]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[The Spaceape]]\n* [[Tricky]]\n* [[Willow Smith]]\n* [[Warp 9]]\n* [[Wu-Tang Clan]]\n* [[SZA (singer)|SZA]]\n* [[Ryan Jack Kay]]\n\n=== Visual artists ===\n* [[Emo de Medeiros]]\n* [[Shala.

It is an active-duty associate unit administratively assigned to the [[495th Fighter Group]] and operates aircraft assigned to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s [[301st Fighter Wing]]. Prior to its reactivation in 2015, the unit's last assignment was that of a subordinate unit of the [[354th Fighter Wing]] based at [[Eielson Air Force Base]] in [[Alaska]], flying the Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. The squadron was inactivated on 15 August 2007 as a result of [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) 2005.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\nActivated on 15 November 1942 at [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]], California, initially equipped with [[P-39 Airacobra]]s and assigned to [[IV Fighter Command]] for training. Moved to several bases in California and Nevada then to [[Portland Army Air Base]], Oregon in June 1943 and re-equipped with new [[North American P-51B Mustang]]s. Transitioned to the Mustang throughout the summer of 1943 the deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]], being assigned to [[IX Fighter Command]] in England.\n\nIn late 1943, the strategic bombardment campaign over [[Occupied Europe]] and [[Nazi Germany]] being conducted by [[VIII Bomber Command]] was taking heavy losses in aircraft and flight crews as the [[VIII Fighter Command]]'s [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]]s and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s lacked the range to escort the heavy [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers deep into [[Germany]] to attack industrial and military targets. The P-51 had the range to perform the escort duties and the unit's operational control was transferred to Headquarters, [[Eighth Air Force]] to perform escort missions. From its base at [[RAF Boxted]], the unit flew long-range strategic escort missions with VIII Bomber Command groups, escorting the heavy bombers to targets such as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Augsburg, and Schweinfurt, engaging [[Luftwaffe]] day interceptors frequently, with the P-51s outperforming the German [[Bf 109]] and [[Fw 190]] interceptors, causing heavy losses to the Luftwaffe. Remained under operational control of Eighth Air Force until April 1944, when sufficient numbers of P-51D Mustangs and arrived from the United States and were assigned to VIII Fighter Command units for escort duty.\n\nWas relieved from escort duty and was re-equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts, and reassigned to [[RAF Lashenden]] on the southern coast of England.    Mission was redefined to provide tactical air support for the forthcoming invasion of France, to support the Third, and later Ninth United States Armies. Flew fighter sweeps over [[Normandy]] and along the [[English Channel]] coast of France and the Low Countries, April\u2013June 1944, then engaged in heavy tactical bombing of enemy military targets as well as roads, railroads and bridges in the Normandy area to support ground forces in the immediate aftermath of [[D-Day]].\n\n[[File:354fg-p51b.jpg|thumb|left|North American P-51B-1-NA Mustang Serial 43-12408 of the 355th Fighter Squadron, photo probably taken at RAF Boxted, England, early 1944.]]\nMoved to [[Advanced Landing Ground]]s in France beginning at the end of June 1944, moving eastwards to combat airfields and liberated French airports supporting Allied Ground forces as the advanced across Northern France.   Later, in 1944, the squadron became involved in dive-bombing and strafing missions, striking railroad yards, bridges, troop concentrations, and airfields.  Participated in attacks on German forces in Belgium in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], then moved eastward as part of the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]]. The squadron flew its last mission of the war on 7 May 1945 from the captured Luftwaffe airfield at [[Ansbach]] (R-45).\n\nRemained in Occupied Germany as part of the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] [[XII Tactical Air Command]] occupying force after the German Capitulation, being stationed at [[AAF Station Herzogenaurach]].  Was inactivated on 31 March 1946.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Cold War===\nReactivated by Tactical Air Command, United States Air Force on 19 November 1956, being assigned to the reactivated [[354th Fighter-Day Group]] at the new [[Myrtle Beach Air Force Base]], South Carolina.   Equipped with [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]] fighters, the squadron participated in exercises, operations, tests, and firepower demonstrations conducted by the [[Tactical Air Command]] within the US and abroad.  The unit frequently deployed to [[Aviano Air Base]], Italy and [[Wheelus Air Base]], Libya.  Was deployed to Europe during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]] and was moved to [[McCoy Air Force Base]], Florida in 1962 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\n===Vietnam War===\n[[Image:F-100D-56-3374-355tfs-PhuCat.jpg|thumb|Former 355 TFS North American F-100D-80-NH \"Super Sabre\" 56-3374 on a mission into [[North Vietnam]] from Phu Cat AB, South Vietnam]]\n[[File:355th Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7D Formation over Southeast Asia.jpg|thumb|In-flight formation of 3 LTV A-7Ds (S/N 70-0967, 70-0983 and 71-296) of the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Forward) deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand in December 1972.]]\n\nOn 3 February 1968 the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed to support the [[37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t Air Base]], South Vietnam for five months' Temporary Duty (TDY).\n\nAt the end of the TDY on 5 July, the 355 TFS was permanently assigned to the 37th, with activated New Jersey and [[District of Columbia]] [[Air National Guard]] personnel from the [[113th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at Myrtle Beach replacing them and manning the unit.\n\nOn 15 May 1969 with the reassignment of the [[612th Tactical Fighter Squadron|612th]] and [[174th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s, it was decided to convert the 37th to a [[McDonnell F-4 Phantom II]] wing. The F-100 equipped 355th, along with the [[416th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] were reassigned to the [[31st Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Tuy Hoa Air Base]], replacing the Air National Guard [[136th Tactical Fighter Squadron|136th]] and [[188th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s which were returning to New York and New Mexico, respectively.\n\nAt Tuy Hoa, the tail code of the 355th F-100s was changed to \"SP\", and deployed Air National Guard personnel from New York and New Mexico and regular Air Force personnel manned the 355th until its inactivation on 30 September 1970.\n\nDuring its time in Vietnam, the 355th flew more than 17,000 combat sorties flying close air support, interdiction, search and rescue, and helicopter support missions. The squadron was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. the [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]], and the [[Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross]] with Palm for its service.\n\nOn 1 November 1970, the 355 TFS was reactivated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina as part of the [[354th Tactical Fighter Wing]].  Upon its return, the unit transitioned to the new [[LTV A-7D Corsair II]] aircraft before redeploying to Southeast Asia in the fall of 1972 as the first A-7 unit to fight there. In 10 weeks of combat before the end of that conflict, the squadron participated in the Linebacker II campaign, generated more than 4,000 sorties, and was credited with 22 rescues of downed airmen. The unit returned to Myrtle Beach in April 1974.\n\n===Post-Vietnam era===\n[[File:355th Tactical Fighter Squadron - Group Photo.jpg|thumb|355th Tactical Fighter Squadron Personnel \u2013 March 1991 \u2013 King Fahd International Airport after victory in Operation Desert Storm]]\nIn February 1978, the 355 FS transitioned to the new [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], a [[close air support]] aircraft, becoming the second operational squadron in the nation's first A-10 wing.\n\nDuty called again in August 1990 when the unit deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. There, the squadron's pilots inflicted heavy damage to Iraqi armor and artillery emplacements, helped cut off enemy supply lines, and conducted search and rescue missions. The squadron contributed greatly to the 4,200 artillery, tank and other vehicle kills credited to A-10s during the war.\n\n===Modern era===\nInactivated at Myrtle Beach on 31 March 1992, the 355 FS was reactivated on 20 August 1993, replacing the inactivating 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron at Eleison AFB, Alaska.  The unit's primary missions included air strike control, close air support, interdiction, joint air attack team, escort, and combat search and rescue.\n\nWith a dual role A/OA-10 Warthog squadron commitment and night vision goggles, the squadron had the ability to deploy forward air controllers with attack aircraft for a complete day and night employment capability.\n\n355 FS deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy from January 1996 to March 1997, supporting Operation Joint Guard.  No ordnance was employed, but pilots flew sorties and sat alert with combat loaded aircraft.\n\nThe 355th FS also provided air liaison officers for the 172d Stryker Brigade Combat, providing advice, as ground forward air controllers, on the use of fighters and the tactical employment of close air support assets.\n\nIn October 1998, the 355 FS deployed to support [[Operation Southern Watch]]. Only two months later, the Warthogs saw their second tour of combat duty over Iraq while participating in the 16\u201319 December 1998, [[Operation Desert Fox]] strike missions. In 2.5 months, the 355 FS flew 597 combat and combat support sorties leading up to, then conducting, National Command Authority directed strikes on Iraqi military facilities and suspected weapons of mass destruction storage areas. They achieved 100 percent target hit rate.\n\n[[Image:Eielson looks cold.jpg|thumb|An [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] of the 355th Fighter Squadron sits on the tarmac at Eielson before a mission, 2004]]\nThe unit deployed to [[Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base]], [[Kuwait]], in support of Operation Southern Watch, January\u2013March 2001. The 355 FS also exercised at [[Hurlburt Field]], [[Florida]], to train with Special Forces units, October 2003.\n\nIn Spring 2004 the unit deployed to [[Bagram Air Base]], Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  The unit redeployed there again early 2006.  During both deployments the unit was responsible to provide close air support to Army ground forces and convoys in Afghanistan.\n\n===Base realignment and closure===\nOn 13 May 2005, The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] proposed a major realignment of the base as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|Base Realignment and Closure]] program. The A-10 aircraft were to be distributed to the [[917th Wing]] at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], Louisiana (three aircraft); to a new active-duty unit at [[Moody Air Force Base]], Georgia (12 aircraft); and to backup inventory (three aircraft).\n\nLt Col Quentin \"Q-Tip\" Rideout, 355th Fighter Squadron Commander, flew the last operational A-10 sortie at Eielson AFB on 31 July 2007.\n\nThe last three A-10 aircraft departed Eielson AFB on 15 August 2007.  Lt Col Kevin \"Crotch\" Blanchard flew 81-944, Capt Sean \"Shark\" Hall flew 79-172, and Capt Dale \"Porkchop\" Stark flew 80-259.  Although the aircraft were originally scheduled to depart at 0700, they were delayed until 0830 because of foggy conditions.  Lt Col Blanchard was the first to lift off, followed closely by Capt Hall. When Capt Stark took off, and shortly before disappearing into the clouds, he tipped the wings of his jet, a final farewell salute to Eielson AFB and the 355th Fighter Squadron.\n\n===Current operations===\nIn 2010, Detachment 457, a geographically separated unit of the [[20th Operations Group]] at [[Shaw Air Force Base]], South Carolina, stood up at [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth]], Texas. The unit oversaw the integration of over 130 active-duty [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] pilots and maintenance personnel into the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s [[301st Fighter Wing]] under the Total Force Initiative.<ref name=codeone>{{cite web |url= http://www.codeonemagazine.com/article.html?item_id=120 |last1=Boling|first1=B.J.|title=301st Fighter Wing \u2013 Total Force Integration|date=10 May 2013|publisher=Code One Magazine|url-status=live |accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> On 8 March 2013, the [[495th Fighter Group]] was stood up at Shaw as a dedicated unit overseeing ten active associate fighter units, including Detachment 457. On 5 October 2015, Detachment 457 discontinued and was replaced by the '''355th Fighter Squadron''', which reactivated the same day. It remains under administrative command of the 495th Fighter Group and flies and maintains F-16s assigned to the 301st's [[457th Fighter Squadron]] at Fort Worth.\n\n==Lineage==\n* Constituted as the '''355th Fighter Squadron''' on 12 November 1942\n: Activated on 15 November 1942\n: Redesignated '''355th Fighter Squadron''', Single Engine on 21 August 1944\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1946\n* Redesignated '''355th Fighter-Day Squadron''' on 28 September 1956\n: Activated on 19 November 1956\n: Redesignated '''355th Tactical Fighter Squadron''' on 1 July 1958\n: Inactivated on 30 September 1970\n* Activated on 1 November 1970\n: Redesignated '''355th Fighter Squadron''' on 1 November 1991\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1992\n* Activated on 20 August 1993\n: Inactivated on 15 August 2007\n* Activated on 5 October 2015<ref name=355FSfacts/>\n: Inactivated on 25 October 2019\n\n===Assignments===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* 354th Fighter Group, 15 November 1942 \u2013 31 March 1946\n* 354th Fighter-Day Group, 19 November 1956\n* 354th Fighter-Day Wing (later 354th Tactical Fighter Wing), 25 September 1957\n:: Attached to: [[Seventeenth Air Force]], 15 July \u2013 26 October 1958;

It is an active-duty associate unit administratively assigned to the [[495th Fighter Group]] and operates aircraft assigned to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s [[301st Fighter Wing]]. Prior to its reactivation in 2015, the unit's last assignment was that of a subordinate unit of the [[354th Fighter Wing]] based at [[Eielson Air Force Base]] in [[Alaska]], flying the Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. The squadron was inactivated on 15 August 2007 as a result of [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) 2005.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\nActivated on 15 November 1942 at [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]], California, initially equipped with [[P-39 Airacobra]]s and assigned to [[IV Fighter Command]] for training. Moved to several bases in California and Nevada then to [[Portland Army Air Base]], Oregon in June 1943 and re-equipped with new [[North American P-51B Mustang]]s. Transitioned to the Mustang throughout the summer of 1943 the deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]], being assigned to [[IX Fighter Command]] in England.\n\nIn late 1943, the strategic bombardment campaign over [[Occupied Europe]] and [[Nazi Germany]] being conducted by [[VIII Bomber Command]] was taking heavy losses in aircraft and flight crews as the [[VIII Fighter Command]]'s [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]]s and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s lacked the range to escort the heavy [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers deep into [[Germany]] to attack industrial and military targets. The P-51 had the range to perform the escort duties and the unit's operational control was transferred to Headquarters, [[Eighth Air Force]] to perform escort missions. From its base at [[RAF Boxted]], the unit flew long-range strategic escort missions with VIII Bomber Command groups, escorting the heavy bombers to targets such as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Augsburg, and Schweinfurt, engaging [[Luftwaffe]] day interceptors frequently, with the P-51s outperforming the German [[Bf 109]] and [[Fw 190]] interceptors, causing heavy losses to the Luftwaffe. Remained under operational control of Eighth Air Force until April 1944, when sufficient numbers of P-51D Mustangs and arrived from the United States and were assigned to VIII Fighter Command units for escort duty.\n\nWas relieved from escort duty and was re-equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts, and reassigned to [[RAF Lashenden]] on the southern coast of England.    Mission was redefined to provide tactical air support for the forthcoming invasion of France, to support the Third, and later Ninth United States Armies. Flew fighter sweeps over [[Normandy]] and along the [[English Channel]] coast of France and the Low Countries, April\u2013June 1944, then engaged in heavy tactical bombing of enemy military targets as well as roads, railroads and bridges in the Normandy area to support ground forces in the immediate aftermath of [[D-Day]].\n\n[[File:354fg-p51b.jpg|thumb|left|North American P-51B-1-NA Mustang Serial 43-12408 of the 355th Fighter Squadron, photo probably taken at RAF Boxted, England, early 1944.]]\nMoved to [[Advanced Landing Ground]]s in France beginning at the end of June 1944, moving eastwards to combat airfields and liberated French airports supporting Allied Ground forces as the advanced across Northern France.   Later, in 1944, the squadron became involved in dive-bombing and strafing missions, striking railroad yards, bridges, troop concentrations, and airfields.  Participated in attacks on German forces in Belgium in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Bulge]], then moved eastward as part of the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]]. The squadron flew its last mission of the war on 7 May 1945 from the captured Luftwaffe airfield at [[Ansbach]] (R-45).\n\nRemained in Occupied Germany as part of the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] [[XII Tactical Air Command]] occupying force after the German Capitulation, being stationed at [[AAF Station Herzogenaurach]].  Was inactivated on 31 March 1946.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Cold War===\nReactivated by Tactical Air Command, United States Air Force on 19 November 1956, being assigned to the reactivated [[354th Fighter-Day Group]] at the new [[Myrtle Beach Air Force Base]], South Carolina.   Equipped with [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]] fighters, the squadron participated in exercises, operations, tests, and firepower demonstrations conducted by the [[Tactical Air Command]] within the US and abroad.  The unit frequently deployed to [[Aviano Air Base]], Italy and [[Wheelus Air Base]], Libya.  Was deployed to Europe during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]] and was moved to [[McCoy Air Force Base]], Florida in 1962 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\n===Vietnam War===\n[[Image:F-100D-56-3374-355tfs-PhuCat.jpg|thumb|Former 355 TFS North American F-100D-80-NH \"Super Sabre\" 56-3374 on a mission into [[North Vietnam]] from Phu Cat AB, South Vietnam]]\n[[File:355th Tactical Fighter Squadron A-7D Formation over Southeast Asia.jpg|thumb|In-flight formation of 3 LTV A-7Ds (S/N 70-0967, 70-0983 and 71-296) of the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Forward) deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand in December 1972.]]\n\nOn 3 February 1968 the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed to support the [[37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t Air Base]], South Vietnam for five months' Temporary Duty (TDY).\n\nAt the end of the TDY on 5 July, the 355 TFS was permanently assigned to the 37th, with activated New Jersey and [[District of Columbia]] [[Air National Guard]] personnel from the [[113th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at Myrtle Beach replacing them and manning the unit.\n\nOn 15 May 1969 with the reassignment of the [[612th Tactical Fighter Squadron|612th]] and [[174th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s, it was decided to convert the 37th to a [[McDonnell F-4 Phantom II]] wing. The F-100 equipped 355th, along with the [[416th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] were reassigned to the [[31st Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Tuy Hoa Air Base]], replacing the Air National Guard [[136th Tactical Fighter Squadron|136th]] and [[188th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]s which were returning to New York and New Mexico, respectively.\n\nAt Tuy Hoa, the tail code of the 355th F-100s was changed to \"SP\", and deployed Air National Guard personnel from New York and New Mexico and regular Air Force personnel manned the 355th until its inactivation on 30 September 1970.\n\nDuring its time in Vietnam, the 355th flew more than 17,000 combat sorties flying close air support, interdiction, search and rescue, and helicopter support missions. The squadron was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (US)|Presidential Unit Citation]]. the [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]], and the [[Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross]] with Palm for its service.\n\nOn 1 November 1970, the 355 TFS was reactivated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina as part of the [[354th Tactical Fighter Wing]].  Upon its return, the unit transitioned to the new [[LTV A-7D Corsair II]] aircraft before redeploying to Southeast Asia in the fall of 1972 as the first A-7 unit to fight there. In 10 weeks of combat before the end of that conflict, the squadron participated in the Linebacker II campaign, generated more than 4,000 sorties, and was credited with 22 rescues of downed airmen. The unit returned to Myrtle Beach in April 1974.\n\n===Post-Vietnam era===\n[[File:355th Tactical Fighter Squadron - Group Photo.jpg|thumb|355th Tactical Fighter Squadron Personnel \u2013 March 1991 \u2013 King Fahd International Airport after victory in Operation Desert Storm]]\nIn February 1978, the 355 FS transitioned to the new [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II]], a [[close air support]] aircraft, becoming the second operational squadron in the nation's first A-10 wing.\n\nDuty called again in August 1990 when the unit deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. There, the squadron's pilots inflicted heavy damage to Iraqi armor and artillery emplacements, helped cut off enemy supply lines, and conducted search and rescue missions. The squadron contributed greatly to the 4,200 artillery, tank and other vehicle kills credited to A-10s during the war.\n\n===Modern era===\nInactivated at Myrtle Beach on 31 March 1992, the 355 FS was reactivated on 20 August 1993, replacing the inactivating 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron at Eleison AFB, Alaska.  The unit's primary missions included air strike control, close air support, interdiction, joint air attack team, escort, and combat search and rescue.\n\nWith a dual role A/OA-10 Warthog squadron commitment and night vision goggles, the squadron had the ability to deploy forward air controllers with attack aircraft for a complete day and night employment capability.\n\n355 FS deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy from January 1996 to March 1997, supporting Operation Joint Guard.  No ordnance was employed, but pilots flew sorties and sat alert with combat loaded aircraft.\n\nThe 355th FS also provided air liaison officers for the 172d Stryker Brigade Combat, providing advice, as ground forward air controllers, on the use of fighters and the tactical employment of close air support assets.\n\nIn October 1998, the 355 FS deployed to support [[Operation Southern Watch]]. Only two months later, the Warthogs saw their second tour of combat duty over Iraq while participating in the 16\u201319 December 1998, [[Operation Desert Fox]] strike missions. In 2.5 months, the 355 FS flew 597 combat and combat support sorties leading up to, then conducting, National Command Authority directed strikes on Iraqi military facilities and suspected weapons of mass destruction storage areas. They achieved 100 percent target hit rate.\n\n[[Image:Eielson looks cold.jpg|thumb|An [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] of the 355th Fighter Squadron sits on the tarmac at Eielson before a mission, 2004]]\nThe unit deployed to [[Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base]], [[Kuwait]], in support of Operation Southern Watch, January\u2013March 2001. The 355 FS also exercised at [[Hurlburt Field]], [[Florida]], to train with Special Forces units, October 2003.\n\nIn Spring 2004 the unit deployed to [[Bagram Air Base]], Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  The unit redeployed there again early 2006.  During both deployments the unit was responsible to provide close air support to Army ground forces and convoys in Afghanistan.\n\n===Base realignment and closure===\nOn 13 May 2005, The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] proposed a major realignment of the base as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|Base Realignment and Closure]] program. The A-10 aircraft were to be distributed to the [[917th Wing]] at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]], Louisiana (three aircraft); to a new active-duty unit at [[Moody Air Force Base]], Georgia (12 aircraft); and to backup inventory (three aircraft).\n\nLt Col Quentin \"Q-Tip\" Rideout, 355th Fighter Squadron Commander, flew the last operational A-10 sortie at Eielson AFB on 31 July 2007.\n\nThe last three A-10 aircraft departed Eielson AFB on 15 August 2007.  Lt Col Kevin \"Crotch\" Blanchard flew 81-944, Capt Sean \"Shark\" Hall flew 79-172, and Capt Dale \"Porkchop\" Stark flew 80-259.  Although the aircraft were originally scheduled to depart at 0700, they were delayed until 0830 because of foggy conditions.  Lt Col Blanchard was the first to lift off, followed closely by Capt Hall. When Capt Stark took off, and shortly before disappearing into the clouds, he tipped the wings of his jet, a final farewell salute to Eielson AFB and the 355th Fighter Squadron.\n\n===Current operations===\nIn 2010, Detachment 457, a geographically separated unit of the [[20th Operations Group]] at [[Shaw Air Force Base]], South Carolina, stood up at [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth]], Texas. The unit oversaw the integration of over 130 active-duty [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] pilots and maintenance personnel into the [[Air Force Reserve Command]]'s [[301st Fighter Wing]] under the Total Force Initiative.<ref name=codeone>{{cite web |url= http://www.codeonemagazine.com/article.html?item_id=120 |last1=Boling|first1=B.J.|title=301st Fighter Wing \u2013 Total Force Integration|date=10 May 2013|publisher=Code One Magazine|url-status=live |accessdate=30 January 2019}}</ref> On 8 March 2013, the [[495th Fighter Group]] was stood up at Shaw as a dedicated unit overseeing ten active associate fighter units, including Detachment 457. On 5 October 2015, Detachment 457 discontinued and was replaced by the '''355th Fighter Squadron''', which reactivated the same day. It remains under administrative command of the 495th Fighter Group and flies and maintains F-16s assigned to the 301st's [[457th Fighter Squadron]] at Fort Worth.\n\n==Lineage==\n* Constituted as the '''355th Fighter Squadron''' on 12 November 1942\n: Activated on 15 November 1942\n: Redesignated '''355th Fighter Squadron''', Single Engine on 21 August 1944\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1946\n* Redesignated '''355th Fighter-Day Squadron''' on 28 September 1956\n: Activated on 19 November 1956\n: Redesignated '''355th Tactical Fighter Squadron''' on 1 July 1958\n: Inactivated on 30 September 1970\n* Activated on 1 November 1970\n: Redesignated '''355th Fighter Squadron''' on 1 November 1991\n: Inactivated on 31 March 1992\n* Activated on 20 August 1993\n: Inactivated on 15 August 2007\n* Activated on 5 October 2015<ref name=355FSfacts/>\n: Inactivated on 25 October 2019\n\n===Assignments===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break|width=50%}}\n* 354th Fighter Group, 15 November 1942 \u2013 31 March 1946\n* 354th Fighter-Day Group, 19 November 1956\n* 354th Fighter-Day Wing (later 354th Tactical Fighter Wing), 25 September 1957\n:: Attached to: [[Seventeenth Air Force]], 15 July \u2013 26 October 1958;
