The story signified [[Saul]]'s unfitness to rule, as Saul himself should have fought for [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]].{{sfn|Nelson|2000|p=519}}  Revisionists today believe that the original listed killer of Goliath was [[Elhanan, son of Jair]], and that the authors of the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic_history|Deutoronomic history]] changed the original text to credit the victory to the more famous character, David.{{sfn|Halpern|2003|p=8}} Whereas, Elhanan, son of Jair is credited with killing the brother of Goliath in 1 Chron 20:5. \n\nThe phrase \"[[Goliath#Modern usage of \"David and Goliath\"|David and Goliath]]\" has taken on a more popular meaning, denoting an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary.<ref name=\"oxford\">{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/american_english/david-and-goliath | title=David and Goliath | encyclopedia=Oxford Advanced American Dictionary | accessdate=11 February 2015}} \"used to describe a situation in which a small or weak person or organization tries to defeat another much larger or stronger opponent: ''The game looks like it will be a David and Goliath contest.''\"</ref>\n\n==Biblical account==\n[[File:071A.David Slays Goliath.jpg|thumbnail|David hoists the severed head of Goliath as illustrated by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1866).]]\n\n===The Goliath narrative in 1 Samuel 17===\n[[Saul]] and the [[Israelites]] are facing the [[Philistines]] in the [[Valley of Elah]]. Twice a day for 40 days, morning and evening, Goliath, the [[champion]] of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in [[Single combat#Single combat|single combat]], but Saul is afraid. [[David]], bringing food for his elder brothers on the battlefield, hears that Goliath has defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him, and accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling and five stones from a brook.\n\nDavid and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. \"The Philistine cursed David by his gods\", but David replies: \"This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is God's, and he will give you into our hand.\"\n\nDavid hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites \"as far as [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and the gates of [[Ekron]]\". David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to [[Jerusalem]], and Saul sends [[Abner]] to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers, \"I am the son of your servant [[Jesse]] the [[Bethlehem]]ite.\"\n\n===Composition of the Book of Samuel and the Goliath narrative===\nThe [[Books of Samuel]], together with the books of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]], make up a unified history of Israel which biblical scholars call the [[Deuteronomistic history]]. The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah's King [[Josiah]] (late 7th century BCE) and a revised second edition during the exile (6th century BCE), with further revisions in the post-exilic period.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=2 and fn6}}{{sfn|Person|2010|p=10\u201311}} Traces of this can be seen in the contradictions and illogicalities of the Goliath story - to take a few examples, David turns from Saul's adult shield-bearer into a child herding sheep for his father, Saul finds it necessary to send for him when as the king's shield-bearer he should already be beside his royal master, and then has to ask who David is, which sits strangely with David's status at his court.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=262 fn62}} The Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile:{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=259-260 fn58}} \n:''Original story''\n*The Israelites and Philistines face each other; Goliath makes his challenge to single combat;\n*David volunteers to fight Goliath;\n*David selects five smooth stones from a creek-bed to be used in his [[Sling (weapon)|sling]];\n*David defeats Goliath, the Philistines flee the battlefield.\n:''Additions''\n*David is sent by his father to bring food to his brothers, hears the challenge, and expresses his desire to accept; \n*Details of the account of the battle;\n*Saul asks who David is, and he is introduced to the king through Abner.{{sfn|Johnson|2015|p=10-11}}{{efn|[http://kukis.org/Samuel/1Sam_17.htm#The%20LXX%20%E2%82%AC%20of%20I%20Samuel%2017%20(with%20the%20Missing%20Portions%20in%20Magenta) Compare texts of short and long versions of 1 Samuel 17].}}\n\n==Textual considerations==\n\n=== Goliath's height ===\n[[File:David and Goliath.jpg|thumb|''Goliath laughs at David'', 1915, by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\n[[File:Andrea Vaccaro - David with the Head of Goliath.jpg|thumb|''David with the Head of Goliath'', circa 1635, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]]]\n\nThe oldest manuscripts, namely the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] text of Samuel from the late 1st century BCE, the 1st-century CE historian [[Josephus]], and the major Septuagint manuscripts, all give it as \"four [[cubit]]s and a [[Span (unit)|span]]\" ({{convert|6|ft|9|in|disp=or}}), whereas the [[Masoretic Text]] has \"six cubits and a span\" ({{convert|9|ft|9|in|disp=or}}).<ref>Ehrlich, C.

Saul was chosen to lead the Israelites against their enemies, but when faced with Goliath he refuses to do so; Saul is a very tall man, but Goliath is a giant. Saul's exact height is not given, but he was a head taller than anyone else in all Israel (1 Samuel 9:2), which implies he was over {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall and the obvious challenger for Goliath, yet, David is the one who eventually defeated him. Also, Saul's armour and weaponry are apparently no worse than Goliath's (and David, of course, refuses Saul's armour in any case). \"David declares that when a lion or bear came and attacked his father's sheep, he battled against it and killed it, [but Saul] has been cowering in fear instead of rising up and attacking the threat to his sheep (i.e. Israel).\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/>\n\n=== Elhanan and Goliath ===\n2 Samuel 21:19 tells how Goliath the [[Gittite]] was killed by \"[[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim]], the Bethlehemite.\" Revisionists believe that the original killer of Goliath was Ehanan, and that the authors of the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic_history|Deutoronomic history]] changed the text to credit the victory to the more famous character, David.{{sfn|Halpern|2003|p=8}} The fourth-century BC [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles 20:5]] explains the second Goliath by saying that Elhanan \"slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath\", constructing the name [[Lahmi]] from the last portion of the word \"Bethlehemite\" (\"''beit-ha\u2019lahmi''\"), and the [[King James Bible]] adopted this into 2 Samuel 21:18\u201319, but the Hebrew text at Goliath\u2019s name makes no mention of the word \"brother\".<ref name=Halperin>{{cite book |last1=Halpern |first1=Baruch |title=David's Secret Demons: Messiah, Murderer, Traitor, King |date=2003 |publisher=Wm.

The archaeologists have established that this was one of the largest of the Philistine cities until destroyed in the ninth century BC, an event from which it never recovered. A [[Sherd|potsherd]] discovered at the site, and reliably dated to the tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC, is inscribed with the two names \"alwt\" and \"wlt\". While the names are not directly connected with the biblical Goliath (\"glyt\"), they are etymologically related and demonstrate that the name fits with the context of late-tenth/early-ninth-century BC Philistine culture. The name \"Goliath\" itself is non-Semitic and has been linked with the [[Lydia]]n king [[Alyattes I|Alyattes]], which also fits the Philistine context of the biblical Goliath story.<ref>[http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/comment-on-the-news-item-in-bar-on-the-goliath-inscription/ Tell es-Safi/Gath weblog] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080109230143/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~maeira/Goliath/Goliath%20Inscription.html Bar-Ilan University]; For the editio princeps and an in-depth discussion of the inscription, see now: Maeir, A.M., Wimmer, S.J., Zukerman, A., and Demsky, A.

[[Ruth Rabbah]], a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the [[Book of Ruth]], makes the blood-relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah was said to have made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] Goliath was born by [[polyspermy]], and had about one hundred fathers.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Yebamoth, 24b.</ref>\n\nThe Talmud stresses Goliath's ungodliness: his taunts before the Israelites included the boast that it was he who had captured the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and brought it to the temple of [[Dagon]]; and his challenges to combat were made at morning and evening in order to disturb the Israelites in their prayers. His armour weighed 60 tons, according to rabbi [[Hanina]]; 120, according to rabbi [[Abba bar Kahana]]; and his sword, which became the sword of David, had marvellous powers. On his death it was found that his heart carried the image of Dagon, who thereby also came to a shameful downfall.<ref>For a brief overview of Talmudic traditions on Goliath, see [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=336&letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia, \"Goliath\"].</ref>\n\nIn [[Pseudo-Philo]], believed to have been composed between 135&nbsp;BC and 70&nbsp;AD, David picks up seven stones and writes on them his father's name, his own name, and the name of God, one name per stone; then, speaking to Goliath, he says \"Hear this word before you die: were not the two woman from whom you and I were born, sisters? And your mother was Orpah and my mother Ruth&nbsp;...\" After David strikes Goliath with the stone he runs to Goliath before he dies and Goliath says \"Hurry and kill me and rejoice.\" and David replies \"Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer.\" Goliath sees an angel and tells David that it is not he who has killed him but the angel. Pseudo-Philo then goes on to say that the angel of the Lord changes David's appearance so that no one recognizes him, and thus Saul asks who he is.<ref>Charlesworth, James H. 1983.

This film includes the King of the Philistines saying, \"Goliath has challenged the Israelites six times and no one has responded.\" It is then on the seventh time that David meets his challenge.\n\nThe PBS series ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'' featured Goliath in its first-season episode \"Little Big Dog\".\n\nBig Idea's popular ''[[VeggieTales]]'' episode was called \"[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]\", where [[Phil Vischer]] voiced Goliath.\n\nIn 1972, [[Toho]] and [[Tsuburaya Productions]] collaborated on a film called ''[[Daigoro vs. Goliath]]'', which follows the story relatively closely but recasts the main characters as [[Kaiju]].\n\nIn 1975, Israeli band [[Poogy]] release a song called ''Golyat'' on the album [[Crowded in the Ear|''Tzafoof BaOzen'']], loosely and humorously based on the story.\n\n[[Suzanne Vega]]'s song ''Rock In This Pocket (Song Of David)'' on the album [[99.9F\u00b0|''99.9\u00b0F'']] is based on the story.\n\nIn 2005, Lightstone Studios released a direct-to-DVD movie musical titled \"One Smooth Stone\", which was later changed to \"David and Goliath\".

He possessed amazing strength, and the films were similar in theme to their [[Hercules]] and [[Maciste]] movies. After the classic ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, the 1959 [[Steve Reeves]] film ''Terrore dei Barbari'' (''Terror of the Barbarians'') was retitled ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' in the United States, (after [[Joseph E. Levine]] claimed the sole right to the name of ''Hercules''); the film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not really related to each other. (The 1960 Italian film ''David and Goliath'' starring [[Orson Welles]] was not one of these, since that film was a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical story).\n\nThe four titles in the Italian ''Goliath'' series were as follows:\n \n* ''Goliath contro i giganti''/''[[Goliath Against the Giants]]'' (1960) starring [[Brad Harris]]\n* ''Goliath e la schiava ribelle''/''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Tyrant of Lydia vs. The Son of Hercules'') (1963) starring [[Gordon Scott]]\n* ''Golia e il cavaliere mascherato''/''Goliath and the Masked Rider'' (a.k.a. ''[[Hercules and the Masked Rider]]'')  (1964) starring [[Alan Steel]]\n* ''Golia alla conquista di Bagdad''/''Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad'' (a.k.a. ''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus]]'', 1964) starring [[Peter Lupus]]\n\nThe name Goliath was later inserted into the film titles of three other Italian muscle man movies that were retitled for distribution in the United States in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as Goliath films in Italy.\n\nBoth ''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]'' (1961) and ''[[Goliath and the Sins of Babylon]]'' (1963) actually featured the famed superhero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name Maciste had any meaning to American audiences. ''[[Goliath and the Dragon]]'' (1960) was originally an Italian Hercules film called ''The Revenge of Hercules''.\n\n=={{anchor|David and Goliath}} Modern usage of \"David and Goliath\"==\n{{redirect|David and Goliath}}\nIn modern usage, the phrase \"David and Goliath\" has taken on a secular meaning, denoting an [[Underdog (term)|underdog]] situation, a contest where a smaller, weaker opponent faces a much bigger, stronger adversary; if successful, the underdog may win in an unusual or surprising way.<ref name=\"oxford\" /><ref name=\"macmillan\">{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/david-and-goliath | title=David and Goliath | encyclopedia=Macmillan Dictionary | accessdate=11 February 2015}} \"used for describing a situation in which a small person or organization defeats a much larger one in a surprising way\"</ref> It is arguably the most famous underdog story.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bibleodyssey.org/en/passages/main-articles/david-and-goliath.aspx | title=David and Goliath (1 Sam 17) | publisher=Society of Biblical Literature | accessdate=18 February 2015 | author=Bodner, Keith}}</ref>\n\n[[Theology]] professor Leonard Greenspoon, in his essay, \"David vs. Goliath in the Sports Pages\", explains that \"most writers use the story for its underdog overtones (the little guy wins) ...

Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling and five stones from a brook.\n\nDavid and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. \"The Philistine cursed David by his gods\", but David replies: \"This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, and that all this assembly may know that God saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is God's, and he will give you into our hand.\"\n\nDavid hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites \"as far as [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and the gates of [[Ekron]]\".

The first edition of the history was probably written at the court of Judah's King [[Josiah]] (late 7th century BCE) and a revised second edition during the exile (6th century BCE), with further revisions in the post-exilic period.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=2 and fn6}}{{sfn|Person|2010|p=10\u201311}} Traces of this can be seen in the contradictions and illogicalities of the Goliath story - to take a few examples, David turns from Saul's adult shield-bearer into a child herding sheep for his father, Saul finds it necessary to send for him when as the king's shield-bearer he should already be beside his royal master, and then has to ask who David is, which sits strangely with David's status at his court.{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=262 fn62}} The Goliath story is made up of base-narrative with numerous additions made probably after the exile:{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=259-260 fn58}} \n:''Original story''\n*The Israelites and Philistines face each other; Goliath makes his challenge to single combat;\n*David volunteers to fight Goliath;\n*David selects five smooth stones from a creek-bed to be used in his [[Sling (weapon)|sling]];\n*David defeats Goliath, the Philistines flee the battlefield.\n:''Additions''\n*David is sent by his father to bring food to his brothers, hears the challenge, and expresses his desire to accept; \n*Details of the account of the battle;\n*Saul asks who David is, and he is introduced to the king through Abner.{{sfn|Johnson|2015|p=10-11}}{{efn|[http://kukis.org/Samuel/1Sam_17.htm#The%20LXX%20%E2%82%AC%20of%20I%20Samuel%2017%20(with%20the%20Missing%20Portions%20in%20Magenta) Compare texts of short and long versions of 1 Samuel 17].}}\n\n==Textual considerations==\n\n=== Goliath's height ===\n[[File:David and Goliath.jpg|thumb|''Goliath laughs at David'', 1915, by [[Ilya Repin]]]]\n[[File:Andrea Vaccaro - David with the Head of Goliath.jpg|thumb|''David with the Head of Goliath'', circa 1635, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]]]\n\nThe oldest manuscripts, namely the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] text of Samuel from the late 1st century BCE, the 1st-century CE historian [[Josephus]], and the major Septuagint manuscripts, all give it as \"four [[cubit]]s and a [[Span (unit)|span]]\" ({{convert|6|ft|9|in|disp=or}}), whereas the [[Masoretic Text]] has \"six cubits and a span\" ({{convert|9|ft|9|in|disp=or}}).<ref>Ehrlich, C.

Saul was chosen to lead the Israelites against their enemies, but when faced with Goliath he refuses to do so; Saul is a very tall man, but Goliath is a giant. Saul's exact height is not given, but he was a head taller than anyone else in all Israel (1 Samuel 9:2), which implies he was over {{convert|6|ft|m}} tall and the obvious challenger for Goliath, yet, David is the one who eventually defeated him. Also, Saul's armour and weaponry are apparently no worse than Goliath's (and David, of course, refuses Saul's armour in any case). \"David declares that when a lion or bear came and attacked his father's sheep, he battled against it and killed it, [but Saul] has been cowering in fear instead of rising up and attacking the threat to his sheep (i.e. Israel).\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\"/>\n\n=== Elhanan and Goliath ===\n2 Samuel 21:19 tells how Goliath the [[Gittite]] was killed by \"[[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim]], the Bethlehemite.\" Scholars believe that the original killer of Goliath was Ehanan, and that the authors of the [[Deuteronomist#Deuteronomistic_history|Deutoronomic history]] changed the text to credit the victory to the more famous character, David.{{sfn|Halpern|2003|p=8}} The fourth-century BC [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles 20:5]] explains the second Goliath by saying that Elhanan \"slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath\", constructing the name [[Lahmi]] from the last portion of the word \"Bethlehemite\" (\"''beit-ha\u2019lahmi''\"), and the [[King James Bible]] adopted this into 2 Samuel 21:18\u201319, but the Hebrew text at Goliath\u2019s name makes no mention of the word \"brother\".<ref name=Halperin>{{cite book |last1=Halpern |first1=Baruch |title=David's Secret Demons: Messiah, Murderer, Traitor, King |date=2003 |publisher=Wm.

The archaeologists have established that this was one of the largest of the Philistine cities until destroyed in the ninth century BC, an event from which it never recovered. A [[Sherd|potsherd]] discovered at the site, and reliably dated to the tenth to mid-ninth centuries BC, is inscribed with the two names \"alwt\" and \"wlt\". While the names are not directly connected with the biblical Goliath (\"glyt\"), they are etymologically related and demonstrate that the name fits with the context of late-tenth/early-ninth-century BC Philistine culture. The name \"Goliath\" itself is non-Semitic and has been linked with the [[Lydia]]n king [[Alyattes I|Alyattes]], which also fits the Philistine context of the biblical Goliath story.<ref>[http://gath.wordpress.com/2006/02/16/comment-on-the-news-item-in-bar-on-the-goliath-inscription/ Tell es-Safi/Gath weblog] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20080109230143/http://faculty.biu.ac.il/~maeira/Goliath/Goliath%20Inscription.html Bar-Ilan University]; For the editio princeps and an in-depth discussion of the inscription, see now: Maeir, A.M., Wimmer, S.J., Zukerman, A., and Demsky, A.

[[Ruth Rabbah]], a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the [[Book of Ruth]], makes the blood-relationship even closer, considering Orpah and Ruth to have been full sisters. Orpah was said to have made a pretense of accompanying Ruth but after forty paces left her. Thereafter she led a dissolute life. According to the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] Goliath was born by [[polyspermy]], and had about one hundred fathers.<ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]] Yebamoth, 24b.</ref>\n\nThe Talmud stresses Goliath's ungodliness: his taunts before the Israelites included the boast that it was he who had captured the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and brought it to the temple of [[Dagon]]; and his challenges to combat were made at morning and evening in order to disturb the Israelites in their prayers. His armour weighed 60 tons, according to rabbi [[Hanina]]; 120, according to rabbi [[Abba bar Kahana]]; and his sword, which became the sword of David, had marvellous powers. On his death it was found that his heart carried the image of Dagon, who thereby also came to a shameful downfall.<ref>For a brief overview of Talmudic traditions on Goliath, see [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=336&letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia, \"Goliath\"].</ref>\n\nIn [[Pseudo-Philo]], believed to have been composed between 135&nbsp;BC and 70&nbsp;AD, David picks up seven stones and writes on them his father's name, his own name, and the name of God, one name per stone; then, speaking to Goliath, he says \"Hear this word before you die: were not the two woman from whom you and I were born, sisters? And your mother was Orpah and my mother Ruth&nbsp;...\" After David strikes Goliath with the stone he runs to Goliath before he dies and Goliath says \"Hurry and kill me and rejoice.\" and David replies \"Before you die, open your eyes and see your slayer.\" Goliath sees an angel and tells David that it is not he who has killed him but the angel. Pseudo-Philo then goes on to say that the angel of the Lord changes David's appearance so that no one recognizes him, and thus Saul asks who he is.<ref>Charlesworth, James H. 1983.

This film includes the King of the Philistines saying, \"Goliath has challenged the Israelites six times and no one has responded.\" It is then on the seventh time that David meets his challenge.\n\nThe PBS series ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'' featured Goliath in its first-season episode \"Little Big Dog\".\n\nBig Idea's popular ''[[VeggieTales]]'' episode was called \"[[Dave and the Giant Pickle]]\", where [[Phil Vischer]] voiced Goliath.\n\nIn 1972, [[Toho]] and [[Tsuburaya Productions]] collaborated on a film called ''[[Daigoro vs. Goliath]]'', which follows the story relatively closely but recasts the main characters as [[Kaiju]].\n\nIn 1975, Israeli band [[Poogy]] release a song called ''Golyat'' on the album [[Crowded in the Ear|''Tzafoof BaOzen'']], loosely and humorously based on the story.\n\n[[Suzanne Vega]]'s song ''Rock In This Pocket (Song Of David)'' on the album [[99.9F\u00b0|''99.9\u00b0F'']] is based on the story.\n\nIn 2005, Lightstone Studios released a direct-to-DVD movie musical titled \"One Smooth Stone\", which was later changed to \"David and Goliath\".

He possessed amazing strength, and the films were similar in theme to their [[Hercules]] and [[Maciste]] movies. After the classic ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'' (1958) became a blockbuster sensation in the film industry, the 1959 [[Steve Reeves]] film ''Terrore dei Barbari'' (''Terror of the Barbarians'') was retitled ''[[Goliath and the Barbarians]]'' in the United States, (after [[Joseph E. Levine]] claimed the sole right to the name of ''Hercules''); the film was so successful at the box office, it inspired Italian filmmakers to do a series of four more films featuring a beefcake hero named Goliath, although the films were not really related to each other. (The 1960 Italian film ''David and Goliath'' starring [[Orson Welles]] was not one of these, since that film was a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical story).\n\nThe four titles in the Italian ''Goliath'' series were as follows:\n \n* ''Goliath contro i giganti''/''[[Goliath Against the Giants]]'' (1960) starring [[Brad Harris]]\n* ''Goliath e la schiava ribelle''/''[[Goliath and the Rebel Slave]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Tyrant of Lydia vs. The Son of Hercules'') (1963) starring [[Gordon Scott]]\n* ''Golia e il cavaliere mascherato''/''Goliath and the Masked Rider'' (a.k.a. ''[[Hercules and the Masked Rider]]'')  (1964) starring [[Alan Steel]]\n* ''Golia alla conquista di Bagdad''/''Goliath at the Conquest of Baghdad'' (a.k.a. ''[[Goliath at the Conquest of Damascus]]'', 1964) starring [[Peter Lupus]]\n\nThe name Goliath was later inserted into the film titles of three other Italian muscle man movies that were retitled for distribution in the United States in an attempt to cash in on the Goliath craze, but these films were not originally made as Goliath films in Italy.\n\nBoth ''[[Goliath and the Vampires]]'' (1961) and ''[[Goliath and the Sins of Babylon]]'' (1963) actually featured the famed superhero Maciste in the original Italian versions, but American distributors did not feel the name Maciste had any meaning to American audiences.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.

Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.

Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

He was the sixth king of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. The fourth son of [[Edward I]], Edward became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne following the death of his elder brother [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester|Alphonso]]. Beginning in 1300, Edward accompanied his father on [[Wars of Scottish Independence|campaigns to pacify Scotland]]. In 1306, he was [[knight]]ed in a [[Feast of the Swans|grand ceremony]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Following his father's death, Edward succeeded to the throne in 1307. He married [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the daughter of the powerful King [[Philip IV of France]], in 1308, as part of a long-running effort to resolve tensions between the English and French crowns.\n\nEdward had a close and controversial relationship with [[Piers Gaveston]], who had joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of their relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, lovers or [[sworn brothers]]. Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s 1592 play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', along with other plays, films, novels and media. Gaveston's power as Edward's [[favourite]] provoked discontent among both the [[baron]]s and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to [[exile]] him. On Gaveston's return, the barons pressured the king into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms, called the [[Ordinances of 1311]]. The newly empowered barons banished Gaveston, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confrontation. English forces were pushed back in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by [[Robert the Bruce]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. [[Great Famine of 1315\u201317|Widespread famine]] followed, and criticism of the king's reign mounted.\n\nThe Despenser family, in particular [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], became close friends and advisers to Edward, but Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands in 1321, and forced the king to exile them. In response, Edward led a [[Despenser War|short military campaign]], capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, formally revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a [[War of Saint-Sardos#Aftermath|peace treaty]] in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Instead, she allied herself with the exiled [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and [[Invasion of England (1326)|invaded England]] with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled to Wales, where he was captured in November. The king was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his 14-year-old son, [[Edward III]], and he died in [[Berkeley Castle]] on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.\n\nEdward's contemporaries criticised his performance as king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of [[Parliament of England|parliamentary institutions]] during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate over his perceived failures has continued into the 21st century.\n\n==Background==\nEdward II was the fourth son<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=3}}</ref> of [[Edward I, King of England]], [[Lord of Ireland]], and ruler of [[Gascony]] in south-western France (which he held as the [[feudal]] vassal of the [[king of France]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> and [[Eleanor, Countess of Ponthieu]] in northern France. Eleanor was from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] royal family. Edward I proved a successful military leader, leading the [[Second Barons' War|suppression of the baronial revolts]] in the 1260s and joining the [[Ninth Crusade]].<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=33}}</ref> During the 1280s he [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|conquered North Wales]], removing the [[Welsh people|native Welsh]] princes from power and, in the 1290s, he [[Wars of Scottish Independence|intervened in Scotland's civil war]], claiming [[suzerainty]] over the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> He was considered an extremely successful ruler by his contemporaries, largely able to control the powerful [[earl]]s that formed the senior ranks of the English nobility.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Given-Wilson|1996|pp=29\u201330}}</ref> The historian [[Michael Prestwich]] describes Edward I as \"a king to inspire fear and respect\", while [[John Gillingham]] characterises him as an efficient bully.<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=5}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/history/article750063.ece | title=Hard on Wales |mode=cs2 | accessdate=22 April 2014 | last1= Gillingham| first1= John | website=Times Literary Supplement | publisher=Times Literary Supplement | date = 11 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nDespite Edward I's successes, when he died in 1307 he left a range of challenges for his son to resolve.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=25}}</ref> One of the most critical was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward I's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died.<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=241}}</ref> His control of Gascony created tension with the French kings.<ref name=Brown1988P575>{{harvnb|Brown|1988|p=575}}</ref> They insisted that the English kings give [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved.<ref name=Brown1988P575/> Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around \u00a3200,000 on his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=30\u201331, 93\u201394}}</ref>{{refn|It is impossible to accurately convert sums of medieval money into modern incomes and prices.

One line of argument stemmed from the 1259 treaty agreed by Edward's grandfather, Henry III, under which Henry had agreed to give homage for Gascony; Edward's lawyers observed that this treaty, which underpinned Edward's 1303 treaty with France, had been a bilateral agreement between the two kings, rather than a conventional feudal agreement. As such, Edward's offering homage for Gascony was dependent on the French crown delivering on its own commitments, rather than an absolute duty. Edward's lawyers also argued that Isabella had a potential claim to the lands in the south under customary French law. When granting Gascony to Isabella, Phillip IV appeared to have been dividing up his lands, as was customary at the time, rather than giving a conditional grant, which meant that Gascony was an [[allod]], Edward's personal property, and as such not subject to the French king's laws on the carrying of weapons or money.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=322, 387}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=19\u201320, 305\u2013306}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nEdward now expected Isabella and their son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=485\u2013486}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=169}}</ref> Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage appears to have been successful, but by the time Isabella left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref> Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=75\u201377}}</ref> When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=437\u2013438}}</ref> She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324.

1284&nbsp;\u2013 21 September 1327), also called '''Edward of Carnarvon''', was [[King of England]] from 1307 until he was [[deposed]] in January 1327. He was the sixth king of the [[House of Plantagenet]]. The fourth son of [[Edward I]], Edward became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne following the death of his elder brother [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester|Alphonso]]. Beginning in 1300, Edward accompanied his father on [[Wars of Scottish Independence|campaigns to pacify Scotland]]. In 1306, he was [[knight]]ed in a [[Feast of the Swans|grand ceremony]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]. Following his father's death, Edward succeeded to the throne in 1307. He married [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the daughter of the powerful King [[Philip IV of France]], in 1308, as part of a long-running effort to resolve tensions between the English and French crowns.\n\nEdward had a close and controversial relationship with [[Piers Gaveston]], who had joined his household in 1300. The precise nature of their relationship is uncertain; they may have been friends, lovers or [[sworn brothers]]. Edward's relationship with Gaveston inspired [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s 1592 play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', along with other plays, films, novels and media. Gaveston's power as Edward's [[favourite]] provoked discontent among both the [[baron]]s and the French royal family, and Edward was forced to [[exile]] him. On Gaveston's return, the barons pressured the king into agreeing to wide-ranging reforms, called the [[Ordinances of 1311]]. The newly empowered barons banished Gaveston, to which Edward responded by revoking the reforms and recalling his favourite. Led by Edward's cousin, [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], a group of the barons seized and executed Gaveston in 1312, beginning several years of armed confrontation. English forces were pushed back in Scotland, where Edward was decisively defeated by [[Robert the Bruce]] at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314. [[Great Famine of 1315\u201317|Widespread famine]] followed, and criticism of the king's reign mounted.\n\nThe Despenser family, in particular [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], became close friends and advisers to Edward, but Lancaster and many of the barons seized the Despensers' lands in 1321, and forced the king to exile them. In response, Edward led a [[Despenser War|short military campaign]], capturing and executing Lancaster. Edward and the Despensers strengthened their grip on power, formally revoking the 1311 reforms, executing their enemies and confiscating estates. Unable to make progress in Scotland, Edward finally signed a truce with Robert. Opposition to the regime grew, and when Isabella was sent to France to negotiate a [[War of Saint-Sardos#Aftermath|peace treaty]] in 1325, she turned against Edward and refused to return. Instead, she allied herself with the exiled [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], and [[Invasion of England (1326)|invaded England]] with a small army in 1326. Edward's regime collapsed and he fled to Wales, where he was captured in November. The king was forced to relinquish his crown in January 1327 in favour of his 14-year-old son, [[Edward III]], and he died in [[Berkeley Castle]] on 21 September, probably murdered on the orders of the new regime.\n\nEdward's contemporaries criticised his performance as king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of [[Parliament of England|parliamentary institutions]] during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate over his perceived failures has continued into the 21st century.\n\n==Background==\nEdward II was the fourth son<ref>{{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=3}}</ref> of [[Edward I, King of England]], [[Lord of Ireland]], and ruler of [[Gascony]] in south-western France (which he held as the [[feudal]] vassal of the [[king of France]]),<ref>{{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|pp=13\u201314}}</ref> and [[Eleanor, Countess of Ponthieu]] in northern France. Eleanor was from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castilian]] royal family.

As such, Edward's offering homage for Gascony was dependent on the French crown delivering on its own commitments, rather than an absolute duty. Edward's lawyers also argued that Isabella had a potential claim to the lands in the south under customary French law. When granting Gascony to Isabella, Phillip IV appeared to have been dividing up his lands, as was customary at the time, rather than giving a conditional grant, which meant that Gascony was an [[allod]], Edward's personal property, and as such not subject to the French king's laws on the carrying of weapons or money.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=322, 387}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|pp=19\u201320, 305\u2013306}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nEdward now expected Isabella and their son to return to England, but instead she remained in France and showed no intention of making her way back.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=485\u2013486}}; {{harvnb|Haines|2003|p=169}}</ref> Until 1322, Edward and Isabella's marriage appears to have been successful, but by the time Isabella left for France in 1325, it had deteriorated.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> Isabella appears to have disliked Hugh Despenser the Younger intensely, not least because of his abuse of high-status women.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=74\u201375}}</ref> Isabella was embarrassed that she had fled from Scottish armies three times during her marriage to Edward, and she blamed Hugh for the final occurrence in 1322.<ref>{{harvnb|Doherty|2004|pp=75\u201377}}</ref> When Edward had negotiated the recent truce with Robert the Bruce, he had severely disadvantaged a range of noble families who owned land in Scotland, including the Beaumonts, close friends of Isabella's.<ref>{{harvnb|Phillips|2011|pp=437\u2013438}}</ref> She was also angry about the arrest of her household and seizure of her lands in 1324.

{"title_page": "La Llorona", "text_new": "{{short description|Latin American ghost legend}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}\n{{rewrite|date=January 2018}}\n}}\n[[Image:llorona.jpg|thumb|Actors representing ''La Llorona'', 2003]]\n\nIn Latin American folklore, specifically Mexican, '''La Llorona''' ({{IPA-es|la \u029do\u02c8\u027eona|pron}}; \"The Weeping Woman\" or \"the Cryer\") is an oral legend about the ghost of a woman who steals children to drown them. There are multiple variations of this, as is common among oral traditions.\n\nIn one variation the lore states that after giving birth to, and raising two sons, an aging wife felt that her husband fell out of love with her and only loved their sons.

Based on the tale of La Llorona, it tells of a family that is cursed by the evil spirit of Luisa, this story's \"weeping woman\". The film was filmed on location in Guanajuato, Mexico. \n\nThe plot of the 1961 [[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican film]] ''[[The Curse of the Crying Woman]]'' ''(La maldici\u00f3n de la llorona)'' involves the resurrection of the spirit of La Llorona.\n\nLa Llorona appeared as the main antagonist in the 2007 movie ''[[J-ok'el]]''.\n\nLa Llorona appeared as the first antagonist in the 2005 [[Pilot (Supernatural)|pilot]] episode of the TV series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''. [[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character [[Sam Winchester]] destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright [[Josefina L\u00f3pez]] wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938 amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker. The play is well noted for its sympathetic portrayal of La Llorona as a victim of oppression.\n\nIn [[Nancy Farmer]]'s 2002 science fiction novel, ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'', and its 2013 sequel book, ''[[The Lord of Opium]]'', the main character, Matt, makes several references to La Llorona, often when retelling the story to other main characters or during self-reflection.\n\nThe 2006 Mexican horror film ''[[Kilometer 31]]'' is inspired by the legend of La Llorona, and the main evil entity in the film is based on her and her story.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nLa Llorona has also been the theme character of several of [[Universal Studios]]'s haunted houses during their annual Halloween event, [[Halloween Horror Nights]] (Both Hollywood and Orlando locations).<ref>{{cite web|title=La Llorona comes to \"Halloween Horror Nights\"|url=http://www.latimes.com/visuals/video/65277378-132.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, [[James Wan]], [[Gary Dauberman]] and Emilie Gladstone produced a film titled ''[[The Curse of La Llorona]]''.

There are multiple variations of this, as is common among oral traditions.\n\nIn one variation the lore states that after giving birth to, and raising two sons, an aging wife felt that her husband fell out of love with her and only loved their sons. After catching her husband cheating on her with a younger woman she was consumed by grief and anger, so she drowned her sons in a river to punish her husband, then drowned herself as well. She was refused entry to Heaven and sent to Hell where she was tricked by a demon that told her her son's souls were lost, but she would be granted entry to Heaven if she found their lost souls and brought them to Heaven where they belonged.

[Miguel Le\u00f3n Portilla- Visi\u00f3n de los Vencidos, p. 21].\n\nStories of weeping female phantoms are common in the folklore of both [[Europe]]an and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] cultures.

As Bacil Kirtley (1960) wrote in Western Folklore, \"During the same decade that {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was first mentioned in Mexico, a story, seemingly already quite old, of '{{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}}' ('The White Lady')\u2014which reproduces many of the features consistently recurring in the more developed versions of '{{lang|es|La Llorona}}', was recorded in Germany\"; references to {{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}} date back as early as 1486. The story of the White Lady follows a virtually identical plot to the classical {{lang|es|La Llorona}} story.}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest published reference to {{lang|es|La Llorona}} occurred in a sonnet written by Mexican poet [[Manuel Carpio]] in the late 1800s. The poem makes no reference to infanticide, rather {{lang|es|La Llorona}} is identified as the ghost of a woman who was murdered by her husband.{{sfn|Werner|1997|p=753}}\n\n===Similar folktales===\nThe [[Chumash people|Chumash]] of Southern California have their own connection to {{lang|es|La Llorona}}.

[[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character [[Sam Winchester]] destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright [[Josefina L\u00f3pez]] wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938 amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker. The play is well noted for its sympathetic portrayal of La Llorona as a victim of oppression.\n\nIn [[Nancy Farmer]]'s 2002 science fiction novel, ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'', and its 2013 sequel book, ''[[The Lord of Opium]]'', the main character, Matt, makes several references to La Llorona, often when retelling the story to other main characters or during self-reflection.\n\nThe 2006 Mexican horror film ''[[Kilometer 31]]'' is inspired by the legend of La Llorona, and the main evil entity in the film is based on her and her story.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nLa Llorona has also been the theme character of several of [[Universal Studios]]'s haunted houses during their annual Halloween event, [[Halloween Horror Nights]] (Both Hollywood and Orlando locations).<ref>{{cite web|title=La Llorona comes to \"Halloween Horror Nights\"|url=http://www.latimes.com/visuals/video/65277378-132.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, [[James Wan]], [[Gary Dauberman]] and Emilie Gladstone produced a film titled ''[[The Curse of La Llorona]]''.
