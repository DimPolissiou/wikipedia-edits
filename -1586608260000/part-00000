''Drum'' is a [[museum ship]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]], at [[Battleship Memorial Park]].\n\n''Drum'' was laid down on 11 September 1940 at [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]], [[Kittery, Maine]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 May 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Beatrice M. Holcomb, wife of Major General [[Thomas Holcomb]], Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. The boat was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 November 1941, with [[Commander]] [[Robert H. Rice]] in command.\n\n''Drum'' was the twelfth of the ''Gato'' class but was the first completed and the first to enter combat in [[World War II]]. She is the oldest of her class still in existence.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===World War II===\n[[Image:USS Drum (SS-228).png|left|''Drum'', c. 1943]]\n\n===First patrol===\n''Drum'' arrived at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on 1 April 1942, and after a voyage to [[Midway Atoll]], departed Pearl Harbor on 14 April on her first war patrol. Cruising off the coast of [[Japan]], she sank the Japanese [[seaplane tender]] [[Japanese_seaplane_carrier_Mizuho|''Mizuho'']] on 2 May and afterwards endured a 16-hour [[depth charge]] attack consisting of 31 depth charges. Later that month she sank three cargo ships before returning to Pearl Harbor on 12 June to refit.\n\n===Second patrol===\n''Drum''{{'}}s second war patrol, which she made in the waters between [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Kavieng]] from 10 July{{spaced ndash}}2 September, found her efforts frustrated by poor torpedo performance, but she damaged one freighter before returning to Midway to refit.\n\n===Third patrol===\nThe submarine sailed from Midway on 23 September on her third war patrol, bound for the eastern coast of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. On 8 October, she contacted a convoy of four freighters, and defying the air cover guarding the ships, sank the 5652 ton cargo/passenger ship IJA ''Hague Maru'' laden with 4000 tons of wheat, machines, steel, oil, automobiles and captured paper money for the Formosa bank, before aerial bombs forced her deep. The next day, ''Drum'' underwent a severe depth charging from several escorts after she attacked and sank the 2461 ton cargo ship ''Hachimanzan Maru''.  On 20 October, she sank the 5106 ton ''Ryunan Maru'', one of three air-escorted cargo ships, and damaged at least two more ships before completing her patrol at Pearl Harbor on 8 November.\n\n===Fourth patrol===\nOn her fourth patrol, 29 November 1942{{spaced ndash}}24 January 1943, ''Drum'' carried out the demanding task of planting mines in heavily traveled [[Bungo Suido]]. On 12 December, she spotted the Japanese aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Ry\u016bh\u014d|Ry\u016bh\u014d]], which had a full deck-load of planes. Although taking water forward due to faulty valves, ''Drum'' launched torpedoes at this choice target, scoring two hits, and causing the carrier to list so far that her flight deck became completely visible. Also visible was a destroyer bearing down, and splashes that indicated ''Drum''{{'}}s periscope was under fire. As the submarine dove, she lost depth control and her port shaft stopped turning. As she made emergency repairs, she underwent two waves of depth charging. When she surfaced several hours later to see what had become of her prey, which had escaped, an aircraft forced her down again. During this patrol, ''Drum'' also damaged a large tanker, another choice target.\n\n===Fifth and sixth patrols===\nAfter a thorough overhaul at Pearl Harbor, ''Drum'' made her fifth war patrol, 24 March{{spaced ndash}}13 May, searching waters south of Truk after she had completed a photographic reconnaissance of [[Nauru]]. She sank the cargo vessel ''Yuzan (Oyama) Maru'' of 3809 tons on 9 April, and on 18 April she sank the 6380 ton cargo ship ''Nisshun Maru'', carrying a cargo of ammunition, then refitted at [[Brisbane]], Australia. Her sixth war patrol, 7 June{{spaced ndash}}26 July, found her north of the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], where on 17 June she found a 3 ship convoy consisting of 2 cargo ships under escort by a destroyer and sank the 5086 ton cargo-passenger ship ''Myoko Maru''.\n\n===Seventh patrol===\nShe returned to Brisbane to replenish, and on 16 August sailed on her seventh war patrol. She damaged the 6439 ton cargo ship ''Yamagiri Maru'', carrying a load of raw materials for the war effort, with two torpedoes on 28 August. Adding to her impressive list of sinkings, she sank the 1334 ton cargo ship ''Hakutetsu Maru #13'' on 8 September, as well and patrolled off [[New Georgia]] during the landings there. She put into [[Tulagi]] from 29 September{{spaced ndash}}2 October to repair her [[gyrocompass]], then sailed on to Brisbane.\n\n===Eighth patrol===\n''Drum'' sailed on 2 November for her eighth war patrol, coordinated with the landings at [[Cape Torokina]]. Patrolling between the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] and [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], she sank the submarine tender ''[[Hie Maru]]'' (11,621 tons) on 17 November, and on 22 November attacked a convoy of four freighters. The convoy's escorts delivered three depth charge attacks. ''Drum'' was heavily damaged and ordered to Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 5 December; inspection revealed that the [[conning tower]] needed to be replaced, which required that she sail to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].\n\n===Ninth patrol===\nReturning to Pearl Harbor on 29 March 1944, ''Drum'' sailed 11 days later on her ninth war patrol, during which she patrolled the waters around [[Iwo Jima]] and other islands in the [[Bonin Islands]]. No worthy targets were contacted, but a reconnaissance of [[Chichi Jima]] gained valuable intelligence for bombardment of the island later by surface ships.\n\n===Tenth and Eleventh patrols===\nThe submarine refitted at [[Majuro]] from 31 May{{spaced ndash}}24 June, then sailed on her 10th war patrol to give lifeguard service for raids on [[Yap]] and [[Palau]]. She sank a 125-ton ''[[sampan]]'' on 29 July, capturing two prisoners whom she brought back to Pearl Harbor on 14 August. She sailed for [[Surigao Strait]] on 9 September on her 11th war patrol, and after two weeks in the Strait with no contact, she was ordered north to the [[South China Sea]]. Here she patrolled during the [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] landings and the decisive [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and on 24 October sank the passenger-cargo ship ''Shikisan Maru'' (4725 tons). On 26 October ''Drum'', made contact with a 13 ship convoy (10 merchant with 3 escorts)  sinking two passenger-cargo ships, ''Taihaku Maru'' (6886 tons), ''Taisho Maru'' (6886 tons), and one transport ship, ''Tatsura Maru'', (6420 tons), also damaging another passenger-cargo ship, ''Aoki Maru'' (3710 tons), bound for the [[Philippines]] with Japanese reinforcements. While sailing for Majuro for refit, ''Drum'' searched east of [[Luzon Strait]] for downed aviators.\n\n===Twelfth, Thirteenth and last patrols===\n''Drum'' replenished and made repairs at Majuro from 8 November{{spaced ndash}}7 December, then sailed for the [[Nansei Shoto]] on her 12th war patrol. Only one contact was made during this patrol, and she returned to [[Guam]] on 17 January 1945. During her 13th war patrol, from 11 February{{spaced ndash}}2 April, ''Drum'' played a part in the assaults on both Iwo Jima and [[Okinawa]], providing lifeguard service for air strikes on the Nansei Shoto and the Japanese home islands as bases were neutralized before both invasions. Returning to Pearl Harbor, ''Drum'' sailed to the West Coast for another overhaul, and after training at Pearl Harbor, cleared Midway on 9 August on what would have been her 14th war patrol. This was cut short by the [[Japanese surrender]] on 15 August. She proceeded to [[Saipan]] at the end of hostilities, and from there sailed for Pearl Harbor, the [[Panama Canal Zone]], and [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].\n\n===Post-War===\n''Drum'' was decommissioned on 16 February 1946 and on 18 March 1947, began service at [[Washington, D.C.]], to members of the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in the [[Potomac River Naval Command]], which continued through 1967. She was in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|inactive Fleet]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] from 1967 to 1969.\n\n==Awards==\n''Drum'' received a total of 12 [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service. She is credited with sinking 15 ships,<ref>http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJN/JANAC-Losses/JANAC-Losses-6.html</ref> a total of 80,580 tons of enemy shipping, eighth highest of all US submarines in total Japanese tonnage sunk.\n\n==Museum ship and landmark==\n\n''Drum'' was donated to the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)#Museum ship|USS ''Alabama'' Battleship Commission]] on 14 April 1969. She was towed to [[Battleship Memorial Park|Battleship Alabama Memorial Park]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]] arriving on 18 May 1969. ''Drum'' was dedicated and opened to the public on 4 July 1969.\n\nThe submarine was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv2\">\n{{cite web\n|url={{NHLS url|id=86000086}}\n|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: USS Drum (SS-228)\n|format=pdf\n|date=May 1985\n|first=Harry A.\n|last=Butowsky\n|publisher=[[National Park Service]]\n|accessdate=2009-06-22\n}} and<br /> {{cite web\n|url={{NHLS url|id=86000086|photos=y}}\n|format=pdf\n|title=Accompanying 4 photos, 1 exterior and 3 interior, from 1985\n|accessdate=2012-08-29\n}}</ref>\n\n''Drum'' was moored in the waters behind ''Alabama'', until she was substantially damaged by the [[storm surge]] of [[Hurricane Georges]] in 1998. As a result, she is now on display on shore. ''Alabama'' and ''Drum'' also sustained damage when [[Hurricane Katrina]] came ashore on 29 August 2005. Tours on board ''Drum'' resumed 9 January 2006. Most funding to maintain the submarine comes from a community of American Submarine Vets.\n\nAs of 2015, the ''Drum'''s restoration has progressed at an extraordinary rate, including the complete rebuilding of part of the bow and stern sections and the installation of new I-beams inside the ballast tanks to support the submarine's overall weight.<ref>http://www.drum228.org/restoration.html</ref>\n<gallery class=\"center\"  widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:USS Drum.jpg|''Drum'' in 1983, prior to her relocation\n\nFile:USS Drum SS-228 Tower.jpeg|''Drum'' Topside\nFile:USS Drum SS-228 Forward Torpedo room.jpeg|''Drum'' Forward Torpedo room\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The ''Drum'''s Periscope is aimed directly at the stern of the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS ''Alabama'']]\n*[[Wayne Green]], founder of Byte magazine (among others) was a crew member.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of most successful American submarines in World War II]]\n*[[List of National Historic Landmarks in Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/d/drum.html}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ussalabama.com/ Battleship Memorial Park]\n*[http://www.drum228.org/ Drum228.org:  USS ''Drum'' WWII war patrol reports, WWII crew list, historical information, restoration]\n*[http://www.pigboats.com/ww2/drum.html Kill record:  USS ''Drum'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053125/http://www.ussdrum228story.com/ ''The Untold Story'' USS ''Drum'' (SS-228) documentary]\n{{commons category}}\n*{{hnsa|uss-drum-ss-228}}\n*{{navsource|08/08228|USS Drum}}\n*[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/submar/ss228.txt hazegray.org: USS ''Drum'']\n\n{{Gato class_submarine}}\n{{Surviving ocean going ships}}\n{{Mobile attractions}}\n{{NRHP in Mobile, Alabama}}\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum (Ss-228)}}\n[[Category:1941 ships]]\n[[Category:Gato-class submarines]]\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in Alabama]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Mobile, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Kittery, Maine]]\n[[Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama]]\n[[Category:World War II submarines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "{{other ships|USS Drum}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n|+USS ''Drum'' (SS-228)\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=[[Image:USS Drum SS-228 in Mobile.jpg|300px|USS ''Drum'' (SS-228) on display as a museum ship]]\n|Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=United States\n|Ship flag={{USN flag|1946}}\n|Ship name=\n|Ship namesake=[[Sciaenidae|Drum, Fish]]\n|Ship ordered=12 June 1940\n|Ship builder=[[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]], [[Kittery, Maine]]<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\">\n {{cite book\n |last=Friedman\n |first=Norman\n |title=U.S. Submarines Through 1945: An Illustrated Design History\n |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute]]\n |year=1995\n |location=[[Annapolis, Maryland]]\n |pages=285\u2013304\n |isbn=1-55750-263-3\n }}</ref>\n|Ship laid down=11 September 1940<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship launched=12 May 1941<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship sponsor=Mrs. Thomas Holcomb\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned=1 November 1941<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship decommissioned=16 February 1946<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship struck=30 June 1968<ref name=\"FriedmanSubs1-dates\"/>\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship status=[[Museum ship]] at [[Mobile, Alabama]]<ref name=\"Register\">\n {{cite book\n |last=Bauer\n |first=K.

She arrived there on 5 December; inspection revealed that the [[conning tower]] needed to be replaced, which required that she sail to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].\n\n===Ninth patrol===\nReturning to Pearl Harbor on 29 March 1944, ''Drum'' sailed 11 days later on her ninth war patrol, during which she patrolled the waters around [[Iwo Jima]] and other islands in the [[Bonin Islands]]. No worthy targets were contacted, but a reconnaissance of [[Chichi Jima]] gained valuable intelligence for bombardment of the island later by surface ships.\n\n===Tenth and Eleventh patrols===\nThe submarine refitted at [[Majuro]] from 31 May{{spaced ndash}}24 June, then sailed on her 10th war patrol to give lifeguard service for raids on [[Yap]] and [[Palau]]. She sank a 125-ton ''[[sampan]]'' on 29 July, capturing two prisoners whom she brought back to Pearl Harbor on 14 August. She sailed for [[Surigao Strait]] on 9 September on her 11th war patrol, and after two weeks in the Strait with no contact, she was ordered north to the [[South China Sea]]. Here she patrolled during the [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] landings and the decisive [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]], and on 24 October sank the passenger-cargo ship ''Shikisan Maru'' (4725 tons). On 26 October ''Drum'', made contact with a 13 ship convoy (10 merchant with 3 escorts)  sinking two passenger-cargo ships, ''Taihaku Maru'' (6886 tons), ''Taisho Maru'' (6886 tons), and one transport ship, ''Tatsura Maru'', (6420 tons), also damaging another passenger-cargo ship, ''Aoki Maru'' (3710 tons), bound for the [[Philippines]] with Japanese reinforcements. While sailing for Majuro for refit, ''Drum'' searched east of [[Luzon Strait]] for downed aviators.\n\n===Twelfth, Thirteenth and last patrols===\n''Drum'' replenished and made repairs at Majuro from 8 November{{spaced ndash}}7 December, then sailed for the [[Nansei Shoto]] on her 12th war patrol. Only one contact was made during this patrol, and she returned to [[Guam]] on 17 January 1945. During her 13th war patrol, from 11 February{{spaced ndash}}2 April, ''Drum'' played a part in the assaults on both Iwo Jima and [[Okinawa]], providing lifeguard service for air strikes on the Nansei Shoto and the Japanese home islands as bases were neutralized before both invasions. Returning to Pearl Harbor, ''Drum'' sailed to the West Coast for another overhaul, and after training at Pearl Harbor, cleared Midway on 9 August on what would have been her 14th war patrol. This was cut short by the [[Japanese surrender]] on 15 August. She proceeded to [[Saipan]] at the end of hostilities, and from there sailed for Pearl Harbor, the [[Panama Canal Zone]], and [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]].\n\n===Post-War===\n''Drum'' was decommissioned on 16 February 1946 and on 18 March 1947, began service at [[Washington, D.C.]], to members of the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] in the [[Potomac River Naval Command]], which continued through 1967. She was in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|inactive Fleet]] at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] from 1967 to 1969.\n\n==Awards==\n''Drum'' received a total of 12 [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service. She is credited with sinking 15 ships,<ref>http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/IJN/JANAC-Losses/JANAC-Losses-6.html</ref> a total of 80,580 tons of enemy shipping, eighth highest of all US submarines in total Japanese tonnage sunk.\n\n==Museum ship and landmark==\n\n''Drum'' was donated to the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)#Museum ship|USS ''Alabama'' Battleship Commission]] on 14 April 1969. She was towed to [[Battleship Memorial Park|Battleship Alabama Memorial Park]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]] arriving on 18 May 1969. ''Drum'' was dedicated and opened to the public on 4 July 1969.\n\nThe submarine was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1986.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv2\">\n{{cite web\n|url={{NHLS url|id=86000086}}\n|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: USS Drum (SS-228)\n|format=pdf\n|date=May 1985\n|first=Harry A.\n|last=Butowsky\n|publisher=[[National Park Service]]\n|accessdate=2009-06-22\n}} and<br /> {{cite web\n|url={{NHLS url|id=86000086|photos=y}}\n|format=pdf\n|title=Accompanying 4 photos, 1 exterior and 3 interior, from 1985\n|accessdate=2012-08-29\n}}</ref>\n\n''Drum'' was moored in the waters behind ''Alabama'', until she was substantially damaged by the [[storm surge]] of [[Hurricane Georges]] in 1998. As a result, she is now on display on shore. ''Alabama'' and ''Drum'' also sustained damage when [[Hurricane Katrina]] came ashore on 29 August 2005. Tours on board ''Drum'' resumed 9 January 2006. Most funding to maintain the submarine comes from a community of American Submarine Vets.\n\nAs of 2015, the ''Drum'''s restoration has progressed at an extraordinary rate, including the complete rebuilding of part of the bow and stern sections and the installation of new I-beams inside the ballast tanks to support the submarine's overall weight.<ref>http://www.drum228.org/restoration.html</ref>\n<gallery class=\"center\"  widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:USS Drum.jpg|''Drum'' in 1983, prior to her relocation\n\nFile:USS Drum SS-228 Tower.jpeg|''Drum'' Topside\nFile:USS Drum SS-228 Forward Torpedo room.jpeg|''Drum'' Forward Torpedo room\n</gallery>\n\n==Trivia==\n*The ''Drum'''s Periscope is aimed directly at the stern of the [[USS Alabama (BB-60)|USS ''Alabama'']]\n*[[Wayne Green]], founder of Byte magazine (among others) was a crew member.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of most successful American submarines in World War II]]\n*[[List of National Historic Landmarks in Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/d/drum.html}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ussalabama.com/ Battleship Memorial Park]\n*[http://www.drum228.org/ Drum228.org:  USS ''Drum'' WWII war patrol reports, WWII crew list, historical information, restoration]\n*[http://www.pigboats.com/ww2/drum.html Kill record:  USS ''Drum'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090902053125/http://www.ussdrum228story.com/ ''The Untold Story'' USS ''Drum'' (SS-228) documentary]\n{{commons category}}\n*{{hnsa|uss-drum-ss-228}}\n*{{navsource|08/08228|USS Drum}}\n*[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/submar/ss228.txt hazegray.org: USS ''Drum'']\n\n{{Gato class_submarine}}\n{{Surviving ocean going ships}}\n{{Mobile attractions}}\n{{NRHP in Mobile, Alabama}}\n{{Registered Historic Places}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum (Ss-228)}}\n[[Category:1941 ships]]\n[[Category:Gato-class submarines]]\n[[Category:National Historic Landmarks in Alabama]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Mobile, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Kittery, Maine]]\n[[Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama]]\n[[Category:World War II submarines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "Robertl30", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFirst patrol:yes, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 June.

An original solution to the problem of moving aircraft parts between the different factories and the assembly plants is the use of the [[Airbus Beluga]], a modified cargo aircraft capable of carrying entire sections of fuselage. This solution has also been investigated by Boeing, which [[Boeing Dreamlifter|retrofitted 4 747-400s]] to transport the components of the 787. An exception to this scheme is the A380, whose fuselage and wings are too large for sections to be carried by the Beluga.

An original solution to the problem of moving aircraft parts between the different factories and the assembly plants is the use of the [[Airbus Beluga]], a modified cargo aircraft capable of carrying entire sections of fuselage. This solution has also been investigated by Boeing, which [[Boeing Dreamlifter|retrofitted 4 747-400s]] to transport the components of the 787. An exception to this scheme is the A380, whose fuselage and wings are too large for sections to be carried by the Beluga.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T.

Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

This was also the best performance of any party in the era of proportional elections to the European Parliament in [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scotland]].

Although the party suffered a [[North East Fife (UK Parliament constituency)|loss]] to the Liberal Democrats, it gained the [[East Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|seat]] of its then UK leader [[Jo Swinson]], along with 7 from the Conservatives and 6 from Labour.

All of the Branches within each Scottish Parliament constituency form a Constituency Association, which coordinates the work of the Branches within the constituency, coordinates the activities of the party in the constituency, and acts as a point of liaison between an MSP or MP and the party. Constituency Associations are composed of delegates from all of the Branches within the constituency.\n\nThe annual National Conference is the supreme governing body of the SNP, and is responsible for determining party policy and electing the National Executive Committee. The National Conference is composed of:\n* delegates from every Branch and Constituency Association\n* the members of the National Executive Committee\n* 15 members elected by the National Conference\n* every SNP MSP and MP (and previously MEPs)\n* a number of SNP local councillors, and\n* delegates from one of the SNP's Affiliated Organisations ([[Young Scots for Independence]], [[SNP Students]], [[SNP Trade Union Group]] and the Association of Nationalist Councillors)\n\nThe National Council serves as the SNP's governing body between National Conferences, and its decisions are binding, unless rescinded or modified by the National Conference. There are also regular meetings of the National Assembly, which provides a forum for detailed discussion of party policy by party members.\n\nThe party has an active youth wing, the [[Young Scots for Independence]], as well as a student wing, the [[Federation of Student Nationalists]]. There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference). The SNP parliamentarians (Holyrood and Westminster) and councillors have representation on the NEC, as do the Trade Union Group, the youth wing and the student wing.\n\n===National Executive Committee===\nThe National Executive Committee is composed of:\n* President: [[Ian Hudghton]]\n* Leader: [[Nicola Sturgeon]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]])</small>\n* Depute Leader: [[Keith Brown (Scottish politician)|Keith Brown]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Clackmannanshire and Dunblane (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire and Dunblane]])</small>\n* National Treasurer: [[Colin Beattie]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|<small>MSP</small>]] <small>([[Midlothian North and Musselburgh (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Midlothian North and Musselburgh]])</small>\n* National Secretary: <small>Dr</small> Angus MacLeod\n* Business Convener: [[Kirsten Oswald]] [[Member of parliament|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Renfrewshire]])</small>\n* Organisation Convener: Stacy Bradley\n* Member Support Convener: Doug Daniel\n* Policy Development Convener: [[Alyn Smith]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Stirling (UK Parliament constituency)|Stirling]])</small>\n* Local Government Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Ellen Forson <small>([[Clackmannanshire South]])</small>\n* Women's Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Rhiannon Spear <small>([[Greater Pollok (ward)|Greater Pollok]])</small>\n* Equalities Convener: Fiona Robertson\n* Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic Convener: <small>Cllr</small> Graham Campbell <small>([[Springburn/Robroyston (ward)|Springburn/Robroyston]])</small>\n* Disabled Members' Convener: Morag Fulton\n* [[Tommy Sheppard]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Edinburgh East (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh East]])</small>\n* [[Alison Thewliss]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|<small>MP</small>]] <small>([[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]])</small>\n* Sixteen regional representatives\n* Representatives from the Association of Nationalist Councillors and affiliated organisations\n\n===Membership===\nSince 18 September 2014 (the day of the Scottish independence referendum), party membership has more than quadrupled (from 25,642), surpassing the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and, briefly, [[Conservatives (UK)|Conservatives]] to become the second-largest political party in the United Kingdom in terms of membership.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160//|title=New figures show our party is now powered by 125,482 members - making @theSNP the second biggest party in the UK.|access-date=3 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524143611/https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1036557191648604160|archive-date=24 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As of August 2018, the Party has 125,482 members.\n\n===European affiliation===\nThe SNP retains close links with [[Plaid Cymru]], its counterpart in [[Wales]].

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

This policy was followed in 1963 by a motion opposed to [[nuclear weapon]]s: a policy that has remained in place ever since.<ref name=\"Mitchell19961994\">{{cite book|author=James Mitchell|title=Strategies for Self-government: The Campaigns for a Scottish Parliament|year=1996|publisher=Polygon|page=194}}</ref> The 1964 policy document, ''SNP & You'', contained a clear centre-left policy platform, including commitments to [[full employment]], government intervention in fuel, power and transport, a state bank to guide economic development, encouragement of [[cooperative]]s and [[credit union]]s, extensive building of [[council house]]s (social housing) by central and local government, pensions adjusted to cost of living, a [[minimum wage]] and an improved [[NHS Scotland|national health service]].<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nThe 1960s also saw the beginnings of the SNP's efforts to establish an industrial organisation and mobilise amongst trade unionists in Scotland, with the establishment of the SNP Trade Union Group, and identifying the SNP with industrial campaigns, such as the [[Upper-Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] and the attempt of the workers at the Scottish ''[[Daily Express]]'' to run as a co-operative.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> For the party manifestos for the two 1974 general elections, the SNP finally self-identified as a social democratic party, and proposed a range of social democratic policies.<ref name=\"Brand199027\">{{cite book|title=\u2018Scotland\u2019, in Watson, Michael (ed.), Contemporary Minority Nationalism|publisher=Routledge|year=1990|page=27|author=Jack Brand}}</ref><ref name=\"Hassan2009121\">{{cite book|author=Gerry Hassan|title=The Modern SNP: From Protest to Power|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=121}}</ref> There was also an unsuccessful proposal at the 1975 party conference to rename the party as the ''Scottish National Party (Social Democrats)''.<ref name=\"Hepburn2013143\">{{cite book|author=Eve Hepburn|title=New Challenges for Stateless Nationalist and Regionalist Parties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96596-1|page=143|access-date=25 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503092815/https://books.google.com/books?id=dTOOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|archive-date=3 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In the UK wide referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the same year as the aforementioned attempted name change, the SNP campaigned for Britain to leave the EEC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Devenney|first=Andrew D.|date=2008|title=Regional Resistance to European Integration: The Case of the Scottish National Party, 1961-1972|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20762312|journal=Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung|volume=33|issue=3 (125)|pages=319\u2013345|issn=0172-6404}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-37107148|title=The dilemma facing Scotland's Eurosceptic nationalists|last=Ley|first=Shaun|date=2016-08-18|access-date=2020-01-12|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nThere were further ideological and internal struggles after 1979, with the [[79 Group]] attempting to move the SNP further to the left, away from being what could be described a \"social-democratic\" party, to an expressly \"[[socialism|socialist]]\" party. Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach. However, this 79 Group gradualism was as much a reaction against the fundamentalists of the day, many of whom believed the SNP should not take a clear left or right position.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n===Economic Policy===\n[[File:Revenue Scotland logo.png|left|thumb|The [[First Sturgeon government|Sturgeon Government]] created [[Revenue Scotland]] in 2015.]]\nWith the SNP's policy base being mostly in the mainstream Western European [[social democracy|social democratic]] tradition, the party is committed to polices such as [[progressive tax|progressive personal taxation]].

By 18&nbsp;years, he had completed his first major work: ''[[Corso Donati]] mortally wounded is transported by Monks of San Salvi to their Abbey'' (see gallery).<ref>\u201cCorso Donati trasportato nella [[Badia di San Salvi]]\u201d is now on display at the [[Galleria d\u2019Arte Moderna of Florence]].</ref> The painting won an award at the Florentine Triennale contest of 1861. He completed commissions for patrons in America and England. In 1863, he won a contest in Rome with the essay piece ''[[Savonarola]] explains the Bible to some friends in the Convent of San Marco''. He was unable to make use of the stipend attached to the prize. In Florence, he exhibited a work depicting ''[[Piccarda Donati]] kidnapped from the Convent of Santa Chiara, by her brother Corso''. He completed a ''[[St Catherine of Siena]] before an angry Florentine mob after concluding peace with the Pope'', by commission for signore marchese Carlo Torrigiani. His painting of ''[[Imelda de' Lambertazzi]] e Bonifazio Geremei'' (lovers from [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti's]] opera) was sold to Wilhelm Metzler of Frankfort, Germany. In 1869, the sculptor [[Giovanni Dupr\u00e8]] visited his studio, and commissioned a ''[[Phidias]] sculpts the Minerva Statue''.\n\nAfter this work, Sorbi produced mainly small canvases, mostly sold through the [[Goupil Gallery]] of Paris. Many are of antique Roman (Neo-Pompeian) or from the historical Tuscan past: ''Regatta in the Arno'': ''il Girotondo''; ''Il [[Decameron]]e''; ''The Florentine Concert '': ''Il Triclinio''; ''The [[Vestal Virgin]]s exit the Amphitheater after the spectacle'': ''Il venditore di terre cotte''; ''A family scene under a peristyle''; ''[[Cornelia Africana|Cornelia]] mother of the [[Gaius Gracchus|Gaius]] and [[Tiberius Gracchus]]''. Other paintings are genre scenes in 18th-century dress and finery. Among his works, ''Lo Corsa delle carrette nel Circo'' and ''il serraglio agli sposi'', were bought by the Silley of London, and ''Le Maggiolate'' bought by Signor [[Egisto Vannucci]] of Florence. Many of his works were acquired by English collectors. Among his works are a series of games, including ''Il Giuoco delle Bocce'', ''delle Carte'', ''del Pallone'', ''della Ruzzola'', and ''della Mora''. He painted a ''Convalesence of Dante''. In 1870, at the Mostra of Fine Arts di Parma, he displayed ''La strada''.
