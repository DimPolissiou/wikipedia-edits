Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the bloodstream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]]. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by the host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of the host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protrusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) that provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]]. Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the bloodstream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells act as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved the killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]]. Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however, the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering the formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system. Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevent the action of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by the host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18). IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection. T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers are associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis. Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective. People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response. However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear. Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment. [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction). [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis. However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Commercial [[ELISA]] kits for melioidosis no longer available in the market due to low sensitivity to human antibodies detection.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nVarious imaging modalities can also help with the diagnosis of melioidosis. In acute melioidosis with the spreading of the bacteria through the bloodstream, the chest X-ray shows multifocal nodular lesions. It may also show merging nodules or [[cavitary pneumonia|cavitations]]. For those with acute melioidosis without the spread to the bloodstream, chest x-ray shows upper lobe [[Pulmonary consolidation|consolidation]] or cavitations. In chronic melioidosis, the slowly progressing of upper lobe consolidation of the lungs resembles tuberculosis. For abscesses located in other parts of the body apart from the lungs, especially in the liver and spleen, [[computed tomography|CT]] scan has higher sensitivity when compared with an ultrasound scan. In liver and splenic abscesses, an ultrasound scan shows \"target-like\" lesions while CT scan shows \"honeycomb sign\" in liver abscesses. For melioidosis involving the brain, MRI have higher sensitivity than a CT scan in diagnosing the lesion. MRI shows ring-enhancing lesions for brain melioidosis.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n==Prevention==\nMelioidosis is a notifiable disease in Australia. It enables the country to monitor disease burden and contain outbreaks. On the other hand, melioidosis is only a notifiable condition in Thailand since June 2016. Nevertheless, Australia also embarked on awareness campaigns to increase the community's understanding of the disease.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/> In the United States, lab workers can handle clinical specimens of ''B. pseudomallei'' under [[BSL-2]] conditions, while mass production of such organisms requires [[BSL-3]] precautions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories|publisher=National Institutes of Health|location=Atlanta, Georgia|year=2009|edition=5th}}</ref> There are also several cases of hospital-acquired infection of melioidosis. Therefore, healthcare providers are recommended to practice hand hygiene and [[universal precautions]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nLarge-scale water chlorination has been successful at reducing ''B. pseudomallei'' in the water in Australia. In middle to low-income countries, water should be boiled before consumption. In high income countries, water could be treated with ultraviolet light for those at risk of contracting melioidosis. Those who are at high risk of contact with the bacteria should wear protective gear (such as boots and gloves) during work. Those staying in endemic areas should avoid direct contact with soil, and outdoor exposure to heavy rain or dust clouds. Bottled water or boiled water are preferred as drinking water.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n===Postexposure prophylaxis===\nAfter exposure to ''B. pseudomallei'' (particularly following a laboratory accident), treatment with [[co-trimoxazole]] is recommended. Alternatively, [[co-amoxiclav]] and [[doxycycline]] can be used for those who are intolerant to co-trimoxazole. Since co-trimoxazole can cause severe side effects, only high-risk individuals tend to receive such treatments. Low-risk individuals would receive frequent monitoring instead.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n===Vaccination===\n{{Further|Burkholderia_pseudomallei#Vaccine_candidates}}\nSeveral vaccine candidates have been tested in animal models. Nevertheless, no vaccine candidates have been tried in humans. Major hurdles of the vaccines are limited efficacy in animal models, establishing the best method of vaccine administration in humans and logistical and financial issues in establishing human trials in endemic areas.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nThe treatment of melioidosis is divided into two stages: an intravenous intensive phase and an eradication phase to prevent recurrence. The choice of antibiotics depends upon the susceptibility of the bacteria to various antibiotics. ''B. pesudomallei'' are generally susceptible to ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem, and co-amoxiclav. These drugs are designed to kill the bacteria. ''B. pseudomallei'' is also susceptible to doyxcycline, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole. These drugs are designed to inhibit the growth of the bacteria. However, the bacteria are resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, 1st and 2nd generation [[cephalosporin]], gentamicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, macrolides, and polymyxins.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> On the other hand, ''B. pseudomallei'' isolates from the region of [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] are susceptible to gentamicin.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n===Intensive phase===\n[[Intravenous]] [[ceftazidime]] is the current drug of choice for treatment of acute melioidosis and should be administered for at least 10 to 14 days.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"CAZ\">{{cite journal |vauthors=White NJ, Dance DA, Chaowagul W, et al | title = Halving of mortality of severe melioidosis by ceftazidime| journal = Lancet| year = 1989| volume = 2| issue = 8665| pages = 697&ndash;701| pmid = 2570956| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(89)90768-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chierakul W, Anunnatsiri S, Chaowagul W, et al | title = Addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to ceftazidime during parenteral treatment of melioidosis is not associated with a long-term outcome benefit| journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases| volume = 45| issue = 4| pages = 521&ndash;523| year = 2007| pmid = 17638209| doi = 10.1086/520010}}</ref> [[Meropenem]],<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"MEM2004\">{{cite journal| title = Outcomes of Patients with Melioidosis Treated with Meropenem |vauthors=Cheng AC, Fisher DA, Anstey NM, et al | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother| year = 2004| pages = 1763&ndash;65| volume = 48| issue = 5| doi = 10.1128/AAC.48.5.1763-1765.2004| pmid = 15105132| pmc = 400582}}</ref> [[imipenem]]<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> and the [[cefoperazone]]-[[sulbactam]] combination (Sulperazone)<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Chetchotisakd P, Porramatikul S, Mootsikapun P, Anunnatsiri S, Thinkhamrop B | title = Randomized, double-blind, controlled study of cefoperazone-sulbactam plus cotrimoxazole versus ceftazidime plus cotrimoxazole for the treatment of severe melioidosis| journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases| year = 2001| volume = 33| pages = 29&ndash;33| pmid = 11389491|doi=10.1086/320878| issue = 1}}</ref> are also effective.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dance DA, Wuthiekanun V, White NJ, Chaowagul W |title=Antibiotic resistance in ''Pseudomonas pseudomallei''|journal=Lancet|year=1988|volume=1|issue=8592|pages=994&ndash;995|pmid=2896855|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(88)91810-7}}</ref>  Intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate ([[co-amoxiclav]]) may be used if none of the above four drugs is available;<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> co-amoxiclav prevents death from melioidosis as well as ceftazidime.<ref name=\"Bennett 2015\"/> Intravenous [[antibiotic]]s are given for a minimum of 10 to 14 days.

Co-trimoxazole should not be used in those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] deficiency as it can cause [[haemolytic anemia]].

Meanwhile, in Thailand, co-amoxiclav is the drug of choice for children and pregnant women. However, ''B. pseudomallei'' often acquires resistance when this drug is used.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The dosing regimen for co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) in eradication phase is 6/30&nbsp;mg/kg, up to maximum 240/1200&nbsp;mg in children, 240/1200&nbsp;mg in adults weighing 40 to 60&nbsp;kg, and 320/1600&nbsp;mg in adults weighing more than 60&nbsp;kg, taken orally every 12 hours.

Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the bloodstream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]]. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by the host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of the host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protrusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) that provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]]. Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the bloodstream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells act as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved the killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]]. Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however, the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering the formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system. Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevent the action of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by the host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18). IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection. T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers are associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis. Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective. People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response. However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear. Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment. [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction). [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis. However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Commercial [[ELISA]] kits for melioidosis no longer available in the market due to low sensitivity to human antibodies detection.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nVarious imaging modalities can also help with the diagnosis of melioidosis. In acute melioidosis with the spreading of the bacteria through the bloodstream, the chest X-ray shows multifocal nodular lesions. It may also show merging nodules or [[cavitary pneumonia|cavitations]]. For those with acute melioidosis without the spread to the bloodstream, chest x-ray shows upper lobe [[Pulmonary consolidation|consolidation]] or cavitations. In chronic melioidosis, the slowly progressing of upper lobe consolidation of the lungs resembles tuberculosis. For abscesses located in other parts of the body apart from the lungs, especially in the liver and spleen, [[computed tomography|CT]] scan has higher sensitivity when compared with an ultrasound scan. In liver and splenic abscesses, an ultrasound scan shows \"target-like\" lesions while CT scan shows \"honeycomb sign\" in liver abscesses. For melioidosis involving the brain, MRI have higher sensitivity than a CT scan in diagnosing the lesion. MRI shows ring-enhancing lesions for brain melioidosis.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n==Prevention==\nMelioidosis is a notifiable disease in Australia. It enables the country to monitor disease burden and contain outbreaks. On the other hand, melioidosis is only a notifiable condition in Thailand since June 2016. Nevertheless, Australia also embarked on awareness campaigns to increase the community's understanding of the disease.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/> In the United States, lab workers can handle clinical specimens of ''B. pseudomallei'' under [[BSL-2]] conditions, while mass production of such organisms requires [[BSL-3]] precautions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|title=Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories|publisher=National Institutes of Health|location=Atlanta, Georgia|year=2009|edition=5th}}</ref> There are also several cases of hospital-acquired infection of melioidosis. Therefore, healthcare providers are recommended to practice hand hygiene and [[universal precautions]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nLarge-scale water chlorination has been successful at reducing ''B. pseudomallei'' in the water in Australia. In middle to low-income countries, water should be boiled before consumption. In high income countries, water could be treated with ultraviolet light for those at risk of contracting melioidosis. Those who are at high risk of contact with the bacteria should wear protective gear (such as boots and gloves) during work. Those staying in endemic areas should avoid direct contact with soil, and outdoor exposure to heavy rain or dust clouds. Bottled water or boiled water are preferred as drinking water.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n===Postexposure prophylaxis===\nAfter exposure to ''B. pseudomallei'' (particularly following a laboratory accident), treatment with [[co-trimoxazole]] is recommended. Alternatively, [[co-amoxiclav]] and [[doxycycline]] can be used for those who are intolerant to co-trimoxazole. Since co-trimoxazole can cause severe side effects, only high-risk individuals tend to receive such treatments. Low-risk individuals would receive frequent monitoring instead.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n===Vaccination===\n{{Further|Burkholderia_pseudomallei#Vaccine_candidates}}\nSeveral vaccine candidates have been tested in animal models. Nevertheless, no vaccine candidates have been tried in humans. Major hurdles of the vaccines are limited efficacy in animal models, establishing the best method of vaccine administration in humans and logistical and financial issues in establishing human trials in endemic areas.<ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nThe treatment of melioidosis is divided into two stages: an intravenous intensive phase and an eradication phase to prevent recurrence. The choice of antibiotics depends upon the susceptibility of the bacteria to various antibiotics. ''B. pesudomallei'' are generally susceptible to ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem, and co-amoxiclav. These drugs are designed to kill the bacteria. ''B. pseudomallei'' is also susceptible to doyxcycline, chloramphenicol, and co-trimoxazole. These drugs are designed to inhibit the growth of the bacteria. However, the bacteria are resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, 1st and 2nd generation [[cephalosporin]], gentamicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, macrolides, and polymyxins.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> On the other hand, ''B. pseudomallei'' isolates from the region of [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] are susceptible to gentamicin.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Optimal therapy for melioidosis have been determined as a result from clinical trials in Thailand.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\">{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=C Cheng |last2=Bart |first2=J Currie |title=Melioidosis: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Management |journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |date=April 2005 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=383\u2013416 |doi=10.1128/CMR.18.2.383-416.2005 |pmid=15831829 |pmc=1082802}}</ref>\n\n===Intensive phase===\n[[Intravenous]] [[ceftazidime]] is the current drug of choice for treatment of acute melioidosis and should be administered for at least 10 to 14 days.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"CAZ\">{{cite journal |vauthors=White NJ, Dance DA, Chaowagul W, et al | title = Halving of mortality of severe melioidosis by ceftazidime| journal = Lancet| year = 1989| volume = 2| issue = 8665| pages = 697&ndash;701| pmid = 2570956| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(89)90768-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chierakul W, Anunnatsiri S, Chaowagul W, et al | title = Addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to ceftazidime during parenteral treatment of melioidosis is not associated with a long-term outcome benefit| journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases| volume = 45| issue = 4| pages = 521&ndash;523| year = 2007| pmid = 17638209| doi = 10.1086/520010}}</ref> [[Meropenem]],<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"MEM2004\">{{cite journal| title = Outcomes of Patients with Melioidosis Treated with Meropenem |vauthors=Cheng AC, Fisher DA, Anstey NM, et al | journal = Antimicrob Agents Chemother| year = 2004| pages = 1763&ndash;65| volume = 48| issue = 5| doi = 10.1128/AAC.48.5.1763-1765.2004| pmid = 15105132| pmc = 400582}}</ref> [[imipenem]]<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> and the [[cefoperazone]]-[[sulbactam]] combination (Sulperazone)<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Chetchotisakd P, Porramatikul S, Mootsikapun P, Anunnatsiri S, Thinkhamrop B | title = Randomized, double-blind, controlled study of cefoperazone-sulbactam plus cotrimoxazole versus ceftazidime plus cotrimoxazole for the treatment of severe melioidosis| journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases| year = 2001| volume = 33| pages = 29&ndash;33| pmid = 11389491|doi=10.1086/320878| issue = 1}}</ref> are also effective.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Dance DA, Wuthiekanun V, White NJ, Chaowagul W |title=Antibiotic resistance in ''Pseudomonas pseudomallei''|journal=Lancet|year=1988|volume=1|issue=8592|pages=994&ndash;995|pmid=2896855|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(88)91810-7}}</ref>  Intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate ([[co-amoxiclav]]) may be used if none of the above four drugs is available;<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> co-amoxiclav prevents death from melioidosis as well as ceftazidime.<ref name=\"Bennett 2015\"/> Intravenous [[antibiotic]]s are given for a minimum of 10 to 14 days.

An oblivious Peter conjectures that Brian's beloved would \"probably end up with some idiot\".\n\n==Reception==\nIn his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] rated the episode an 8/10, saying that the episode shows Brian's love for Lois in \"a perfectly believable and somewhat heartfelt earnest manner\". He stated that \"while not every joke works [...] the focus on Brian's feelings is pretty significant for the series from both an entertainment and ongoing storyline perspective.\" <ref name=ign>{{cite web |author=Haque, Ahsan |title=Family Guy: \"Brian in Love\" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/896/896754p1.html |accessdate=2009-12-02 |date=6 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Callaghan, Steve. \u201cBrian in Love.\u201d ''Family Guy: The Official Episode Guide Seasons 1\u20133''.

Meanwhile, Peter becomes very satisfied with his A-Team's actions, but the team fails a mission to save a local park from demolition by becoming \"side-tracked by idle conversation\" with the builders. The guilty A-Team disbands afterwards. Brian eventually cracks under the pressure of a final test and knowing he will only pass if he cheats, he decides to return home with Stewie. A shocked Lois attempts to encourage him to go back and finish the test, and eventually chases him away with a [[vacuum cleaner]] called \"Mr. Hoover\".\n\nBrian ends up exercising for hours with the help of Stewie, parodying [[Rocky Balboa]] in the movie ''[[Rocky IV]]'', but realizes his test is only a few hours away.

It was also situated close to the River Severn Bridge which was a very important crossing on the River Severn linking the city to Western areas of the country and other western towns, such as Hereford.

The club's development has largely been down to the development of the [[University of Worcester]] but its fan base is spread across the city. Many of these fans are based in St John's due to the teams involvement with local schools from early on in the club's existence.

The main bisecting street, known as The Avenue of the States south of 9th Street and Edgmont Avenue north of it, is signed as both [[Pennsylvania Route 320]] (southbound only; northbound PA Rt. 320 uses adjacent Madison Street to [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]]) and [[Pennsylvania Route 352]]. North of I-95, State Route 320 follows Providence Avenue. Between 1993 and 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) widened and realigned [[Pennsylvania Route 291]] from Trainer to Eddystone from a two-lane roadway to a five-lane roadway. This widening and realignment project, spearheaded by the late State Senator [[Clarence D. Bell]], allowed PA Route 291 to maintain at least two travel lanes in each direction.\n\n===Highways and bridges===\n[[File:Commodore Barry Bridge 9104.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Commodore Barry Bridge]] crosses the [[Delaware River]] at Chester.]]\nChester is served by two [[interstate highways]]: [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Interstate 476]], which meet in nearby [[Crum Lynne, Pennsylvania|Crum Lynne]]. I-95 was built in the 1960s and originally terminated just north of the Chester/Eddystone line at the present-day I-95/I-476 junction. It was extended north in the 1970s, with the section around [[Philadelphia International Airport]] being completed in 1985. Three exits on I-95 allow access to Highland Avenue, Kerlin Street, and Edgmont Avenue/Avenue of the States (Rts. 320 & 352).\n\nTwo federal highway routes, [[U.S. Route 13]] and [[U.S. Route 322]], also run through Chester. US 13 enters Chester from Trainer on W. 4th Street, becomes part of Highland Avenue between W. 4th Street and W. 9th Street, and then continues on 9th Street to Morton Avenue. US 13 follows Morton Avenue in the city's Sun Village section until it crosses [[Ridley Creek]] and becomes Chester Pike in Eddystone.\n\nUS 322 enters Chester from the northeast, merges with I-95 briefly and crosses the Delaware River over the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]]. Prior to the bridge's opening in 1974, US 322 would cross the Delaware River on the Chester-[[Bridgeport, New Jersey|Bridgeport]] Ferry, via Flower Street, causing major backups because of limited space on the ferries. With the expansion of [[Pennsylvania Route 291|State Rt. 291]] and the redevelopment of the Chester Waterfront, both the [[Delaware River Port Authority]] and PennDOT built a pair of entrance (westbound) and exit (eastbound) ramps to PA Rt. 291, providing direct access to the waterfront without using local streets. The ramps were built between 2007 and 2010 and were opened in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=US 322|url=http://www.pahighways.com/us/US322.html|website=www.pahighways.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nPlans for reconstruction of US 322 and the merge with I-95 are underway.<ref>{{cite web|title=Section CSC - 322 Conchester Highway|url=http://us322conchester.com/project-information/section-csx/|website=www.us322conchester.com|accessdate=8 February 2018}}</ref> The road currently requires traffic to merge onto I-95 in the left lane and requires changing lanes three times to the Commodore Barry Bridge exit ramp in less than a mile.\n\nA $16.6 million project to fix up eight I-95 bridges will begin March 2017 and is expected to be finished in November 2018.

The main bisecting street, known as The Avenue of the States south of 9th Street and Edgmont Avenue north of it, is signed as both [[Pennsylvania Route 320]] (southbound only; northbound PA Rt. 320 uses adjacent Madison Street to [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]]) and [[Pennsylvania Route 352]]. North of I-95, State Route 320 follows Providence Avenue. Between 1993 and 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) widened and realigned [[Pennsylvania Route 291]] from Trainer to Eddystone from a two-lane roadway to a five-lane roadway. This widening and realignment project, spearheaded by the late State Senator [[Clarence D. Bell]], allowed PA Route 291 to maintain at least two travel lanes in each direction.\n\n===Highways and bridges===\n[[File:Commodore Barry Bridge 9104.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Commodore Barry Bridge]] crosses the [[Delaware River]] at Chester.]]\nChester is served by two [[interstate highways]]: [[Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 95]] and [[Interstate 476]], which meet in nearby [[Crum Lynne, Pennsylvania|Crum Lynne]]. I-95 was built in the 1960s and originally terminated just north of the Chester/Eddystone line at the present-day I-95/I-476 junction. It was extended north in the 1970s, with the section around [[Philadelphia International Airport]] being completed in 1985. Three exits on I-95 allow access to Highland Avenue, Kerlin Street, and Edgmont Avenue/Avenue of the States (Rts. 320 & 352).\n\nTwo federal highway routes, [[U.S. Route 13]] and [[U.S. Route 322]], also run through Chester. US 13 enters Chester from Trainer on W. 4th Street, becomes part of Highland Avenue between W. 4th Street and W. 9th Street, and then continues on 9th Street to Morton Avenue. US 13 follows Morton Avenue in the city's Sun Village section until it crosses [[Ridley Creek]] and becomes Chester Pike in Eddystone.\n\nUS 322 enters Chester from the northeast, merges with I-95 briefly and crosses the Delaware River over the [[Commodore Barry Bridge]]. Prior to the bridge's opening in 1974, US 322 would cross the Delaware River on the Chester-[[Bridgeport, New Jersey|Bridgeport]] Ferry, via Flower Street, causing major backups because of limited space on the ferries. With the expansion of [[Pennsylvania Route 291|State Rt. 291]] and the redevelopment of the Chester Waterfront, both the [[Delaware River Port Authority]] and PennDOT built a pair of entrance (westbound) and exit (eastbound) ramps to PA Rt. 291, providing direct access to the waterfront without using local streets. The ramps were built between 2007 and 2010 and were opened in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=US 322|url=http://www.pahighways.com/us/US322.html|website=www.pahighways.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nPlans for reconstruction of US 322 and the merge with I-95 are underway.<ref>{{cite web|title=Section CSC - 322 Conchester Highway|url=http://us322conchester.com/project-information/section-csx/|website=www.us322conchester.com|accessdate=8 February 2018}}</ref> The road currently requires traffic to merge onto I-95 in the left lane and requires changing lanes three times to the Commodore Barry Bridge exit ramp in less than a mile.\n\nA $16.6 million project to fix up eight I-95 bridges will begin March 2017 and is expected to be finished in November 2018.

In phase two, another 200 apartments will be built, along with {{convert|100000|sqft|m2}} of office space and {{convert|22000|sqft|m2}} of retail space.<ref>{{cite web |title=Major hurdle cleared for Philly expansion |work=MLSnet.com |url=http://www.mlsnet.com//news/mls_news.jsp?ymd=20080131&content_id=137294&vkey=news_mls&fext=.jsp |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109113909/http://mlsnet.com/ |archivedate=November 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Chester, Pennsylvania}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:3rd Presby Chester PA from SE.JPG|thumb|[[Third Presbyterian Church (Chester, Pennsylvania)|Third Presbyterian Church]]]]\n[[File:Delco National Bank.JPG|thumb|[[Delaware County National Bank]]]]\n*[[Asbury AME Church]]\n*[[1724 Chester Courthouse|Chester Courthouse]]\n*[[Chester Friends Meetinghouse]]\n*[[Chester Rural Cemetery]]\n*[[Chester Waterside Station of the Philadelphia Electric Company]]\n*[[Crozer Arboretum]]\n*[[Crozer Theological Seminary]]\n*[[Delaware County National Bank]]\n*[[Harrah's Philadelphia|Harrah's Philadelphia Casino & Racetrack]]\n*[[Madison Street Methodist Episcopal Church]]\n*[[Old Main and Chemistry Building]]\n*[[St. Paul's Church (Chester, PA)|St. Paul's Church and Old Burial Ground]]\n*[[Talen Energy Stadium]]\n*[[Third Presbyterian Church (Chester, Pennsylvania)|Third Presbyterian Church]]\n*[[Widener University]]\n*[[William Penn Landing Site]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Ashmead\n  | first = Henry Graham\n  | year = 1883\n  | title = Historical Sketch of Chester, on Delaware\n  | publisher = Republican Steam Printing House\n  | ref = harv\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/historicalsketch00ashm_0\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Ashmead\n  | first = Henry Graham\n  | year = 1884\n  | title = History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania\n  | publisher = L.H.

{"title_page": "List of language regulators", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\nThis is a list of bodies that regulate [[standard language]]s, often called '''language academies'''. Language academies are motivated by, or closely associated with, [[linguistic purism]] and [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]], and typically publish [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] [[dictionaries]],<ref>Thomas, George (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=G18NAQAAMAAJ ''Linguistic purism''] p.108, quotation: {{quotation|Whereas a number of the puristically motivated language societies have assumed ''de facto'' responsibility for language cultivation, the decisions of the academies have often had the force of law. ... Since academies are so closely associated with the notion of purism, a brief word on their history may not be out of place. The first academy to deal expressly and exclusively with language matters was the ''Accademia della Crusca'' ... Its orientation was essentially conservative, favouring a return to the Tuscan language as cultivated in the fourteenth century over the innovations of contemporary renaissance poets such as Torquato Tasso. ... One of its first tasks&nbsp;-- as with so many academies to follow&nbsp;-- was to produce a large-scale prescriptive dictionary of Italian}}</ref> which purport to officiate and prescribe the meaning of words and pronunciations. A language regulator may also have a more [[Linguistic description|descriptive approach]], however, while maintaining and promoting (but not imposing) a standard spelling. Many language academies are private institutions, although some are governmental bodies in different states, or enjoy some form of government-sanctioned status in one or more countries. There may also be multiple language academies attempting to regulate and [[codification (linguistics)|codify]] the same language, sometimes based in different countries and sometimes influenced by political factors (see also: [[pluricentric language]]).\n\nMany [[world language]]s have one or more language academies. However, the degree of control that the academies exert over these languages does not render the latter [[controlled natural language]]s in the sense that the various kinds of \"[[Simple English (disambiguation)|simple English]]\" (e.g. [[Basic English]], [[Simplified Technical English]]) or [[George Orwell]]'s fictional [[Newspeak]] are. They instead remain [[natural language]]s to a considerable extent and are thus not [[formal language]]s such as [[Attempto Controlled English]]. They have a degree of [[standardization]] that allows them to function as [[standard language]]s (e.g. [[standard French]]). The English language has never had a formal regulator anywhere.\n\n== Natural languages ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Language\n! scope=\"col\" | Territory\n! scope=\"col\" |

Since academies are so closely associated with the notion of purism, a brief word on their history may not be out of place. The first academy to deal expressly and exclusively with language matters was the ''Accademia della Crusca'' ... Its orientation was essentially conservative, favouring a return to the Tuscan language as cultivated in the fourteenth century over the innovations of contemporary renaissance poets such as Torquato Tasso. ... One of its first tasks&nbsp;-- as with so many academies to follow&nbsp;-- was to produce a large-scale prescriptive dictionary of Italian}}</ref> which purport to officiate and prescribe the meaning of words and pronunciations. A language regulator may also have a more [[Linguistic description|descriptive approach]], however, while maintaining and promoting (but not imposing) a standard spelling. Many language academies are private institutions, although some are governmental bodies in different states, or enjoy some form of government-sanctioned status in one or more countries. There may also be multiple language academies attempting to regulate and [[codification (linguistics)|codify]] the same language, sometimes based in different countries and sometimes influenced by political factors (see also: [[pluricentric language]]).\n\nMany [[world language]]s have one or more language academies. However, the degree of control that the academies exert over these languages does not render the latter [[controlled natural language]]s in the sense that the various kinds of \"[[Simple English (disambiguation)|simple English]]\" (e.g. [[Basic English]], [[Simplified Technical English]]) or [[George Orwell]]'s fictional [[Newspeak]] are. They instead remain [[natural language]]s to a considerable extent and are thus not [[formal language]]s such as [[Attempto Controlled English]]. They have a degree of [[standardization]] that allows them to function as [[standard language]]s (e.g. [[standard French]]).

This technique also increased the \"working period\" making the glass easier to manipulate.\n\nThe term ''lead crystal'' is, technically, not an accurate term to describe lead glass, as being an [[amorphous solid]], glass lacks a [[crystal structure|crystalline structure]]. The use of the term ''lead crystal'' remains popular for historical and commercial reasons. It is retained from the [[Venetian language|Venetian]] word ''cristallo'' to describe the [[Quartz|rock crystal]] imitated by [[Murano]] glassmakers. This naming convention has been maintained to the present day to describe decorative [[Holloware|hollow-ware]].<ref name=tait>{{cite book\n|editor= Tait, Hugh| title = Five Thousand Years of Glass|year = 2004\n| publisher = [[University of Pennsylvania Press]] (orig.

One alternative material is '''crystal glass''', in which [[barium oxide]], [[zinc oxide]], or [[potassium oxide]] are employed instead of lead oxide. Lead-free crystal has a similar refractive index to lead crystal, but it is lighter and it has less [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive]] power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bottegadelvinocrystal.com/about_lead_free_crystal.htm|title=About Lead-free Crystal|access-date=22 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121001052/http://www.bottegadelvinocrystal.com/about_lead_free_crystal.htm|archive-date=21 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, labeling of \"crystal\" products is regulated by Council Directive 69/493/EEC, which defines four categories, depending on the chemical composition and properties of the material. Only glass products containing at least 24% of lead oxide may be referred to as \"lead crystal\". Products with less lead oxide, or glass products with other metal oxides used in place of lead oxide, must be labeled \"crystalline\" or \"crystal glass\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31969L0493:en:NOT|title=Council Directive 69/493/EEC of 15 December 1969 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to crystal glass}}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nThe addition of lead oxide to glass raises its [[refractive index]] and lowers its working temperature and [[viscosity]]. The attractive optical properties of lead glass result from the high content of the [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] lead. The high [[atomic number]] of lead also raises the density of the material, since lead has a very high [[atomic mass|atomic weight]] of 207.2, versus 40.08 for calcium. The density of soda glass is {{convert|abbr=on|2.4|g/cm3|g/cuin|lk=in}} or below, while typical lead crystal has a density of around {{cvt|3.1|g/cm3|g/in3||}} and high-lead glass can be over {{cvt|4.0|g/cm3|g/in3||}} or even up to {{cvt|5.9|g/cm3|g/in3||}}.<ref name=newton/>\n\nThe brilliance of lead crystal relies on the high [[refractive index]] caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of ''n'' = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7<ref name=newton/> or 1.8.<ref>[http://physics.info/refraction/ Refraction of media tutorial]. physics.info</ref> This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], which measures the degree to which a medium separates light into its component [[visible spectrum|spectra]], as in a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for [[lens (optics)|lens]] making, since a given [[focal length]] can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be [[achromatic lens|achromatic]].\n\nThe addition of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its [[viscosity]], rendering it more fluid than ordinary soda glass above softening temperature (about {{convert|abbr=on|600|\u00b0C|F|disp=or}}), with a working point of {{convert|abbr=on|800|\u00b0C|F}}. The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, but that of lead glass is roughly 100 times less than that of ordinary soda glasses across working temperature ranges (up to {{convert|abbr=on|1100|\u00b0C|F| disp=or}}). From the glassmaker's perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in [[enamelling]], and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. \n\nWhen tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a [[soda-lime glass]], the former absorbs more energy when struck{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. This causes the lead crystal to [[oscillate]], thereby producing its characteristic sound.<ref name=newton/> Lead also increases the solubility of [[tin]], [[copper]], and [[antimony]], leading to its use in colored enamels and [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]s. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the [[glass solder]]s.\n\n[[File:Fluoroscopy room with control space.jpg|thumb|Fluoroscopy room with control space separated by [[lead shielding]] glass.]]\nThe presence of lead is used in glasses absorbing [[gamma radiation]] and [[X-ray]]s, used in [[radiation shielding]] as a form of [[lead shielding]] (e.g. in [[cathode ray tube]]s, where lowering the exposure of the viewer to soft X-rays is of concern).\n\nThe high [[ionic radius]] of the Pb<sup>2+</sup> ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (10<sup>8.5</sup> vs 10<sup>6.5</sup> Ohm\u00b7cm, [[direct current|DC]] at {{convert|abbr=on|250|\u00b0C|F|disp=or}}).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASIYuNCp81YC&pg=PA158&dq=%22glass+solders%22&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22glass%20solders%22 |title=Ceramic and Glass Materials: Structure, Properties and Processing|page=158|author=James F.

The lead oxide used in lead glass could be obtained from a variety of sources. In Europe, [[galena]], lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be [[Smelting|smelted]] to produce metallic lead. The lead metal would be [[Calcination|calcined]] to form lead oxide by roasting it and scraping off the [[litharge]]. In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] lead metal could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver [[cupellation]], and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.<ref name=fiori>{{cite book\n|last = Fiori|first = Cesare|author2=Mariangela Vandini\n | title = When Glass Matters: Studies in the History of Science and Art from Graeco-Roman Antiquity to Early Modern Era| chapter = Chemical Composition of Glass and its Raw Materials| editor = Marco Beretta| year = 2004| publisher = Olschki\n| location = Florence |isbn= 88-222-5318-3\n}}</ref>\n\nGlasses with lead oxide content first appeared in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[History of glass|birthplace of the glass industry]].<ref name=tait/> The earliest known example is a blue glass fragment from [[Nippur]] dated to 1400 BC containing 3.66% PbO.

J. |journal=Archaeometry |volume=3 |pages=1\u20134}}</ref> A red sealing-wax cake found in the Burnt Palace at [[Nimrud]], from the early 6th century BC, contains 10% PbO. These low values suggest that lead oxide may not have been consciously added, and was certainly not used as the primary fluxing agent in ancient glasses.\n\nLead glass also occurs in [[Han Dynasty|Han-period China]] (206 BC \u2013 220 AD). There, it was cast to imitate [[jade]], both for ritual objects such as big and small figures, as well as jewellery and a limited range of vessels. Since glass first occurs at such a late date in China, it is thought that the technology was brought along [[Silk Road|the Silk Road]] by glassworkers from the Middle East.<ref name=tait/> The fundamental compositional difference between Western silica-[[natron]] glass and the unique Chinese lead glass, however, may indicate an autonomous development.\n\nIn medieval and [[early modern Europe]], lead glass was used as a base in coloured glasses, specifically in mosaic [[tessera]]e, enamels, [[stained glass|stained-glass]] painting, and ''bijouterie'', where it was used to imitate [[gemstone|precious stones]]. Several textual sources describing lead glass survive. In the late 11th-early 12th century, ''Schedula Diversarum Artium'' (''List of Sundry Crafts''), the author known as \"[[Theophilus Presbyter]]\" describes its use as imitation gemstone, and the title of a lost chapter of the work mentions the use of lead in glass. The 12\u201313th century pseudonymus \"Heraclius\" details the manufacture of lead enamel and its use for window painting in his ''De Coloribus et artibus Romanorum'' (''Of Hues and Crafts of the Romans''). This refers to lead glass as \"Jewish glass\", perhaps indicating its transmission to Europe.<ref name=charleston/> A manuscript preserved in the [[Biblioteca Marciana]], Venice, describes the use of lead oxide in enamels and includes recipes for calcining lead to form the oxide. Lead glass was ideally suited for enamelling vessels and windows owing to its lower working temperature than the [[forest glass]] of the body.\n\n[[Antonio Neri]] devoted book four of his ''L\u2019Arte Vetraria'' (\"The Art of Glass-making\", 1612) to lead glass. In this first systematic treatise on glass, he again refers to the use of lead glass in enamels, glassware, and for the imitation of precious stones. [[Christopher Merrett]] translated this into English in 1662 (''The Art of Glass''), paving the way for the production of English lead crystal glass by George Ravenscroft.\n\n[[George Ravenscroft]] (1618\u20131681) was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. The son of a merchant with close ties to Venice, Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, setting the basis from which England overtook Venice and Bohemia as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With the aid of Venetian glassmakers, especially da Costa, and under the auspices of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers of London, Ravenscroft sought to find an alternative to Venetian [[cristallo]]. His use of flint as the silica source has led to the term [[flint glass]] to describe these crystal glasses, despite his later switch to sand.<ref name=hurst-vose/> At first, his glasses tended to [[wikt:crizzle|crizzle]], developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency, which was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt, up to 30%. Crizzling results from the destruction of the glass network by an excess of alkali, and may be caused by excess humidity as well as inherent defects in glass composition.<ref name=newton/> He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production  moved from his glasshouse in the [[precinct of the Savoy]], London, to the seclusion of [[Henley-on-Thames]].<ref name=macleod>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3105182 |jstor=3105182 |pages=776\u2013803 |last1=MacLeod |first1=Christine |title=Accident or Design? George Ravenscroft's Patent and the Invention of Lead-Crystal Glass |volume=28 |issue=4 |journal=Technology and Culture |year=1987}}</ref> In 1676, having apparently overcome the crizzling problem, Ravenscroft was granted the use of a raven's head seal as a guaranty of quality. In 1681, the year of his death, the patent expired and operations quickly developed among several firms, where by 1696 twenty-seven of the eighty-eight glasshouses in England, especially at London and Bristol, were producing flint glass containing 30\u201335% PbO.<ref name=hurst-vose/>\n\nAt this period, glass was sold by weight, and the typical forms were rather heavy and solid with minimal decoration. Such was its success on the international market, however, that in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax by weight. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as ''Excise glasses''.<ref name=hurst-vose/> In 1780, the Government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation. English labour and capital then shifted to Dublin and Belfast, and new glassworks specialising in [[Art glass#Cut glass|cut glass]] were installed in Cork and [[Waterford]]. In 1825, the tax was renewed, and gradually the industry declined until the mid-nineteenth century, when the tax was finally repealed.<ref name=tait/>\n\nFrom the 18th century, English lead glass became popular throughout Europe, and was ideally suited to the new taste for wheel-cut glass decoration perfected on the Continent owing to its relatively soft properties. In Holland, local engraving masters such as David Wolff and [[Frans Greenwood]] stippled imported English glassware, a style that remained popular through the eighteenth century.<ref name=tait/> Such was its popularity in Holland that the first Continental production of lead-crystal glass began there, probably as the result of imported English workers.<ref name=charleston/> Imitating lead-crystal ''\u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d\u2019Angleterre'' presented technical difficulties, as the best results were obtained with covered pots in a coal-fired furnace, a particularly English process requiring specialised cone-furnaces.<ref name=hurst-vose/> Towards the end of the eighteenth century, lead-crystal glass was being produced in France, Hungary, Germany, and Norway.<ref name=charleston/><ref name=\"Ajka Krist\u00e1ly\">{{cite web |url=http://ajka-crystal.hu/en/aboutus |title=About us \u2013 Ajka Krist\u00e1ly |location=Ajka, Hungary |publisher=Ajka Krist\u00e1ly |accessdate=16 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220080518/http://ajka-crystal.hu/en/aboutus |archive-date=20 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By 1800, [[Ireland|Irish]] lead crystal had overtaken lime-potash glasses on the Continent, and traditional glassmaking centres in Bohemia began to focus on colored glasses rather than compete directly against it.\n\nThe development of lead glass continued through the twentieth century, when in 1932 scientists at the [[Corning Inc.|Corning Glassworks]], New York State, developed a new lead glass of high optical clarity. This became the focus of [[Steuben Glass Works]], a division of Corning, which produced decorative vases, bowls, and glasses in [[Art Deco]] style. Lead-crystal continues to be used in industrial and decorative applications.\n\n==Lead glazes==\nThe fluxing and refractive properties valued for lead glass also make it attractive as a pottery or [[ceramic glaze]]. Lead glazes first appear in first century BC to first century AD Roman wares, and occur nearly simultaneously in China. They were very high in lead, 45\u201360% PbO, with a very low alkali content, less than 2%.<ref name=tite>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1998.tb00836.x |title=Lead Glazes in Antiquity\u2014methods of Production and Reasons for Use |year=1998 |last1=Tite |first1=M.

In China, similar glazes were used from the twelfth century for colored enamels on stoneware, and on porcelain from the fourteenth century.\nThese could be applied in three different ways. Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body in the form of a lead compound in suspension, either from [[galena]] (PbS), [[red lead]] (Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), [[white lead]] (2PbCO<sub>3</sub>\u00b7Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub>), or [[Lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] (PbO). The second method involves mixing the lead compound with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the lead compound with silica, powdering the mixture, and suspending and applying it.<ref name=tite/> The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between the glaze and the ceramic body microscopically.\n\n[[Tin glazing|Tin-opacified glazes]] appear in Iraq in the eighth century AD. Originally containing 1\u20132% PbO; by the eleventh century high-lead glazes had developed, typically containing 20\u201340% PbO and 5\u201312% alkali. These were used throughout Europe and the Near East, especially in [[Iznik pottery|Iznik ware]], and continue to be used today. Glazes with even-higher lead content occur in Spanish and Italian [[maiolica]], with up to 55% PbO and as low as 3% alkali.<ref name=tite/> Adding lead to the melt allows the formation of [[tin(II) oxide|tin oxide]] more readily than in an alkali glaze: tin oxide precipitates into crystals in the glaze as it cools, creating its opacity.\n\nThe use of lead glaze has several advantages over alkali glazes in addition to their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and [[frit]]ted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not ''crawl'', or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the [[surface tension]] of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the [[thermal expansion|thermal contraction]] of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5\u201315% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>/\u00b0C, compared to 9 to 10\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>/\u00b0C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>/\u00b0C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>/\u00b0C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15\u201325% CaO.<ref name=tite/> Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900\u20131100&nbsp;\u00b0C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.<ref name=tite/>\nLead glass and glazes have a long and complex history, and continue to play new roles in industry and technology today.\n\n==Lead crystal==\n[[File:Crystbeads.jpg|thumb|Lead crystal beads]]\n[[Lead(II) oxide|Lead oxide]] added to the molten glass gives lead crystal a much higher [[index of refraction]] than normal glass, and consequently much greater \"sparkle\" by increasing [[specular reflection]] and the range of angles of [[total internal reflection]]. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of ''n'' = 1.5; the addition of lead produces an index of refraction of up to 1.7.<ref name=\"newton\"/> This heightened refractive index also raises the correlating index{{clarify|date=January 2020}} of [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], which measures the degree to which a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. This increase in refractive index from 1.5 to 1.7 significantly increases the amount of light reflected (by a factor of 1.68 for light reflecting in the normal direction; see [[Fresnel equations]]).\n\nIn [[Art glass#Cut glass|cut glass]], which has been hand- or machine-cut with facets, the presence of lead also makes the glass softer and easier to cut. Crystal can consist of up to 35% lead, at which point it has the most sparkle.<ref name=\"newton\"/>\n\nMakers of lead crystal objects include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Polity\n!Production began\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[NovaScotian Crystal]]\n|[[Canada]]\n|1996\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Gus Crystal]]\n|[[Russia]]\n|1756\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat]]\n|[[France]]\n|1764\n|Part of the [[Starwood Capital Group]] since 2005\n|-\n|[[Saint-Louis (glass manufacturer)|Saint-Louis]]\n|[[France]]\n|1781\n|Part of [[Herm\u00e8s]] since 1989\n|-\n|[[Lalique]]\n|[[France]]\n|1920s\n|Part of the [[Art & Fragrance]] since 2011\n|-\n|[[Daum (studio)|Daum]]\n|[[France]]\n|1878\n|Part of [[Financiere Saint-Germain]] since 2009 after bankruptcy in 2003\n|-\n|[[Luminarc|Arc International]]\n|[[France]]\n|1968\n|Production of [[Arc International#Cristal d'Arques|Crystal D'Arque]] ended in 2009; restarted in 2010 as lead-free Diamax.\n|-\n|[[Dartington Crystal]]\n|[[England]]\n|1967\n|Management buy out in 2006.\n|-\n|[[Cumbria Crystal]]\n|[[England]]\n|1976\n|Last remaining Luxury Cut Crystal producer in the UK.\n|-\n|[[Royal Brierley]]\n|[[England]]\n|1776\n|Trademark of the [[Dartington Crystal]] since 2006\n|-\n|[[Waterford Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|1783\n|[[Waterford Wedgwood|WWRD Holdings]] of [[KPS Capital Partners]] after bankruptcy in 2009.\n|-\n|[[Galway Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Tipperary Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|1987\n|Founded by former [[Waterford Crystal]] craftsmen.\n|-\n|[[Cavan Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Tyrone Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|1971\n|Factory closed 2010\n|-\n|[[Dingle Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|1998\n|\n|-\n|[[Edinburgh Crystal]]\n|[[Scotland]]\n|1867\n|Trademark of the WWRD Holdings after bankruptcy in 2006\n|-\n|[[Hadeland Glassverk]]\n|[[Norway]]\n|1765\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Magnor Glassverk]]\n|[[Norway]]\n|1830\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Orrefors glassworks]]\n|[[Sweden]]\n|1913\n|Part of the Swedish glassworks group [[Orrefors Kosta Boda AB]] since 2005\n|-\n|[[Kosta Boda]]\n|[[Sweden]]\n|1742\n|Part of the Swedish glassworks group [[Orrefors Kosta Boda AB]] since 2005\n|-\n|[[Holmegaard Glass Factory]]\n|[[Denmark]]\n|1825\n|Production ceased in 2009\n|-\n|[[Val Saint Lambert]]\n|[[Belgium]]\n|1826\n|Sold to [[Onclin]] winemaker family for $5M in 2008\n|-\n|[[Mozart Crystal]]\n|[[Brazil]]\n|2018\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Royal Leerdam Crystal]]\n|[[Netherlands]]\n|1765\n|Merged with porcelain factory [[De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles]] in 2008\n|-\n|[[Zwiesel Kristallglas]]\n|[[Germany]]\n|1872\n|Management buy out at [[Schott AG]] in 2001.

The attractive optical properties of lead glass result from the high content of the [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] lead. The high [[atomic number]] of lead also raises the density of the material, since lead has a very high [[atomic mass|atomic weight]] of 207.2, versus 40.08 for calcium. The density of soda glass is {{convert|abbr=on|2.4|g/cm3|g/cuin|lk=in}} or below, while typical lead crystal has a density of around {{cvt|3.1|g/cm3|g/in3||}} and high-lead glass can be over {{cvt|4.0|g/cm3|g/in3||}} or even up to {{cvt|5.9|g/cm3|g/in3||}}.<ref name=newton/>\n\nThe brilliance of lead crystal relies on the high [[refractive index]] caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of ''n'' = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7<ref name=newton/> or 1.8.<ref>[http://physics.info/refraction/ Refraction of media tutorial]. physics.info</ref> This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], which measures the degree to which a medium separates light into its component [[visible spectrum|spectra]], as in a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for [[lens (optics)|lens]] making, since a given [[focal length]] can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be [[achromatic lens|achromatic]].\n\nThe addition of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its [[viscosity]], rendering it more fluid than ordinary soda glass above softening temperature (about {{convert|abbr=on|600|\u00b0C|F|disp=or}}), with a working point of {{convert|abbr=on|800|\u00b0C|F}}. The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, but that of lead glass is roughly 100 times less than that of ordinary soda glasses across working temperature ranges (up to {{convert|abbr=on|1100|\u00b0C|F| disp=or}}). From the glassmaker's perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in [[enamelling]], and second, clear vessels may be made free from trapped air bubbles with considerably less difficulty than with ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects. \n\nWhen tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a [[soda-lime glass]], the former absorbs more energy when struck{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. This causes the lead crystal to [[oscillate]], thereby producing its characteristic sound.<ref name=newton/> Lead also increases the solubility of [[tin]], [[copper]], and [[antimony]], leading to its use in colored enamels and [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]s. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the [[glass solder]]s.\n\n[[File:Fluoroscopy room with control space.jpg|thumb|Fluoroscopy room with control space separated by [[lead shielding]] glass.]]\nThe presence of lead is used in glasses absorbing [[gamma radiation]] and [[X-ray]]s, used in [[radiation shielding]] as a form of [[lead shielding]] (e.g. in [[cathode ray tube]]s, where lowering the exposure of the viewer to soft X-rays is of concern).\n\nThe high [[ionic radius]] of the Pb<sup>2+</sup> ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda-lime glass (10<sup>8.5</sup> vs 10<sup>6.5</sup> Ohm\u00b7cm, [[direct current|DC]] at {{convert|abbr=on|250|\u00b0C|F|disp=or}}).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASIYuNCp81YC&pg=PA158&dq=%22glass+solders%22&cd=3#v=onepage&q=%22glass%20solders%22 |title=Ceramic and Glass Materials: Structure, Properties and Processing|page=158|author=James F.

The lead oxide used in lead glass could be obtained from a variety of sources. In Europe, [[galena]], lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be [[Smelting|smelted]] to produce metallic lead. The lead metal would be [[Calcination|calcined]] to form lead oxide by roasting it and scraping off the [[litharge]]. In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] lead metal could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver [[cupellation]], and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.<ref name=fiori>{{cite book\n|last = Fiori|first = Cesare|author2=Mariangela Vandini\n | title = When Glass Matters: Studies in the History of Science and Art from Graeco-Roman Antiquity to Early Modern Era| chapter = Chemical Composition of Glass and its Raw Materials| editor = Marco Beretta| year = 2004| publisher = Olschki\n| location = Florence |isbn= 88-222-5318-3\n}}</ref>\n\nGlasses with lead oxide content first appeared in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[History of glass|birthplace of the glass industry]].<ref name=tait/> The earliest known example is a blue glass fragment from [[Nippur]] dated to 1400 BC containing 3.66% PbO.

J. |journal=Archaeometry |volume=3 |pages=1\u20134}}</ref> A red sealing-wax cake found in the Burnt Palace at [[Nimrud]], from the early 6th century BC, contains 10% PbO. These low values suggest that lead oxide may not have been consciously added, and was certainly not used as the primary fluxing agent in ancient glasses.\n\nLead glass also occurs in [[Han Dynasty|Han-period China]] (206 BC \u2013 220 AD). There, it was cast to imitate [[jade]], both for ritual objects such as big and small figures, as well as jewellery and a limited range of vessels. Since glass first occurs at such a late date in China, it is thought that the technology was brought along [[Silk Road|the Silk Road]] by glassworkers from the Middle East.<ref name=tait/> The fundamental compositional difference between Western silica-[[natron]] glass and the unique Chinese lead glass, however, may indicate an autonomous development.\n\nIn medieval and [[early modern Europe]], lead glass was used as a base in coloured glasses, specifically in mosaic [[tessera]]e, enamels, [[stained glass|stained-glass]] painting, and ''bijouterie'', where it was used to imitate [[gemstone|precious stones]]. Several textual sources describing lead glass survive. In the late 11th-early 12th century, ''Schedula Diversarum Artium'' (''List of Sundry Crafts''), the author known as \"[[Theophilus Presbyter]]\" describes its use as imitation gemstone, and the title of a lost chapter of the work mentions the use of lead in glass. The 12\u201313th century pseudonymus \"Heraclius\" details the manufacture of lead enamel and its use for window painting in his ''De Coloribus et artibus Romanorum'' (''Of Hues and Crafts of the Romans''). This refers to lead glass as \"Jewish glass\", perhaps indicating its transmission to Europe.<ref name=charleston/> A manuscript preserved in the [[Biblioteca Marciana]], Venice, describes the use of lead oxide in enamels and includes recipes for calcining lead to form the oxide. Lead glass was ideally suited for enamelling vessels and windows owing to its lower working temperature than the [[forest glass]] of the body.\n\n[[Antonio Neri]] devoted book four of his ''L\u2019Arte Vetraria'' (\"The Art of Glass-making\", 1612) to lead glass. In this first systematic treatise on glass, he again refers to the use of lead glass in enamels, glassware, and for the imitation of precious stones. [[Christopher Merrett]] translated this into English in 1662 (''The Art of Glass''), paving the way for the production of English lead crystal glass by George Ravenscroft.\n\n[[George Ravenscroft]] (1618\u20131681) was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. The son of a merchant with close ties to Venice, Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, setting the basis from which England overtook Venice and Bohemia as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With the aid of Venetian glassmakers, especially da Costa, and under the auspices of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers of London, Ravenscroft sought to find an alternative to Venetian [[cristallo]]. His use of flint as the silica source has led to the term [[flint glass]] to describe these crystal glasses, despite his later switch to sand.<ref name=hurst-vose/> At first, his glasses tended to [[wikt:crizzle|crizzle]], developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency, which was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt, up to 30%. Crizzling results from the destruction of the glass network by an excess of alkali, and may be caused by excess humidity as well as inherent defects in glass composition.<ref name=newton/> He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production  moved from his glasshouse in the [[precinct of the Savoy]], London, to the seclusion of [[Henley-on-Thames]].<ref name=macleod>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3105182 |jstor=3105182 |pages=776\u2013803 |last1=MacLeod |first1=Christine |title=Accident or Design? George Ravenscroft's Patent and the Invention of Lead-Crystal Glass |volume=28 |issue=4 |journal=Technology and Culture |year=1987}}</ref> In 1676, having apparently overcome the crizzling problem, Ravenscroft was granted the use of a raven's head seal as a guaranty of quality. In 1681, the year of his death, the patent expired and operations quickly developed among several firms, where by 1696 twenty-seven of the eighty-eight glasshouses in England, especially at London and Bristol, were producing flint glass containing 30\u201335% PbO.<ref name=hurst-vose/>\n\nAt this period, glass was sold by weight, and the typical forms were rather heavy and solid with minimal decoration. Such was its success on the international market, however, that in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax by weight. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as ''Excise glasses''.<ref name=hurst-vose/> In 1780, the Government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation. English labour and capital then shifted to Dublin and Belfast, and new glassworks specialising in [[Art glass#Cut glass|cut glass]] were installed in Cork and [[Waterford]]. In 1825, the tax was renewed, and gradually the industry declined until the mid-nineteenth century, when the tax was finally repealed.<ref name=tait/>\n\nFrom the 18th century, English lead glass became popular throughout Europe, and was ideally suited to the new taste for wheel-cut glass decoration perfected on the Continent owing to its relatively soft properties. In Holland, local engraving masters such as David Wolff and [[Frans Greenwood]] stippled imported English glassware, a style that remained popular through the eighteenth century.<ref name=tait/> Such was its popularity in Holland that the first Continental production of lead-crystal glass began there, probably as the result of imported English workers.<ref name=charleston/> Imitating lead-crystal ''\u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d\u2019Angleterre'' presented technical difficulties, as the best results were obtained with covered pots in a coal-fired furnace, a particularly English process requiring specialised cone-furnaces.<ref name=hurst-vose/> Towards the end of the eighteenth century, lead-crystal glass was being produced in France, Hungary, Germany, and Norway.<ref name=charleston/><ref name=\"Ajka Krist\u00e1ly\">{{cite web |url=http://ajka-crystal.hu/en/aboutus |title=About us \u2013 Ajka Krist\u00e1ly |location=Ajka, Hungary |publisher=Ajka Krist\u00e1ly |accessdate=16 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220080518/http://ajka-crystal.hu/en/aboutus |archive-date=20 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By 1800, [[Ireland|Irish]] lead crystal had overtaken lime-potash glasses on the Continent, and traditional glassmaking centres in Bohemia began to focus on colored glasses rather than compete directly against it.\n\nThe development of lead glass continued through the twentieth century, when in 1932 scientists at the [[Corning Inc.|Corning Glassworks]], New York State, developed a new lead glass of high optical clarity. This became the focus of [[Steuben Glass Works]], a division of Corning, which produced decorative vases, bowls, and glasses in [[Art Deco]] style. Lead-crystal continues to be used in industrial and decorative applications.\n\n==Lead glazes==\nThe fluxing and refractive properties valued for lead glass also make it attractive as a pottery or [[ceramic glaze]]. Lead glazes first appear in first century BC to first century AD Roman wares, and occur nearly simultaneously in China. They were very high in lead, 45\u201360% PbO, with a very low alkali content, less than 2%.<ref name=tite>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1998.tb00836.x |title=Lead Glazes in Antiquity\u2014methods of Production and Reasons for Use |year=1998 |last1=Tite |first1=M.

In China, similar glazes were used from the twelfth century for colored enamels on stoneware, and on porcelain from the fourteenth century.\nThese could be applied in three different ways. Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body in the form of a lead compound in suspension, either from [[galena]] (PbS), [[red lead]] (Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), [[white lead]] (2PbCO<sub>3</sub>\u00b7Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub>), or [[Lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] (PbO). The second method involves mixing the lead compound with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the lead compound with silica, powdering the mixture, and suspending and applying it.<ref name=tite/> The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between the glaze and the ceramic body microscopically.\n\n[[Tin glazing|Tin-opacified glazes]] appear in Iraq in the eighth century AD. Originally containing 1\u20132% PbO; by the eleventh century high-lead glazes had developed, typically containing 20\u201340% PbO and 5\u201312% alkali. These were used throughout Europe and the Near East, especially in [[Iznik pottery|Iznik ware]], and continue to be used today. Glazes with even-higher lead content occur in Spanish and Italian [[maiolica]], with up to 55% PbO and as low as 3% alkali.<ref name=tite/> Adding lead to the melt allows the formation of [[tin(II) oxide|tin oxide]] more readily than in an alkali glaze: tin oxide precipitates into crystals in the glaze as it cools, creating its opacity.\n\nThe use of lead glaze has several advantages over alkali glazes in addition to their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and [[frit]]ted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not ''crawl'', or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the [[surface tension]] of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the [[thermal expansion|thermal contraction]] of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5\u201315% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>/\u00b0C, compared to 9 to 10\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>/\u00b0C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>/\u00b0C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>/\u00b0C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15\u201325% CaO.<ref name=tite/> Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900\u20131100&nbsp;\u00b0C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.<ref name=tite/>\nLead glass and glazes have a long and complex history, and continue to play new roles in industry and technology today.\n\n==Lead crystal==\n[[File:Crystbeads.jpg|thumb|Lead crystal beads]]\n[[Lead(II) oxide|Lead oxide]] added to the molten glass gives lead crystal a much higher [[index of refraction]] than normal glass, and consequently much greater \"sparkle\" by increasing [[specular reflection]] and the range of angles of [[total internal reflection]]. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of ''n'' = 1.5; the addition of lead produces an index of refraction of up to 1.7.<ref name=\"newton\"/> This heightened refractive index also raises the correlating index{{clarify|date=January 2020}} of [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], which measures the degree to which a medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a [[prism (optics)|prism]]. This increase in refractive index from 1.5 to 1.7 significantly increases the amount of light reflected (by a factor of 1.68 for light reflecting in the normal direction; see [[Fresnel equations]]).\n\nIn [[Art glass#Cut glass|cut glass]], which has been hand- or machine-cut with facets, the presence of lead also makes the glass softer and easier to cut. Crystal can consist of up to 35% lead, at which point it has the most sparkle.<ref name=\"newton\"/>\n\nMakers of lead crystal objects include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Polity\n!Production began\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[NovaScotian Crystal]]\n|[[Canada]]\n|1996\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Gus Crystal]]\n|[[Russia]]\n|1756\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Baccarat (company)|Baccarat]]\n|[[France]]\n|1764\n|Part of the [[Starwood Capital Group]] since 2005\n|-\n|[[Saint-Louis (glass manufacturer)|Saint-Louis]]\n|[[France]]\n|1781\n|Part of [[Herm\u00e8s]] since 1989\n|-\n|[[Lalique]]\n|[[France]]\n|1920s\n|Part of the [[Art & Fragrance]] since 2011\n|-\n|[[Daum (studio)|Daum]]\n|[[France]]\n|1878\n|Part of [[Financiere Saint-Germain]] since 2009 after bankruptcy in 2003\n|-\n|[[Luminarc|Arc International]]\n|[[France]]\n|1968\n|Production of [[Arc International#Cristal d'Arques|Crystal D'Arque]] ended in 2009; restarted in 2010 as lead-free Diamax.\n|-\n|[[Dartington Crystal]]\n|[[England]]\n|1967\n|Management buy out in 2006.\n|-\n|[[Cumbria Crystal]]\n|[[England]]\n|1976\n|Last remaining Luxury Cut Crystal producer in the UK.\n|-\n|[[Royal Brierley]]\n|[[England]]\n|1776\n|Trademark of the [[Dartington Crystal]] since 2006\n|-\n|[[Waterford Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|1783\n|[[Waterford Wedgwood|WWRD Holdings]] of [[KPS Capital Partners]] after bankruptcy in 2009.\n|-\n|[[Galway Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Tipperary Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|1987\n|Founded by former [[Waterford Crystal]] craftsmen.\n|-\n|[[Cavan Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Tyrone Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|1971\n|Factory closed 2010\n|-\n|[[Dingle Crystal]]\n|[[Ireland]]\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[Edinburgh Crystal]]\n|[[Scotland]]\n|1867\n|Trademark of the WWRD Holdings after bankruptcy in 2006\n|-\n|[[Hadeland Glassverk]]\n|[[Norway]]\n|1765\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Magnor Glassverk]]\n|[[Norway]]\n|1830\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Orrefors glassworks]]\n|[[Sweden]]\n|1913\n|Part of the Swedish glassworks group [[Orrefors Kosta Boda AB]] since 2005\n|-\n|[[Kosta Boda]]\n|[[Sweden]]\n|1742\n|Part of the Swedish glassworks group [[Orrefors Kosta Boda AB]] since 2005\n|-\n|[[Holmegaard Glass Factory]]\n|[[Denmark]]\n|1825\n|Production ceased in 2009\n|-\n|[[Val Saint Lambert]]\n|[[Belgium]]\n|1826\n|Sold to [[Onclin]] winemaker family for $5M in 2008\n|-\n|[[Mozart Crystal]]\n|[[Brazil]]\n|2018\n|Production continued\n|-\n|[[Royal Leerdam Crystal]]\n|[[Netherlands]]\n|1765\n|Merged with porcelain factory [[De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles]] in 2008\n|-\n|[[Zwiesel Kristallglas]]\n|[[Germany]]\n|1872\n|Management buy out at [[Schott AG]] in 2001.

Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to [[theft]]. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is caught by [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] and arrested.\n\nIn court, Lois is sentenced to serve three years in prison. The Griffin household turns to chaos in Lois' absence, and the family realizes they need to break Lois out of jail.  During a visit to Lois in the prison, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] smuggles her out by stuffing her into his mouth.

Joe successfully tracks the family down and pursues them through Asiantown, leading them into the city sewers. Lois decides to surrender and face the consequences so that the rest of the family won't have to, but as Joe attempts to detain her, he slips in the sewer and is almost swept off a nearby ledge.
