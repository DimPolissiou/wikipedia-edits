Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethra karyam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families - Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.\n \nAnother version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of [[Laccadive Sea]], he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts \u2013 thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spst.in/temple-history/ |title=Temple History}}</ref> The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur [[Naduvil Madhom]].<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n===Travancore royal family===\nIn the first half of the 18th century, in line with [[Nair|matrilineal customs]], Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], succeeded his uncle Rama Varma as king at the age of 23. He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about this stories but overall he took control and centralized the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.<ref name=\"Temples of Kerala\" /> Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\n==Temple structure==\n[[File:Thiruvanthapuram Temple Approach.JPG|thumb|200px|The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple]]\n\n===Main shrine===\nIn the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}</ref> The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation.

At the same time, Marthanda Varma also brought 12,000 [[shaligram]]s, [[aniconism|aniconic]] representations of [[Vishnu]], from the [[Gandaki River]], north of Benares (now known as [[Varanasi]]) to the temple. These were used in the reconsecration of the Padmanabha.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Travancore from the Earliest Times|last1=Menon|first1=P.

Only the King of Travancore may perform sashtanga namaskaram, or prostrate on the \"Ottakkal Mandapam\". It is traditionally held that anybody who prostrates on the mandapam has surrendered all that he possesses to the Deity.

Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple).

The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\n[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.\n\n===Priests===\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from [[Naduvil Madhom]] and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies - Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi - are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Temple entry ===\nIn line with the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.<ref>Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice ''Frommer's India'' 2010 Page 281 \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple - This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non-Hindus, but the \"temple guides\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \"</ref>\n\n==Temple management==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.<ref>Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S.

Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple.

Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of these Mathilakam documents - segregated under 70 \"heads\" - is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\n==Temple assets==\n{{Main article|Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure}}\n{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family|Travancore Royal family]].

The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key.

Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure]]\n* [[Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n* [[Temples of Kerala]]\n* [[Methan mani]], clock tower adjoining the temple\n* {{Portal-inline|India}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Padmanabhaswamy Temple}}\n* [http://spst.in/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Official Website)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416181925/http://www.sree-padmanabhaswamy.com/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Information About Sree Padmanabhaswamy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184850/http://www.247onlinenews.com/2011/07/padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasures-belong-to-royal-family-sankaracharya/ Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasures belong to royal family: Sankaracharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024931/http://mapkerala.in/page/padmanabhaswamy_temple Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n* [https://templesblog.com/sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n{{Vishnu temples}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Thiruvananthapuram}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n\n[[Category:Vishnu temples]]\n[[Category:Divya Desams]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Monuments of National Importance in Kerala]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Travancore royal family]]\n[[Category:Tamilakam]]\n", "text_old": "{{manual|date=August 2017}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox temple\n| image              = TVM Padmanabhaswamy Temple.jpg\n| alt                =\n| caption            =\n| coordinates        ={{coord|8|28|58|N|76|56|37|E|type:landmark_region:IN|display=inline,title}}\n| country            = [[India]]\n| state              = [[Kerala]]\n| district           =\n| location           = [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n| elevation_m        =\n| deity = [[Vishnu|Maha Vishnu]]\n| architecture       = Fusion of [[Architecture of Kerala|Kerala Architecture]] and [[ Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Architecture]]\n| inscriptions       =\n| creator            =\n| website            = [http://spst.in/ Official website]\n}}\n\n{{Vaishnavism}}\nThe '''Padmanabhaswamy temple''' is a [[Hindu temple]] located in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the state capital of [[Kerala]], [[India]].

Parasurama entrusted 'Kshethra karyam' (Administration of the Temple) with seven Potti families - Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti, Neythasseri Potti and Sreekaryathu Potti. King Adithya Vikrama of Vanchi (Venad) was directed by Parasurama to do 'Paripalanam' (Protection) of the Temple. Parasurama gave the Tantram of the Temple to Tharananallur Namboothiripad. This legend is narrated in detail in 'Kerala Mahathmyam' which forms part of 'Brahmanda Puranam'.\n \nAnother version regarding the consecration of the Main Idol of the Temple relates to the legendary sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar. Swamiyar, who resided near [[Ananthapura Lake Temple|Ananthapuram Temple]] in Kasaragod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his ''[[Dar\u015bana|darshan]]'' or \"auspicious sight\". The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy who disappeared before him. Realizing the boy was no ordinary mortal, the sage wept for forgiveness and asked for another darshan as a sign. He heard a voice say \"If you want to see me come to the Anathavana (the unending forest or ananthakadu). After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of [[Laccadive Sea]], he heard a ''[[pulaya]]'' lady warning her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake [[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]]). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvattar near Thuckalay Tamil Nadu, Body or Udal at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram near Kulathoor and Technopark (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts \u2013 thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti.

He successfully suppressed the 700-year-old stranglehold of the [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\") and his cousins following the discovery of conspiracies which the lords were involved in against the royal house of Travancore (There are various legends and disputes about this stories but overall he took control and centralized the rule). The last major renovation of the Padmanabhaswamy temple commenced immediately after Anizham Thirunal's accession to the musnud and the idol was reconsecrated in 906 [[Malayalam calendar|ME]] (1731 CE). On 17 January 1750, Anizham Thirunal surrendered the kingdom of [[Travancore]] to Padmanabha Swamy, the deity at the temple, and pledged that he and his descendants would be vassals or agents of the deity who would serve the kingdom as ''Padmanabha Dasa''.<ref name=\"Temples of Kerala\" /> Since then, the name of every Travancore king was preceded by the title Sree Padmanabha Dasa; the female members of the royal family were called Sree Padmanabha Sevinis. The donation of the king to Padmanabhaswamy was known as Thrippadi-danam. The final wishes of Anizham Thirunal on his passing at the age of 53 clearly delineated the historical relationship between the Maharaja and the temple: \"That no deviation whatsoever should be made in regard to the dedication of the kingdom to Padmanabhaswamy and that all future territorial acquisitions should be made over to the Devaswom.\"\n\n==Temple structure==\n[[File:Thiruvanthapuram Temple Approach.JPG|thumb|200px|The approach road to the Padmanabhaswamy temple]]\n\n===Main shrine===\nIn the ''[[sanctum sanctorum]]'', Padmanabha reclines on the serpent ''[[Ananta (infinite)|Anantha]] '' or ''Adi Sesha''.<ref>{{Citation |last=Jayashanker|first1=S|title=Temples of Kerala|year=1999}}</ref> The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation.

Thiruvambadi shrine enjoys an independent status and predates the shrine of Padmanabha. Thiruvambadi shrine has its own namaskara mandapam, bali stones and flagmast. The Lord of Thiruvambadi is Parthasarathi, the Divine Charioteer of [[Arjuna]]. The granite idol of the Lord of Thiruvambadi was brought from Gujarat by 72 families of Vrishni Vamsa Kshatriyas. As these Vrishnies belong to the lineage of Lord Krishna, they are known as Krishnan vakakkar. The two-armed granite idol, with one hand holding the whip and the other resting on the left thigh holding the conch close to it, is in standing posture. On [[Ekadasi]] days the Lord is dressed and decorated as [[Mohini]]. There are also shrines for [[Rama]] accompanied by [[Sita]], [[Lakshmana]] and [[Hanuman]], Vishwaksena (the Nirmalyadhari of Vishnu and Remover of Obstacles), [[Vyasa]], [[Ganapati]], [[Sasta]], and Kshetrapala (who guards the temple).

The major festivals are bi-annual. The ''Alpashy'' festival which is in October/November and the ''[[Panguni Uthiram|Panguni]]'' festival which is in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] month Panguni, March/April, lasts for 10 days each. On the ninth day the Maharajah of Travancore, in his capacity as Thrippappoor Mooppan, escorts the deities to the vettakkalam for Pallivetta. Centuries back, the Pallivetta procession was said to pass through Kaithamukku, Kuthiravattom (Kunnumpuram), [[Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple|Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram]] and Putharikkandam. The festivals culminate with the ''Aarat'' (holy bath) procession to the [[Shankumugham Beach]]. The word ''Aarat'' refers to the purificatory immersion of the deities of the temple in sea. This event takes place in the evening. The Maharajah of Travancore escorts the ''Aarat'' procession on foot. The festival idols \"Utsava Vigrahas\" of Padmanabhaswamy, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami are given a ritual bath in the sea, after the prescribed [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]s. After this ceremony, the idols are taken back to the temple in a procession that is lit by traditional torches, marking the conclusion of the festival.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\nA major annual festival related to Padmanabha temple is the ''[[Navaratri]]'' festival. The idols of [[Saraswati]] Amman, Mun Uditha Nangai ([[Parasakti]] who appeared before Saraswati, [[Lakshmi]] and Parvati to help them identify their husbands who had been transformed into infants by the power of chastity of [[Anasuya]]) and Kumara Swami ([[Murugan]]) are brought to the ''Kuthira malika'' palace in front of Padmanabha temple as a procession. This festival lasts for 9 days. The famous Swathi music festival is held every year during this festival.\n\n[[File:Aaratu3.jpg|thumb|upright|Big idol of Pandavas displayed during Panguni festival]]\n\nThe biggest festival in this temple is ''laksha deepam'', which means hundred thousand (or one [[lakh]]) lamps. This festival is unique and commences once in 6 years. Prior to this festival, chanting of prayers and recitation of three [[vedas]] is done for 56 days (Murajapam). On the last day, hundred thousand oil lamps are lit in and around the temple premises. The next ''laksha deepam'' is slated in January 2020.\n\n===Priests===\nTemples where 'Swamiyar Pushpanjali' is conducted are claimants to extra sanctity. Sannyasins from [[Naduvil Madhom]] and Munchira Madhom do pushpanjali (flower worship) daily to Padmanabha, Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. Tharananallur Nambuthiripads of Iranjalakkuda are the Tantris of the Temple. The Nambies, altogether four in number, are the Chief Priests of the Temple. Two Nambies - Periya Nambi and Panchagavyathu Nambi - are allotted to Padmanabha and one Nambi each to Narasimha Moorthi and Krishna Swami. The Nambies hail from either side of the Chandragiri River.<ref name=\"Aswathi\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Temple entry ===\nIn line with the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.<ref>Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, David Allardice ''Frommer's India'' 2010 Page 281 \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple - This Tamil style Vishnu temple, said to be the largest in Kerala, may be off-limits to non-Hindus, but the \"temple guides\" manage to target foreigners with great ease, leading them to the obligatory spots from. \"</ref>\n\n==Temple management==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nThe Padmanabhaswamy Temple and its property were controlled by the [[Ettara Yogam]] (King and Council of Eight) with the assistance of [[Ettuveetil Pillamar]] (\"Lords of the Eight Houses\"). The Ettara Yogam consists of Pushpanjali Swamiyar, six member Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha, Sabhanjithan (Secretary) and Arachan (Maharaja of Travancore). Thiruvananthapurathu Sabha was primarily responsible for the administration of the Temple. Koopakkara Potti, Vanchiyoor Athiyara Potti, Kollur Athiyara Potti, Muttavila Potti, Karuva Potti and Neythasseri Potti are the members of the Sabha. The Pushpanjali Swamiyar presides over the meetings of the Sabha. Sreekaryathu Potti is the Sabhanjithan of the Sabha.<ref>Sri Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram Charithra Rekhakalilude by S. Uma Maheswari</ref> Any decision taken by the Sabha can be implemented only if the Maharaja of Travancore approves of it.<ref>Charithram Kuricha Sree Padmanabha Swamy Kshethram by Dr MG Sasibhooshan and Dr RP Raja</ref> It is believed that eight members of Ettara Yogam (seven Potties and the Maharaja of Travancore) received their rights from Lord Parashurama Himself.\n\nIn the past, only the Swamiyars of the [[Naduvil Madhom]] were appointed as Pushpanjali Swamiyars by the [[Maharaja of Travancore]]. Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] curtailed the authority of Ettara Yogam and liquidated the powerful Ettuveetil Pillamar. Ettara Yogam became an advisory and assenting body thereafter. Besides Naduvil Madhom, Munchira Madhom got the right to appoint Pushpanjali Swamiyars during his reign. In the recent past, [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] gave Pushpanjali rights to the Swamiyars of Thrikkaikattu Madhom and Thekke Madhom as well. Though the Maharaja is the appointing authority of the Pushpanjali Swamiyar, the former must do a Vechu Namaskaram when he sees the Swamiyar. With the passing away of Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma in December 2013, his nephew [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]] became the titular Maharaja of Travancore in January 2014. Like his predecessors, Moolam Thirunal also got concurrence from the Ettara Yogam before assuming the title 'Maharaja'. In the presence of the Maharaja designate, the Yogathil Pottimar and the Tantri, the Pushpanjali Swamiyar Maravanchery Thekkedathu Neelakanta Bharatikal signed on the Neettu (Order) of the Ettara Yogam accepting Moolam Thirunal as ''Chirava Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Maharaja of Travancore) and ''Thrippappoor Mootha Thiruvadi'' (Protector of the Temple). This ceremony took place at Kulasekhara Mandapam in Padmanabha Swamy Temple. [[Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma]], grandson of Maharani Regent Pooradom Thirunal [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]], is the titular Elayaraja of Travancore.\n\n==Extant temple records==\n{{Inline citations|date=October 2019}}\nA pertinent event in the long history of the temple was the construction of a \"granta-pura\" (record-room) within the temple compound itself around 1425 A.D. by the then Venad King Veera Iravi Iravi Varma, to store the \"Mathilakam\" (within-the-walls) records, as the then existing temple records were known.<ref name=\"frontline.in\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2815/stories/20110729281512800.htm|title=Key to the past|publisher=}}</ref> A major portion of those records (over 3000 'Cadjan' leaf-records) from the Mathikalam had been donated later to the Archives Department in 1867 at the time of the formation of the latter. Each of these Cadjan leaf-records, which have been compiled over thousands of years, contains 10,000 documentations according to [[R._Nagaswamy]], noted archeologist and historian, totaling over 30 crores of records. Despite their cultural value, only a minuscule portion of these grantas (bundles) of cadjan leaf records, written mostly in ancient scripts of proto-[[Tamil script|Tamil]] and archaic-Malayalam, have been deciphered. The translations of this section of manuscripts by some scholars serve as a rare but very inadequate primary source material on the temple and its rich traditions.\n\nThe rest of these Mathilakam documents - segregated under 70 \"heads\" - is still lying idle with the Archives Department. According to Aswathi Thirunal Gouri Lakshmi Bayi, a member of the Travancore Royal Family and author of a book on the temple, from a very early period in recorded history the temple had employed two kinds of 'record writers'. One group was to record the proceedings and transactions of the Ettarayogam, a council of temple administrators, that included the then king. The other was to write and preserve the records of the day-to-day functioning of the temple, maintain correct accounts of the temple-treasury, and of temple-revenue-collections and temple-expenditure, and as well as write down all the other records, connected with the functioning of the temple.\n\n==Temple assets==\n{{Main article|Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure}}\n{{wikinews|Hidden treasure worth billions of dollars discovered in Indian temple}}\nThe temple and its assets belong to Lord Padmanabhaswamy, and were for a long time controlled by a trust, headed by the [[Travancore royal family|Travancore Royal family]].

While vault B has been unopened over centuries, A was possibly opened in the 1930s, and vaults C to F have been opened from time to time over recent years. The two priests of the temple, the 'Periya Nambi' and the 'Thekkedathu Nambi', are the custodians of the four vaults, C to F, which are opened periodically. The Supreme Court had directed that \"the existing practices, procedures, and rituals\" of the temple be followed while opening vaults C to F and using the articles inside, while Vaults A and B would be opened only for the purpose of making an inventory of the articles and then closed. The review of the temple's underground vaults was undertaken by a seven-member panel appointed by the [[Supreme Court of India]] to generate an inventory, leading to the enumeration of a vast collection of articles that are traditionally kept under lock and key.

According to it, the gold and precious stones contained in Vault B, which is by far the largest and the only vault (of the reported six) that is unopened so far, since the discovery of the treasure, was worth INR 12,000 Crores in the then (1880s') terms.

This was possibly an antechamber of any of the Vaults A or C or D or E or F that may not have been opened yet. This was necessitated due to the severe economic depression that India was going through as was the entire world. The Palace and State Treasuries had run almost dry. The small group of people including the King and the priests found a granary-sized structure almost full with mostly gold and some silver coins and jewels. Surmounted on top of it were hundreds of pure gold pots. There were four coffers filled with gold coins as well. Also found was a larger chest fixed to the ground with six sections in it. They were full of gold jewelry encrusted with diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds.

The IB cites Mr Subramaniam's report on Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple as one of the instances where he relied heavily on his spiritual instincts rather than rational logic and hard facts.<ref name=\"The Economic Times, June 25, 2014\">The Economic Times, June 25, 2014</ref> In his second report on Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple, Mr Subramaniam himself reveals,\"It was his morning ritual of [shutting] his mind and seeking guidance, which resulted in discoveries in this direction.\"<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 9</ref>\n\nThe Amicus Curiae has also been accused of conducting poojas in the Temple in violation of its customs.<ref name=\"The Economic Times, June 25, 2014\"/> He performed poojas at the Thevarappura in the Temple and in front of the Vedavyasa Shrine. Despite opposition from the Royal Family and the Tantries of the Temple, he pulled out a stone Yantra from the nearby Marthandan Madhom Palace and did pooja on it for several days. The Tantries explained that the Yantram had no connection with the Padmanabhaswami Temple and that it was for the protection of the Palace. But the Amicus Curiae insisted on having it installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. Due to severe opposition from the Tantries the Yantram remains where it was. Every morning, Lord Padmanabha is to be awakened only by blowing the conch shell and chanting the Sripada Sooktham. But the Amicus Curiae introduced the daily rendering of Venkatesa Suprabhatam to awaken the Lord. The Supreme Court requested the Tantri to take the final decision on whether the Suprabhatam could be sung. Following that, the Senior Tantri Nedumpilli Tharananalloor Parameswaran Namboothiripad directed the Temple authorities to stop the chanting of Suprabhatam forthwith, as it was causing 'Anya Mantra Yajana Dosham' (affliction due to worshipping the Deity with incompatible mantras) to the Presiding Deity and the Temple. As atonement for this dosham, the Tantri wants Vedic scholars to chant 12 'muras' each of Rig Veda and Yajur Veda. In his first report to the Supreme Court, the Amicus Curiae directed the Tantries to examine whether a [[Sri Yantra]] can be installed in the Sanctum Sanctorum, in front of the utsava moorthi.<ref>Report of the Amicus Curiae, Pg 63</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasure]]\n* [[Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n* [[Temples of Kerala]]\n* [[Methan mani]], clock tower adjoining the temple\n* {{Portal-inline|India}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Padmanabhaswamy Temple}}\n* [http://spst.in/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Official Website)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120416181925/http://www.sree-padmanabhaswamy.com/ Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple] (Information About Sree Padmanabhaswamy)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110709184850/http://www.247onlinenews.com/2011/07/padmanabhaswamy-temple-treasures-belong-to-royal-family-sankaracharya/ Padmanabhaswamy Temple treasures belong to royal family: Sankaracharya]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227024931/http://mapkerala.in/page/padmanabhaswamy_temple Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n* [https://templesblog.com/sree-padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram Padmanabhaswamy temple tour information]\n{{Vishnu temples}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Thiruvananthapuram}}\n{{Hinduism (compact)}}\n\n[[Category:Vishnu temples]]\n[[Category:Divya Desams]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in India]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Monuments of National Importance in Kerala]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Thiruvananthapuram]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Travancore royal family]]\n[[Category:Tamilakam]]\n", "name_user": "IamRohitKamal", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padmanabhaswamy_Temple"}
