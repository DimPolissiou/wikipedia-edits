Note that the shorter a lens's focal length, the wider its [[angle of view]] (the 'angle' in [[wide-angle lens]], for instance, which is \"how much you see\"), so the same idea can also be expressed as that the lens's ''angle of view'' plus ''camera-subject distance'' is the camera's ''field of view''.\n\n:'''Caution''': In this context, the focal length value differs with each [[film gauge]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] size for optical reasons, but the angle of view is the same for any of them, so it's easier comparing the angle of view with lenses for different formats than their focal lengths. The same angle of view always gives the same ''field size'' at the same camera-subject distance no matter what format you're using, but the same focal length does not.\n\n:For in-depth information behind the laws of optics regarding the influence that focal length and different formats have on ''field sizes'', see [[35 mm equivalent focal length]], [[crop factor]], [[image sensor format]], and [[Digital photography#Sensor size and angle of view|Digital photography: Sensor size and angle of view]].\n\nThe same ''field size'' can be achieved at varied camera-subject distances by using a lens with a compensating focal length, and at varied focal lengths by choosing a compensating camera-subject distance. ''Field size'' differs from ''framing'' in that within professional environments where [[prime lens]]es are dominant, the latter applies only to camera placement (including camera angle), not focal length.\n \nHowever, maintaining an identical ''field size'' at varying camera-subject distances and focal lengths must be handled with caution as it applies different amounts of [[perspective distortion (photography)|perspective distortion]] to the image: [[wide-angle lens]]es expand a perspective, while [[long focus lens]]es compress a perspective. The famous [[dolly zoom]], taken with a variable focal length lens, is a vivid, intuitive demonstration of this effect. Thus, it's more common in photography and cinematography to determine an image's ''field size'' by only changing one out of the two factors.<ref name=\"Pincus\" />\n\nWhen shooting video or film with human subjects, it is best to avoid cutting off human subjects with the bottom of the frame at the natural cut-off points (joints, neck). When the frame cuts off the subject at these positions, it looks unnatural. Therefore, filmmakers utilize the following shot types because the brain understands that the body continues beneath what it sees in the frame. This is because of a psychological term called [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] that refers to the human brain seeking complete perception of the subject.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roberts-Breslin, Jan.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1013499253|title=Making media : foundations of sound and image production|date=2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-28392-0|oclc=1013499253}}</ref> The ''field size'' (along with the specific amount of perspective distortion) greatly affects the [[narrative]] power of a shot.

''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'', a novel by [[Andy Weir]], served as the screenplay adapted by [[Drew Goddard]]. The film depicts an astronaut's ([[Matt Damon]]) lone struggle to survive on Mars after being left behind, and efforts to rescue him and bring him home to Earth. It also stars [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Sebastian Stan]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Aksel Hennie]] and [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]].\n\nProduced through [[20th Century Fox]], the film is a co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"lumiere\"/> Producer [[Simon Kinberg]] began developing the film after Fox [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the novel in March 2013, which [[Drew Goddard]] adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, but the film did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days. Twenty sets were built on one of the largest sound stages in the world in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. [[Wadi Rum]] in [[Jordan]] was also used for exterior filming.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2015, while the London premiere was held on September 24, 2015. The film was released in the United Kingdom on September 30, 2015, and in the United States on October 2, 2015, in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]] and [[4DX]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/south-korea-box-office-martian-832932|title=South Korea Box Office: 'Martian' Dominates for Second Consecutive Week|last=Lee |first=Hyo-won|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 19, 2015|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}</ref> It received positive reviews and grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date, as well as the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|10th-highest-grossing film of 2015]]. ''The Martian'' received <!-- Per WP:PEACOCK: Avoid terms like \"acclaim\" that promote the subject without attribution -->praise for its direction, visual effects, musical score, screenplay, scientific accuracy, and likability, largely due to Damon's performance.

A severe [[Climate of Mars#Effect of dust storms|dust storm]] threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The mission is scrubbed and as the crew evacuates, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm. The [[telemetry]] from his suit's biomonitor is damaged and Watney is presumed dead. With the MAV on the verge of toppling, the surviving crew take off for their orbiting vessel, the ''Hermes''.\n\nWatney awakens after the storm, injured and with a low-oxygen warning. He returns to the crew's surface habitat (\"Hab\") and [[self-surgery|treats his wound]]. As Watney recovers, he begins a video diary. Lacking communication with Earth, his only chance of rescue is via the next Mars mission, four years later: the Ares IV will be landing {{convert|3200|km|sp=us}} away at the [[Schiaparelli (Martian crater)|Schiaparelli crater]]. Watney's immediate concern is food; being the mission's [[botany|botanist]], he improvises a garden inside the Hab utilizing [[Martian soil]] fertilized with the crew's bio-waste, and manufactures water from leftover rocket fuel. He then plants the crew's unused [[Thanksgiving dinner]] [[potato]]es to supplement his food supply. He also begins modifying the [[rover (space exploration)|rover]] for the long-distance trek to the Ares IV landing site.\n\nOn Earth, [[NASA]] satellite planner Mindy Park, reviewing aerial Hab images, notices moved equipment and realizes Mark is alive. NASA director, Teddy Sanders, publicly releases the news, though the Ares III crew (still on route to Earth) are not told so that they remained focused on their mission. Sanders overrules ''Hermes'' [[Flight controller#Flight director|flight director]] Mitch Henderson, who believes the crew should know.\n\nWatney takes the rover to retrieve the nearby ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using ''Pathfinder''{{'}}s camera and motor, he establishes rudimentary two-way communication with Earth, first using hand-written signs, and then sending and receiving [[ASCII]] in [[hexadecimal]]. NASA transmits a [[patch (computing)|software patch]] to link the rover with ''Pathfinder'' and communicate via text. Watney is angry that  the ''Hermes'' crew is unaware that he is alive; Sanders finally allows Henderson to inform them.\n\nMars mission director, Vincent Kapoor, and [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) director Bruce Ng prepare an Iris [[space probe]] to deliver enough food for Watney to survive until Ares IV's arrival. Meanwhile, the Hab's airlock malfunctions, causing an implosion and damaging the structure. Watney repairs and pressurizes the Hab, but the Martian atmosphere has destroyed the current potato crop and sterilized the soil. Believing it a low risk, Sanders orders the routine pre-flight safety inspections be bypassed to expedite the probe's launch. The rocket explodes 40 seconds after liftoff. Watney now believes his death on Mars is inevitable.\n\nThe [[China National Space Administration]] has been developing a powerful classified [[booster (rocketry)|booster]] rocket, the ''Taiyang Shen''. Feeling camaraderie with NASA's scientists, they violate their government's secrecy and offer to repeat the Iris mission. As Watney's situation grows more risky as time passes, JPL [[astrodynamicist]] Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: have the ''Taiyang Shen'' [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with and resupply the ''Hermes'', which will then [[gravity assist|use Earth's gravity to \"slingshot\"]] back to Mars two years earlier than Ares IV. Sanders rejects the idea, considering it too risky for the ''Hermes'' crew; Henderson surreptitiously sends Purnell's plan to the crew who unanimously vote to implement it. They disable NASA's remote controls and make the course change. Powerless to stop them, NASA concedes the issue.\n\nWatney begins the 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli, where the MAV for Ares IV has been pre-positioned. The MAV needs to be lightened to intercept with ''Hermes'' on its new course. Watney removes many components,<!-- As I trim this plot summary to fit under the 700-word maximum, I feel rather like him in this scene --> and replaces the [[nose cone]] with canvas. After takeoff, the MAV fails to reach the required speed. Commander Lewis [[orbital maneuver|maneuvers]] the ''Hermes'' to decelerate, consuming much fuel. She also orders an [[Newton's laws of motion|directional explosive decompression]] of the internal atmosphere to better align the ship. In a [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]], Lewis is unable to reach Watney when the tether falls short. Watney pierces his pressure suit, using the escaping air to successfully propel himself to Lewis. He and the crew are reunited after Mark's 560 sols alone on Mars.\n\nAfter returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates. Five years later, as the Ares V is about to launch, those involved in Watney's rescue are seen in their current lives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1    = 128\n| width2    = 135\n| footer    = [[Matt Damon]] and [[Jessica Chastain]] star as Mark Watney and Melissa Lewis, respectively.\n| image1    = Matt Damon TIFF 2015.jpg\n| alt1      = Matt Damon\n| image2    = Jessica Chastain TIFF 2015.jpg\n| alt2      = Jessica Chastain\n}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Mark Watney, a botanist who is part of the Ares III team, mistakenly presumed dead after a violent storm on Mars.

''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'', a novel by [[Andy Weir]], served as the screenplay adapted by [[Drew Goddard]]. The film depicts an astronaut's ([[Matt Damon]]) lone struggle to survive on Mars after being left behind, and efforts to rescue him and bring him home to Earth. It also stars [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Sean Bean]], [[Sebastian Stan]], [[Donald Glover]], [[Aksel Hennie]] and [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]].\n\nProduced through [[20th Century Fox]], the film is a co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"lumiere\"/> Producer [[Simon Kinberg]] began developing the film after Fox [[option (filmmaking)|optioned]] the novel in March 2013, which [[Drew Goddard]] adapted into a screenplay and was initially attached to direct, but the film did not move forward. Scott replaced Goddard, and with Damon in place as the main character, production was approved. Filming began in November 2014 and lasted approximately seventy days. Twenty sets were built on one of the largest sound stages in the world in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. [[Wadi Rum]] in [[Jordan]] was also used for exterior filming.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2015 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 2015, while the London premiere was held on September 24, 2015. The film was released in the United Kingdom on September 30, 2015, and in the United States on October 2, 2015, in 2D, [[3D film|3D]], [[IMAX 3D]] and [[4DX]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/south-korea-box-office-martian-832932|title=South Korea Box Office: 'Martian' Dominates for Second Consecutive Week|last=Lee |first=Hyo-won|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 19, 2015|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}</ref> It received positive reviews and grossed over $630 million worldwide, becoming Scott's highest-grossing film to date, as well as the [[2015 in film#Highest-grossing films|10th-highest-grossing film of 2015]]. ''The Martian'' received <!-- Per WP:PEACOCK: Avoid terms like \"acclaim\" that promote the subject without attribution -->praise for its direction, visual effects, musical score, screenplay, scientific accuracy, and likability, largely due to Damon's performance. It received several accolades, including the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]], seven nominations at the [[88th Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] for Goddard, and the 2016 long form [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]].

A severe [[Climate of Mars#Effect of dust storms|dust storm]] threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The mission is scrubbed and as the crew evacuates, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm. The [[telemetry]] from his suit's biomonitor is damaged and Watney is presumed dead. With the MAV on the verge of toppling, the surviving crew take off for their orbiting vessel, the ''Hermes''.\n\nWatney awakens after the storm, injured and with a low-oxygen warning. He returns to the crew's surface habitat (\"Hab\") and [[self-surgery|treats his wound]]. As Watney recovers, he begins a video diary. Lacking communication with Earth, his only chance of rescue is via the next Mars mission, four years later: the Ares IV will be landing {{convert|3200|km|sp=us}} away at the [[Schiaparelli (Martian crater)|Schiaparelli crater]]. Watney's immediate concern is food; being the mission's [[botany|botanist]], he improvises a garden inside the Hab utilizing [[Martian soil]] fertilized with the crew's bio-waste, and manufactures water from leftover rocket fuel. He then plants the crew's unused [[Thanksgiving dinner]] [[potato]]es to supplement his food supply. He also begins modifying the [[rover (space exploration)|rover]] for the long-distance trek to the Ares IV landing site.\n\nOn Earth, [[NASA]] satellite planner Mindy Park, reviewing aerial Hab images, notices moved equipment and realizes Mark is alive. NASA director, Teddy Sanders, publicly releases the news, though the Ares III crew (still on route to Earth) are not told so that they remained focused on their mission. Sanders overrules ''Hermes'' [[Flight controller#Flight director|flight director]] Mitch Henderson, who believes the crew should know.\n\nWatney takes the rover to retrieve the nearby ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using ''Pathfinder''{{'}}s camera and motor, he establishes rudimentary two-way communication with Earth, first using hand-written signs, and then sending and receiving [[ASCII]] in [[hexadecimal]]. NASA transmits a [[patch (computing)|software patch]] to link the rover with ''Pathfinder'' and communicate via text. Watney is angry that  the ''Hermes'' crew is unaware that he is alive; Sanders finally allows Henderson to inform them.\n\nMars mission director, Vincent Kapoor, and [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) director Bruce Ng prepare an Iris [[space probe]] to deliver enough food for Watney to survive until Ares IV's arrival. Meanwhile, the Hab's airlock malfunctions, causing an implosion and damaging the structure. Watney repairs and pressurizes the Hab, but the Martian atmosphere has destroyed the current potato crop and sterilized the soil. Believing it a low risk, Sanders orders the routine pre-flight safety inspections be bypassed to expedite the probe's launch. The rocket explodes 40 seconds after liftoff. Watney now believes his death on Mars is inevitable.\n\nThe [[China National Space Administration]] has been developing a powerful classified [[booster (rocketry)|booster]] rocket, the ''Taiyang Shen''. Feeling camaraderie with NASA's scientists, they violate their government's secrecy and offer to repeat the Iris mission. As Watney's situation grows more risky as time passes, JPL [[astrodynamicist]] Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: have the ''Taiyang Shen'' [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with and resupply the ''Hermes'', which will then [[gravity assist|use Earth's gravity to \"slingshot\"]] back to Mars two years earlier than Ares IV. Sanders rejects the idea, considering it too risky for the ''Hermes'' crew; Henderson surreptitiously sends Purnell's plan to the crew who unanimously vote to implement it. They disable NASA's remote controls and make the course change. Powerless to stop them, NASA concedes the issue.\n\nWatney begins the 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli, where the MAV for Ares IV has been pre-positioned. The MAV needs to be lightened to intercept with ''Hermes'' on its new course. Watney removes many components,<!-- As I trim this plot summary to fit under the 700-word maximum, I feel rather like him in this scene --> and replaces the [[nose cone]] with canvas. After takeoff, the MAV fails to reach the required speed. Commander Lewis [[orbital maneuver|maneuvers]] the ''Hermes'' to decelerate, consuming much fuel. She also orders an [[Newton's laws of motion|directional explosive decompression]] of the internal atmosphere to better align the ship. In a [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]], Lewis is unable to reach Watney when the tether falls short. Watney pierces his pressure suit, using the escaping air to successfully propel himself to Lewis. He and the crew are reunited after Mark's 560 sols alone on Mars.\n\nAfter returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates. Five years later, as the Ares V is about to launch, those involved in Watney's rescue are seen in their current lives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width1    = 128\n| width2    = 135\n| footer    = [[Matt Damon]] and [[Jessica Chastain]] star as Mark Watney and Melissa Lewis, respectively.\n| image1    = Matt Damon TIFF 2015.jpg\n| alt1      = Matt Damon\n| image2    = Jessica Chastain TIFF 2015.jpg\n| alt2      = Jessica Chastain\n}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Mark Watney, a botanist who is part of the Ares III team, mistakenly presumed dead after a violent storm on Mars.

It convenes International Permafrost Conferences, undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks. Among other issues addressed by the IPA are: Problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost, e.g. the preservation of organisms frozen ''in situ''.\n\n===Construction on permafrost===\nBuilding on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure. Three common solutions include: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[Deep foundation|piles]]; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1\u20132 metres/3.3\u20136.6 feet thick); or using [[anhydrous ammonia]] [[heat pipe]]s.<ref name=\"ASCE\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Clarke\n | first = Edwin S.\n | title = Permafrost Foundations\u2014State of the Practice\n | work = Monograph Series\n | publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers\n | date = 2007\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O-voTug5apsC&pg=PA34\n | isbn = 978-0-7844-0947-3}}\n</ref> The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses [[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|heat pipes built into vertical supports]] to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with [[Frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]]. Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called \"[[Utility tunnel#In Arctic towns|utilidors]]\".\n\nThe [[Melnikov Permafrost Institute]] in [[Yakutsk]], found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground can be prevented by using pile foundations extending down to {{convert|15|m}} or more.

This is the oldest plant tissue ever revived. The plant was fertile, producing white flowers and viable seeds.

There was presumably a bath-house belonging to the 4th-century fort. The Roman baths incorporated a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor [[Postumus]], dating from AD 262\u2013266. The 3rd-century fort was garrisoned by the ''ala Sebosiana'' and the ''numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium''.<ref>Birley, CW- XXXIX, p. 222.</ref>\n\nThe ancient ''Wery Wall'' was identified in 1950 as the north wall of the 4th-century fort, which constituted a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. Exceptionally the later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive curtain-wall and projecting bastions typical of the ''Saxon Shore'' or in Wales. The extension of this technique as far north as Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the attacks on the west coast and the disaster in the [[Carausian Revolt]] of AD 296, following on from those under [[Clodius Albinus|Albinus]] in AD 197.\n\nThe fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was {{convert|9|-|10|acres|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>Shotter, p. 14.</ref> The evidence suggests that the fort remained active up to the end of [[Roman occupation of Britain]] in the early 5th century.<ref>Shotter, p. 27.</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Lancaster between the end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest in the late 11th century. Despite a lack of documentation from the period, it is likely that Lancaster was still inhabited. Lancaster was on the fringes of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]], and over time, control may have changed from one to the other.<ref>{{harvnb |White |2001 |p=33}}</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests there was a monastery on or near the site of today's [[Lancaster Priory]] by the 700s or 800s. For example, an Anglo-Saxon [[Runes|runic]] cross found at the Priory in 1807, known as \"Cynibald's cross\", is thought to have been made in the late 9th century. Lancaster was probably one of the numerous monasteries founded under [[Wilfrid]].<ref>White, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Lancaster in 1728.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in 1728]]\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Lancaster fell under the control of [[William the Conqueror|William I]], as stated in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, which is the earliest known mention of Lancaster in any document. The founding charter of the Priory, dated 1094, is the first known document which is specific to Lancaster.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\">White, p. 57.</ref> By this time William had given Lancaster and its surrounding region to [[Roger the Poitevin|Roger de Poitou]]. This document also suggests that the monastery had been refounded as a parish church at some point before 1066.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\"/>\n\nLancaster became a [[Ancient borough|borough]] in 1193 under King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. Its first [[Municipal charter|charter]], dated 12 June 1193, was from [[John, King of England|John]], [[List of counts of Mortain|Count of Mortain]], who later became King of England.<ref>White, p. 35.</ref>\n[[File:DV342 Lancaster from the south.png|thumb|Lancaster from the south in 1825]]\n[[Lancaster Castle]], partly built in the 13th century and enlarged by [[Elizabeth I]], stands on the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[garrison]]. Lancaster Castle is well known as the site of the [[Pendle witch trials]] in 1612. It was said that the court based in the castle (the Lancaster [[Assizes]]) sentenced more people to be [[hanging|hanged]] than any other in the country outside [[London]], earning Lancaster the nickname, ''\"the Hanging Town\"''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/lancast.html |title=Lancaster Castle|publisher=}}</ref> Lancaster also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the reformation with the execution of at least eleven Catholic priests. A memorial to the [[Lancaster Martyrs]] is located close to the city centre.\n\n[[File:Lancaster from Lune Bank, Skerton.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in the 19th century]]\nThe traditional emblem for the [[House of Lancaster]] is a red rose, the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]], similar to that of the [[House of York]], which is a white rose. These names derive from the emblems of the Royal Duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in the 15th century. This erupted into a [[civil war]] over rival claims to the throne during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nIn more recent times, the term ''\"Wars of the Roses\"'' has been applied to rivalry in sports between teams representing [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], not just the cities of Lancaster and [[York]]. It is also applied to the [[Roses Tournament]] in which Lancaster and York universities compete every year.<ref>Students celebrate...{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenationalstudent.co.uk/2010/05/04/students-celebrate-as-lancaster-triumphs-in-war-of-the-roses/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810202750/http://www.thenationalstudent.co.uk/2010/05/04/students-celebrate-as-lancaster-triumphs-in-war-of-the-roses/ |archivedate=10 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St. George's Quay.JPG|thumb|St. George's Quay]]\nLancaster gained its first [[charter]] in 1193<ref name=timeline>{{Cite web |url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/articles/towns/lanctime.shtml |title=Lancaster Timeline |publisher=}}</ref> as a [[market town]] and [[borough]], but was not given city status until 1937.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/civic-ceremonial/former-mayors-city-lancaster/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019171426/http://www.lancaster.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/civic-ceremonial/former-mayors-city-lancaster/ |url-status=dead |title=Former Mayors of the City of Lancaster |archivedate=19 October 2014}}</ref> Many buildings in the [[city centre]] and along St. George's Quay date from the 19th century, built as the port became one of the busiest in the UK and the fourth most important in the UK's [[slave trade]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/362/1-slave-trade.html |title=Online 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=}}</ref> One prominent Lancaster slave-trader was [[Dodshon Foster]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Andrew White |title=Lancaster: A History |publisher=Phillimore & Co. |year=2003}} p. 63.</ref> However, Lancaster's role as a major port was short-lived, as the river began to silt up.<ref name=timeline/> [[Morecambe]], [[Glasson Dock]] and [[Sunderland Point]] served as Lancaster's port for brief periods.

The former [[City]] and [[Municipal Borough]] of Lancaster and the [[Morecambe and Heysham|Municipal Borough of Morecambe and Heysham]] along with other authorities merged in 1974 to form the [[City of Lancaster|District of Lancaster]] within the [[shire county]] of Lancashire. This was given [[city status in the United Kingdom]] and Lancaster City Council is the local governing body for the district. Lancaster is an [[unparished area]] and has no separate council. It is divided into wards such as Bulk, Castle, Ellel, John O'Gaunt (named after [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]), [[Scotforth]] East, Scotforth West, [[Skerton]] East, Skerton West, and University and Scotforth Rural.\n\n===Political representation===\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[File:Lancaster, Lancs coa.png|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Lancaster City Council.]] -->\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nMost of the city lies in the [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] constituency for elections of Members of Parliament to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The current MP for [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] is [[Cat Smith]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Skerton part of the city lies in the [[Morecambe and Lunesdale]] constituency represented by [[David Morris (Conservative politician)|David Morris]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nBefore [[Brexit]], it was in the [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] European Parliamentary Constituency.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the city council was under the control of the [[Morecambe Bay Independents]] (MBIs), who campaigned for an independent Morecambe council. In 2003, their influence waned and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the LibDems and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]s in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in [[no overall control]], with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint administrative arrangement with the Greens.\n\nThe [[2019 Lancaster City Council election]] result saw no party in overall control. The Council is run by a coalition of Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat parties with Conservatives and Independents in opposition. At 10 seats, Lancaster has one of the largest Green Party representations in the country.\n\n==Geography==\nLancaster is the most northerly city in Lancashire, lying three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) inland from [[Morecambe Bay]] on the [[River Lune]] (from which it derives its name), and the [[Lancaster Canal]].

There was presumably a bath-house belonging to the 4th-century fort. The Roman baths incorporated a reused inscription of the Gallic Emperor [[Postumus]], dating from AD 262\u2013266. The 3rd-century fort was garrisoned by the ''ala Sebosiana'' and the ''numerus Barcariorum Tigrisiensium''.<ref>Birley, CW- XXXIX, p. 222.</ref>\n\nThe ancient ''Wery Wall'' was identified in 1950 as the north wall of the 4th-century fort, which constituted a drastic remodelling of the 3rd-century one, while retaining the same orientation. Exceptionally the later fort is the only example in north-west Britain of a 4th-century type, with massive curtain-wall and projecting bastions typical of the ''Saxon Shore'' or in Wales. The extension of this technique as far north as Lancaster shows that the coast between Cumberland and North Wales was not left defenceless after the attacks on the west coast and the disaster in the [[Carausian Revolt]] of AD 296, following on from those under [[Clodius Albinus|Albinus]] in AD 197.\n\nThe fort underwent a few more extensions, and at its largest area it was {{convert|9|-|10|acres|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>Shotter, p. 14.</ref> The evidence suggests that the fort remained active up to the end of [[Roman occupation of Britain]] in the early 5th century.<ref>Shotter, p. 27.</ref>\n\nLittle is known about Lancaster between the end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman Conquest in the late 11th century. Despite a lack of documentation from the period, it is likely that Lancaster was still inhabited. Lancaster was on the fringes of the kingdoms of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]], and over time, control may have changed from one to the other.<ref>{{harvnb |White |2001 |p=33}}</ref> Archaeological evidence suggests there was a monastery on or near the site of today's [[Lancaster Priory]] by the 700s or 800s. For example, an Anglo-Saxon [[Runes|runic]] cross found at the Priory in 1807, known as \"Cynibald's cross\", is thought to have been made in the late 9th century. Lancaster was probably one of the numerous monasteries founded under [[Wilfrid]].<ref>White, p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Lancaster in 1728.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in 1728]]\nFollowing the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Lancaster fell under the control of [[William the Conqueror|William I]], as stated in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, which is the earliest known mention of Lancaster in any document. The founding charter of the Priory, dated 1094, is the first known document which is specific to Lancaster.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\">White, p. 57.</ref> By this time William had given Lancaster and its surrounding region to [[Roger the Poitevin|Roger de Poitou]]. This document also suggests that the monastery had been refounded as a parish church at some point before 1066.<ref name=\"White, p. 57\"/>\n\nLancaster became a [[Ancient borough|borough]] in 1193 under King [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. Its first [[Municipal charter|charter]], dated 12 June 1193, was from [[John, King of England|John]], [[List of counts of Mortain|Count of Mortain]], who later became King of England.<ref>White, p. 35.</ref>\n[[File:DV342 Lancaster from the south.png|thumb|Lancaster from the south in 1825]]\n[[Lancaster Castle]], partly built in the 13th century and enlarged by [[Elizabeth I]], stands on the site of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[garrison]]. Lancaster Castle is well known as the site of the [[Pendle witch trials]] in 1612. It was said that the court based in the castle (the Lancaster [[Assizes]]) sentenced more people to be [[hanging|hanged]] than any other in the country outside [[London]], earning Lancaster the nickname, ''\"the Hanging Town\"''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/lancast.html |title=Lancaster Castle|publisher=}}</ref> Lancaster also figured prominently in the suppression of Catholicism during the reformation with the execution of at least eleven Catholic priests. A memorial to the [[Lancaster Martyrs]] is located close to the city centre.\n\n[[File:Lancaster from Lune Bank, Skerton.jpg|thumb|Lancaster in the 19th century]]\nThe traditional emblem for the [[House of Lancaster]] is a red rose, the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]], similar to that of the [[House of York]], which is a white rose. These names derive from the emblems of the Royal Duchies of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in the 15th century. This erupted into a [[civil war]] over rival claims to the throne during the [[Wars of the Roses]].\n\nIn more recent times, the term ''\"Wars of the Roses\"'' has been applied to rivalry in sports between teams representing [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]], not just the cities of Lancaster and [[York]]. It is also applied to the [[Roses Tournament]] in which Lancaster and York universities compete every year.<ref>Students celebrate...{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenationalstudent.co.uk/2010/05/04/students-celebrate-as-lancaster-triumphs-in-war-of-the-roses/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810202750/http://www.thenationalstudent.co.uk/2010/05/04/students-celebrate-as-lancaster-triumphs-in-war-of-the-roses/ |archivedate=10 August 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St. George's Quay.JPG|thumb|St. George's Quay]]\nLancaster gained its first [[charter]] in 1193<ref name=timeline>{{Cite web |url=http://www.timetravel-britain.com/articles/towns/lanctime.shtml |title=Lancaster Timeline |publisher=}}</ref> as a [[market town]] and [[borough]], but was not given city status until 1937.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/civic-ceremonial/former-mayors-city-lancaster/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019171426/http://www.lancaster.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/civic-ceremonial/former-mayors-city-lancaster/ |url-status=dead |title=Former Mayors of the City of Lancaster |archivedate=19 October 2014}}</ref> Many buildings in the [[city centre]] and along St. George's Quay date from the 19th century, built as the port became one of the busiest in the UK and the fourth most important in the UK's [[slave trade]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jrank.org/cultures/pages/362/1-slave-trade.html |title=Online 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=}}</ref> One prominent Lancaster slave-trader was [[Dodshon Foster]].<ref>{{Cite book |author=Andrew White |title=Lancaster: A History |publisher=Phillimore & Co. |year=2003}} p. 63.</ref> However, Lancaster's role as a major port was short-lived, as the river began to silt up.<ref name=timeline/> [[Morecambe]], [[Glasson Dock]] and [[Sunderland Point]] served as Lancaster's port for brief periods.

The former [[City]] and [[Municipal Borough]] of Lancaster and the [[Morecambe and Heysham|Municipal Borough of Morecambe and Heysham]] along with other authorities merged in 1974 to form the [[City of Lancaster|District of Lancaster]] within the [[shire county]] of Lancashire. This was given [[city status in the United Kingdom]] and Lancaster City Council is the local governing body for the district. Lancaster is an [[unparished area]] and has no separate council. It is divided into wards such as Bulk, Castle, Ellel, John O'Gaunt (named after [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]]), [[Scotforth]] East, Scotforth West, [[Skerton]] East, Skerton West, and University and Scotforth Rural.\n\n===Political representation===\n<!-- Missing image removed: [[File:Lancaster, Lancs coa.png|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Lancaster City Council.]] -->\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nMost of the city lies in the [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] constituency for elections of Members of Parliament to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The current MP for [[Lancaster and Fleetwood]] is [[Cat Smith]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The Skerton part of the city lies in the [[Morecambe and Lunesdale]] constituency represented by [[David Morris (Conservative politician)|David Morris]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].\n\nBefore [[Brexit]], it was in the [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West England]] European Parliamentary Constituency.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, the city council was under the control of the [[Morecambe Bay Independents]] (MBIs), who campaigned for an independent Morecambe council. In 2003, their influence waned and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] became the largest party on the council. They formed a coalition with the LibDems and Greens. At the May 2007 local elections, Labour lost ground to the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]s in Lancaster and the MBIs in Morecambe, resulting in [[no overall control]], with all parties represented in a PR administration. The 2011 elections saw Labour emerge as the largest party. They reached a joint administrative arrangement with the Greens.\n\nThe [[2019 Lancaster City Council election]] result saw no party in overall control. The Council is run by a coalition of Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat parties with Conservatives and Independents in opposition. At 10 seats, Lancaster has one of the largest Green Party representations in the country.\n\n==Geography==\nLancaster is the most northerly city in Lancashire, lying three miles ({{convert|3|mi|abbr=on|disp=output only}}) inland from [[Morecambe Bay]] on the [[River Lune]] (from which it derives its name), and the [[Lancaster Canal]]. The settlement gets more hilly from the Lune Valley towards the east, with Williamson Hill in the north-west a notable high point at {{convert|109|m|ft}}.\n\n===Green belt===\n{{main|North West Green Belt}}\nThere is a small portion of green belt on the northern fringes of Lancaster, covering the area above its urban area through to Carnforth, helping to keep the adjacent countryside open, and prevent further urban expansion between these and the nearby communities of Morecambe, Hest Bank, Slyne and Bolton-le-Sands.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Environmental studies |url=http://www.lancaster.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/environmental-studies |website=Lancaster City Council}}</ref>\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Lancaster'''\n|North-west = [[Morecambe Bay]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]\n|North = [[Slyne]], [[Hest Bank]], [[Bolton-le-Sands]], [[Carnforth]], [[Milnthorpe]], [[Kendal]]\n|North-east = [[Caton, Lancashire|Caton]], [[Halton, Lancashire|Halton]], [[Kirkby Lonsdale]], [[Wennington (Lancashire)|Wennington]]\n|West = [[Morecambe]], [[Heysham]]\n|Centre = Lancaster\n|East = [[Quernmore]]\n|South-west = [[Glasson Dock]], [[Pilling]], [[Knott End-on-Sea]], [[Fleetwood]], [[Poulton-le-Fylde]], [[Blackpool]]\n|South = [[Lancaster University]], [[Galgate]], [[Bay Horse]], [[Garstang]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]\n|South-east = [[Abbeystead]], [[Forest of Bowland]], [[Dolphinholme]]\n}}\n\n==Transport==\n===Road===\n[[File:King Street, Lancaster, with the castle in the background - geograph.org.uk - 945333.jpg|thumb|King Street with the castle in the background]]\nThe [[M6 motorway]] passes to the east of Lancaster, with junctions 33 and 34 to the south and north respectively.

Somehow, Gizmo transforms the toy into a real-life robot that can walk and talk for the duration of the adventure, although he still needs to be wound up regularly.\n\nIn the first episode, Chris and Joy were cleaning the attic for Chris's father, a somewhat eccentric college professor, when they noticed an old book glowing. The children tried to open the book, but were unable to open it, no matter how hard they pulled.  The book promptly opened on its own, shining a blinding light around Chris's bedroom, and started to speak before whisking the children and Gizmo back in time to the [[Garden of Eden]] to experience the story of [[Adam and Eve]].\n\nIn ''Superbook II'' (''Pasokon Travel Tanteidan''), which took place two years after the first series, the book fell onto a computer keyboard, giving anybody the ability to see into the past from Christopher's home via the monitor. Ruffles, his poodle, has managed to get lost in time, which prompted Gizmo and Christopher's little brother (rewritten as his cousin in the English dub) named Uriah \"Uri\" Peepers (Yuu Asuka in Japanese) to search for her. Chris and Joy kept watch and control of the computer from the present. The older children also had a hard time trying to prevent what happened a secret from Chris's parents. In this series, Gizmo appeared as a fully fledged functioning robot in the present day rather than as a toy in the second series but still needed to be wound up regularly. Gizmo also has a built-in computer keyboard and a monitor in his chest for Gizmo and Uri to stay in contact with Chris and Joy in the present day as well as transporting to other places in time or returning to the present.\n\nThe first series of ''Superbook'' featured stories chiefly from the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]] ([[Old Testament]]), although a few episodes dealt with the life and ministry of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the final episode was about the conversion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Tarsus]].  The episodes in the first series are chiefly unique stories, with no overarching \"plot\" aside from Chris and Joy learning life lessons from their travels in the Superbook.  However, some condensation or editing of stories was necessary to fit them into half-hour episodes and make them suitable for young viewers.  Also, some additional edits were necessary for the English versions to make the episodes conform to American broadcast standards.\n\nThe episodes in Season Two focused solely on Old Testament stories.  Season Two covered some stories featured in Season One (for example, the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and [[David|King David]]) in more detail, while also covering some stories not included in the first series (i.e. the fall of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]).  In Season Two, the overarching plot concern was Uri and Gizmo's quest to find the missing Ruffles. Likewise ''[[The Flying House (TV series)|The Flying House]],'' which originally aired in Japan between the two ''Superbook'' series, was a more in-depth look at the life of Jesus and other events from the Christian Scriptures (New Testament). Additionally, unlike season 1 (and by extension the aforementioned Flying House series), the interaction between the modern day characters and the Biblical characters in season 2 is minimal; each episode is mostly a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical stories shown, occurring while Uri and Gizmo are searching for Ruffles.\n\n===Reboot===\nSet in the 23rd century AD, a boy named Chris, who always has problems, travels with his friends Joy and Gizmo who travel with Superbook to the Biblical times from the [[Old Testament]] and [[New Testament]].\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n\n====Original Series====\n\nThe main cast of the original series includes:\n\n* '''Christopher \"Chris\" Peeper{{fact|date=January 2020}} (Sho Asuka)''' \u2013 The main hero of the series the son of Professor Peeper and the owner of Gizmo, Chris is a somewhat lazy type of boy who doesn't like school and goes to sometimes ridiculous extremes to get out of doing housework or homework.\n* '''Joyeux \"Joy\" Pepper{{fact|date=January 2020}} (Azusa Yamato)''' \u2013 Christopher's next door neighbor and best friend.\n* '''Uriah \"Uri\" Quantum (Yuu Asuka)''' \u2013 Chris's cousin, the new owner of Gizmo, and the son of Fred's younger brother inventor Kenneth \"Ken\" Peepers.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n* '''Professor Frederick \"Fred\" Quantum (Professor Asuka)''' \u2013 Christopher's father.

Somehow, Gizmo transforms the toy into a real-life robot that can walk and talk for the duration of the adventure, although he still needs to be wound up regularly.\n\nIn the first episode, Chris and Joy were cleaning the attic for Chris's father, a somewhat eccentric college professor, when they noticed an old book glowing. The children tried to open the book, but were unable to open it, no matter how hard they pulled.  The book promptly opened on its own, shining a blinding light around Chris's bedroom, and started to speak before whisking the children and Gizmo back in time to the [[Garden of Eden]] to experience the story of [[Adam and Eve]].\n\nIn ''Superbook II'' (''Pasokon Travel Tanteidan''), which took place two years after the first series, the book fell onto a computer keyboard, giving anybody the ability to see into the past from Christopher's home via the monitor. Ruffles, his poodle, has managed to get lost in time, which prompted Gizmo and Christopher's little brother (rewritten as his cousin in the English dub) named Uriah \"Uri\" Peepers (Yuu Asuka in Japanese) to search for her. Chris and Joy kept watch and control of the computer from the present. The older children also had a hard time trying to prevent what happened a secret from Chris's parents. In this series, Gizmo appeared as a fully fledged functioning robot in the present day rather than as a toy in the second series but still needed to be wound up regularly. Gizmo also has a built-in computer keyboard and a monitor in his chest for Gizmo and Uri to stay in contact with Chris and Joy in the present day as well as transporting to other places in time or returning to the present.\n\nThe first series of ''Superbook'' featured stories chiefly from the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Scriptures]] ([[Old Testament]]), although a few episodes dealt with the life and ministry of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and the final episode was about the conversion of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Tarsus]].  The episodes in the first series are chiefly unique stories, with no overarching \"plot\" aside from Chris and Joy learning life lessons from their travels in the Superbook.  However, some condensation or editing of stories was necessary to fit them into half-hour episodes and make them suitable for young viewers.  Also, some additional edits were necessary for the English versions to make the episodes conform to American broadcast standards.\n\nThe episodes in Season Two focused solely on Old Testament stories.  Season Two covered some stories featured in Season One (for example, the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and [[David|King David]]) in more detail, while also covering some stories not included in the first series (i.e. the fall of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]).  In Season Two, the overarching plot concern was Uri and Gizmo's quest to find the missing Ruffles. Likewise ''[[The Flying House (TV series)|The Flying House]],'' which originally aired in Japan between the two ''Superbook'' series, was a more in-depth look at the life of Jesus and other events from the Christian Scriptures (New Testament). Additionally, unlike season 1 (and by extension the aforementioned Flying House series), the interaction between the modern day characters and the Biblical characters in season 2 is minimal; each episode is mostly a straightforward adaptation of the Biblical stories shown, occurring while Uri and Gizmo are searching for Ruffles.\n\n===Reboot===\nSet in the 23rd century AD, a boy named Chris, who always has problems, travels with his friends Joy and Gizmo who travel with Superbook to the Biblical times from the [[Old testament]] and [[New testament]].\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n\n====Original Series====\n\nThe main cast of the original series includes:\n\n* '''Christopher \"Chris\" Peeper{{fact|date=January 2020}} (Sho Asuka)''' \u2013 The main hero of the series the son of Professor Peeper and the owner of Gizmo, Chris is a somewhat lazy type of boy who doesn't like school and goes to sometimes ridiculous extremes to get out of doing housework or homework.\n* '''Joyeux \"Joy\" Pepper{{fact|date=January 2020}} (Azusa Yamato)''' \u2013 Christopher's next door neighbor and best friend.\n* '''Uriah \"Uri\" Quantum (Yuu Asuka)''' \u2013 Chris's cousin, the new owner of Gizmo, and the son of Fred's younger brother inventor Kenneth \"Ken\" Peepers.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n* '''Professor Frederick \"Fred\" Quantum (Professor Asuka)''' \u2013 Christopher's father.

Superbook whisks them back to meet a tax collector named Zacchaeus in ancient Jericho. The kids are amazed to watch how a sinner like Zacchaeus is transformed when he meets Jesus. Joy sees that Jesus came to seek and save the lost--including herself! Joy realizes that she also needs to accept Jesus as her Savior--just as Zacchaeus did--and begins to understand why Chris is so excited about being baptized.

Chris and Joy witness Jesus' encounter with a Roman Centurion and learn that the Kingdom of God is open to everyone who accepts the Lord and tries to follow the narrow path of Christ's footsteps. Back home, Chris displays his new understanding at a Bible study group that the first step in leading a Christian life is admitting you can't do it without God's help.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us-en.superbook.cbn.com/content/sermon-mount|title=Sermon on the Mount|publisher=Christian Broadcasting Network|website=Superbook}}</ref>\n| LineColor       = 4B0082\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 57\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Isaiah\n| AltTitle        = \n| Aux1            = Isaiah 6:1-13, 36\n| DirectedBy      = Bryant P.

Aeroflot's CEO Vitaly Saveliev intends to make its fleet younger in accordance to its corporate strategy to keep the airline competitive with other international airlines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2020-03-06/aeroflot-inducts-a350-while-pledging-take-indigenous-jets|title=Aeroflot Inducts A350 While Pledging to Take Indigenous Jets|last=Karnozov|first=Vladimir|website=Aviation International News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== Current ==\n\nThe Aeroflot fleet comprises the following aircraft ({{as of|2020|02|lc=y}}):<ref name=\"plane_park\">{{cite web|title= Aircraft Fleet|url= https://www.aeroflot.ru/ru-en/flight/plane_park|publisher= Aeroflot|date= 1 February 2020|archive-url= \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20191012085314/https://www.aeroflot.ru/ru-en/flight/plane_park|archive-date= 12 October 2019|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;text-align:center\"\n|+\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Aircraft type\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:60px;\" | In service\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:50px;\" | Orders\n! colspan=\"4\" | Passengers\n! rowspan=\"2\" |  Notes\n|-\n! <abbr title=\"Business Class\">B</abbr>\n! <abbr title=\"Comfort Class\">C</abbr>\n! <abbr title=\"Economy Class\">E</abbr>\n!

During the 1940s and the early 1950s, the main aircraft was the [[Lisunov Li-2]] a license-built version of the [[Douglas DC-3]]. The first to be produced in the Soviet Union was completed in 1939. DC-3s modified by fitting Soviet-made engines, named the PS-84, were also used later.

During the 1940s and the early 1950s, the main aircraft was the [[Lisunov Li-2]] a license-built version of the [[Douglas DC-3]]. The first to be produced in the Soviet Union was completed in 1939. DC-3s modified by fitting Soviet-made engines, named the PS-84, were also used later. The Li-2 would be replaced by the [[Ilyushin Il-12]], which entered service in 1947, and the [[Ilyushin Il-14]], which entered service in 1954. Aeroflot also operated thousands of the [[Antonov An-2]] STOL biplane (first flying in 1947), in passenger and cargo roles. The An-2 remained in service until the 1980s.\n\n[[File:Aeroflot Tu-104B CCCP-42403 LBG 1974-8-2.png|thumb|An Aeroflot [[Tupolev Tu-104]] at [[Le Bourget Airport]] in 1974]]\nAeroflot began operating the [[Tupolev Tu-104]], reportedly named ''Silver Arrow'',<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=19 October 1956|title=World's second jet service|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%201503.html|journal=Flight|volume=|pages=659|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523131123/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%201503.html|archive-date=23 May 2013|via=}}</ref> with at least three in service between Moscow and the [[Russian Far East]] by {{start date|1956|6}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=29 June 1956|title=I.C.A.O. at Caracas|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%200854.html|journal=Flight|volume=|pages=854|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523124549/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%200854.html|archive-date=23 May 2013|via=}}</ref> The Tu-104 was the USSR's first [[Jet aircraft|jet airliner]].<ref name=\"Flight1959-615\" />{{rp|615}} The first two routes on which it was deployed were the Moscow\u2013[[Irkutsk]] and the Moscow\u2013[[Yakutsk]] runs;<ref name=\":3\" /> in {{start date|df=yes|1956|9}}, the Moscow\u2013[[Tiflis]] route became the third scheduled service flown with the aircraft.<ref name=\"Flight1956-596\" /> Likewise, Moscow\u2013[[Prague]] was the first international route served with the Silver Arrow.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn 1962, Aeroflot began operating the [[Tupolev Tu-124]], the smaller version of the Tu-104, on regional routes.
