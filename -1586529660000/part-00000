None of Loa\u00edsa's seven ships completed the voyage, but ''Santa Mar\u00eda de la Victoria'' reached the [[Moluccas]] before being wrecked in a Portuguese attack. Successive chiefs of the expedition (Loa\u00edsa, Elcano, Salazar, I\u00f1iguez, De la Torre) died during the voyages. Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta and other fellow men survived, reaching the [[Spice Islands]] in 1526, to be taken prisoner by the Portuguese. Urdaneta and a few of his men returned to Spain in 1536 aboard Portuguese ships via India, the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and Portugal, and completed the second world circumnavigation in history.

As Usagi matures, she becomes a powerful warrior and protects her adopted home planet, Earth, from villains who wish to harm it. Usagi is depicted as usually carefree and cheerful, but with cry-baby tendencies that show themselves when things don't go her way.\n\nAs the protagonist, Usagi appears in every episode, film, television special, and [[original video animation]] (OVA) of the anime adaptations, ''[[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Sailor Moon Crystal]]''; as well as the live action adaptation, ''[[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (live-action series)|Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon]]''.

Mamoru and Usagi's relationship is a significant part of Usagi's [[personal life]], as well as the series as a whole. Mamoru and Usagi date for a long time in the series and the love they share helps her through many challenges. In the anime adaptation, Mamoru gives Usagi a heart-shaped promise ring just before he leaves for America. The ring represents a promise to Usagi that they will eventually marry.\n\nOnce she forms the Sailor Soldiers, Usagi learns that she comes from a race belonging to the Silver Millennium, and that her mother sent her to Earth to be reincarnated.

At first, this is always accompanied with the suffix ''{{nbh}}atama'', meaning \"head\", but this is gradually dropped. Usagi hates the name at first, but it develops into a sign of affection as they become close. Later in the series [[Sailor Uranus|Haruka]] and [[Sailor Star Fighter|Seiya]], other important figures in her life, adopt the name as well. Since there is no North American equivalent to ''odango'', the original English adaptation almost always used the phrases \"meatball head\" or \"moon face\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.smuncensored.com/comparison.php?episodeid=101 |title=Episode 101 |work= Sailor Moon Uncensored |accessdate= November 27, 2007 |last= Wheeler |first= Robert |author2= Bednarski, Dan |author3= Wood, Tiffany }}</ref> In the Tokyopop Manga adaptation, Mamoru calls Usagi \"buns\", which is an approximation of ''odango'' and is short for \"Bunny\".

She is more outgoing and extroverted, and makes friends very easily. This immediately puts her personality in conflict with the other Sailor Soldiers, each of whom is solitary to some degree. She rarely uses [[formal grammar]] with those of her age (though she does with adults), and refers to everyone as \"''given name''-chan\" (which is very informal and a way of expressing closeness). She teases Ami when Ami continues calling her \"Tsukino-san\" (a formal way of speaking to classmates), saying that it is as if they are not friends.<ref>''Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon'', Act 5.</ref> Every time a new Sailor Soldier appears, Usagi immediately tries to make friends, even though almost all of them resist. However, Usagi eventually makes the other Sailor Soldiers realize that they are stronger together than alone. Usagi also has a habit of forcing her interests on the people that she makes friends with. This is prominent in her relationship with Rei, where she repeatedly tries to get her to sing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Aspects and forms==\n[[File:Moon symbol decrescent.svg|thumb|150px|Sailor Moon's [[planet symbols|planetary symbol]]]]\n\nBeing a character with a long lifetime (spanning the ancient Silver Millennium era and 30th century), as well as multiple incarnations, special powers and transformations, Usagi has various aliases such as Princess Serenity, Sailor Moon, Princess Sailor Moon, Super Sailor Moon, Eternal Sailor Moon, and Neo-Queen Serenity. In all of her incarnations (barring [[disguise]]s), Usagi is always depicted with her hair up in [[Bun (hairstyle)#Double bun|twin buns]] with twin [[pigtail]]s.\n\n===Sailor Moon===\nThe series often refers to Usagi's Sailor Soldier identity, Sailor Moon, as the \"Soldier of Love and Justice\", and once as the \"Soldier of Mystery\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Vol. 7|date=1994|publisher=[[Kodansha|Kodansha Comics]]|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061787810}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} Throughout most of the series, Sailor Moon wears a white and blue ''[[sailor fuku]]'' uniform; white and reddish{{nbh}}pink gloves and boots; and crescent{{nbh}}moon earrings. She also wears red hairpieces and white [[barrette]]s resembling feathers, both of which can be used for minor attacks. Her personality is no different from when she is a civilian, though her Sailor Moon form has certain powers.\n\nThe names for Sailor Moon's attacks center around the Moon, love, mystery and light. Starting out as a frightened, reluctant girl often in need of help, she gradually accepts her full identity. She eventually becomes the most powerful Sailor Soldier in the galaxy, but her capacity for caring for others is shown to be more powerful still.\n\nSalior Moon's appearance and title change at key points when she grows stronger or gains additional powers. The first change takes place during the third major story arc \u2013 act 30 of the manga and episode 111 of the anime \u2013 when she obtains the Holy Grail and becomes ''Super Sailor Moon''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Vol. 9|date=1996|publisher=[[Kodansha|K\u014ddansha]]|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061788353}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} In this form, her costume becomes more ornate and her powers are increased. At first she is unable to take this form without the Grail, but she later gains this ability permanently. This happens when Pegasus grants both her and Sailor Chibi Moon new transformation brooches \u2013 in arc 34 of the manga and in episode 130 of the anime. However, in this \"Super\" version, her white back bow is shorter than in the Holy Grail version.\n\nSailor Moon receives her third and final form at the end of the fourth major story arc, as the combined power of the other Sailor Soldiers transforms her into ''Eternal Sailor Moon'', whom [[Diana (Sailor Moon)#Diana|Diana]] says is the closest in power to Neo-Queen Serenity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Vol. 15.|date=1996|publisher=[[Kodansha|K\u014ddansha]]|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061788353}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} Her uniform is radically altered, including the addition of two pairs of angelic wings on her back which replace her back bow.\n\nThe plot of ''Sailor Moon'' contains several examples of asynchrony, including appearances of Sailor Moon from different time periods. [[ChibiChibi]] is a young girl from the future who turns out to be a future form of Sailor Moon. She comes back to the present to aid Eternal Sailor Moon in her fight against [[Sailor Galaxia]]. Like [[Chibiusa]], she hypnotizes Usagi's family into believing that she is part of their family. In the manga, ChibiChibi transforms into \"[[Sailor Cosmos]]\" which is implied to be Sailor Moon's ultimate form. However, Sailor Cosmos admits that she is a coward that ran away from her battles and could never match Eternal Sailor Moon's final show of courage and power.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Naoko|title=Sailor Moon Stars Vol. 18|date=2001|publisher=Mixx Entertainment|location=[[Los Angeles, California]]|isbn=1892213974|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sailormoonstars00take}}</ref>\n\nIn the manga, Eternal Sailor Moon uses the Silver Moon Crystal, an evolved form of the Silver Crystal, to carry out her attacks.<ref name=\"vol 10\" />\n\n===Princess Serenity===\n[[File:PrincessSerenity.jpg|thumb|upright|Princess Serenity as seen in the manga. Unlike the anime, Serenity is almost always pictured with silver hair [in this version]]]\n\n{{nihongo|Princess Serenity|\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u30fb\u30bb\u30ec\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3|Purinsesu Sereniti}} is a past incarnation of Sailor Moon that lived in the Moon Kingdom during the age of Silver Millennium. She was the daughter of [[Queen Serenity]], who ruled Silver Millennium and watched over the Earth. Princess Serenity's guardians and closest friends were [[Sailor Mercury]], [[Sailor Mars]], [[Sailor Jupiter]], and [[Sailor Venus]], who were princesses of their own respective planets that sometimes lived on the Moon. On one of her visits to Earth, she met and fell in love with [[Prince Endymion|Endymion]], the crown prince of Earth.\n\nDuring the attack that caused the Moon Kingdom's downfall, Prince Endymion died protecting Serenity. In the manga she then commits suicide out of grief, while in the anime Queen Metallia killed them both. Serenity's mother, the Queen, was able to seal away the evil that had created the attack, but everyone involved was killed. Before her own death, the Queen used the Silver Crystal to give her daughter (and others) another chance at life, hoping that Serenity and Endymion would be able to find happiness together in their new lives. In the live-action series, it is Princess Serenity herself who destroys the Moon Kingdom when Endymion was killed during the war.\n\nSerenity reincarnates as Usagi Tsukino in the 20th century. Usagi occasionally takes the form of Princess Serenity during the series, often at climactic moments when more strength is needed than Sailor Moon can usually access. Usagi discovers her identity as a princess in act 9 of the manga, episode 34 of the anime, and act 25 of the [[Live action|live-action]] series.\n\nWhile Takeuchi draws Usagi with white, yellow, and even pink hair, Serenity almost always has white hair. In the anime, both characters are always blond. In the live-action series, Serenity has black hair and brown eyes, just like Usagi, and she wears her hair straight down rather than in pigtails. This makes her identity more ambiguous before the storyline reveals her to be Usagi.\n\nAt climactic moments, Serenity sometimes gains a pair of functioning angelic wings. She does this during the final battles of ''SuperS'', after she jumps off a tower to save Chibiusa and the two of them collide with Pegasus while falling. It also happens in ''Sailor Stars'' during the fight with the fully possessed Galaxia when she grabs the Sword of Sealing. It remains unclear if this power comes from her past life, if it belongs to Usagi herself, or if it came from Pegasus and the Sword of Sealing.\n\n====Princess Sailor Moon====\n[[File:Princesssailormoon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Princess Sailor Moon in ''[[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (live-action series)|Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon]]'']]\n\nPrincess Sailor Moon is a powerful combination of Sailor Moon and Princess Serenity that only exists in the live-action series. She is introduced when Usagi is possessed by the spirit of her former self. She originally appears after Queen Beryl takes the shitennou hostage in exchange for Mamoru. Sailor Moon transforms into Princess Sailor Moon and stops Queen Beryl using her sword.\n\nPrincess Sailor Moon is not the same person as Usagi and they have completely different personalities. Princess Sailor Moon shows no remorse for the fate of the Four Kings of Heaven and she refers to Mamoru as \"Endymion\" rather than his civilian name. She is always angry, and has no misgivings about causing death or destruction. In one act, Usagi's friend Naru accidentally gets too close to Princess Sailor Moon and has to be hospitalized as a result. It is also shown that Princess Serenity has full control of the upgrade. Though smiling in most promotional material for the series, Princess Sailor Moon does not smile in the series itself until the end, after reconciling with Usagi.\n\nDuring a confrontation with her current self as Princess Sailor Moon, Serenity tells Usagi that she would have no qualms about destroying the earth if Endymion were taken from her again. Usagi pleads with Serenity not to overuse her powers, but Serenity refuses. Afraid that she will eventually destroy the world, Usagi tires to suppress her powers. Usagi's internal conflict forces her to undergo endurance training to keep her powers and Princess Serenity persona at bay. Usagi initially succeeds but avoiding negative thoughts. However, when she is forced to kill a possessed Mamoru, Serenity overcomes Usagi's resistance and transforms into Princess Sailor Moon. Serenity even summons her own minions to fight the other Sailor Guardians to prevent them from stopping her. Princess Sailor Moon successfully destroys the world once again, but Serenity eventually realizes the extent to which she is responsible for this and uses the Silver Crystal to undo the harm she has done.\n\nPrincess Sailor Moon has a sword that can deflect enemy attacks or unleash devastating projectiles. The sword also doubles as a harp with invisible strings that Princess Sailor Moon plays while mourning her lost prince. The harp's main power is the ability to heal people and the land. Other than the healing powers, the exact effect of playing the harp is unclear, but it often causes her Silver Crystal to feed the power of Queen Metaria, accelerating the devastation of the planet.\n\nAs with other characters unique to the live-action series, Takeuchi designed Princess Sailor Moon's outfit. Her sailor outfit is considerably more elaborate than Sailor Moon's, and included pearls on her gloves and lace on her skirt.<ref>{{cite book |last= Takeuchi |first= Naoko | title= Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon shinsouban Story Collection | volume= 1 |language=Japanese|publisher= [[Kodansha]] |date= August 23, 2004 |ISBN= }}</ref>{{ISBN missing}} In fact, there is a very similar design on the back cover of ''Sailor Moon: Short Stories'' volume 1.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sailor Moon Short Stories 1|last=Takeuchi|first=Naoko|publisher=Kodansha Comics|year=2004|isbn=1612624421|location=Tokyo|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Neo-Queen Serenity===\nDuring the second major [[story arc]], it is revealed that Usagi, as Serenity, will eventually become the [[queen regnant]] of a new Silver Millennium called Crystal Tokyo, in the 30th century. She is first seen in this future form in act 16 of the manga and episode 68 of the anime. Usagi learns that she will be given the title \"Sovereign of [[Earth (planet)|Earth]]\", and Mamoru will become [[King Endymion]] alongside her. It is stated in the anime that she becomes Neo-Queen Serenity after warding off a second Ice Age, though the specifics of this are never discussed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThis incarnation is shown to be more mature than the present day Usagi, though she is still childish in some ways. For example, in episode 104, Chibiusa gives the Sailor Soldiers a letter from the future, in which the Queen asks them to train her, but the letter is simplistic and contains almost no [[kanji]]. In episode 146, Diana says that the King and Queen would sometimes play sick to get out of things. Letters she sends through the Door of Space-Time to Chibiusa are sometimes signed with a drawing of herself (and sometimes King Endymion) instead of a name.\n\nIn the manga, Neo-Queen Serenity tells the present-day Sailor Soldiers that after she became queen, she lost her power as a Sailor Soldier. In the second arc of the anime she does not transform (into Sailor Moon) even when the others do. However, she is seen showing great powers in a flashback when the King Endymion of the future describes the great feats of Neo-Queen Serenity during the time she brought about peace.\n\nShe wears an altered version of the dress she wore as a princess. The shoulder pieces are omitted and a large, wing-shaped bow replaces the smaller one of the princess outfit. In the manga, Neo-Queen Serenity's dress is similar to her past form's outfit. She also wears a crown and new earrings. The crescent moon is always visible on her forehead, just as it is with her princess form. Her face and facial expressions are drawn to look more mature than the 20th century Usagi, but her [[Bun (hairstyle)#Double bun|iconic hairstyle]] is retained.\n\nThis form is the one that Chibiusa considers as truly being her mother, while she sees the Usagi of the past as a sister figure.\n\n==Abilities==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Original research|section|date=July 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:Sailor Moon taunt.jpg|thumb|Sailor Moon's pre-battle taunt pose in ''Sailor Moon Crystal'' with her signature catchphrase: \"In the name of the Moon, I'll punish you!\"; This pose is an iconic symbol throughout various versions of the series.]]\n\nUsagi can [[metamorphosis|transform]] into a \"Sailor Soldier\" (Sailor Scout in the English adaptions of the anime) by wearing a special device (usually a brooch) and shouting a special command that activates the device. Her original transformation command is {{nihongo|\"Moon Prism Power, Make Up!\"|\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3001\u30e1\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7!|M\u016bn Purizumu Paw\u0101, Meiku Appu!}}. She gains a new basic transformation sequence for each of the five major story arcs. In the fifth arc she becomes Eternal Sailor Moon with \"Silver Moon Crystal Power\" in the manga, or \"{{nihongo|Moon Eternal Make Up!|\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3\u30a8\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb\u3001\u30e1\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7!|M\u016bn Et\u0101naru, Meiku Appu!}}\" in the anime adaptation (and once in the manga).<ref group=note>Act 42 and episode 168, respectively. This requires an unnamed object in the manga and the Holy Moon Chalice in the anime.</ref> At first, she is required to be in her Super Sailor Moon form to become Eternal Sailor Moon, as the upgrade to her brooch is temporary. When facing off with Nehelenia for the final time, the brooch is permanently upgraded allowing her to become Eternal Sailor Moon directly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nMost of the anime adaptations' transformation sequences involve the use of shiny red or pink ribbons that fly out of her brooch and form her uniform. Feathers and wings also figure prominently in some sequences, particularly the transformation into Eternal Sailor Moon.\n\nAs the protagonist and leader, Usagi has the most special powers of any character in the series. Her physical attacks, usually one-offs and not always successful, include the occasional use of her hair pins as projectile weapons.<ref name=\"vol1\"/>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Takeuchi |first=Naoko |authorlink=Naoko Takeuchi |author2=Bandai |title=Pretty Guardian Sailormoon homepage |date=July 8, 1996 |url=http://sailormoon.channel.or.jp/ |accessdate=July 4, 2007}}</ref> One of her techniques is the {{nihongo|\"Ultrasonic Wave\"|\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2|ch\u014d onpa}}, which involves using her red hair pieces to amplify her screams.<ref group=note>In the manga, this is noted as {{nihongo|''Chou Onpa''|\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2|ch\u014d onpa|super sound waves}} and is used again in episode 153, this time in tandem with Sailor Chibi Moon.</ref>\n\n===Silver Crystal===\nThe {{nihongo|''Legendary Silver Crystal''|\u300c\u5e7b\u306e\u9280\u6c34\u6676\u300d|Maboroshi no Ginzuish\u014d|lit. \"Phantom Silver Crystal\"}} is a magical crystal that only the members of the Moon dynasty can use. The first English-dubbed anime sometimes calls it the ''Imperium Silver Crystal'' as well as various other names.\n\nThe Crystal possesses tremendous power, capable of reviving an entire world from ruin. However, the strain of using such power often costs the user her life, as the power derives from the [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] of the Moon dynasty.{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}} The anime shows this happening three times. The first time is in a flashback with Queen Serenity; the second time when Usagi defeats Queen Metaria at the end of season one; and finally in the ''R'' movie. It is shown as the source of Queen Serenity's power during the age of Silver Millennium, with Usagi Tsukino and Chibiusa each going on to inherit the Crystal in some form. However, it is also shown in the ''S'' movie that the power of all the Senshi working in unison allows Sailor Moon to use the Crystal's full strength without the result being fatal (although she was still exhausted afterwards from using it).\n\nBoth the anime, manga and second anime series commonly portray the Silver Crystal as possibly the single most powerful artifact in the universe, able to focus the energy of its wielder to perform magnificent feats. However, several artifacts rival it in strength, including the Black Crystal of the [[Death Phantom]], and the Saffer Crystal of [[Sailor Galaxia]]. In the fifth series of the anime, the crystal also appears to double as the Star Seed of Sailor Moon, which was hinted at in the ''R'' movie, and the manga implies that it is her Sailor Crystal. It takes on a multitude of shapes, including round, diamond, rose, heart, star, and [[lotus (plant)|lotus]], and it turns pink while stored within the brooches of Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi Moon.\n\nBecause Chibiusa comes from the future \u2013 having eventually inherited the Silver Crystal from Usagi \u2013 two versions of it exist in the series. After the first and second story arcs, the owners of the crystals keep them in their respective transformation brooches and only remove them in times of urgent need.\n\nThe original anime features seven [[rainbow]] crystals that had the Seven Great Monsters (the most powerful monsters in the [[Dark Kingdom]]) sealed into them. They were sealed within seven separate shards of the Silver Crystal using Queen Serenity's power. They were then carried to Earth where they were reincarnated centuries later, with no memories of their prior existences. All seven rainbow crystals (and, as in the manga, one of Usagi's tears) are needed to recombine to form the Silver Crystal.\n\n==Conception and creation==\nUsagi and ''Sailor Moon'' series evolved from Naoko Takeuchi's earlier one-shot series called ''Codename: Sailor V''. In Takeuchi's first proposal for the ''Sailor Moon'' series, each of the five heroines had a completely unique outfit.

She teases Ami when Ami continues calling her \"Tsukino-san\" (a formal way of speaking to classmates), saying that it is as if they are not friends.<ref>''Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon'', Act 5.</ref> Every time a new Sailor Soldier appears, Usagi immediately tries to make friends, even though almost all of them resist. However, Usagi eventually makes the other Sailor Soldiers realize that they are stronger together than alone. Usagi also has a habit of forcing her interests on the people that she makes friends with. This is prominent in her relationship with Rei, where she repeatedly tries to get her to sing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Aspects and forms==\n[[File:Moon symbol decrescent.svg|thumb|150px|Sailor Moon's [[planet symbols|planetary symbol]]]]\n\nBeing a character with a long lifetime (spanning the ancient Silver Millennium era and 30th century), as well as multiple incarnations, special powers and transformations, Usagi has various aliases such as Princess Serenity, Sailor Moon, Princess Sailor Moon, Super Sailor Moon, Eternal Sailor Moon, and Neo-Queen Serenity. In all of her incarnations (barring [[disguise]]s), Usagi is always depicted with her hair up in [[Bun (hairstyle)#Double bun|twin buns]] with twin [[pigtail]]s.\n\n===Sailor Moon===\nThe series often refers to Usagi's Sailor Soldier identity, Sailor Moon, as the \"Soldier of Love and Justice\", and once as the \"Soldier of Mystery\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Vol. 7|date=1994|publisher=[[Kodansha|Kodansha Comics]]|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061787810}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} Throughout most of the series, Sailor Moon wears a white and blue ''[[sailor fuku]]'' uniform; white and reddish{{nbh}}pink gloves and boots; and crescent{{nbh}}moon earrings. She also wears red hairpieces and white [[barrette]]s resembling feathers, both of which can be used for minor attacks. Her personality is no different from when she is a civilian, though her Sailor Moon form has certain powers.\n\nThe names for Sailor Moon's attacks center around the Moon, love, mystery and light. Starting out as a frightened, reluctant girl often in need of help, she gradually accepts her full identity. She eventually becomes the most powerful Sailor Soldier in the galaxy, but her capacity for caring for others is shown to be more powerful still.\n\nSalior Moon's appearance and title change at key points when she grows stronger or gains additional powers. The first change takes place during the third major story arc \u2013 act 30 of the manga and episode 111 of the anime \u2013 when she obtains the Holy Grail and becomes ''Super Sailor Moon''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Vol. 9|date=1996|publisher=[[Kodansha|K\u014ddansha]]|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061788353}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} In this form, her costume becomes more ornate and her powers are increased. At first she is unable to take this form without the Grail, but she later gains this ability permanently. This happens when Pegasus grants both her and Sailor Chibi Moon new transformation brooches \u2013 in arc 34 of the manga and in episode 130 of the anime. However, in this \"Super\" version, her white back bow is shorter than in the Holy Grail version.\n\nSailor Moon receives her third and final form at the end of the fourth major story arc, as the combined power of the other Sailor Soldiers transforms her into ''Eternal Sailor Moon'', whom [[Diana (Sailor Moon)#Diana|Diana]] says is the closest in power to Neo-Queen Serenity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Vol. 15.|date=1996|publisher=[[Kodansha|K\u014ddansha]]|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061788353}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} Her uniform is radically altered, including the addition of two pairs of angelic wings on her back which replace her back bow.\n\nThe plot of ''Sailor Moon'' contains several examples of asynchrony, including appearances of Sailor Moon from different time periods. [[ChibiChibi]] is a young girl from the future who turns out to be a future form of Sailor Moon. She comes back to the present to aid Eternal Sailor Moon in her fight against [[Sailor Galaxia]]. Like [[Chibiusa]], she hypnotizes Usagi's family into believing that she is part of their family. In the manga, ChibiChibi transforms into \"[[Sailor Cosmos]]\" which is implied to be Sailor Moon's ultimate form. However, Sailor Cosmos admits that she is a coward that ran away from her battles and could never match Eternal Sailor Moon's final show of courage and power.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Naoko|title=Sailor Moon Stars Vol. 18|date=2001|publisher=Mixx Entertainment|location=[[Los Angeles, California]]|isbn=1892213974|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sailormoonstars00take}}</ref>\n\nIn the manga, Eternal Sailor Moon uses the Silver Moon Crystal, an evolved form of the Silver Crystal, to carry out her attacks.<ref name=\"vol 10\" />\n\n===Princess Serenity===\n[[File:PrincessSerenity.jpg|thumb|upright|Princess Serenity as seen in the manga. Unlike the anime, Serenity is almost always pictured with silver hair [in this version]]]\n\n{{nihongo|Princess Serenity|\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u30fb\u30bb\u30ec\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3|Purinsesu Sereniti}} is a past incarnation of Sailor Moon that lived in the Moon Kingdom during the age of Silver Millennium. She was the daughter of [[Queen Serenity]], who ruled Silver Millennium and watched over the Earth. Princess Serenity's guardians and closest friends were [[Sailor Mercury]], [[Sailor Mars]], [[Sailor Jupiter]], and [[Sailor Venus]], who were princesses of their own respective planets that sometimes lived on the Moon. On one of her visits to Earth, she met and fell in love with [[Prince Endymion|Endymion]], the crown prince of Earth.\n\nDuring the attack that caused the Moon Kingdom's downfall, Prince Endymion died protecting Serenity. In the manga she then commits suicide out of grief, while in the anime Queen Metallia killed them both. Serenity's mother, the Queen, was able to seal away the evil that had created the attack, but everyone involved was killed. Before her own death, the Queen used the Silver Crystal to give her daughter (and others) another chance at life, hoping that Serenity and Endymion would be able to find happiness together in their new lives. In the live-action series, it is Princess Serenity herself who destroys the Moon Kingdom when Endymion was killed during the war.\n\nSerenity reincarnates as Usagi Tsukino in the 20th century. Usagi occasionally takes the form of Princess Serenity during the series, often at climactic moments when more strength is needed than Sailor Moon can usually access. Usagi discovers her identity as a princess in act 9 of the manga, episode 34 of the anime, and act 25 of the [[Live action|live-action]] series.\n\nWhile Takeuchi draws Usagi with white, yellow, and even pink hair, Serenity almost always has white hair. In the anime, both characters are always blond. In the live-action series, Serenity has black hair and brown eyes, just like Usagi, and she wears her hair straight down rather than in pigtails. This makes her identity more ambiguous before the storyline reveals her to be Usagi.\n\nAt climactic moments, Serenity sometimes gains a pair of functioning angelic wings. She does this during the final battles of ''SuperS'', after she jumps off a tower to save Chibiusa and the two of them collide with Pegasus while falling. It also happens in ''Sailor Stars'' during the fight with the fully possessed Galaxia when she grabs the Sword of Sealing. It remains unclear if this power comes from her past life, if it belongs to Usagi herself, or if it came from Pegasus and the Sword of Sealing.\n\n====Princess Sailor Moon====\n[[File:Princesssailormoon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Princess Sailor Moon in ''[[Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (live-action series)|Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon]]'']]\n\nPrincess Sailor Moon is a powerful combination of Sailor Moon and Princess Serenity that only exists in the live-action series. She is introduced when Usagi is possessed by the spirit of her former self. She originally appears after Queen Beryl takes the shitennou hostage in exchange for Mamoru. Sailor Moon transforms into Princess Sailor Moon and stops Queen Beryl using her sword.\n\nPrincess Sailor Moon is not the same person as Usagi and they have completely different personalities. Princess Sailor Moon shows no remorse for the fate of the Four Kings of Heaven and she refers to Mamoru as \"Endymion\" rather than his civilian name. She is always angry, and has no misgivings about causing death or destruction. In one act, Usagi's friend Naru accidentally gets too close to Princess Sailor Moon and has to be hospitalized as a result. It is also shown that Princess Serenity has full control of the upgrade. Though smiling in most promotional material for the series, Princess Sailor Moon does not smile in the series itself until the end, after reconciling with Usagi.\n\nDuring a confrontation with her current self as Princess Sailor Moon, Serenity tells Usagi that she would have no qualms about destroying the earth if Endymion were taken from her again. Usagi pleads with Serenity not to overuse her powers, but Serenity refuses. Afraid that she will eventually destroy the world, Usagi tires to suppress her powers. Usagi's internal conflict forces her to undergo endurance training to keep her powers and Princess Serenity persona at bay. Usagi initially succeeds but avoiding negative thoughts. However, when she is forced to kill a possessed Mamoru, Serenity overcomes Usagi's resistance and transforms into Princess Sailor Moon. Serenity even summons her own minions to fight the other Sailor Guardians to prevent them from stopping her. Princess Sailor Moon successfully destroys the world once again, but Serenity eventually realizes the extent to which she is responsible for this and uses the Silver Crystal to undo the harm she has done.\n\nPrincess Sailor Moon has a sword that can deflect enemy attacks or unleash devastating projectiles. The sword also doubles as a harp with invisible strings that Princess Sailor Moon plays while mourning her lost prince. The harp's main power is the ability to heal people and the land. Other than the healing powers, the exact effect of playing the harp is unclear, but it often causes her Silver Crystal to feed the power of Queen Metaria, accelerating the devastation of the planet.\n\nAs with other characters unique to the live-action series, Takeuchi designed Princess Sailor Moon's outfit. Her sailor outfit is considerably more elaborate than Sailor Moon's, and included pearls on her gloves and lace on her skirt.<ref>{{cite book |last= Takeuchi |first= Naoko | title= Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon shinsouban Story Collection | volume= 1 |language=Japanese|publisher= [[Kodansha]] |date= August 23, 2004 |ISBN= }}</ref>{{ISBN missing}} In fact, there is a very similar design on the back cover of ''Sailor Moon: Short Stories'' volume 1.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sailor Moon Short Stories 1|last=Takeuchi|first=Naoko|publisher=Kodansha Comics|year=2004|isbn=1612624421|location=Tokyo|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Neo-Queen Serenity===\nDuring the second major [[story arc]], it is revealed that Usagi, as Serenity, will eventually become the [[queen regnant]] of a new Silver Millennium called Crystal Tokyo, in the 30th century. She is first seen in this future form in act 16 of the manga and episode 68 of the anime. Usagi learns that she will be given the title \"Sovereign of [[Earth (planet)|Earth]]\", and Mamoru will become [[King Endymion]] alongside her. It is stated in the anime that she becomes Neo-Queen Serenity after warding off a second Ice Age, though the specifics of this are never discussed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThis incarnation is shown to be more mature than the present day Usagi, though she is still childish in some ways. For example, in episode 104, Chibiusa gives the Sailor Soldiers a letter from the future, in which the Queen asks them to train her, but the letter is simplistic and contains almost no [[kanji]]. In episode 146, Diana says that the King and Queen would sometimes play sick to get out of things. Letters she sends though the Door of Space-Time to Chibiusa are sometimes signed with a drawing of herself (and sometimes King Endymion) instead of a name.\n\nIn the manga, Neo-Queen Serenity tells the present-day Sailor Soldiers that after she became queen, she lost her power as a Sailor Soldier. In the second arc of the anime she does not transform (into Sailor Moon) even when the others do. However, she is seen showing great powers in a flashback when the King Endymion of the future describes the great feats of Neo-Queen Serenity during the time she brought about peace.\n\nShe wears an altered version of the dress she wore as a princess. The shoulder pieces are omitted and a large, wing-shaped bow replaces the smaller one of the princess outfit. In the manga, Neo-Queen Serenity's dress is similar to her past form's outfit. She also wears a crown and new earrings. The crescent moon is always visible on her forehead, just as it is with her princess form. Her face and facial expressions are drawn to look more mature than the 20th century Usagi, but her [[Bun (hairstyle)#Double bun|iconic hairstyle]] is retained.\n\nThis form is the one that Chibiusa considers as truly being her mother, while she sees the Usagi of the past as a sister figure.\n\n==Abilities==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Original research|section|date=July 2017}}\n}}\n[[File:Sailor Moon taunt.jpg|thumb|Sailor Moon's pre-battle taunt pose in ''Sailor Moon Crystal'' with her signature catchphrase: \"In the name of the Moon, I'll punish you!\"; This pose is an iconic symbol throughout various versions of the series.]]\n\nUsagi can [[metamorphosis|transform]] into a \"Sailor Soldier\" (Sailor Scout in the English adaptions of the anime) by wearing a special device (usually a brooch) and shouting a special command that activates the device. Her original transformation command is {{nihongo|\"Moon Prism Power, Make Up!\"|\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30ba\u30e0\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u3001\u30e1\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7!|M\u016bn Purizumu Paw\u0101, Meiku Appu!}}. She gains a new basic transformation sequence for each of the five major story arcs. In the fifth arc she becomes Eternal Sailor Moon with \"Silver Moon Crystal Power\" in the manga, or \"{{nihongo|Moon Eternal Make Up!|\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3\u30a8\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb\u3001\u30e1\u30a4\u30af\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7!|M\u016bn Et\u0101naru, Meiku Appu!}}\" in the anime adaptation (and once in the manga).<ref group=note>Act 42 and episode 168, respectively. This requires an unnamed object in the manga and the Holy Moon Chalice in the anime.</ref> At first, she is required to be in her Super Sailor Moon form to become Eternal Sailor Moon, as the upgrade to her brooch is temporary. When facing off with Nehelenia for the final time, the brooch is permanently upgraded allowing her to become Eternal Sailor Moon directly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nMost of the anime adaptations' transformation sequences involve the use of shiny red or pink ribbons that fly out of her brooch and form her uniform. Feathers and wings also figure prominently in some sequences, particularly the transformation into Eternal Sailor Moon.\n\nAs the protagonist and leader, Usagi has the most special powers of any character in the series. Her physical attacks, usually one-offs and not always successful, include the occasional use of her hair pins as projectile weapons.<ref name=\"vol1\"/>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Takeuchi |first=Naoko |authorlink=Naoko Takeuchi |author2=Bandai |title=Pretty Guardian Sailormoon homepage |date=July 8, 1996 |url=http://sailormoon.channel.or.jp/ |accessdate=July 4, 2007}}</ref> One of her techniques is the {{nihongo|\"Ultrasonic Wave\"|\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2|ch\u014d onpa}}, which involves using her red hair pieces to amplify her screams.<ref group=note>In the manga, this is noted as {{nihongo|''Chou Onpa''|\u8d85\u97f3\u6ce2|ch\u014d onpa|super sound waves}} and is used again in episode 153, this time in tandem with Sailor Chibi Moon.</ref>\n\n===Silver Crystal===\nThe {{nihongo|''Legendary Silver Crystal''|\u300c\u5e7b\u306e\u9280\u6c34\u6676\u300d|Maboroshi no Ginzuish\u014d|lit. \"Phantom Silver Crystal\"}} is a magical crystal that only the members of the Moon dynasty can use. The first English-dubbed anime sometimes calls it the ''Imperium Silver Crystal'' as well as various other names.\n\nThe Crystal possesses tremendous power, capable of reviving an entire world from ruin. However, the strain of using such power often costs the user her life, as the power derives from the [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]] of the Moon dynasty.{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}} The anime shows this happening three times. The first time is in a flashback with Queen Serenity; the second time when Usagi defeats Queen Metaria at the end of season one; and finally in the ''R'' movie. It is shown as the source of Queen Serenity's power during the age of Silver Millennium, with Usagi Tsukino and Chibiusa each going on to inherit the Crystal in some form. However, it is also shown in the ''S'' movie that the power of all the Senshi working in unison allows Sailor Moon to use the Crystal's full strength without the result being fatal (although she was still exhausted afterwards from using it).\n\nBoth the anime, manga and second anime series commonly portray the Silver Crystal as possibly the single most powerful artifact in the universe, able to focus the energy of its wielder to perform magnificent feats. However, several artifacts rival it in strength, including the Black Crystal of the [[Death Phantom]], and the Saffer Crystal of [[Sailor Galaxia]]. In the fifth series of the anime, the crystal also appears to double as the Star Seed of Sailor Moon, which was hinted at in the ''R'' movie, and the manga implies that it is her Sailor Crystal. It takes on a multitude of shapes, including round, diamond, rose, heart, star, and [[lotus (plant)|lotus]], and it turns pink while stored within the brooches of Sailor Moon and Sailor Chibi Moon.\n\nBecause Chibiusa comes from the future \u2013 having eventually inherited the Silver Crystal from Usagi \u2013 two versions of it exist in the series. After the first and second story arcs, the owners of the crystals keep them in their respective transformation brooches and only remove them in times of urgent need.\n\nThe original anime features seven [[rainbow]] crystals that had the Seven Great Monsters (the most powerful monsters in the [[Dark Kingdom]]) sealed into them. They were sealed within seven separate shards of the Silver Crystal using Queen Serenity's power. They were then carried to Earth where they were reincarnated centuries later, with no memories of their prior existences. All seven rainbow crystals (and, as in the manga, one of Usagi's tears) are needed to recombine to form the Silver Crystal.\n\n==Conception and creation==\nUsagi and ''Sailor Moon'' series evolved from Naoko Takeuchi's earlier one-shot series called ''Codename: Sailor V''. In Takeuchi's first proposal for the ''Sailor Moon'' series, each of the five heroines had a completely unique outfit. It was eventually decided that they would instead wear uniforms based on a single theme, whose design was closest to Sailor Moon's original costume concept. Sailor Moon's original had some small differences, including color changes, an exposed midriff, and ribbons around the gloves and boots. She also had a mask, which did appear in a few chapters of the manga before being discarded.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naoko|first1=Takeuchi|title=Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Vol. 2|date=1992|publisher=[[Kodansha|K\u014ddansha]]|location=Tokyo|isbn=4061787314}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} These aspects of Sailor Moon's costume are shown in multiple pieces of early artwork, along with a gun and cloak, which were also parts of the original concept.<ref name=\"devel\">{{cite web |last=Takeuchi |first=Naoko |authorlink=Naoko Takeuchi |title=Manga Style - Early Designs |url=http://mangastyle.net/manga_prototypes.htm |access-date=February 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206201528/http://mangastyle.net/manga_prototypes.htm |archive-date=February 6, 2007 |df=mdy-all}} (translated by Michelle Bacon of Manga Style)</ref>\n\nTakeuchi based Usagi's signature hairstyle on a \"good luck charm\" she had during her studies as a university student.

In Mid 2018 the Commander and Second in Command of the Coast Guard was appointed, with the first Coast Guard Ship commissioned in late 2019, and Operational in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2016/12/07/uk-coastguard-reviewing-caymans-search-and-rescue-capabilities/|title=UK Coastguard reviewing Cayman\u2019s search and rescue capabilities &#124; Cayman Compass|website=www.caymancompass.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caymancompass.com/2018/08/28/caymans-coast-guard-chiefs-announced/|title=Cayman\u2019s Coast Guard chiefs announced &#124; Cayman Compass|website=www.caymancompass.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caymannewsservice.com/2019/11/coastguard-to-manage-stingray-city/|title=Coastguard to manage Stingray City - Cayman Islands Headline News|date=November 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard Commander and Second in Command took part in a joint operation with the United State Coast Guard and the Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard known as Operation Riptide making it the first Operation for the Cayman Islands Coast Guard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.ky/portal/page/portal/cighome/pressroom/archive/201907/CICG+Deployed+in+International+Joint+Operation|title=Error|website=www.gov.ky}}</ref>\n\nFor several years talks in Cayman had taken place about developing an Auxiliary Force to assist Cayman in major crisis or times of disasters like hurricanes. These talks had increased and now included the United Kingdom since 2016 and onwards as from 2016-2019 the Atlantic Hurricane Seasons had proved to be quite disastrous for the region.

Girs\u2019s ancestors were of Swedish origin. His most notable relative was his cousin [[Nicholas de Giers|Nikolai Karlovich Girs]], [[Foreign Minister of Russia|foreign minister]] in 1882-1894. In 1843, his family moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], where he studied in a military school, graduated from the engineer college, and then served as a field engineer.

Although the novel aroused great expectations, it was never finished. Other works by Girs are ''Na krayu propasti'' (On the edge of the abyss) in ''Delo'' (The deed), 1870; ''Kaliforniiskiy rudnik'' (The California mine)  in ''Otechestvennye zapiski'', 1872; ''Dnevnik notarialnogo pistsa'' (The diary of a notary scribe), ''Ibid''., 1883; ''Avdotya-dvumuzhnitsa'' (Avdotya the bigamist) in ''Russkaya mysl''' (Russian Thought), 1884.\n\nIn 1876 Girs worked in [[Serbia]] as a military reporter for ''[[Sankt-Peterburgskiye Vedomosti]]'' (The St. Petersburg Gazette) and in 1877 for ''Severnyi vestnik'' (The Northern Bulletin). In 1878-1880 Girs published his own newspaper, called ''Russkaya pravda'' (Russian Truth), in which he wrote [[feuilleton]]s under the pen-name Dobro-Glagol.
