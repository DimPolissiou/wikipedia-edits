The film takes place in the future in [[Scotland]], which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in [[London]], political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair ([[Rhona Mitra]]) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. ''Doomsday'' was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including ''[[Mad Max]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]''.\n\nMarshall had a budget three times the size of his previous two films, ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'', and the director filmed the larger-scale ''Doomsday'' in Scotland and [[South Africa]]. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 14 March 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008. ''Doomsday'' did not perform well at the box office, and critics gave the film mixed reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2008, an unknown killer virus, known as the \"Reaper Virus\", has infected the country of [[Scotland]]. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of [[Great Britain]]. Whilst the quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. Now a [[pariah state]], the UK collapses into a [[dystopia]], rife with unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil.\n\n27 years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper Virus during a routine investigation. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] John Hatcher shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair, to lead the team. Sinclair is originally from Scotland, having escaped as the quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.\n\nSinclair's team crosses the wall to [[Glasgow]], Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals, led by the power-hungry Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army [[Invasion|to start their invasion of England]], which will bring Great Britain into the [[Golden Age]]. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of the gang, who burn Dr. Talbot alive before devouring his body. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's second-in-command. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol abolishes [[martial law]] by creating his own army.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reaper Virus turns everyone present in London into primal savages, destroying everything in sight in an ongoing riot. Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection when an infected man breaks into Hatcher\u2019s office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the infected man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Hatcher is quarantined by his right hand man, Michael Canaris,  who also takes his place as ''de facto'' prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide, unable to take much more of his successor's scam.\n\nAfter leaving the train, Sinclair's group are arrested by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the rest of the group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.\n\nSinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact [[Bentley Continental GT|2007 Bentley Continental GT]], which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper once and for all. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.\n\nUsing a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris then tricks Sinclair into trading Cally (whose blood can be used to create a vaccine to treat the virus), revealing his scheme to use the virus all over the UK as both a form of population control and for profit.\n\nCally and Stirling board the gunship with Canaris while Sinclair returns to her old house in search of her mother, followed by Nelson, who flew into the quarantine zone to speak with his top-ranking officer. While Sinclair confirms that her mother has perished due to the virus, she is able to retrieve a picture of her. Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of Canaris's [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] scheme. The recording is later broadcasted to the rest of the country, much to Canaris's shock as it spells doom to his career. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang; she throws the head onto the ground, announcing to the marauders, \u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, try a piece of your friend\u201d. The marauders stand in shock for a moment before bursting into cheering, accepting Sinclair as their new leader.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Rhona Mitra (Straighten Colors).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A seated woman with brown hair extending below her shoulders and wearing a blue shirt smiles as she looks to her right.|Actress Rhona Mitra starred in ''Doomsday'' as Major Eden Sinclair.]]\n\n* [[Rhona Mitra]] as Major Eden Sinclair of the Department of Domestic Security, selected to lead a team to find a cure.<ref name=mitra/> The heroine was inspired by the character [[Snake Plissken]].<ref name=hot>{{cite news | first=Justine | last=Elias | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/30/2007-09-30_hot_heroines_in_apocalyptic_flicks-1.html | title=Hot heroines in apocalyptic flicks | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | date=30 September 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007}}</ref> Mitra worked out and fight trained for eleven weeks for the film.

[[MyAnna Buring]] portrayed Kane's daughter Cally.<ref name=credits>Listed in the film's credits.</ref> [[Emma Cleasby]] played Eden's mother at the start of the film.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\nDirector [[Neil Marshall]] lived near the ruins of [[Hadrian's Wall]], a Roman fortification built to defend England against Scotland's tribes. The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: \"I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets\u2014clearly from the future\u2014facing a medieval knight on horseback.\" The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.<ref name=cfq>{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Biodrowski| url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday| title=Interview: Neil Marshall Directs \"Doomsday\"| publisher=Cinefantastique.com|accessdate=15 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe lethal virus in ''Doomsday'' differs from contemporary films like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' by being an authentic plague that actually devastates the population, instead of infecting people so they become aggressive cannibals or zombies. Marshall intended the virus as the backdrop to the story, having survivors scavenge for themselves and set up a primitive society. The director drew from tribal history around the world to design the society. Though the survivors are depicted as brutal, Marshall sought to have \"shades of gray\" by characterising some people in England as selfishly manipulative.<ref name=cfq/>\n\nThe director intended ''Doomsday'' as a tribute to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, \"Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. I wanted to make a movie for a new generation of audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema\u2014hadn't seen them at all maybe\u2014and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them.

While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved [[Matte painting|matte paint]] and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in ''Doomsday'' was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news | first=Thomas J. | last=McLean | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3578 | title=''Doomsday'': A VFX Cure for the Reaper Virus | publisher=VFXWorld.com | date=14 March 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNeil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects. A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions. A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics. Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the \"rabbit explosion\" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors. The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasise its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\n=== Music ===\nMarshall originally intended to include 1980s [[synthesizer|synth]] music in his film, but he found it difficult to combine the music with the intense action. Instead, composer [[Tyler Bates]] composed a score using heavy orchestra music.<ref name=sayer/> The film also included songs from the bands [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Fine Young Cannibals]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], and [[Kasabian]].<ref name=credits/> The song \"[[Two Tribes]]\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was the only song to remain in the film from the first draft of the screenplay. \"[[Spellbound (Siouxsie and the Banshees song)|Spellbound]]\" by Siouxsie and the Banshees was a favourite song of the director, who sought to include it. Marshall also hoped to include the song \"Into the Light\" by the Banshees, but it was left out due to the producer disliking it and the cost being too high to licence it.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tim| last=Masters| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7390688.stm| title= Talking Shop: Neil Marshall| publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=9 May 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nFor its theatrical run, the film was originally intended to be distributed by [[Focus Features]] under [[Rogue Pictures]], but the company transferred ''Doomsday'' among other films to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] for larger-scale distribution and marketing beginning in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dade | last=Hayes | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974078.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Rogue marketing moves to Universal | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=15 October 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007 }}</ref> ''Doomsday'' was commercially released on 14 March 2008 in the United States and Canada in 1,936 theatres, grossing US$4,926,565 in its opening weekend and ranking seventh in the box office,<ref name=bom>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> which ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' reported as a \"failed\" opening.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brandon | last=Gray | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2465&p=.htm | title='Horton' Hits It Big | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | date=17 March 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> Its theatrical run in the United States and Canada lasted 28 days, ending on 10 April 2008, having grossed US$11,008,770.<ref name=bom/> The film opened in the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[Malta]] on 9 May 2008, grossing a total of US$2,027,749 in its entire run.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) - International Box Office Results | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=13 October 2008 }}</ref> The film's performance in the UK was considered a \"disappointing run\".<ref name=tanks>{{cite news | first=Orlando | last=Parfitt | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/speed_racer/news/1728059/uk_box_office_breakdown_speed_racer_tanks | title=UK Box Office Breakdown: Speed Racer Tanks | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=14 May 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> The film premiered in Italy in August 2008, grossing an overall US$500,000.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Frank |last=Segers |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |title='Knight' tops overseas with $19 mil |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082644/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |archivedate=13 September 2008 }}</ref> Worldwide, ''Doomsday'' has grossed US$22,211,426.<ref name=bom/>\n\n{{Anchor|Reception|Critical reception|Critics}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"The director of top horror flicks ''The Descent'' and ''Dog Soldiers'' was given more money for his latest effort, but many thought he wasted it on a collection of flashy set pieces without much interlinking plot in between.\"\n | source = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] on UK's general consensus<ref name=tanks/>\n | width = 300px\n | align = right\n}}\n''Doomsday'' was not screened for critics in advance of its commercial opening in cinemas.<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Ratliff | title=Latest virus film put in quarantine | work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] | date=14 March 2008 }}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics.

The film takes place in the future in [[Scotland]], which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the virus is found in [[London]], political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair ([[Rhona Mitra]]) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. ''Doomsday'' was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including ''[[Mad Max]]'', ''[[Escape from New York]]'' and ''[[28 Days Later]]''.\n\nMarshall had a budget three times the size of his previous two films, ''[[The Descent]]'' and ''[[Dog Soldiers (film)|Dog Soldiers]]'', and the director filmed the larger-scale ''Doomsday'' in Scotland and [[South Africa]]. The film was released in the United States and Canada on 14 March 2008 and in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2008. ''Doomsday'' did not perform well at the box office, and critics gave the film mixed reviews.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2008, an unknown killer virus, known as the \"Reaper Virus\", has infected the country of [[Scotland]]. Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of [[Great Britain]]. Whilst the quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world. Now a [[pariah state]], the UK collapses into a [[dystopia]], rife with unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil.\n\n27 years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper Virus during a routine investigation. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] John Hatcher shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane, who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair, to lead the team. Sinclair is originally from Scotland, having escaped as the quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.\n\nSinclair's team crosses the wall to [[Glasgow]], Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals, led by the power-hungry Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army [[Invasion|to start their invasion of England]], which will bring Great Britain into the [[Golden Age]]. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of the gang, who burn Dr. Talbot alive before devouring his body. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's second-in-command. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol abolishes [[martial law]] by creating his own army.\n\nMeanwhile, the Reaper Virus turns everyone present into primal savages, destroying everything in sight in an ongoing riot. Hatcher plans secretly to isolate the central London area because of the infection when an infected man breaks into Hatcher\u2019s office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the infected man, but his blood splatters on Hatcher. Hatcher is quarantined by his right hand man, Michael Canaris,  who also takes his place as ''de facto'' prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide, unable to take much more of his successor's scam.\n\nAfter leaving the train, Sinclair's group are arrested by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure, only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic leader. He sentences Sinclair and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon. During the duel, the rest of the group escapes, retrieves their equipment and rescue Sinclair.\n\nSinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact [[Bentley Continental GT|2007 Bentley Continental GT]], which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper once and for all. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.\n\nUsing a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris then tricks Sinclair into trading Cally (whose blood can be used to create a vaccine to treat the virus), revealing his scheme to use the virus all over the UK as both a form of population control and for profit.\n\nCally and Stirling board the gunship with Canaris while Sinclair returns to her old house in search of her mother, followed by Nelson, who flew into the quarantine zone to speak with his top-ranking officer. While Sinclair confirms that her mother has perished due to the virus, she is able to retrieve a picture of her. Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of Canaris's [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] scheme. The recording is later broadcasted to the rest of the country, much to Canaris's shock as it spells doom to his career. Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns to his gang; she throws the head onto the ground, announcing to the marauders, \u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, try a piece of your friend\u201d.

The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: \"I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets\u2014clearly from the future\u2014facing a medieval knight on horseback.\" The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.<ref name=cfq>{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Biodrowski| url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/03/07/interview-neil-marshall-directs-doomsday| title=Interview: Neil Marshall Directs \"Doomsday\"| publisher=Cinefantastique.com|accessdate=15 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe lethal virus in ''Doomsday'' differs from contemporary films like ''[[28 Days Later]]'' and ''[[28 Weeks Later]]'' by being an authentic plague that actually devastates the population, instead of infecting people so they become aggressive cannibals or zombies. Marshall intended the virus as the backdrop to the story, having survivors scavenge for themselves and set up a primitive society. The director drew from tribal history around the world to design the society. Though the survivors are depicted as brutal, Marshall sought to have \"shades of gray\" by characterising some people in England as selfishly manipulative.<ref name=cfq/>\n\nThe director intended ''Doomsday'' as a tribute to post-apocalyptic films from the 1970s and 1980s, explaining, \"Right from the start, I wanted my film to be an homage to these sorts of movies, and deliberately so. I wanted to make a movie for a new generation of audience that hadn't seen those movies in the cinema\u2014hadn't seen them at all maybe\u2014and to give them the same thrill that I got from watching them.

While filmmakers did not seek innovative visual effects, they worked with budget restrictions by creating set extensions. With most shots taking place in daylight, the extensions involved [[Matte painting|matte paint]] and 2D and 3D solutions. The visual effects crew visited Scotland to take reference photos so scenes that were filmed in Cape Town, South Africa could instead have Scottish backgrounds. Several challenges for the visual effects crew included the illustration of cow overpopulation in line with a decimated human population and the convincing creation of the rebuilt Hadrian Wall in different lights and from different distances. The most challenging visual effects shot in ''Doomsday'' was the close-up in which a main character is burned alive. The shot required multiple enhancements and implementations of burning wardrobe, burning pigskin, and smoke and fire elements to look authentic.<ref name=vfxworld>{{cite news | first=Thomas J. | last=McLean | url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&format=rss&id=3578 | title=''Doomsday'': A VFX Cure for the Reaper Virus | publisher=VFXWorld.com | date=14 March 2008 | accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNeil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects. A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions. A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics. Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the \"rabbit explosion\" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors. The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasise its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.<ref name=vfxworld/>\n\n=== Music ===\nMarshall originally intended to include 1980s [[synthesizer|synth]] music in his film, but he found it difficult to combine the music with the intense action.

Marshall also hoped to include the song \"Into the Light\" by the Banshees, but it was left out due to the producer disliking it and the cost being too high to licence it.<ref>{{cite news | first=Tim| last=Masters| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7390688.stm| title= Talking Shop: Neil Marshall| publisher=[[BBC News]]| date=9 May 2008| accessdate=20 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nFor its theatrical run, the film was originally intended to be distributed by [[Focus Features]] under [[Rogue Pictures]], but the company transferred ''Doomsday'' among other films to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] for larger-scale distribution and marketing beginning in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dade | last=Hayes | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974078.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 | title=Rogue marketing moves to Universal | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=15 October 2007 | accessdate=24 December 2007 }}</ref> ''Doomsday'' was commercially released on 14 March 2008 in the United States and Canada in 1,936 theatres, grossing US$4,926,565 in its opening weekend and ranking seventh in the box office,<ref name=bom>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> which ''[[Box Office Mojo]]'' reported as a \"failed\" opening.<ref>{{cite news | first=Brandon | last=Gray | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2465&p=.htm | title='Horton' Hits It Big | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | date=17 March 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> Its theatrical run in the United States and Canada lasted 28 days, ending on 10 April 2008, having grossed US$11,008,770.<ref name=bom/> The film opened in the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland]], and [[Malta]] on 9 May 2008, grossing a total of US$2,027,749 in its entire run.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id=doomsday.htm | title=Doomsday (2008) - International Box Office Results | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC | accessdate=13 October 2008 }}</ref> The film's performance in the UK was considered a \"disappointing run\".<ref name=tanks>{{cite news | first=Orlando | last=Parfitt | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/speed_racer/news/1728059/uk_box_office_breakdown_speed_racer_tanks | title=UK Box Office Breakdown: Speed Racer Tanks | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=14 May 2008 | accessdate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> The film premiered in Italy in August 2008, grossing an overall US$500,000.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Frank |last=Segers |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |title='Knight' tops overseas with $19 mil |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Company]] |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=13 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082644/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i70662f7dd9d6f3c434b1463dc499d597 |archivedate=13 September 2008 }}</ref> Worldwide, ''Doomsday'' has grossed US$22,211,426.<ref name=bom/>\n\n{{Anchor|Reception|Critical reception|Critics}}\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"The director of top horror flicks ''The Descent'' and ''Dog Soldiers'' was given more money for his latest effort, but many thought he wasted it on a collection of flashy set pieces without much interlinking plot in between.\"\n | source = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] on UK's general consensus<ref name=tanks/>\n | width = 300px\n | align = right\n}}\n''Doomsday'' was not screened for critics in advance of its commercial opening in cinemas.<ref>{{cite news | first=Larry | last=Ratliff | title=Latest virus film put in quarantine | work=[[San Antonio Express-News]] | date=14 March 2008 }}</ref> The film received mixed reviews from critics.

The trea[[Category:Living people]]ty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

On 4 July, Wilson gave British agreement for the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of nuclear weapons against Japan]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=372}} On 8 August the Prime Minister, [[Clement Attlee]], sent a message to President [[Harry Truman]] in which he referred to themselves as \"heads of the Governments which have control of this great force\".{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=372\u2013373}}\n\n=== Truman administration ===\nThe British government had trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it considered to be a joint discovery.{{sfn|Goldberg|1964|p=410}} On 9 November 1945, Attlee and the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Mackenzie King]], went to Washington, DC, to confer with Truman about future co-operation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power.{{sfn|Gott|1963|p=240}}{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=73\u201377}} A Memorandum of Intention they signed on 16 November 1945 made Canada a full partner, and replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for \"mutual consent\" before using nuclear weapons with one for \"prior consultation\". There was to be \"full and effective co-operation in the field of atomic energy\", but British hopes were soon disappointed;{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|p=92}} this was only \"in the field of basic scientific research\".{{sfn|Paul|2000|pp=80\u201383}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=468}}\n\nTechnical co-operation was ended by the [[United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] (McMahon Act), which forbade passing \"restricted data\" to the United States' allies under pain of death.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=106\u2013108}} This partly resulted from the arrest for espionage of British physicist [[Alan Nunn May]] in February 1946, while the legislation was being debated.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=105\u2013108}} Fearing a resurgence of [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]], and Britain losing its [[great power]] status, the British government restarted its own development effort,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=181\u2013184}} now codenamed [[High Explosive Research]].{{sfn|Cathcart|1995|pp=23\u201324, 48, 57}}\n\nBy the end of 1947, {{convert|1900|lt}} of uranium ore from the [[Belgian Congo]] was stockpiled for the Combined Development Trust at [[Springfields]], near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] in [[Lancashire]], as part of a wartime sharing agreement, along with {{convert|1350|lt}} for British use. To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement.

The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK.

Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted. Only Britain qualified as a nation that had made substantial progress.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=232\u2013233}} The bill passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and was signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=234\u2013236}} The 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed by Dulles and [[Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]], the British Minister in Washington, DC, on 3 July,<ref name=\"full text\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/56_4.pdf |title=Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=1 June 2017 }}</ref> and approved by Congress on 30 July.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=238}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Details of the agreement===\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080709-D-7203C-008.jpg|thumb|left|UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] (right) addresses a reception hosted by US Defense Secretary [[Robert M.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times. The most recent renewal extended it to 31 December 2024.\n\n== Background ==\n=== Quebec Agreement ===\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Quebec Conference, August 1943 H32144.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in 1943.

Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G.

He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine.
