The first title in the series, the [[eponym]]ous ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', premiered in Japan in 1987, and ''Final Fantasy'' games have been released almost every single year since. Fifteen games have been released as part of the main (numbered) series. Sequels, prequels, [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], and related video games have been published, as well as [[List of Final Fantasy media|numerous titles in other media forms]]. Each game in the main series takes place in a different [[fictional universe]] rather than serve as direct sequels to prior games, although some titles have received sequels, or prequels, set in the same universe.\n\nMost of the games have been re-released for several different platforms, many of which have been included in [[Product bundling|bundled]] releases. The series as a whole is primarily composed of [[role-playing video game]]s, but also includes [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, [[third-person shooter]]s, [[tower defense|tower defense games]], and [[tactical role-playing game]]s. ''Final Fantasy'' games have been released on over a dozen [[video game console]]s beginning with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], as well as for [[personal computer]]s and [[mobile phone]]s. The series is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 100 million units worldwide as of June 2011, across both the main series and its spin-offs.<ref name=\"100mil\"/> ''Final Fantasy''{{'}}s popularity has placed it as one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises]].<ref name=\"Edge177\"/>\n\n==Main series==\n{{Video game titles|\n{{Video game titles/item\n|article= Final Fantasy (video game)\n|title= Final Fantasy\n|date= {{vgrelease|JP|December 18, 1987<ref name=\"JPsite1990-1985\"/>|NA|July 12, 1990<ref name=\"FF1info\"/>|PAL|March 14, 2003<ref name=\"FFOdate\"/><br/>(PlayStation version)}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|canceled=\n|refs=\n|release= 1987 \u2013 [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]<ref name=\"JPsite1990-1985\"/><br/>1989 \u2013 [[MSX]]<ref name=\"FF1MSX\"/><br/>2000 \u2013 [[WonderSwan Color]]<ref name=\"FF1WSC\"/><br/>2002 \u2013 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]<ref name=\"FF1PS\"/><br/>2004 \u2013 [[Game Boy Advance]] <br/>2004 \u2013 [[Mobile phone]]s<ref name=\"FF1mobile\"/><br/>2007 \u2013 [[PlayStation Portable]] (''Final Fantasy Anniversary Edition'')<ref name=\"FF1PSP\"/><br/>2010 \u2013 [[iOS]]<ref name=\"FF1IP\"/><br/>2012 \u2013 [[Windows Phone]]<ref name=\"FF1I7\"/><br/>2012 \u2013 [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n|platform=\n|notes=*Included in the ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)#Versions and re-releases|Final Fantasy I-II]]'' (Family Computer, 1994), ''Final Fantasy Origins'' (PlayStation, 2002), and ''Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls'' ([[Game Boy Advance]], 2004) bundle and the ''Final Fantasy Mobile'' (Mobile phones, 2004) subseries<ref name=\"FFOdate\"/><ref name=\"FF1-2date\"/><ref name=\"FFDOSdate\"/><ref name=\"FFMobile\"/>\n*NES version available on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan, North America & Europe/Australia.

published by [[Square Enix]] (formerly [[Square (video game company)|Square]]). The first title in the series, the [[eponym]]ous ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'', premiered in Japan in 1987, and ''Final Fantasy'' games have been released almost every single year since. Fifteen games have been released as part of the main (numbered) series. Sequels, prequels, [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], and related video games have been published, as well as [[List of Final Fantasy media|numerous titles in other media forms]]. Each game in the main series takes place in a different [[fictional universe]] rather than serve as direct sequels to prior games, although some titles have received sequels, or prequels, set in the same universe.\n\nMost of the games have been re-released for several different platforms, many of which have been included in [[Product bundling|bundled]] releases. The series as a whole is primarily composed of [[role-playing video game]]s, but also includes [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, [[third-person shooter]]s, [[tower defense|tower defense games]], and [[tactical role-playing game]]s. ''Final Fantasy'' games have been released on over a dozen [[video game console]]s beginning with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], as well as for [[personal computer]]s and [[mobile phone]]s. The series is Square Enix's most successful franchise, having sold over 100 million units worldwide as of June 2011, across both the main series and its spin-offs.<ref name=\"100mil\"/> ''Final Fantasy''{{'}}s popularity has placed it as one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises]].<ref name=\"Edge177\"/>\n\n==Main series==\n{{Video game titles|\n{{Video game titles/item\n|article= Final Fantasy (video game)\n|title= Final Fantasy\n|date= {{vgrelease|JP|December 18, 1987<ref name=\"JPsite1990-1985\"/>|NA|July 12, 1990<ref name=\"FF1info\"/>|PAL|March 14, 2003<ref name=\"FFOdate\"/><br/>(PlayStation version)}}\n|multiplereleasedates=yes\n|canceled=\n|refs=\n|release= 1987 \u2013 [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]<ref name=\"JPsite1990-1985\"/><br/>1989 \u2013 [[MSX]]<ref name=\"FF1MSX\"/><br/>2000 \u2013 [[WonderSwan Color]]<ref name=\"FF1WSC\"/><br/>2002 \u2013 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]<ref name=\"FF1PS\"/><br/>2004 \u2013 [[Game Boy Advance]] <br/>2004 \u2013 [[Mobile phone]]s<ref name=\"FF1mobile\"/><br/>2007 \u2013 [[PlayStation Portable]] (''Final Fantasy Anniversary Edition'')<ref name=\"FF1PSP\"/><br/>2010 \u2013 [[iOS]]<ref name=\"FF1IP\"/><br/>2012 \u2013 [[Windows Phone]]<ref name=\"FF1I7\"/><br/>2012 \u2013 [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n|platform=\n|notes=*Included in the ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)#Versions and re-releases|Final Fantasy I-II]]'' (Family Computer, 1994), ''Final Fantasy Origins'' (PlayStation, 2002), and ''Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls'' ([[Game Boy Advance]], 2004) bundle and the ''Final Fantasy Mobile'' (Mobile phones, 2004) subseries<ref name=\"FFOdate\"/><ref name=\"FF1-2date\"/><ref name=\"FFDOSdate\"/><ref name=\"FFMobile\"/>\n*NES version available on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan, North America & Europe/Australia.

Also, in 1957, the [[American Institute of Architects]] selected Red Rocks to be Colorado's entry at the [[National Gallery of Art]] for the AIA's Centennial Exhibition.\n\n== History ==\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, [[John Brisben Walker]] had a vision of artists performing on a stage nestled in the perfectly acoustic surroundings of Red Rocks, which likely were used by the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] tribe in earlier times.

Originally the place was known as the \"Garden of the Angels\" (1870s-1906), and then as \"Garden of the Titans\" during the Walker years (1906\u20131928).  The park, however, had always been known by the folk name of \"Red Rocks,\" which became its formal name when [[Denver]] acquired it in 1928.  The amphitheater's rocks are named \"Creation Rock\" on the north, \"Ship Rock\" on the south, and \"Stage Rock\" to the east.  Red Rocks Amphitheatre was designed by Denver architect [[Burnham Hoyt]]; its walls<!-- of the amphitheater--> contain records dating back to the [[Jurassic]] period of 160&nbsp;million years ago as nearby dinosaur tracks have been discovered as well as fossil fragments of the {{convert|40|ft|adj=on|spell=in}} sea serpent [[Plesiosaur]].\n\nIn 1927, George Cranmer, Manager of Denver Parks, convinced the City of Denver to purchase the area of Red Rocks from Walker for $54,133 (${{inflation|US|54133|1928|r=0|fmt=c}} today). Cranmer convinced [[List of mayors of Denver|Mayor]] [[Benjamin F. Stapleton|Benjamin Stapleton]] to build on the foundation laid by Walker. By enlisting the help of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), and [[Work Projects Administration|Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), labor and materials were provided for the venture. Construction of the amphitheater began in 1936 and was opened to the public in June 1941.<ref name=\"CCC\"/>\n\n== Notable performances ==\nPublic, organizational and private performances have been held at Red Rocks for over a century<!--more than 100 years-->. The earliest documented performance at the amphitheater was the ''Grand Opening of the Garden of the Titans'', put on by famed publisher [[John Brisben Walker]] on May 31, 1906. Featuring Pietro Satriano and his 25-piece brass band, it was the formal opening of the natural amphitheater for use by the general public after Walker purchased it with the proceeds of his sale of ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine]]''.\n\nThe amphitheater's largest-scale performance to date was the ''Feast of Lanterns'' on September 5, 1908. Commemorating the opening of the scenic road up nearby [[Mt. Falcon]], it was patterned after the festival of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]], and featured four military bands and fireworks off Mt. Falcon, Mt. Morrison and two intermediate hills.\n\nRenowned [[opera]] singer [[Mary Garden]] put Red Rocks on the world musical map with her performance on May 10, 1911.  Having performed at many opera halls around the world, she pronounced Red Rocks the finest venue at which she had ever performed.\n\nUpon the full construction of the amphitheatre to its present form by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], the venue was formally dedicated on June 15, 1941. It has held regular concert seasons every year since 1947.\n\nThe first performance of each season is the ''Easter Sunrise Service'', a non-denominational service on [[Easter Sunday]] of each year.\n\nThe earliest notable rock-and-roll performance at Red Rocks was by [[The Beatles]] on August 26, 1964,<ref name=dprecsbe>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EhgrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KJ0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5115%2C4381789 |work=Reading Eagle |location=(Pennsylvania) |agency=UPI |title=Denver park record set by Beatles |date=August 27, 1964 |page=4}}</ref> the only concert not sold out during their US-tour. When [[Ringo Starr]] returned to Red Rocks with his [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]] on June 28, 2000, he asked if anyone in the crowd had been at the Beatles concert thirty-six years earlier. On August 26, 2004, the East-Coast-based Beatles-tribute band, \"[[1964 the Tribute|1964]]\" was flown to Denver to re-enact the Beatles concert held at the site exactly forty years earlier<!-- to the day-->. The<!-- beautiful and-->&nbsp;unique setting has led to the venue becoming a favorite for many performers: [[Jimi Hendrix]] played at Red Rocks on September 1, 1968, along with [[Vanilla Fudge]] and [[Soft Machine]].\n\n[[The Blues Brothers]] performed at the amphitheatre on July 15, 1980.\n\nAn incident during a performance by [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] on June 10, 1971,<ref name=rkcspcl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p1QoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6008%2C2588399 |work=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah) |agency=UPI |title=Rock concert sparks clash |date=June 11, 1971 |page=A2}}</ref> led to a five-year ban of rock concerts at Red Rocks.<ref>Thomas J.

Denver police directed the overflow, non-paying crowd to an area behind the theater, where they could hear the music but not see the band. The situation seemed satisfactory until some of the people without tickets attempted to enter the amphitheatre by charging at, and breaking through, the police line. Some of those without tickets began lobbing rocks at the police, and the police responded by discharging [[tear gas]] at the gate-crashers.<ref name=rkcspcl/> The wind carried the tear gas over the hill, into the paying crowd and onto the stage. Following the \"Riot at Red Rocks,\" Denver Mayor [[William H. McNichols, Jr.]] banned rock concerts from the amphitheatre. For the next five years, shows at Red Rocks were limited to softer acts, such as [[John Denver]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[The Carpenters]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Seals & Crofts]], and [[Carole King]]. The ban on rock and roll was finally lifted through legal action taken by Denver concert promoter [[Barry Fey]], who tried to book the band [[America (band)|America]] at the venue in 1975. After being denied a permit by the city, Fey took the city to court, and the court ruled that the city had acted \"arbitrarily and capricious[ly]\" in banning rock concerts at Red Rocks. Starting in the summer of 1976, the rock bands were once again welcomed at the venue. Jethro Tull played Red Rocks again on August 12, 2008, and on June 8, 2011.\n\n[[U2]] performed<!-- at Red Rocks--> in 1983 during their [[War Tour]], in front<!-- of a crowd--> of 9,000<!--people--> in varying inclement weather on June&nbsp;5. The&nbsp;show was filmed for the group's concert film ''[[U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]''. The show was recorded and part of it was used for the group's live album ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]''.\n\n[[Depeche Mode]] performed at the amphitheatre four times: the first time was July 1, 1986.  The second and third were on July 11 and 12, 1990, during their [[World Violation Tour]]. The fourth was on August 27, 2009, during their ''[[Tour of the Universe (tour)|Tour of the Universe]]'', in front of a crowd of 8,679 people. The show was recorded for the group's live albums project ''[[Recording the Universe]]''.\n\nRed Rocks was one of the favored venues for [[The Grateful Dead]] and the venue has become a traditional stop for many subsequent [[jam band]]s. [[Widespread Panic]] holds the record for the most sold-out performances at Red Rocks with 60 as of June 2019. [[Blues Traveler]] has played the venue every Fourth of July since 1993, except 1999 when lead singer and harmonica player John Popper was unable to play due to heart surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/01/blues-traveler-for-the-fourth-a-red-rocks-tradition-for-more-than-20-years/|title=Blues Traveler for the Fourth: A Red Rocks tradition for more than 20 years \u2013 The Denver Post|access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref> [[Phish]], the most popular jam band of the era, were banned from performing at Red Rocks after they played four concerts there in August 1996.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Etsler |first1=Derek |title=Riots, rock bans and redemption: The lesser known history of Red Rocks |url=http://www.cpr.org/openair/story/riots-rock-bans-and-redemption-lesser-known-history-red-rocks |website=Colorado Public Radio |accessdate=16 September 2018 |language=en |date=12 August 2017}}</ref> Fans of the band who showed up to the concerts without tickets were accused of starting a riot outside the amphitheater on the second night, and the nearby town of [[Morrison, Colorado|Morrison]] was unprepared to accommodate the size of the band's following.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gripp |first1=Steven |title=What Most People Misunderstand about Phish |url=https://medium.com/@gripp_steven/what-most-people-misunderstand-about-phish-acc38bfe6cca |website=Steven Gripp |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=12 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"denverphish\">{{cite web |title=Band Phish Back At Red Rocks For First Time Since Riots |url=https://www.thedenverchannel.com/entertainment/band-phish-back-at-red-rocks-for-first-time-since-riots |website=7NEWS |accessdate=16 September 2018 |date=30 July 2009}}</ref> Phish was not invited to perform at Red Rocks again until July 2009.<ref name=\"denverphish\"/>\n\n[[Geddy Lee]] of the rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] said, \"It's an amazing location.

During the 1970s and 1980s, local [[folk-rock]]er [[John Denver]] recorded several world-televised concerts at Red Rocks. [[U2]]'s 1983 concert video, ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]'', became a best-selling long-form concert video and the performance of \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" was played frequently on [[MTV]].

In 2009, they followed the original recording up with a 2-CD/1DVD set from their June 2008 performance.\n\nA two-volume 2003 album, ''Carved in Stone'', features live performances by various artists at Red Rocks, including [[R.E.M.]], [[Ben Harper]], [[Coldplay]], [[The Allman Brothers Band]], and [[Phish]], with proceeds going towards a fund for preservation of the park and amphitheatre.\n\n[[Phish]] frontman, [[Trey Anastasio]] included excerpts from his 2005 performance at Red Rocks on the DVD that accompanied his album \"Shine.\"  Country music superstar [[Gary Allan]] filmed the music video for his song \"[[Watching Airplanes]]\" during a live sell-out concert at Red Rocks in August 2007.

Also, in 1957, the [[American Institute of Architects]] selected Red Rocks to be Colorado's entry at the [[National Gallery of Art]] for the AIA's Centennial Exhibition. \n\n== History ==\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century, [[John Brisben Walker]] had a vision of artists performing on a stage nestled in the perfectly acoustic surroundings of Red Rocks, which likely were used by the [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] tribe in earlier times. Walker produced several concerts between 1906 and 1910 on a temporary platform; and from his dream, the history of Red Rocks as an entertainment venue began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redrocksonline.com/ABOUTUS/HistoryGeology.aspx|title=Red Rocks Entertainment Concerts \u2013 About \u2013 History Geology|publisher=}}</ref> It took the natural amphitheater of Red Rocks over 200 million years to form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/02/seventy-five-facts-about-red-rocks/|title=Seventy-five facts about Red Rocks|date=2 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref> The city of Denver acquired Red Rocks amphitheater from Walker for $54,133 (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|54133|1928|r=0|fmt=c}} today), with a total area of {{convert|728|acre|mi2 km2|1}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://redrocksonline.com/about/history-geology|title=Red Rocks Entertainment Concerts {{!}} About {{!}} History Geology|website=redrocksonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-16}}</ref> In addition to the platform, Walker also built the Mount Morrison Cable Incline [[funicular]] railway which carried tourists from a base at what is today the parking lot of the amphitheatre up to enjoy the view from the top of Mount Morrison; the incline operated for about five years beginning in 1909.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://coloradogambler.com/trails-end-inclines-funicular-railways-colorado/|title=Trail's End \u2013 Inclines and Funicular Railways in Colorado \u2013 Colorado Gambler|date=2014-09-03|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501102453/http://coloradogambler.com/trails-end-inclines-funicular-railways-colorado/|archive-date=2016-05-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nGeologically, the rocks surrounding the amphitheater are representative of the [[Fountain Formation]].  Originally the place was known as the \"Garden of the Angels\" (1870s-1906), and then as \"Garden of the Titans\" during the Walker years (1906\u20131928).  The park, however, had always been known by the folk name of \"Red Rocks,\" which became its formal name when [[Denver]] acquired it in 1928.  The amphitheater's rocks are named \"Creation Rock\" on the north, \"Ship Rock\" on the south, and \"Stage Rock\" to the east.  Red Rocks Amphitheatre was designed by Denver architect [[Burnham Hoyt]]; its walls<!-- of the amphitheater--> contain records dating back to the [[Jurassic]] period of 160&nbsp;million years ago as nearby dinosaur tracks have been discovered as well as fossil fragments of the {{convert|40|ft|adj=on|spell=in}} sea serpent [[Plesiosaur]]. \n\nIn 1927, George Cranmer, Manager of Denver Parks, convinced the City of Denver to purchase the area of Red Rocks from Walker for $54,133 (${{inflation|US|54133|1928|r=0|fmt=c}} today). Cranmer convinced [[List of mayors of Denver|Mayor]] [[Benjamin F. Stapleton|Benjamin Stapleton]] to build on the foundation laid by Walker. By enlisting the help of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), and [[Work Projects Administration|Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), labor and materials were provided for the venture. Construction of the amphitheater began in 1936 and was opened to the public in June 1941.<ref name=\"CCC\">[http://www.denvergov.org/Portals/626/documents/MtnParks/Red%20Rocks%20Timeline.pdf Red Rocks Park Timeline] of the 1930s and 1940s, from Denvergov.org</ref>\n\n== Notable performances ==\nPublic, organizational and private performances have been held at Red Rocks for over a century<!--more than 100 years-->. The earliest documented performance at the amphitheater was the ''Grand Opening of the Garden of the Titans'', put on by famed publisher [[John Brisben Walker]] on May 31, 1906. Featuring Pietro Satriano and his 25-piece brass band, it was the formal opening of the natural amphitheater for use by the general public after Walker purchased it with the proceeds of his sale of ''[[Cosmopolitan Magazine]]''.\n\nThe amphitheater's largest-scale performance to date was the ''Feast of Lanterns'' on September 5, 1908. Commemorating the opening of the scenic road up nearby [[Mt. Falcon]], it was patterned after the festival of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki, Japan]], and featured four military bands and fireworks off Mt. Falcon, Mt. Morrison and two intermediate hills.\n\nRenowned [[opera]] singer [[Mary Garden]] put Red Rocks on the world musical map with her performance on May 10, 1911.  Having performed at many opera halls around the world, she pronounced Red Rocks the finest venue at which she had ever performed.\n\nUpon the full construction of the amphitheatre to its present form by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], the venue was formally dedicated on June 15, 1941. It has held regular concert seasons every year since 1947.\n\nThe first performance of each season is the ''Easter Sunrise Service'', a non-denominational service on [[Easter Sunday]] of each year.\n\nThe earliest notable rock-and-roll performance at Red Rocks was by [[The Beatles]] on August 26, 1964,<ref name=dprecsbe>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EhgrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KJ0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=5115%2C4381789 |work=Reading Eagle |location=(Pennsylvania) |agency=UPI |title=Denver park record set by Beatles |date=August 27, 1964 |page=4}}</ref> the only concert not sold out during their US-tour. When [[Ringo Starr]] returned to Red Rocks with his [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]] on June 28, 2000, he asked if anyone in the crowd had been at the Beatles concert thirty-six years earlier. On August 26, 2004, the East-Coast-based Beatles-tribute band, \"[[1964 the Tribute|1964]]\" was flown to Denver to re-enact the Beatles concert held at the site exactly forty years earlier<!-- to the day-->. The<!-- beautiful and-->&nbsp;unique setting has led to the venue becoming a favorite for many performers: [[Jimi Hendrix]] played at Red Rocks on September 1, 1968, along with [[Vanilla Fudge]] and [[Soft Machine]].\n\n[[The Blues Brothers]] performed at the amphitheatre on July 15, 1980.\n\nAn incident during a performance by [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] on June 10, 1971,<ref name=rkcspcl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p1QoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SVUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6008%2C2588399 |work=Deseret News |location=(Salt Lake City, Utah) |agency=UPI |title=Rock concert sparks clash |date=June 11, 1971 |page=A2}}</ref> led to a five-year ban of rock concerts at Red Rocks.<ref>Thomas J.

Denver police directed the overflow, non-paying crowd to an area behind the theater, where they could hear the music but not see the band. The situation seemed satisfactory until some of the people without tickets attempted to enter the amphitheatre by charging at, and breaking through, the police line. Some of those without tickets began lobbing rocks at the police, and the police responded by discharging [[tear gas]] at the gate-crashers.<ref name=rkcspcl/> The wind carried the tear gas over the hill, into the paying crowd and onto the stage. Following the \"Riot at Red Rocks,\" Denver Mayor [[William H. McNichols, Jr.]] banned rock concerts from the amphitheatre. For the next five years, shows at Red Rocks were limited to softer acts, such as [[John Denver]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[The Carpenters]], [[Pat Boone]], [[Seals & Crofts]], and [[Carole King]]. The ban on rock and roll was finally lifted through legal action taken by Denver concert promoter [[Barry Fey]], who tried to book the band [[America (band)|America]] at the venue in 1975. After being denied a permit by the city, Fey took the city to court, and the court ruled that the city had acted \"arbitrarily and capricious[ly]\" in banning rock concerts at Red Rocks. Starting in the summer of 1976, the rock bands were once again welcomed at the venue. Jethro Tull played Red Rocks again on August 12, 2008, and on June 8, 2011.\n\n[[U2]] performed<!-- at Red Rocks--> in 1983 during their [[War Tour]], in front<!-- of a crowd--> of 9,000<!--people--> in varying inclement weather on June&nbsp;5. The&nbsp;show was filmed for the group's concert film ''[[U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]''. The show was recorded and part of it was used for the group's live album ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]''.\n\n[[Depeche Mode]] performed at the amphitheatre four times: the first time was July 1, 1986.  The second and third were on July 11 and 12, 1990, during their [[World Violation Tour]]. The fourth was on August 27, 2009, during their ''[[Tour of the Universe (tour)|Tour of the Universe]]'', in front of a crowd of 8,679 people. The show was recorded for the group's live albums project ''[[Recording the Universe]]''.\n\nRed Rocks was one of the favored venues for [[The Grateful Dead]] and the venue has become a traditional stop for many subsequent [[jam band]]s. [[Widespread Panic]] holds the record for the most sold-out performances at Red Rocks with 60 as of June 2019.

During the 1970s and 1980s, local [[folk-rock]]er [[John Denver]] recorded several world-televised concerts at Red Rocks. [[U2]]'s 1983 concert video, ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]'', became a best-selling long-form concert video and the performance of \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" was played frequently on [[MTV]].

He then created another AGS game, ''The Trials of Odysseus Kent'', which was released on 30 September 2002. ''The Trials of Odysseus Kent'' was mentioned by ''[[PC Plus]]'' magazine as \"AGS Showcase\" in the November 2003 issue.<ref>[ftp://ftp.futurenet.com/pub/pcplus/issues/208.zip Zipped PDF scans of PC Plus November 2003 article on AGS, featuring ''The Trials of Odysseus Kent'']{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} cited 15 November 2006</ref> He also helped found the collaborative ''Reality-on-the-Norm'' series by creating the first game, ''Lunchtime of the Damned''.

These contain author's commentaries, extended endings, or even extended notes giving backstory. Croshaw allowed people to get these each time they donated over five [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] to his site, but as of July 2009 they were given out for free on his site, as he said he no longer relied on the donations as a means of support.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fully Ramblomatic.com Wants Your Sex|url = http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/donate.htm|website = www.fullyramblomatic.com|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\nCroshaw writes his own games and their graphics and [[animation]] using [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Paint (software)|Microsoft Paint]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/games.htm |title=Come and play with us.

In ''Friday: Death to Arthur Yahtzee'', a group of mutants whom Arthur once defeated are back and out to get him. In ''Saturday: Arthur's Odyssey'', Yahtzee has to face forces trying to mess with time, a quest that leads into '' Yesterday: The D-Gate'' where Arthur faces the villain [[Cathode]] (and helped by [[Anode]]). He reveals himself to be the one responsible for all Arthur's troubles in the previous games and is now determined to gain the power to control travel between dimensions. The game ends with Arthur destroying the entire Multiverse in his quest to stop him. These games showcase the first examples of the humour and writing style that Croshaw became known for in his AGS years.\n\nThe games were created before Croshaw had his own site and thus were hosted on the site of a friend; once that site went down, they were sent to Croshaw's Fully Ramblomatic site. A text adventure game, ''Arthur Yahtzee: The Curse of Hell's Cheesecake'', was also created but is not considered part of the actual trilogy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wurb.com/if/game/360 |title=Baf's Guide to the IF Archive, Arthur Yahtzee: The Curse of Hell's Cheesecake |publisher=Wurb.com |date=2000-07-21 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joltcountry.com/trottingkrips/ccake.html |title=Jolt Country, Arthur Yahtzee: The Curse of Hell's Cheesecake by Ben Croshaw |publisher=Joltcountry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Adventure Game Studio (2000\u20132007) ===\n\n====''Rob Blanc'' Trilogy====\nThe ''Rob Blanc'' trilogy is a series of adventure games for [[MS-DOS]] that follow the adventures of the fictional character Robert \"Rob\" Blanc, an unassuming [[England|English]] chip shop worker who is abducted by the High Ones, the two secret rulers of reality. He is told that he is to become the \"Defender of the Universe\" to provide a counterbalance to all the evil being done in the galaxy. In ''Rob Blanc{{nbsp}}I: Better Days of a Defender of the Universe'', he is sent to an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] [[spacecraft|spaceship]] to find out what happened to the crew, and prove himself as a worthy defender of the universe.<ref name=\"justadventure.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/RobBlanc/RobBlanc.shtm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102021937/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/RobBlanc/RobBlanc.shtm|url-status=dead|title=Justadventure.com|archivedate=2 November 2006}}</ref> The second game, ''Rob Blanc II: Planet of the Pasteurised Pestilence'', features Rob returning to [[Earth]] while the High Ones construct his ship. While there, he notices a green-haired teenage male, Paul Grewald, following him, and inside an elevator, both of them find that they have been sent into outer space. Landing on an alien world, they find that the natives believe them to be the ones prophesied to cure a great plague which is enveloping the planet, and are thus forced to live up to the legend.<ref name=\"justadventure.com\" /> The third and final game, ''Rob Blanc III: The Temporal Terrorists'', begins on Rob's spaceship where he and Paul, now his sidekick, are finally ready to start defending the universe. Their first mission soon comes: somebody is removing all the time from the universe, and Rob and Paul must find and assemble the parts of the Reaman Time Drive (RTD) to find out who is responsible for it. All the games follow the same point-and-click interface typical of the AGS engine they were built on, with most of the puzzles involving the finding of objects. The series' humour is inspired by ''[[The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Red Dwarf]]''.\n\n====''The Trials of Odysseus Kent''====\nAfter finishing the ''Arthur Yahtzee'' and ''Rob Blanc'' trilogies, Croshaw had stated that he was done with making adventure games. In 2002, however, Croshaw wrote and released ''The Trials of Odysseus Kent'', inspired by the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' series. The game follows Odysseus Kent, a mysterious drifter and treasure hunter who dresses like he's from the [[Regency era]]. Kent has come to a small village community in search of a bonanza called the Lost Treasure of Randolph McBoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/games/ody.htm|title=Fully Ramblomatic.com - Odysseus Kent|website=www.fullyramblomatic.com}}</ref> The game uses a traditional point-and-click interface places a higher emphasis on visual graphics rather than message boxes. The game was to be continued in a sequel entitled ''The Rise and Fall of Odysseus Kent'', however, Croshaw lost interest and the game remains unfinished.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLHYAzGxsOM|title=The Ego Review: Abandoned AGS Projects|last=yahtzee19|date=25 October 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n====''Adventures in the Galaxy of Fantabulous Wonderment''====\nReleased in 2005, ''Adventures in the Galaxy of Fantabulous Wonderment'' features cynical science fiction humour similar to [[Sierra On-Line]]'s ''[[Space Quest]]'', but mixes adventure elements with turn-based [[space combat]], resource trading and [[space exploration]] gameplay mechanisms reminiscent of space simulator titles like ''[[Star Control]]'' and ''[[Wing Commander: Privateer]]''. The game is both a parody of and a tribute to science fiction games and films. For instance, a major plot point is the deployment of [[Redshirt (character)|Redshirts]] (an obvious homage to [[Star Trek: The Original Series|''Star Trek'']]'s disposable red-shirted crew members), who are used as [[cannon fodder]] when the situation planet-side is deemed too dangerous for the ship's crew. The easily replaceable Redshirts invariably die, often in gruesome and darkly comic ways. Although not a part of the series proper, the game is set in the ''Rob Blanc'' science fiction universe, after the disappearance of the \"Defender of the Universe\" and the chaos that followed. The game was to be continued in a sequel, ''Escape from the Dimension of Insidulous Cruellitude''; however, Croshaw lost interest, and the game remains uncompleted.\n\n====''Chzo Mythos''====\n\n''5 Days a Stranger'', ''7 Days a Skeptic'', ''Trilby's Notes'', and ''6{{nbsp}}Days a Sacrifice'' are the four parts of a [[horror fiction|horror]] series that were released in 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2007 respectively. In ''5{{nbsp}}Days a Stranger'', the player controls the shady [[cat burglar]] Trilby, who stumbles across a demonic force that manifests itself as a masked killer in the tradition of [[Jason Voorhees]] or [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], while finding himself one of a group of strangers thrown together in an abandoned mansion and being picked off one by one. ''7{{nbsp}}Days a Skeptic'' emulates the claustrophobic horror of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' following a spaceship crew that finds a mysterious artefact floating in space, four hundred years after the events of ''5{{nbsp}}Days a Stranger''. ''Trilby's Notes'', set in a hotel which exists in both the real world and a horrific alternate dimension in the style of ''[[Silent Hill]]'', goes back to flesh out the origin of the cursed [[Africa]]n idol from the other games. ''6{{nbsp}}Days a Sacrifice'' is the final episode of the John DeFoe [[tetralogy]]. It links all its three previous episodes and completes the story of Chzo and John DeFoe.\n\nWhile the first two games use the point-and-click interface typical of adventure games, ''Trilby's Notes'' requires the player to move with the keyboard and type commands with a text parser, similar to the early [[Sierra On-Line]] ''[[King's Quest series|King's Quest]]'' series.\n\nA wrapped version for Linux was released in 2010 to [[Ryan C. Gordon#icculus.org|icculus.org]], later updated to use the [[Open-source software|open source]] version of AGS in 2015.<ref>[https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-chzo-mythos-and-other-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-games-updated-for-linux.4860 The Chzo Mythos And Other Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw Games Updated For Linux] on gamingonlinux.com by Hamish Wilson (20 January 2015)</ref><ref>[http://icculus.org/~hamish/chzo/ chzo] on icculus.org</ref>\n\n====''1213'' series====\n''1213'' is a [[trilogy]] of horror [[science-fiction]] games. The episodes tell the story of the suffering and eventual escape of an [[amnesia]]c victim of experimentation, code-named 1213, from his cell, freed by his unseen tormentor. On escaping, 1213 sees that the facility's other guinea pigs, all similarly named to himself, have also escaped and have been turned into zombies, slaughtering the employees. ''1213'' is notable for reproducing the traditional platformer experience using an engine originally designed to be used in the production of point-and-click adventure games. Simply animated, many elements of the game reflect the original ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' gameplay mechanics,<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/reviews/t/1213-060317.shtml PopMatters.com review] cited 25 December 2006</ref> though it incorporates aspects of gunplay found in ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'' and ''[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity]]'',<ref>[http://indygamer.blogspot.com/2006/02/1213-episode-1.html Independent Gaming: 1213 Episode 1] cited 25 December 2006</ref> the latter of which he has written a sixteen-chapter [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] of.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lparchive.org/Flashback/ |title=Flashback |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n====''Trilby: The Art of Theft''====\nSet two years before ''5 Days a Stranger'', though unrelated to the John DeFoe storyline in the other ''Chzo Mythos'' games, ''Trilby: The Art of Theft'' is a mission-based platformer game released in 2007. Like ''1213'', ''Trilby: The Art of Theft'' was made in AGS and features similar gameplay, though with less emphasis on combat and more on stealth. Unusual for a Croshaw game, ''Trilby: The Art of Theft'' is gameplay based rather than story based like the majority of his work. The game follows Trilby, years before any encounter with the supernatural, as a young gentleman thief whose identity is compromised after he is caught returning from a job. Trilby must loot various buildings in missions while avoiding guards, lasers and security cameras. To deal with being detected, Trilby is equipped with a utility umbrella that contains a taser to knockout aware guards, though if he is detected too many times the level ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/content/games/yahtzee/artoftheft|title=The Escapist : TRILBY: The Art of Theft|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Game Maker (2012 \u2013 present) ===\n\n====''Poacher''====\n''Poacher'' was released on 5 April 2012. It is a [[Metroidvania]] style non-linear [[Platform game|platformer]] starring Derek Badger, a [[poacher]] who travels underground to save a gamekeeper from hordes of [[demonic possession|demonic]] [[rabbit]]s, with the assistance of a spirit. Their actions inadvertently break a longstanding treaty between the spirits and their enemies, the Dark Ones. Eventually, he must resolve difficulties between the two factions to prevent war from breaking out.

In addition, he also produced several other webcomics; ''The Adventures of Angular Mike'', ''Cowboy Comics!'', and ''Chris and Trilby'' which is based on the characters Chris Quinn from ''Age of Evil'' and Trilby from ''Chzo Mythos''.

He had previously mentioned that he was working on a third novel, a science fiction comedy, on his Let's Drown Out video series. The novel, ''[[Will Save the Galaxy for Food]]'', is set in a universe in which the age of space exploration is cut short by the invention of teleportation technology with limitless range and focuses on a former space hero who finds himself embroiled in a dangerous conspiracy. A short excerpt from the novel was included in Croshaw's video game Hatfall, playing in the background of one of the minigames in a spoof of the [[Star Wars opening crawl|Star Wars Opening Craw]]<nowiki/>l.\n\n==== ''Differently Morphous'' ====\n\nOn 7 March 2018 Crowshaw announced on his blog he'd released a fourth novel called ''Differently Morphous''. It was released as an [[Audible (store)|Audible]] original first, with a print edition coming later in the year.

He also explains that \"saving [himself] the trouble of coming up with new characters was nice.\" The novel tells the story of an out-of-work space hero going by the name Dashford Pierce, as a set of complications once again turn his life upside down.\n\n===Video games===\nOn 5 July 2011, Croshaw admitted on his ''Extra Punctuation'' column that at one point during its long development, he was given an offer by [[3D Realms]] developer Brian Hook to write the script for ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''. This was a response to a fan's question, following Croshaw's official review of the game, regarding a fact brought up in a 23 June episode of the TWiT Video Game Show. In the episode, ''Duke Nukem Forever'' developer Jay Brushwood claimed that Hook pushed for Croshaw's involvement in the project and that his piece stood out as being the funniest among the samples sent in by other writers. However, lead designer [[George Broussard]] rejected Croshaw's script for being, according to Brushwood, \"too out there\" and untrue to the [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] character; Croshaw later added in his column that it didn't match the game's \"tone\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQLqjm_njhk&t=60m54s | title=TWiT Video Game Show 0.7 (60:54)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Extra Punctuation'' article, his short audition script wrote Duke Nukem as an ironic character; seeing that it was the only way to successfully present the overly-macho character to the current market. Croshaw added that he never talked about the offer up to that point due to possible \"unspoken\" non-disclosure action and because he didn't think the whole story was worth mentioning to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/9002-Extra-Punctuation-Yahtzee-Could-Have-Written-Duke-Nukem-Forever|title=\"Extra Punctuation: Yahtzee Could Have Written ''Duke Nukem Forever''\" (5 July 2011)|accessdate = 2011-11-11}}</ref> He elaborated further when he and Gabriel Morton played ''Duke Nukem Forever'' on Let's Drown Out, calling Duke Nukem a \"dinosaur\" and pointing out that the character was \"part of a culture that no longer existed\".\n\nDuring his trip to E3 2019, Yahtzee revealed that he did minor writing work on ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22EzsoO9EiY|title=Yahtzee's E3 2019 Adventure - Day Two &#124; Escapist Magazine|date=14 June 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Other projects==\n\n===Podcast and YouTube projects===\nSince 13 April 2011, Croshaw has hosted [[podcast]]s on his personal website. The podcasts consist of unscripted banter between him and co-speaker Gabriel Morton regarding various subjects. The format is [[Show and tell (education)|show and tell]]: Croshaw and Morton each bring three objects to discuss.\n\nIn February 2012, Croshaw and Gabriel Morton began producing [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos of various older video games and uploading them to Croshaw's [[YouTube]] channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/yahtzee19 yahtzee19]. While playing, the two discuss current news in gaming and films. As of July 2019, more than 90 games have been played in the series.\n\nThe \"Show and Tell Podcasts\" have since ended with Croshaw and Morton hybridizing their [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] series with podcast topics. Titled ''Let's Drown Out'', Morton and Yahtzee play a game of one's choosing (alternating with each episode) and talk about current events in the video game world. The series was done weekly and posted on Croshaw's [[YouTube]] channel until being tentatively put on hiatus in December 2014, due to Crowshaw and Morton feeling the format had grown stale. Since then, ''Let's Drown Out'' has been interspersed with their earlier format of Let's Play recordings of Adventure games, as well as a newer series of retrospective gameplay commentaries on Croshaw's own, earlier games, titled ''The Ego Review''. In the series, Croshaw and Morton discuss the games' writing and [[plot hole]]s. Croshaw also talks about the feedback the games got.<ref name=\"blog2014\">{{cite web|author=Ben Croshaw |url=http://fullyramblomatic-yahtzee.blogspot.fi/2014/12/the-various-updates-update.html |title=The Various Updates Update |publisher= |date= 2014-12-13 |accessdate=2015-02-08}}</ref> The format has been rearranged to allow the two to, in Croshaw's words, \"play whatever the fuck we like and talk about whatever the fuck we like\".<ref name=\"LDO FTL\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytcAV2TTDno|title=Lets Drown Out...

The pilot was released on [[YouTube]] on 15 December 2008.<ref name=\"rambotic\" /> A website was set up to promote the series.<ref name=\"Adventure-treff interview\"/> The show was supposed to feature gaming news, comedy sketches, reviews of [[MMORPG]]s and three special reports, one of which involved Croshaw in a discussion of the adventure game genre. On 3{{nbsp}}October 2009, an updated pilot was uploaded to YouTube and the Game Damage website, showing new sketches and appearances at [[Supanova Pop Culture Expo|Supanova 2009]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThere was little to no published information about Game Damage afterwards. In 2011, Croshaw was asked if Game Damage was still being worked on, to which he simply replied \"Nope.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = IAM Yahtzee Croshaw off of the Escapist's Zero Punctuation, AMAA \u2022 /r/IAmA|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/glt5k/iam_yahtzee_croshaw_off_of_the_escapists_zero/c1ohyvy?context=3|website = reddit|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===The Mana Bar===\n{{main|Mana Bar}}\nCroshaw was one of the four founders of [[Mana Bar|The Mana Bar]], an Australian cocktail bar and video gaming lounge.

The weekly series consisted of an original piece of video game themed poetry each from Croshaw and Sterling. Unlike his other shows, Croshaw presented himself on camera the entire time. The series aired weekly from 17 April 2013, to 28 May 2014.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Additionally, Croshaw and Sterling briefly starred in a competitive series titled ''Uncivil War'', which was canceled in November 2014 after Sterling left ''The Escapist''.<ref name=\"Escapistmagazine.com\"/>\n\nIn July 2015, Croshaw started another video series for ''The Escapist'' called ''Judging by the

He then created another AGS game, ''The Trials of Odysseus Kent'', which was released on 30 September 2002. ''The Trials of Odysseus Kent'' was mentioned by ''[[PC Plus]]'' magazine as \"AGS Showcase\" in the November 2003 issue.<ref>[ftp://ftp.futurenet.com/pub/pcplus/issues/208.zip Zipped PDF scans of PC Plus November 2003 article on AGS, featuring ''The Trials of Odysseus Kent'']{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} cited 15 November 2006</ref> He also helped found the collaborative ''Reality-on-the-Norm'' series by creating the first game, ''Lunchtime of the Damned''.

These contain author's commentaries, extended endings, or even extended notes giving backstory. Croshaw allowed people to get these each time they donated over five [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] to his site, but as of July 2009 they were given out for free on his site, as he said he no longer relied on the donations as a means of support.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fully Ramblomatic.com Wants Your Sex|url = http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/donate.htm|website = www.fullyramblomatic.com|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\nCroshaw writes his own games and their graphics and [[animation]] using [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[Paint (software)|Microsoft Paint]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/games.htm |title=Come and play with us.

In ''Friday: Death to Arthur Yahtzee'', a group of mutants whom Arthur once defeated are back and out to get him. In ''Saturday: Arthur's Odyssey'', Yahtzee has to face forces trying to mess with time, a quest that leads into '' Yesterday: The D-Gate'' where Arthur faces the villain [[Cathode]] (and helped by [[Anode]]). He reveals himself to be the one responsible for all Arthur's troubles in the previous games and is now determined to gain the power to control travel between dimensions. The game ends with Arthur destroying the entire Multiverse in his quest to stop him. These games showcase the first examples of the humour and writing style that Croshaw became known for in his AGS years.\n\nThe games were created before Croshaw had his own site and thus were hosted on the site of a friend; once that site went down, they were sent to Croshaw's Fully Ramblomatic site. A text adventure game, ''Arthur Yahtzee: The Curse of Hell's Cheesecake'', was also created but is not considered part of the actual trilogy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wurb.com/if/game/360 |title=Baf's Guide to the IF Archive, Arthur Yahtzee: The Curse of Hell's Cheesecake |publisher=Wurb.com |date=2000-07-21 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joltcountry.com/trottingkrips/ccake.html |title=Jolt Country, Arthur Yahtzee: The Curse of Hell's Cheesecake by Ben Croshaw |publisher=Joltcountry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Adventure Game Studio (2000\u20132007) ===\n\n====''Rob Blanc'' Trilogy====\nThe ''Rob Blanc'' trilogy is a series of adventure games for [[MS-DOS]] that follow the adventures of the fictional character Robert \"Rob\" Blanc, an unassuming [[England|English]] chip shop worker who is abducted by the High Ones, the two secret rulers of reality. He is told that he is to become the \"Defender of the Universe\" to provide a counterbalance to all the evil being done in the galaxy. In ''Rob Blanc{{nbsp}}I: Better Days of a Defender of the Universe'', he is sent to an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] [[spacecraft|spaceship]] to find out what happened to the crew, and prove himself as a worthy defender of the universe.<ref name=\"justadventure.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/RobBlanc/RobBlanc.shtm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102021937/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/RobBlanc/RobBlanc.shtm|url-status=dead|title=Justadventure.com|archivedate=2 November 2006}}</ref> The second game, ''Rob Blanc II: Planet of the Pasteurised Pestilence'', features Rob returning to [[Earth]] while the High Ones construct his ship. While there, he notices a green-haired teenage male, Paul Grewald, following him, and inside an elevator, both of them find that they have been sent into outer space. Landing on an alien world, they find that the natives believe them to be the ones prophesied to cure a great plague which is enveloping the planet, and are thus forced to live up to the legend.<ref name=\"justadventure.com\" /> The third and final game, ''Rob Blanc III: The Temporal Terrorists'', begins on Rob's spaceship where he and Paul, now his sidekick, are finally ready to start defending the universe. Their first mission soon comes: somebody is removing all the time from the universe, and Rob and Paul must find and assemble the parts of the Reaman Time Drive (RTD) to find out who is responsible for it. All the games follow the same point-and-click interface typical of the AGS engine they were built on, with most of the puzzles involving the finding of objects. The series' humour is inspired by ''[[The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and ''[[Red Dwarf]]''.\n\n====''The Trials of Odysseus Kent''====\nAfter finishing the ''Arthur Yahtzee'' and ''Rob Blanc'' trilogies, Croshaw had stated that he was done with making adventure games. In 2002, however, Croshaw wrote and released ''The Trials of Odysseus Kent'', inspired by the ''[[Monkey Island (series)|Monkey Island]]'' series. The game follows Odysseus Kent, a mysterious drifter and treasure hunter who dresses like he's from the [[Regency era]]. Kent has come to a small village community in search of a bonanza called the Lost Treasure of Randolph McBoing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/games/ody.htm|title=Fully Ramblomatic.com - Odysseus Kent|website=www.fullyramblomatic.com}}</ref> The game uses a traditional point-and-click interface places a higher emphasis on visual graphics rather than message boxes. The game was to be continued in a sequel entitled ''The Rise and Fall of Odysseus Kent'', however, Croshaw lost interest and the game remains unfinished.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLHYAzGxsOM|title=The Ego Review: Abandoned AGS Projects|last=yahtzee19|date=25 October 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n====''Adventures in the Galaxy of Fantabulous Wonderment''====\nReleased in 2005, ''Adventures in the Galaxy of Fantabulous Wonderment'' features cynical science fiction humour similar to [[Sierra On-Line]]'s ''[[Space Quest]]'', but mixes adventure elements with turn-based [[space combat]], resource trading and [[space exploration]] gameplay mechanisms reminiscent of space simulator titles like ''[[Star Control]]'' and ''[[Wing Commander: Privateer]]''. The game is both a parody of and a tribute to science fiction games and films. For instance, a major plot point is the deployment of [[Redshirt (character)|Redshirts]] (an obvious homage to [[Star Trek: The Original Series|''Star Trek'']]'s disposable red-shirted crew members), who are used as [[cannon fodder]] when the situation planet-side is deemed too dangerous for the ship's crew. The easily replaceable Redshirts invariably die, often in gruesome and darkly comic ways. Although not a part of the series proper, the game is set in the ''Rob Blanc'' science fiction universe, after the disappearance of the \"Defender of the Universe\" and the chaos that followed. The game was to be continued in a sequel, ''Escape from the Dimension of Insidulous Cruellitude''; however, Croshaw lost interest, and the game remains uncompleted.\n\n====''Chzo Mythos''====\n\n''5 Days a Stranger'', ''7 Days a Skeptic'', ''Trilby's Notes'', and ''6{{nbsp}}Days a Sacrifice'' are the four parts of a [[horror fiction|horror]] series that were released in 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2007 respectively. In ''5{{nbsp}}Days a Stranger'', the player controls the shady [[cat burglar]] Trilby, who stumbles across a demonic force that manifests itself as a masked killer in the tradition of [[Jason Voorhees]] or [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], while finding himself one of a group of strangers thrown together in an abandoned mansion and being picked off one by one. ''7{{nbsp}}Days a Skeptic'' emulates the claustrophobic horror of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' following a spaceship crew that finds a mysterious artefact floating in space, four hundred years after the events of ''5{{nbsp}}Days a Stranger''. ''Trilby's Notes'', set in a hotel which exists in both the real world and a horrific alternate dimension in the style of ''[[Silent Hill]]'', goes back to flesh out the origin of the cursed [[Africa]]n idol from the other games. ''6{{nbsp}}Days a Sacrifice'' is the final episode of the John DeFoe [[tetralogy]]. It links all its three previous episodes and completes the story of Chzo and John DeFoe.\n\nWhile the first two games use the point-and-click interface typical of adventure games, ''Trilby's Notes'' requires the player to move with the keyboard and type commands with a text parser, similar to the early [[Sierra On-Line]] ''[[King's Quest series|King's Quest]]'' series.\n\nA wrapped version for Linux was released in 2010 to [[Ryan C. Gordon#icculus.org|icculus.org]], later updated to use the [[Open-source software|open source]] version of AGS in 2015.<ref>[https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-chzo-mythos-and-other-ben-yahtzee-croshaw-games-updated-for-linux.4860 The Chzo Mythos And Other Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw Games Updated For Linux] on gamingonlinux.com by Hamish Wilson (20 January 2015)</ref><ref>[http://icculus.org/~hamish/chzo/ chzo] on icculus.org</ref>\n\n====''1213'' series====\n''1213'' is a [[trilogy]] of horror [[science-fiction]] games. The episodes tell the story of the suffering and eventual escape of an [[amnesia]]c victim of experimentation, code-named 1213, from his cell, freed by his unseen tormentor. On escaping, 1213 sees that the facility's other guinea pigs, all similarly named to himself, have also escaped and have been turned into zombies, slaughtering the employees. ''1213'' is notable for reproducing the traditional platformer experience using an engine originally designed to be used in the production of point-and-click adventure games. Simply animated, many elements of the game reflect the original ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' gameplay mechanics,<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/multimedia/reviews/t/1213-060317.shtml PopMatters.com review] cited 25 December 2006</ref> though it incorporates aspects of gunplay found in ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'' and ''[[Flashback: The Quest for Identity]]'',<ref>[http://indygamer.blogspot.com/2006/02/1213-episode-1.html Independent Gaming: 1213 Episode 1] cited 25 December 2006</ref> the latter of which he has written a sixteen-chapter [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] of.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lparchive.org/Flashback/ |title=Flashback |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n====''Trilby: The Art of Theft''====\nSet two years before ''5 Days a Stranger'', though unrelated to the John DeFoe storyline in the other ''Chzo Mythos'' games, ''Trilby: The Art of Theft'' is a mission-based platformer game released in 2007. Like ''1213'', ''Trilby: The Art of Theft'' was made in AGS and features similar gameplay, though with less emphasis on combat and more on stealth. Unusual for a Croshaw game, ''Trilby: The Art of Theft'' is gameplay based rather than story based like the majority of his work. The game follows Trilby, years before any encounter with the supernatural, as a young gentleman thief whose identity is compromised after he is caught returning from a job. Trilby must loot various buildings in missions while avoiding guards, lasers and security cameras. To deal with being detected, Trilby is equipped with a utility umbrella that contains a taser to knockout aware guards, though if he is detected too many times the level ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/content/games/yahtzee/artoftheft|title=The Escapist : TRILBY: The Art of Theft|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Game Maker (2012 \u2013 present) ===\n\n====''Poacher''====\n''Poacher'' was released on 5 April 2012. It is a [[Metroidvania]] style non-linear [[Platform game|platformer]] starring Derek Badger, a [[poacher]] who travels underground to save a gamekeeper from hordes of [[demonic possession|demonic]] [[rabbit]]s, with the assistance of a spirit. Their actions inadvertently break a longstanding treaty between the spirits and their enemies, the Dark Ones. Eventually, he must resolve difficulties between the two factions to prevent war from breaking out. The game was his first to be made in [[GameMaker: Studio|Game Maker]], and was released to positive reception.\n\n====''The Consuming Shadow''====\n''The Consuming Shadow'' was announced in November 2013 on Croshaw's personal website where the beta version was made available for download.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fullyramblomatic-yahtzee.blogspot.pt/2013/11/thy-shadow-consumed.html |title=Thy Shadow Consumed |date=2013-11-26}}</ref> He updated the game continually until 26 June, when he uploaded the trailer of the final version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj5gYHiTgAQ |title=The Consuming Shadow Trailer |date=2013-11-26}}</ref> On 28 July 2015, two editions were made available to purchase on both through [[Humble Bundle]] and the [[Mac App Store]], with a [[SteamOS|Steam]] version later being green lit. The special edition of the game included the e-book releases of Croshaw's novels ''Mogworld'' and ''Jam''.\n\n====''Hatfall''====\nIn February 2015, Croshaw announced a new game titled ''Hatfall'', based on his ''Zero Punctuation'' series, that he would design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fullyramblomatic-yahtzee.blogspot.ie/2015/02/to-catch-hat.html |title=To Catch A Hat |date=2015-02-28}}</ref> The game was later released in July 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kwf8Hk01dM |title=Play Yahtzee's New Game Hatfall Now! |date=2015-07-07}}</ref> and is available on [[IOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Personal computer|PC]].

The comic ended its run on 22 September 2002. In addition, he also produced several other webcomics; ''The Adventures of Angular Mike'', ''Cowboy Comics!'', and ''Chris and Trilby'' which is based on the characters Chris Quinn from ''Age of Evil'' and Trilby from ''Chzo Mythos''. Yahtzee has since openly disowned his comics, attributing it to a \"dark time\" in his life, although they are still hosted online to read.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fullyramblomatic.com/cartoons.htm|title=Fully Ramblomatic.com - Comics|website=www.fullyramblomatic.com}}</ref>\n\n===Novels===\nCroshaw's website hosts two unpublished novels: ''Articulate Jim: A Search for Something'', a [[Pirates in popular culture|pirate]]-themed in part work; and ''Fog Juice'', his 2005 \"[[National Novel Writing Month]]\" entry.

He had previously mentioned that he was working on a third novel, a science fiction comedy, on his Let's Drown Out video series. The novel, ''[[Will Save the Galaxy for Food]]'', is set in a universe in which the age of space exploration is cut short by the invention of teleportation technology with limitless range and focuses on a former space hero who finds himself embroiled in a dangerous conspiracy. A short excerpt from the novel was included in Croshaw's video game Hatfall, playing in the background of one of the minigames in a spoof of the [[Star Wars opening crawl|Star Wars Opening Craw]]<nowiki/>l.\n\n==== ''Differently Morphous'' ====\n\nOn 7 March 2018 Crowshaw announced on his blog he'd released a fourth novel called ''Differently Morphous''. It was released as an [[Audible (store)|Audible]] original first, with a print edition coming later in the year. The novel is about a group of individuals from the Ministry of Occultism needing to track down a magical serial killer while dealing with the public scrutiny of our modern politically correct society.<ref>{{cite web|author=Half-Life |title=Fully Ramblomatic - the blog of Yahtzee Croshaw: Differently Morphous is the name of a book I wrote|url=http://fullyramblomatic-yahtzee.blogspot.com/2018/03/differently-morphous-is-name-of-book-i.html|date=7 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAll four of his published novels have been released in [[audiobook]] format, narrated by Croshaw himself.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Yahtzee Croshaw|url = http://openbookaudio.com/author/yahtzee-croshaw|website = Open Book Audio - Audiobook Production and Distribution for Independent Authors and Publishers|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.audible.com/search/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_1_srAuth?searchAuthor=Yahtzee+Croshaw&qid=1493674107&sr=1-1|title=Audiobooks written by Yahtzee Croshaw {{!}} Audible.com|website=www.audible.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n\n====''Machine of Death''====\nOn 26 October 2010, the independently published [[short story]] [[anthology]] [[Machine of Death]] was published, containing a short story by Croshaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://machineofdeath.net/mod-day |title=Machine of Death |publisher=Machine of Death |date= |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fullyramblomatic-yahtzee.blogspot.com/2010/08/we-are-dead.html |title=Fullyramblomatic-Machine of Death |publisher=Fullyramblomatic-yahtzee.blogspot.com |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2012-11-06}}</ref>\n\n====''Will Destroy the Galaxy for Cash''====\nOn 21 September 2019, Crowshaw announced on his blog that a direct sequel to ''Will Save the Galaxy for Food'' was slated for release on Audible.com on 26 September, 2019. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fullyramblomatic-yahtzee.blogspot.com/2019/09/will-update-this-blog-for-likes.html|title=Fully Ramblomatic - the blog of Yahtzee Croshaw: Will Update This Blog For Likes|date=2019-09-21|website=Fully Ramblomatic - the blog of Yahtzee Croshaw|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> Crowshaw specifically stated that he was leery of sequels and serials, because he remembered as a kid only finding books 2 and 4 of certain series, but he also mentioned that this lack of availability was a non-issue in the age of digital media. He also explains that \"saving [himself] the trouble of coming up with new characters was nice.\" The novel tells the story of an out-of-work space hero going by the name Dashford Pierce, as a set of complications once again turn his life upside down.\n\n===Video games===\nOn 5 July 2011, Croshaw admitted on his ''Extra Punctuation'' column that at one point during its long development, he was given an offer by [[3D Realms]] developer Brian Hook to write the script for ''[[Duke Nukem Forever]]''. This was a response to a fan's question, following Croshaw's official review of the game, regarding a fact brought up in a 23 June episode of the TWiT Video Game Show. In the episode, ''Duke Nukem Forever'' developer Jay Brushwood claimed that Hook pushed for Croshaw's involvement in the project and that his piece stood out as being the funniest among the samples sent in by other writers. However, lead designer [[George Broussard]] rejected Croshaw's script for being, according to Brushwood, \"too out there\" and untrue to the [[Duke Nukem (character)|Duke Nukem]] character; Croshaw later added in his column that it didn't match the game's \"tone\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQLqjm_njhk&t=60m54s | title=TWiT Video Game Show 0.7 (60:54)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Extra Punctuation'' article, his short audition script wrote Duke Nukem as an ironic character; seeing that it was the only way to successfully present the overly-macho character to the current market. Croshaw added that he never talked about the offer up to that point due to possible \"unspoken\" non-disclosure action and because he didn't think the whole story was worth mentioning to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/extra-punctuation/9002-Extra-Punctuation-Yahtzee-Could-Have-Written-Duke-Nukem-Forever|title=\"Extra Punctuation: Yahtzee Could Have Written ''Duke Nukem Forever''\" (5 July 2011)|accessdate = 2011-11-11}}</ref> He elaborated further when he and Gabriel Morton played ''Duke Nukem Forever'' on Let's Drown Out, calling Duke Nukem a \"dinosaur\" and pointing out that the character was \"part of a culture that no longer existed\".\n\nDuring his trip to E3 2019, Yahtzee revealed that he did minor writing work on ''[[Watch Dogs: Legion]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22EzsoO9EiY|title=Yahtzee's E3 2019 Adventure - Day Two &#124; Escapist Magazine|date=14 June 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Other projects==\n\n===Podcast and YouTube projects===\nSince 13 April 2011, Croshaw has hosted [[podcast]]s on his personal website. The podcasts consist of unscripted banter between him and co-speaker Gabriel Morton regarding various subjects. The format is [[Show and tell (education)|show and tell]]: Croshaw and Morton each bring three objects to discuss.\n\nIn February 2012, Croshaw and Gabriel Morton began producing [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos of various older video games and uploading them to Croshaw's [[YouTube]] channel [https://www.youtube.com/user/yahtzee19 yahtzee19]. While playing, the two discuss current news in gaming and films. As of July 2019, more than 90 games have been played in the series.\n\nThe \"Show and Tell Podcasts\" have since ended with Croshaw and Morton hybridizing their [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] series with podcast topics. Titled ''Let's Drown Out'', Morton and Yahtzee play a game of one's choosing (alternating with each episode) and talk about current events in the video game world. The series was done weekly and posted on Croshaw's [[YouTube]] channel until being tentatively put on hiatus in December 2014, due to Crowshaw and Morton feeling the format had grown stale. Since then, ''Let's Drown Out'' has been interspersed with their earlier format of Let's Play recordings of Adventure games, as well as a newer series of retrospective gameplay commentaries on Croshaw's own, earlier games, titled ''The Ego Review''. In the series, Croshaw and Morton discuss the games' writing and [[plot hole]]s. Croshaw also talks about the feedback the games got.<ref name=\"blog2014\">{{cite web|author=Ben Croshaw |url=http://fullyramblomatic-yahtzee.blogspot.fi/2014/12/the-various-updates-update.html |title=The Various Updates Update |publisher= |date= 2014-12-13 |accessdate=2015-02-08}}</ref> The format has been rearranged to allow the two to, in Croshaw's words, \"play whatever the fuck we like and talk about whatever the fuck we like\".<ref name=\"LDO FTL\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytcAV2TTDno|title=Lets Drown Out...

The pilot was released on [[YouTube]] on 15 December 2008.<ref name=\"rambotic\" /> A website was set up to promote the series.<ref name=\"Adventure-treff interview\"/> The show was supposed to feature gaming news, comedy sketches, reviews of [[MMORPG]]s and three special reports, one of which involved Croshaw in a discussion of the adventure game genre. On 3{{nbsp}}October 2009, an updated pilot was uploaded to YouTube and the Game Damage website, showing new sketches and appearances at [[Supanova Pop Culture Expo|Supanova 2009]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThere was little to no published information about Game Damage afterwards. In 2011, Croshaw was asked if Game Damage was still being worked on, to which he simply replied \"Nope.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = IAM Yahtzee Croshaw off of the Escapist's Zero Punctuation, AMAA \u2022 /r/IAmA|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/glt5k/iam_yahtzee_croshaw_off_of_the_escapists_zero/c1ohyvy?context=3|website = reddit|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===The Mana Bar===\n{{main|Mana Bar}}\nCroshaw was one of the four founders of [[Mana Bar|The Mana Bar]], an Australian cocktail bar and video gaming lounge.

The model lineup consisted of a four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], a four-door [[hatchback]] and a five-door [[station wagon|wagon]], marketed in North America as the \"Sport Sedan\", \"5-Door\" and \"Sport Wagon\", respectively. In Australia, the lineup was first available in Limited trim, as a sedan; in Classic trim as sedan, hatch or wagon and in Luxury trim as sedan and liftback &mdash; and Luxury Sports trim, as a liftback. In New Zealand the lineup consisted of 2.0L GLX (sedan only), 2.3L GSX (sedan, liftback, and wagon), and the 2.3L Limited (sedan and liftback).\n\nIts arrival in Japan signified a new consolidated approach as compared to previous large luxury sedans previously offered, such as the [[Mazda Sentia]] and the [[Mazda Millenia]], as well as giving the [[Mazda Capella]] a refreshed appearance. The Atenza continues luxury car offerings to Japanese buyers due to dimensions placing it in the larger \"normal size\" classification, according to Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]].\n\nIn North America, the first generation was marketed as a 2003 model in the United States and as a 2004 model in Canada. In Europe, the luxury sports model was available as a {{convert|120|hp|abbr=on}} direct injection turbodiesel (\"DITD\") estate up until 2007. As of 2008, the European Mazda catalog lists only the \"Sport\" version of the {{convert|146|hp|abbr=on}} turbodiesel estate, while the \"Luxury Sport\" version has been dropped.\n\nDrivetrain combinations include the [[Mazda MZR engine]] in configurations of 1.8&nbsp;L ([[Mazda L engine#L8|L8-DE]]), 2.0&nbsp;L ([[Mazda L engine#LF|LF-VE]]) and 2.3&nbsp;L ([[Mazda L engine#L3|L3-VE]]), initially with a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or four-speed [[automatic transmission]] (with sequential-automatic option, dubbed the \"Four-Speed Sport AT\"). In the US domestic market a 3.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Duratec V6 engine#3.0 L|Duratec 30]] [[V6 engine]]  is also available with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic (with sequential-automatic option, dubbed the \"5-Speed Sport AT\"). European and Australian versions also feature a four-cylinder [[turbodiesel]] that comes with a six-speed manual transmission and produces significantly more torque than the V6, with much improved fuel economy.\n\nIn North America, the 5-speed automatic optional on the V6 models is replaced by an [[Aisin]] 6-speed automatic for 2005 model year. The four-cylinder model receives a [[Jatco]] five-speed automatic in the following year. Power is directed to the front wheels in most markets, although full-time [[all-wheel-drive]] models are available in Japan, Europe and Australia. Not all configurations are available in all areas \u2013 for example, the Mazda 6 as released in Australia is available in 2.3L four-cylinder guise only, while the 626 which it replaced was available with a choice of four- or six-cylinder engines.  The [[Ford Mondeo V6 engine#Mazda MZI|MZI]] V6 engine was only fitted to vehicles manufactured at Mazda's [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant]] and destined for the U.S. and Canadian domestic markets.\n\nJust as before the [[Mazda Capella|Mazda 626]] was renamed to Mazda6 Atenza, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] continues to use the Mazda's [[Mazda G platform#GG|G-series platform]] for the basis of a number of its [[Ford CD3 platform|CD3]] platform coded vehicles, including the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]], [[Mercury Milan]], [[Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ]], [[Lincoln MKX]], and a range of [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] and [[minivan]]s. Ford also plans to offer a [[hybrid car|hybrid]] powertrain on the platform. The official Mazda chassis codes are '''GG''' (saloon/hatch) and '''GY''' (estate) series \u2013 following the 626/Capella in its GF/GW series.\n\nMazda's [[Hofu (Mazda factory)|Hofu Plant]] in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], Japan produced the Mazda6 for international markets from February 2002 to August 2007. In North America, Mazda6 production was handled at the [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant|AutoAlliance International]] plant in [[Flat Rock, Michigan]]. The first Mazda 6 rolled off the AAI assembly line on October 1, 2002, one month after 626 production ended. There are also satellite plants building Mazda 6 models in China and [[Thailand]] for their respective local markets.\n\nIn September 2005, all Australian Mazda 6s received a facelift which included a feature upgrade, 5-speed auto and 6-speed manual transmissions, standard 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels and minor bodywork upgrades.\n\nIn China, the Mazda6 was introduced by [[FAW Group|FAW Mazda]] in 2003. Despite the release of its successors, the first generation car, known locally as the ''Maliu'' (\u9a6c\u516d, \"Horse 6\"), continues to be manufactured at FAW's [[Changchun]] plant, having sold over 770,000 units as of 2014.<ref name=\"Nikkei\"/> This model is also used as the base for the [[FAW Benteng]], also known as [[Besturn B70#First generation (2006-2014)|Besturn B70]] or Hongqi C301.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:Mazda6 sedan.jpg|Pre-facelift Mazda6 sedan (US)\nFile:Mazda 6 2.0 2004 (14971577476).jpg|Pre-facelift Mazda6 sedan (Chile)\nFile:'03-'05 Mazda 6 Wagon V6.jpg|Pre-facelift Mazda6 wagon (Canada)\nFile:2005-2007 Mazda 6 (GG Series 2) Luxury Sports hatchback (2011-01-13).jpg|Facelift Mazda6 liftback \nFile:2006 Mazda6 TS 2.0 Front.jpg|Facelift Mazda6 liftback \nFile:2006 Mazda6 TS 2.0 Rear.jpg|Facelift Mazda6 liftback\nFile:06-08 Mazda6 sedan.jpg|Facelift Mazda6 sedan (US)\nFile:2004 Mazda 6 Sakata Interior (UK).jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n\n=== Mazda6 MPS ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Mazda_Speed_6.jpg\n| name = Mazda6 MPS\n| aka = {{Plainlist|\n*Mazdaspeed 6\n*Mazdaspeed Atenza\n}}\n| manufacturer = [[Mazda]]\n| class = [[Mid-size car]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| production = 2005\u20132007\n| engine = 2.3&nbsp;L [[Mazda L engine#2.3L DISI Turbo (L3-VDT)|MZR L3-VDT]] Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) [[Turbocharger|turbo]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n| transmission = 6-speed A26MX-R [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2675|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1780|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1430|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1628|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| platform = [[Mazda G platform#GG|Mazda GG platform]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|F4 layout]]\n(Front-engine, four-wheel-drive)\n| assembly = [[Hofu, Yamaguchi]], Japan ([[Hofu (Mazda factory)|Hofu Plant]])<ref name=\"mazdaDomestic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mazda.com/profile/group/domestic_base.html|title=Major production facilities in Japan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229061815/http://www.mazda.com/profile/group/domestic_base.html|archivedate=2010-12-29}}</ref>\n| designer = Kaname Sawai (2003)\n}}\n[[File:Mazda 6 MPS (15350551995).jpg|thumb|left|Mazda 6 MPS (Australia)]]\nThe 2006 '''Mazdaspeed Atenza''' (known as ''Mazdaspeed6'' in North America and ''Mazda6 MPS'' in Europe, South Africa and Australia) is a high-performance version of the Mazda6. Its mission statement was written with the help of Peter Birtwhistle, chief of Mazda's advanced design studio in Germany at the time. It was initially unveiled as a concept at the [[2002 Paris Motor Show]]. It features a [[turbocharged]] version of the 2.3&nbsp;L [[Mazda MZR engine|MZR]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] which produces 272&nbsp;PS (200&nbsp;kW) (European version is detuned to 260&nbsp;PS (191&nbsp;kW); the North American version, at 274&nbsp;hp (204&nbsp;kW), revised to {{convert|270|hp|abbr=on|0}} for 2007). All models have {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. This 2.3&nbsp;L DISI turbocharged engine features [[gasoline direct injection|direct fuel injection]] and conforms to the new [[Euro 5]] emissions standards. It has a revised front fascia with a raised hood, a 6-speed manual transmission, and [[all-wheel drive]]. The all-wheel-drive system uses Mazda's ''Active Torque Split'' computer-based control, which routes between 100% of the power to the front and 50% to the rear wheels depending on driving conditions.\n\nOriginally scheduled to be launched in June 2005, the Mazdaspeed Atenza was delayed until November. In North America, the Mazdaspeed6 comes in two trim levels; the \"Sport\" trim with cloth interior and standard key entry and ignition; and the \"Grand Touring\" trim with leather interior, keyless entry/ignition, and an optional DVD navigation. Automatic climate control is standard, as is a 200&nbsp;W [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] stereo system featuring seven speakers and a 9-inch subwoofer in addition to an in-dash six-disc [[CD changer]]. A [[sunroof]] with [[moonroof]] feature is optional on the Grand Touring trim.\n\n''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine has achieved a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of 5.4 seconds for this vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/the-quickest-cars-of-2007-25000-to-30000-2007-mazdaspeed-6-page-6|title=2007 Mazdaspeed 6 \u2013 Feature|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Car and Driver|accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe Mazda6 was second place in the 2003 [[European Car of the Year]] awards and made ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 2003. The ''Sport Wagon'' won the [[Canadian Car of the Year]] ''Best New Station Wagon'' award, while the ''Sport'' sedan won the [[Canadian Car of the Year]] ''Best New Family Car'' award for 2005. The Atenza Wagon also won [[What Car?|What Car?'s]] ''Best Estate'' award in 2004. Also the Mazda6 won the 2003 [[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]].\n\nThe Mazda6 won the 'Best Mid-size Car (over $28,000)' title in Australia's Best Cars in 2002 and 2003. It came second in 2004, behind the [[Subaru Legacy|Subaru Liberty]], and fifth in 2005 (the [[Honda Accord Euro]] was first in 2005). Wheels magazine also awarded the Mazda6 winner of its Active Safety Program in July 2005. In December 2007 in Australia the Mazda6 won the Carsales Peoples Choice award for its class.\nThe Mazda6 also won \"Best Family Sedan\" in [[MotorWeek Drivers' Choice Awards|MotorWeek]]'s 2009 Driver's Choice Awards.\nThe Mazda 6 was praised for its edgy handsome design, communicative steering and tight suspension. However, as it was designed as a world car in order to fit the needs of Europe and Japan, it was smaller than its North American contemporaries in the midsize segment, being criticized for its reduced passenger space. Its acceleration, particularly the V6 engine models, lagged behind that of its rivals as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/mazda/mazda6/review.html |title=Mazda 6 Overview |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe hatchback's [[liftback]]/notchback styling was considered a clever design to disguise it as a four-door saloon, as North Americans generally considered trunks more elegant than hatches. The estate had an early demise, but the hatchback was somewhat successful in Canada, especially in Qu\u00e9bec, though it would not have a 2009 refresh, as both models were unpopular in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/pw/2009-mazda6.php |title=canadiandriver.com |publisher=canadiandriver.com |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|second generation|GH}} Second generation (GH1; 2007\u20132010 GH2 2010-2012) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation (GH1)\n| image        = Mazda 6 front 20090212.jpg\n| caption      = Mazda6 Sedan (Europe)\n| aka          = Mazda6 Ruiyi (China)<!--http://www.faw-mazda.com/exhibit/index.aspx Fits Automotive Works--><br>Mazda 6 Ultra (Middle East)\n| production   = {{Plainlist|\n*August 2007 \u2013 August 2012\n*2009\u20132017 (China)\n}}\n| assembly     = {{Plainlist|\n*Japan:  [[Hofu, Yamaguchi]] ([[Hofu (Mazda factory)|Hofu Plant]])\n*China: [[Changchun]] ([[FAW Group]])\n}}\n| layout       = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n*[[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|AWD layout]]\n}}\n| engine       = {{Plainlist|\n*1.8&nbsp;L [[Mazda L engine#1.8 L (L8-DE, L8-VE)|MZR L8]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] ([[Petrol engine|gasoline]])\n*2.0&nbsp;L [[Mazda L engine#2.0 L (LF-DE, LF-VE, LF-VD)|MZR LF]] I4 (gasoline)\n*2.5&nbsp;L [[Mazda L engine#2.5 L (L5-VE)|MZR L5]] I4 (gasoline)\n*3.7&nbsp;L [[Ford Cyclone engine#3.7 L|Duratec 37]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (gasoline)\n*2.0&nbsp;L [[Mazda Diesel engine#RF 2002 (2.0 MZR-CD)|MZR-CD]] I4 ([[Diesel engine|diesel]])\n*2.2&nbsp;L [[Mazda Diesel engine#R2 2008 (2.2 MZR-CD)|MZR-CD]] I4 (diesel)\n}}\n| transmission = {{Plainlist|\n*5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n*5-speed FS5A-EL [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n*6-speed G36M-R manual\n*6-speed [[AWTF-80 SC]] automatic\n}}\n| wheelbase    = {{Plainlist|\n*International: {{convert|2725|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n*North America: {{convert|109.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n| length       = {{Plainlist|\n*Sedan and hatchback (2007-2010): {{convert|4735|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} \n*Sedan and hatchback (2011-2012): {{convert|4755|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n*Wagon (2007-2010): {{convert|4765|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n*Wagon (2011-2012): {{convert|4785|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n| width        = {{Plainlist|\n*International: {{convert|1795|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n*North America: {{convert|72.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n| height       = {{Plainlist|\n*Sedan and hatchback: {{convert|1440|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n*Wagon: {{convert|1490|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n| platform     = [[Mazda G platform#GH|Mazda GH platform]]\n| body_style   = {{Plainlist|\n*4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n*5-door [[Hatchback#Liftback|liftback]]\n*5-door [[Station wagon|wagon]]\n}}\n| related      = {{Plainlist|\n*[[Ford Edge#First generation (U387, 2007\u20132014)|Ford Edge]]\n*[[Ford Fusion (Americas)#First generation (2006\u20132012)|Ford Fusion]]\n*[[Lincoln MKX#First generation (2007\u20132015)|Lincoln MKX]]\n*[[Lincoln MKZ#First generation (2006\u20132012)|Lincoln MKZ]]\n*[[Mazda CX-9#First generation (2006\u20132016)|Mazda CX-9]]\n*[[Mercury Milan]]\n}}\n| designer     = Koichi Sato (2005)\n}}\n\nThe second generation Mazda6 made its premiere at the [[Frankfurt Auto Show#2007|2007 Frankfurt Auto Show]] in September.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spinelli |first=Mike |url=http://jalopnik.com/cars/frankfurt-auto-show/mazda6-images-hit-the-net-ahead-of-frankfurt-unveiling-296946.php |title=jalopnik.com |publisher=jalopnik.com |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=km77.com |url=http://www.km77.com/00/mazda/6/t01.asp |title=km77.com |publisher=km77.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe new Mazda6 is based on the Mazda [[Mazda G platform#GH|GH]] chassis platform, a revised version of the [[Mazda G platform#GG|GG]] chassis which Ford also still uses as their CD3 platform. Mazda continues to provide three body styles, including 4-door saloon (sedan), 5-door hatchback and wagon. A number of journalists have already praised its electrically assisted steering for being considerably improved compared to the previous generation, providing more feedback to the driver.  The hatchback model even has a trunk space which beats the larger rival [[Ford Mondeo]] and [[Opel Insignia|Opel/Vauxhall Insignia]] (hatchback) by 200 liters with rear seats folded down.\n\nThis model of the Mazda6 was awarded 2010 Family [[Car of the Year]] by ''[[What Car?]]'' magazine.\n\nAt the [[Geneva Motor Show#2010|2010 Geneva Motor Show]], Mazda announced their new 2011 Mazda6.\n\nIn China, over 680,000 Mazdas, including Mazda6 made between September 2008 and January 2016, were recalled due to faulty air bags.

The model lineup consisted of a four-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]], a four-door [[hatchback]] and a five-door [[station wagon|wagon]], marketed in North America as the \"Sport Sedan\", \"5-Door\" and \"Sport Wagon\", respectively. In Australia, the lineup was first available in Limited trim, as a sedan; in Classic trim as sedan, hatch or wagon and in Luxury trim as sedan and liftback &mdash; and Luxury Sports trim, as a liftback. In New Zealand the lineup consisted of 2.0L GLX (sedan only), 2.3L GSX (sedan, liftback, and wagon), and the 2.3L Limited (sedan and liftback).\n\nIts arrival in Japan signified a new consolidated approach as compared to previous large luxury sedans previously offered, such as the [[Mazda Sentia]] and the [[Mazda Millenia]], as well as giving the [[Mazda Capella]] a refreshed appearance. The Atenza continues luxury car offerings to Japanese buyers due to dimensions placing it in the larger \"normal size\" classification, according to Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|dimension regulations]].\n\nIn North America, the first generation was marketed as a 2003 model in the United States and as a 2004 model in Canada. In Europe, the luxury sports model was available as a {{convert|120|hp|abbr=on}} direct injection turbodiesel (\"DITD\") estate up until 2007. As of 2008, the European Mazda catalog lists only the \"Sport\" version of the {{convert|146|hp|abbr=on}} turbodiesel estate, while the \"Luxury Sport\" version has been dropped.\n\nDrivetrain combinations include the [[Mazda MZR engine]] in configurations of 1.8&nbsp;L ([[Mazda L engine#L8|L8-DE]]), 2.0&nbsp;L ([[Mazda L engine#LF|LF-VE]]) and 2.3&nbsp;L ([[Mazda L engine#L3|L3-VE]]), initially with a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or four-speed [[automatic transmission]] (with sequential-automatic option, dubbed the \"Four-Speed Sport AT\"). In the US domestic market a 3.0&nbsp;L [[Ford Duratec V6 engine#3.0 L|Duratec 30]] [[V6 engine]]  is also available with a five-speed manual or five-speed automatic (with sequential-automatic option, dubbed the \"5-Speed Sport AT\"). European and Australian versions also feature a four-cylinder [[turbodiesel]] that comes with a six-speed manual transmission and produces significantly more torque than the V6, with much improved fuel economy.\n\nIn North America, the 5-speed automatic optional on the V6 models is replaced by an [[Aisin]] 6-speed automatic for 2005 model year. The four-cylinder model receives a [[Jatco]] five-speed automatic in the following year. Power is directed to the front wheels in most markets, although full-time [[all-wheel-drive]] models are available in Japan, Europe and Australia. Not all configurations are available in all areas \u2013 for example, the Mazda 6 as released in Australia is available in 2.3L four-cylinder guise only, while the 626 which it replaced was available with a choice of four- or six-cylinder engines.  The [[Ford Mondeo V6 engine#Mazda MZI|MZI]] V6 engine was only fitted to vehicles manufactured at Mazda's [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant]] and destined for the U.S. and Canadian domestic markets.\n\nJust as before the [[Mazda Capella|Mazda 626]] was renamed to Mazda6 Atenza, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] continues to use the Mazda's [[Mazda G platform#GG|G-series platform]] for the basis of a number of its [[Ford CD3 platform|CD3]] platform coded vehicles, including the [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]], [[Mercury Milan]], [[Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ]], [[Lincoln MKX]], and a range of [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] and [[minivan]]s. Ford also plans to offer a [[hybrid car|hybrid]] powertrain on the platform. The official Mazda chassis codes are '''GG''' (saloon/hatch) and '''GY''' (estate) series \u2013 following the 626/Capella in its GF/GW series.\n\nMazda's [[Hofu (Mazda factory)|Hofu Plant]] in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], Japan produced the Mazda6 for international markets from February 2002 to August 2007. In North America, Mazda6 production was handled at the [[Flat Rock Assembly Plant|AutoAlliance International]] plant in [[Flat Rock, Michigan]]. The first Mazda 6 rolled off the AAI assembly line on October 1, 2002, one month after 626 production ended. There are also satellite plants building Mazda 6 models in China and [[Thailand]] for their respective local markets.\n\nIn September 2005, all Australian Mazda 6s received a facelift which included a feature upgrade, 5-speed auto and 6-speed manual transmissions, standard 16- or 17-inch alloy wheels and minor bodywork upgrades.\n\nIn China, the Mazda6 was introduced by [[FAW Group|FAW Mazda]] in 2003. Despite the release of its successors, the first generation car, known locally as the ''Maliu'' (\u9a6c\u516d, \"Horse 6\"), continues to be manufactured at FAW's [[Changchun]] plant, having sold over 770,000 units as of 2014.<ref name=\"Nikkei\"/> This model is also used as the base for the [[FAW Benteng]], also known as [[Besturn B70#First generation (2006-2014)|Besturn B70]] or Hongqi C301.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:Mazda6 sedan.jpg|Pre-facelift Mazda6 sedan (US)\nFile:Mazda 6 2.0 2004 (14971577476).jpg|Pre-facelift Mazda6 sedan (Chile)\nFile:'03-'05 Mazda 6 Wagon V6.jpg|Pre-facelift Mazda6 wagon (Canada)\nFile:2005-2007 Mazda 6 (GG Series 2) Luxury Sports hatchback (2011-01-13).jpg|Facelift Mazda6 liftback \nFile:2006 Mazda6 TS 2.0 Front.jpg|Facelift Mazda6 liftback \nFile:2006 Mazda6 TS 2.0 Rear.jpg|Facelift Mazda6 liftback\nFile:06-08 Mazda6 sedan.jpg|Facelift Mazda6 sedan (US)\nFile:2004 Mazda 6 Sakata Interior (UK).jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n\n=== Mazda6 MPS ===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Mazda_Speed_6.jpg\n| name = Mazda6 MPS\n| aka = {{Plainlist|\n*Mazdaspeed 6\n*Mazdaspeed Atenza\n}}\n| manufacturer = [[Mazda]]\n| class = [[Mid-size car]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| production = 2005\u20132007\n| engine = 2.3&nbsp;L [[Mazda L engine#2.3L DISI Turbo (L3-VDT)|MZR L3-VDT]] Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) [[Turbocharger|turbo]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n| transmission = 6-speed A26MX-R [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2675|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1780|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1430|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1628|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| platform = [[Mazda G platform#GG|Mazda GG platform]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|F4 layout]]\n(Front-engine, four-wheel-drive)\n| assembly = [[Hofu, Yamaguchi]], Japan ([[Hofu (Mazda factory)|Hofu Plant]])<ref name=\"mazdaDomestic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mazda.com/profile/group/domestic_base.html|title=Major production facilities in Japan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229061815/http://www.mazda.com/profile/group/domestic_base.html|archivedate=2010-12-29}}</ref>\n| designer = Kaname Sawai (2003)\n}}\n[[File:Mazda 6 MPS (15350551995).jpg|thumb|left|Mazda 6 MPS (Australia)]]\nThe 2006 '''Mazdaspeed Atenza''' (known as ''Mazdaspeed6'' in North America and ''Mazda6 MPS'' in Europe, South Africa and Australia) is a high-performance version of the Mazda6. Its mission statement was written with the help of Peter Birtwhistle, chief of Mazda's advanced design studio in Germany at the time. It was initially unveiled as a concept at the [[2002 Paris Motor Show]]. It features a [[turbocharged]] version of the 2.3&nbsp;L [[Mazda MZR engine|MZR]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] which produces 272&nbsp;PS (200&nbsp;kW) (European version is detuned to 260&nbsp;PS (191&nbsp;kW); the North American version, at 274&nbsp;hp (204&nbsp;kW), revised to {{convert|270|hp|abbr=on|0}} for 2007). All models have {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. This 2.3&nbsp;L DISI turbocharged engine features [[gasoline direct injection|direct fuel injection]] and conforms to the new [[Euro 5]] emissions standards. It has a revised front fascia with a raised hood, a 6-speed manual transmission, and [[all-wheel drive]]. The all-wheel-drive system uses Mazda's ''Active Torque Split'' computer-based control, which routes between 100% of the power to the front and 50% to the rear wheels depending on driving conditions.\n\nOriginally scheduled to be launched in June 2005, the Mazdaspeed Atenza was delayed until November. In North America, the Mazdaspeed6 comes in two trim levels; the \"Sport\" trim with cloth interior and standard key entry and ignition; and the \"Grand Touring\" trim with leather interior, keyless entry/ignition, and an optional DVD navigation. Automatic climate control is standard, as is a 200&nbsp;W [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] stereo system featuring seven speakers and a 9-inch subwoofer in addition to an in-dash six-disc [[CD changer]]. A [[sunroof]] with [[moonroof]] feature is optional on the Grand Touring trim.\n\n''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine has achieved a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of 5.4 seconds for this vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/the-quickest-cars-of-2007-25000-to-30000-2007-mazdaspeed-6-page-6|title=2007 Mazdaspeed 6 \u2013 Feature|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Car and Driver|accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe Mazda6 was second place in the 2003 [[European Car of the Year]] awards and made ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 2003. The ''Sport Wagon'' won the [[Canadian Car of the Year]] ''Best New Station Wagon'' award, while the ''Sport'' sedan won the [[Canadian Car of the Year]] ''Best New Family Car'' award for 2005. The Atenza Wagon also won [[What Car?|What Car?'s]] ''Best Estate'' award in 2004. Also the Mazda6 won the 2003 [[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]].\n\nThe Mazda6 won the 'Best Mid-size Car (over $28,000)' title in Australia's Best Cars in 2002 and 2003. It came second in 2004, behind the [[Subaru Legacy|Subaru Liberty]], and fifth in 2005 (the [[Honda Accord Euro]] was first in 2005). Wheels magazine also awarded the Mazda6 winner of its Active Safety Program in July 2005. In December 2007 in Australia the Mazda6 won the Carsales Peoples Choice award for its class.\nThe Mazda6 also won \"Best Family Sedan\" in [[MotorWeek Drivers' Choice Awards|MotorWeek]]'s 2009 Driver's Choice Awards.\nThe Mazda 6 was praised for its edgy handsome design, communicative steering and tight suspension. However, as it was designed as a world car in order to fit the needs of Europe and Japan, it was smaller than its North American contemporaries in the midsize segment, being criticized for its reduced passenger space. Its acceleration, particularly the V6 engine models, lagged behind that of its rivals as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/mazda/mazda6/review.html |title=Mazda 6 Overview |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe hatchback's [[liftback]]/notchback styling was considered a clever design to disguise it as a four-door saloon, as North Americans generally considered trunks more elegant than hatches.

The significance of the capacitor system is that the capacitor can store in seconds enough energy to run the car electronics for about several minutes.<ref name=\"greencarreports.com\">{{cite web|author=Bengt Halvorson |url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1069924_mazda-improves-fuel-saving-start-stop-system-with-capacitors |title=Mazda Improves Fuel-Saving Start-Stop System With Capacitors |publisher=Greencarreports.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-16}}</ref>\n\nThe capacitor system offers large weight and space savings over batteries. i-ELOOP also achieves better gas mileage by disengaging the energy sapping alternator during acceleration, i-ELOOP is an innovative use of existing alternator waste energy in deceleration mode, which can happen more frequently than regenerative braking, common in hybrid cars.\n\ni-ELOOP is representative of the \"different\" thinking applied by Mazda engineers to age old problems.  While not the case now, it is possible that this type capacitor technology could become part of a suite of energy saving tools used in any type of car, electric, hybrid, etc., similar to the engine stop start technologies that are widely applied in cars today.<ref name=\"greencarreports.com\"/>\n\n=== 2018 facelift ===\n[[File:2018 Mazda6 Sport NAV+ Diesel 2.2 Front.jpg|thumb|left|Facelift (sedan)]]\n[[File:2018 Mazda6 Sport NAV+ Diesel 2.2 Rear.jpg|thumb|right|Facelift (sedan)]]\n[[File:2018 Mazda6 Estate facelift Rear.jpg |thumb|left|Facelift (wagon)]]\n\nA mid-cycle refresh for the 2018 Mazda6 was unveiled in November 2017 at the 2017 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]].

Ashley]].  First published in 1944, it was the culmination of over 11 years of work.  The book contains exactly 3854 numbered entries and an estimated 7000 illustrations.<ref name=\"abokdj\">{{Citation|last=Ashley|first=Clifford W.|title=The Ashley Book of Knots|origyear=1944|year=1993|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0-385-04025-3 | page=[[Dust jacket]]}}</ref> The entries include knot instructions, uses, and some histories, categorized by type or function.  It remains one of the most important and comprehensive books on knots.\n\n==Use as a reference==\nDue to its scope and wide availability, ''The Ashley Book of Knots'' has become a significant [[reference work]] in the field of knotting.  The numbers Ashley assigned to each knot can be used to unambiguously identify them. This helps to identify knots despite local colloquialisms or identification changes. Citations to Ashley numbers are usually in the form: \"[[Constrictor knot|The Constrictor Knot]] (ABOK #1249)\", \"ABOK #1249\" or even simply \"#1249\" if the context of the reference is clear or already established.<ref name=\"hsok\">{{Citation| last1=Warner| first1=Charles|last2=Turner|first2=John| author-link=| year=1996| editor-last=Turner| editor-first=J.C.| editor2-last=van de Griend| editor2-first=P.| title=History and Science of Knots| series=K&E Series on Knots and Everything| location=Singapore| publisher=World Scientific Publishing| volume=11| pages=22, 274\u2013275| isbn=981-02-2469-9}}</ref>\n\nSome knots have more than one Ashley number due to having multiple uses or forms.  For example, the main entry for #1249 is in the chapter on [[Binding (knot)|binding knots]] but it is also listed as #176 in a chapter on occupational knot usage.\n\n''The Ashley Book of Knots'' was compiled and first published before the introduction of [[synthetic fiber]] ropes, during a time when [[natural fiber]] cordage - typically twisted, laid, or braided rope - was most commonly used. The commentary on some knots may fail to address their behavior when tied with modern synthetic fiber or [[kernmantle rope|kernmantle]] style ropes.\n\n==Corrections and additions==\nAshley suffered a debilitating [[stroke]] the year after the book was published.<ref name=\"KM11\">{{Cite journal|editor1-last=Budworth|editor1-first=Geoffrey|journal=Knotting Matters|title=Profile of Knotsman Clifford W.

Ashley]].  First published in 1944, it was the culmination of over 11 years of work.  The book contains exactly 3854 numbered entries and an estimated 7000 illustrations.<ref name=\"abokdj\">{{Citation|last=Ashley|first=Clifford W.|title=The Ashley Book of Knots|origyear=1944|year=1993|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0-385-04025-3 | page=[[Dust jacket]]}}</ref> The entries include knot instructions, uses, and some histories, categorized by type or function.  It remains one of the most important and comprehensive books on knots.\n\n==Use as a reference==\nDue to its scope and wide availability, ''The Ashley Book of Knots'' has become a significant [[reference work]] in the field of knotting.  The numbers Ashley assigned to each knot can be used to unambiguously identify them. This helps to identify knots despite local colloquialisms or identification changes. Citations to Ashley numbers are usually in the form: \"[[Constrictor knot|The Constrictor Knot]] (ABOK #1249)\", \"ABOK #1249\" or even simply \"#1249\" if the context of the reference is clear or already established.<ref name=\"hsok\">{{Citation| last1=Warner| first1=Charles|last2=Turner|first2=John| author-link=| year=1996| editor-last=Turner| editor-first=J.C.| editor2-last=van de Griend| editor2-first=P.| title=History and Science of Knots| series=K&E Series on Knots and Everything| publication-place=Singapore| publisher=World Scientific Publishing| volume=11| pages=22, 274\u2013275| isbn=981-02-2469-9}}</ref>\n\nSome knots have more than one Ashley number due to having multiple uses or forms.  For example, the main entry for #1249 is in the chapter on [[Binding (knot)|binding knots]] but it is also listed as #176 in a chapter on occupational knot usage.\n\n''The Ashley Book of Knots'' was compiled and first published before the introduction of [[synthetic fiber]] ropes, during a time when [[natural fiber]] cordage - typically twisted, laid, or braided rope - was most commonly used. The commentary on some knots may fail to address their behavior when tied with modern synthetic fiber or [[kernmantle rope|kernmantle]] style ropes.\n\n==Corrections and additions==\nAshley suffered a debilitating [[stroke]] the year after the book was published.<ref name=\"KM11\">{{Cite journal|editor1-last=Budworth|editor1-first=Geoffrey|journal=Knotting Matters|title=Profile of Knotsman Clifford W.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

His father bought Asimov a used typewriter at age 16.{{r|nichols19690803}} His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.

Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters.

He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]].

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine.

Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8.

I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

His father bought Asimov a used typewriter at age 16.{{r|nichols19690803}} His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.\n\nThe robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\".

At the time, Asimov was preparing his own doctoral [[dissertation]], and for the oral examination to follow that. Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at [[Columbia University]], Asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym, yet it appeared under his own name. Asimov grew concerned at the scrutiny he would receive at his oral examination, in case the examiners thought he wasn't taking science seriously. At the end of the examination, one evaluator turned to him, smiling, and said, \"What can you tell us, Mr. Asimov, about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline\".

The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], then at the height of their career. Intrigued by the idea, although he was not generally a fan of rock music, Asimov quickly produced a \"treatment\" or brief outline of the story. He adhered to McCartney's overall idea, producing a story he felt to be moving and dramatic. However, he did not make use of McCartney's brief scrap of dialogue, and probably as a consequence, McCartney rejected the story.

Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 [[fix-up]] novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out.

He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher.

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter).

I'll write as I please and let the critics do the analyzing.|Asimov, 1973{{r|asimov1973}}}}\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nAsimov was his own secretary, typist, [[index (publishing)|index]]er, [[proofreader]], and [[literary agent]].{{r|nichols19690803}} He wrote a typed first draft composed at the keyboard at 90 words per minute; he imagined an ending first, then a beginning, then \"let everything in-between work itself out as I come to it\". (Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are.

In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]].

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model.

It is a prequel and spin-off of Gilligan's prior series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', set in the early 2000s. The series follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill ([[Bob Odenkirk]]), beginning six years before the events of ''Breaking Bad'' and showing his transformation into the persona of criminal for hire [[Saul Goodman]]. McGill becomes the lawyer for former police officer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), whose skills allow him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The show premiered on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] on February 8, 2015. The fifth season premiered on February 23, 2020, and a sixth and final season is scheduled to air in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thorne |first=Will |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-renewed-final-season-1203470181/ |title='Better Call Saul' Renewed for 6th and Final Season at AMC |work=Variety |date=January 16, 2020 |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMcGill is initially working as a low-paid lawyer with the back room of a nail salon as his home and office. His friend and romantic interest [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) works as a lawyer at the firm of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), where she and Jimmy once worked in the mailroom. Partners at HHM include Jimmy's nemesis [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) and his brother [[Chuck McGill]] ([[Michael McKean]]). Ehrmantraut conducts illegal drug distribution with [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) who runs a fast food restaurant as a business front. Their operations are disrupted by members of the Salamanca crime family, including [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]). Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito all reprise their roles from ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n''Better Call Saul'' has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters, and cinematography; many critics have called it a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'' and one of the best prequels ever made, with some deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"sallgoodman\">{{cite web |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title='S'all good, man': How Better Call Saul became superior to Breaking Bad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/11/sall-good-man-how-better-call-saul-became-superior-to-breaking-bad |website=The Guardian |date=October 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/better-call-saul-breaking-bad-vince-gilligan |title=The perfect prequel: how Better Call Saul left Breaking Bad in its dust |work=The Guardian |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Julia |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/04/18/better_call_saul_is_better_than_breaking_bad.html |title=Better Call Saul Is Better Than Breaking Bad |work=Slate |date=April 18, 2016 |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref> It has garnered many nominations, including a [[Peabody Award]], 23 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], eleven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]], five [[Critics' Choice Television Awards]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

Jimmy's work is frequently overshadowed by Chuck's, and he struggles to prove himself with the help of firm associate [[Kim Wexler]], with whom he also becomes romantically involved. At the same time, Jimmy takes care of Chuck, who claims to have [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], a condition that makes him physically ill in the presence of anything with an electrical component and has caused him to take an extended leave from his firm, a choice that the firm's lead partner Howard Hamlin struggles with. Over the course of the show, Jimmy is shown to switch from his earnest and honest personality as Jimmy to the fast-talking \"Saul Goodman\" showman (the name based on the phrase \"[It]'s all good, man!\") as he becomes more engaged in unethical and criminal activities.\n\nInterspersed among Jimmy's activities are the histories of other ''Breaking Bad'' characters, including [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], a former police officer who becomes involved in illegal drug trafficking schemes to protect his daughter-in-law and granddaughter, and drug kingpins Hector Salamanca and [[Gus Fring]], who are in a highly-unstable agreement to share the distribution of [[cocaine]] from the Mexican cartel in the region. In the latter, [[Ignacio Varga|Ignacio \"Nacho\" Varga]], an intelligent high-level enforcer in the Salamanca gang, finds himself pulled by loyalties to both sides while also trying to protect his father's business.\n\nThe series also provides brief glimpses of McGill's fate after the events of \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\", the penultimate episode of ''Breaking Bad'' in which McGill (calling himself Saul Goodman) fears for his own safety and takes on a new identity in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] as Gene Takovic, the manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.\n\nThe fourth season features scenes taking place closer to the time of events in ''Breaking Bad'', which was set in 2008; co-creator Vince Gilligan explains that the story line \"brings us into the world\u2026 of Walter White and the territory of Walter White\".<ref name=\"ew bbscenes\"/> In \"[[Quite a Ride]]\", the [[cold open]] takes place concurrent to events near the end of ''Breaking Bad'', with Jimmy as Saul destroying documents and taking money from the Saul Goodman office made memorable in that series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/03/better-call-saul-bob-odenkirk-breaking-bad-scene/ |title=Better Call Saul star Bob Odenkirk breaks down THAT Breaking Bad-era scene |first=Dan |last=Snierson |date=September 3, 2018 |accessdate=September 3, 2018 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|align=right|total_width=300\n|image1=Vince_Gilligan_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg\n|image2=Peter Gould by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n|footer=''Better Call Saul'' was developed by [[Vince Gilligan]] (left) and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n}}\n[[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] began planning a [[television spinoff]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as early as 2009.

The staff did not expect these events to come to fruition, but after they did, they started considering a spin-off featuring Saul as a thought experiment.

Jimmy cares for his brother Chuck, who is housebound without electricity because he believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. While pursuing an elder law career, Jimmy discovers clients being defrauded by the Sandpiper retirement home and begins a class action lawsuit with Chuck. When the case grows, Chuck suggests giving it to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out. The case continues growing and HHM brings on Davis & Main. Unhappy at Howard's treatment of him, Kim recommends Jimmy to D&M.\n\n=== Season 2 (2016) ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy works at D&M but quits after being reprimanded for his client outreach methods. Kim is demoted because of Jimmy's actions. To reclaim her status, she secures Mesa Verde Bank as a client for HHM but Howard denies her credit. Kim quits at HHM, and she and Jimmy begin separate private practices in a shared office. Jimmy secretly causes Chuck to make an error that delays a new branch construction, so Mesa Verde drops HHM to hire Kim. Nacho hires Mike to remove Tuco from the Salamanca organization. Mike goads Tuco into fighting and Tuco is imprisoned. Hector is suspicious so Mike prepares to assassinate him but is interrupted.\n\n=== Season 3 (2017) ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck discovers Jimmy's fraud and tricks him into confessing, leading to suspension of Jimmy's law license. Chuck's ouster at HHM leads to his suicide.  Gus stops Mike from killing Hector. Mike attacks Hector's trucks and steals $250,000 from one. Mike asks for help laundering the money. Gus arranges for Mike's hire as a contracted security expert at Madrigal and payment of monthly consulting fees. Hector plans to take over Manuel's business so Nacho attempts to kill Hector by changing his angina medication for a placebo. Hector suffers a stroke and Gus\u2019 first aid saves him, though he remains comatose.\n\n=== Season 4 (2018) ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy regains his outgoing demeanor after Howard shoulders blame for Chuck's death. Jimmy manages a cell phone store but makes more reselling prepaid phones. His reinstatement request is denied over lack of remorse for Chuck. After faking mourning, he successfully appeals, but reveals he is going to practice as Saul Goodman. Gus learns Nacho attempted to kill Hector and blackmails him into undermining the Salamancas. Mike escorts engineers who evaluate the laundry's potential as a meth lab and Gus hires Werner to oversee construction. Hector recovers mentally and can move his right index finger. Lalo Salamanca arrives to run Hector's business.\n\n===Season 5 (2020)===\n{{main|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to Kim's dismay.

Gould]]. It is a prequel and spin-off of Gilligan's prior series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', set in the early 2000s. The series follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill ([[Bob Odenkirk]]), beginning six years before the events of ''Breaking Bad'' and showing his transformation into the persona of criminal for hire [[Saul Goodman]]. McGill becomes the lawyer for former police officer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), whose skills allow him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The show premiered on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] on February 8, 2015. The fifth season premiered on February 23, 2020, and a sixth and final season is scheduled to air in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thorne |first=Will |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-renewed-final-season-1203470181/ |title='Better Call Saul' Renewed for 6th and Final Season at AMC |work=Variety |date=January 16, 2020 |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMcGill is initially working as a low-paid lawyer with the back room of a nail salon as his home and office. His friend and romantic interest [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) works as a lawyer at the firm of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), where she and Jimmy once worked in the mailroom. Partners at HHM include Jimmy's nemesis [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) and his brother [[Chuck McGill]] ([[Michael McKean]]). Ehrmantraut conducts illegal drug distribution with [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) who runs a fast food restaurant as a business front. Their operations are disrupted by members of the Salamanca crime family, including [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]). Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito all reprise their roles from ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n''Better Call Saul'' has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters, and cinematography; many critics have called it a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'' and one of the best prequels ever made, with some deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"sallgoodman\">{{cite web |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title='S'all good, man': How Better Call Saul became superior to Breaking Bad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/11/sall-good-man-how-better-call-saul-became-superior-to-breaking-bad |website=The Guardian |date=October 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/better-call-saul-breaking-bad-vince-gilligan |title=The perfect prequel: how Better Call Saul left Breaking Bad in its dust |work=The Guardian |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Julia |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/04/18/better_call_saul_is_better_than_breaking_bad.html |title=Better Call Saul Is Better Than Breaking Bad |work=Slate |date=April 18, 2016 |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref> It has garnered many nominations, including a [[Peabody Award]], 23 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], eleven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]], five [[Critics' Choice Television Awards]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

Jimmy's work is frequently overshadowed by Chuck's, and he struggles to prove himself with the help of firm associate [[Kim Wexler]], with whom he also becomes romantically involved. At the same time, Jimmy takes care of Chuck, who claims to have [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], a condition that makes him physically ill in the presence of anything with an electrical component and has caused him to take an extended leave from his firm, a choice that the firm's lead partner Howard Hamlin struggles with. Over the course of the show, Jimmy is shown to switch from his earnest and honest personality as Jimmy to the fast-talking \"Saul Goodman\" showman (the name based on the phrase \"[It]'s all good, man!\") as he becomes more engaged in unethical and criminal activities.\n\nInterspersed among Jimmy's activities are the histories of other ''Breaking Bad'' characters, including [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], a former police officer who becomes involved in illegal drug trafficking schemes to protect his daughter-in-law and granddaughter, and drug kingpins Hector Salamanca and [[Gus Fring]], who are in a highly-unstable agreement to share the distribution of [[cocaine]] from the Mexican cartel in the region. In the latter, [[Ignacio Varga|Ignacio \"Nacho\" Varga]], an intelligent high-level enforcer in the Salamanca gang, finds himself pulled by loyalties to both sides while also trying to protect his father's business.\n\nThe series also provides brief glimpses of McGill's fate after the events of \"[[Granite State (Breaking Bad)|Granite State]]\", the penultimate episode of ''Breaking Bad'' in which McGill (calling himself Saul Goodman) fears for his own safety and takes on a new identity in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] as Gene Takovic, the manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.\n\nThe fourth season features scenes taking place closer to the time of events in ''Breaking Bad'', which was set in 2008; co-creator Vince Gilligan explains that the story line \"brings us into the world\u2026 of Walter White and the territory of Walter White\".<ref name=\"ew bbscenes\"/> In \"[[Quite a Ride]]\", the [[cold open]] takes place concurrent to events near the end of ''Breaking Bad'', with Jimmy as Saul destroying documents and taking money from the Saul Goodman office made memorable in that series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/09/03/better-call-saul-bob-odenkirk-breaking-bad-scene/ |title=Better Call Saul star Bob Odenkirk breaks down THAT Breaking Bad-era scene |first=Dan |last=Snierson |date=September 3, 2018 |accessdate=September 3, 2018 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|align=right|total_width=300\n|image1=Vince_Gilligan_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg\n|image2=Peter Gould by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n|footer=''Better Call Saul'' was developed by [[Vince Gilligan]] (left) and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n}}\n[[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] began planning a [[television spinoff]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as early as 2009.

The staff did not expect these events to come to fruition, but after they did, they started considering a spin-off featuring Saul as a thought experiment.

Jimmy cares for his brother Chuck, who is housebound without electricity because he believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. While pursuing an elder law career, Jimmy discovers clients being defrauded by the Sandpiper retirement home and begins a class action lawsuit with Chuck. When the case grows, Chuck suggests giving it to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out. The case continues growing and HHM brings on Davis & Main. Unhappy at Howard's treatment of him, Kim recommends Jimmy to D&M.\n\n=== Season 2 (2016) ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy works at D&M but quits after being reprimanded for his client outreach methods. Kim is demoted because of Jimmy's actions. To reclaim her status, she secures Mesa Verde Bank as a client for HHM but Howard denies her credit. Kim quits at HHM, and she and Jimmy begin separate private practices in a shared office. Jimmy secretly causes Chuck to make an error that delays a new branch construction, so Mesa Verde drops HHM to hire Kim. Nacho hires Mike to remove Tuco from the Salamanca organization. Mike goads Tuco into fighting and Tuco is imprisoned. Hector is suspicious so Mike prepares to assassinate him but is interrupted.\n\n=== Season 3 (2017) ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck discovers Jimmy's fraud and tricks him into confessing, leading to suspension of Jimmy's law license. Chuck's ouster at HHM leads to his suicide.  Gus stops Mike from killing Hector. Mike attacks Hector's trucks and steals $250,000 from one. Mike asks for help laundering the money. Gus arranges for Mike's hire as a contracted security expert at Madrigal and payment of monthly consulting fees. Hector plans to take over Manuel's business so Nacho attempts to kill Hector by changing his angina medication for a placebo. Hector suffers a stroke and Gus\u2019 first aid saves him, though he remains comatose.\n\n=== Season 4 (2018) ===\n{{main|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy regains his outgoing demeanor after Howard shoulders blame for Chuck's death. Jimmy manages a cell phone store but makes more reselling prepaid phones. His reinstatement request is denied over lack of remorse for Chuck. After faking mourning, he successfully appeals, but reveals he is going to practice as Saul Goodman. Gus learns Nacho attempted to kill Hector and blackmails him into undermining the Salamancas. Mike escorts engineers who evaluate the laundry's potential as a meth lab and Gus hires Werner to oversee construction. Hector recovers mentally and can move his right index finger. Lalo Salamanca arrives to run Hector's business.\n\n===Season 5 (2020)===\n{{main|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nThe season shows the progression of Jimmy, having regained his law license after a year's suspension, into the character of Saul Goodman, much to Kim's dismay.

In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''.

First, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created. In 1977 the football section was separated from the club and incorporated into [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Coal Mine|KWB Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''. In 1994, the club advanced to Polish league II, and in 1997 to league I \"B\" series. In 1999, it was promoted to series \"A\", but after a year it fell back down to series \"B\" again.\n\nIn 2001, the club led by [[Wies\u0142aw Czaja]] was promoted to [[PlusLiga]]. In their first season there - 2001/2002 - the team achieved the bronze medal in the Polish Men's Volleyball Championship, defeating [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]] after three matches.
