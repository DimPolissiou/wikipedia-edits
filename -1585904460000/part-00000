Located at the wedge-shaped waterfront reclaimed land west of [[Yau Ma Tei]], the district will feature a new museum of visual culture, numerous theatres, concert halls and other performance venues under the management of the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority, which is directly financed by the government with an upfront endowment of HK$21.6 billion for construction and operation.<ref>http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr07-08/chinese/fc/pwsc/papers/p08-31c.pdf</ref>\n\nThe West Kowloon Cultural District is the largest arts and cultural project in Hong Kong to date.

The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad V\u00e1hom]] near [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Z\u00e1kovsk\u00e1, Podkovice, Hubina, and Rado\u0161ina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[\u0160pania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.\n\n[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br/>Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]\n\nAfter the disappearance of the \u010cakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n\n==== Hallstatt Period ====\nThe arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sere\u010f]]) and in the hill forts like Molp\u00edr, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.\n\nA special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the \"Princes\" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.\n\n==== La T\u00e8ne Period ====\nFrom around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Dev\u00edn]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[P\u00fachov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the \"Velkobysterecky\" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].\n\n==== Roman Period ====\n[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] (178\u2013179 AD)]]\nFrom 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Sz\u0151ny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Dev\u00edn Castle]] (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of D\u00fabravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.\n\nNear the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8\u20136&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.\n\n=== Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries ===\nIn the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].\n\nIn 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant.<ref name=\"T\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Kronol\u00f3gia\">{{cite book|last=Benda|first=K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja ''(\"The Historical Chronology of Hungary\")''|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Krist\u00f3, p.30\u201331</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.\n\n=== Slavic states ===\nThe [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century. Western Slovakia was the centre of [[Samo]]'s empire in the 7th century. A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828.

Eventually this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with Germany. The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in Slovakia and Ruthenia.

Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop\u201440 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|C}} (less in the mountains).\n\nAutumn in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|C}}, in November to {{convert|3|C}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called Indian Summer).\n\nWinter starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C}}. In December and January it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it changes into the thaw and frost.

The education system consists of elementary school which is divided into two parts, the first grade (age 6\u201310) and the second grade (age 10\u201315) which is finished by taking nationwide testing called Monitor, from Slovak language and math. Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present at the first grade of elementary school.\n\nAfter finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.\n\nAfter finishing high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919. Although it's not the first university ever established on Slovak territory, it's the oldest university that is still running. Most universities in Slovakia are public funded, where anyone can apply. Every citizen has a right to free education in public schools.\n\nSlovakia has several privately funded universities, however public universities consistently score better in the ranking than their private counterparts. Universities have different criteria for accepting students. Anyone can apply to any number of universities.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Slovakia}}\n[[File:Vlkolinec 02.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden folk architecture can be seen in the well preserved village of [[Vlkol\u00ednec]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]\n\n=== Folk tradition ===\n{{See also|Music of Slovakia}}\n[[File:Carpathian Bazaar of Tastes, Sanok 2010 97.JPG|thumb|[[Slovaks]] wearing [[folk costume]]s from [[Eastern Slovakia]]]]\n[[Folk tradition]] has rooted strongly in Slovakia and is reflected in literature, music, dance and architecture. The prime example is a Slovak national anthem, ''\"[[Nad Tatrou sa bl\u00fdska]]\"'', which is based on a melody from ''\"[[Kopala studienku]]\"'' folk song.\n\nManifestation of Slovak folklore culture is the \"''V\u00fdchodn\u00e1''\" Folklore Festival.

The legend says he was taking from the rich and giving to the poor. J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk's life was depicted in a list of literature works and many movies throughout the 20th century. One of the most popular is a [[film]] ''J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk'' directed by [[Martin Fri\u010d]] in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|title=J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk movie on Czechoslovak Film Database|year=1935|url=http://www.csfd.cz/film/3113-janosik/}}</ref>\n\n=== Art ===\n[[File:St. James, Levo\u010da, Main altar, 2017 v2.jpg|thumb|right|Main altar in Basilica of St. James from the workshop of [[Master Paul of Levo\u010da]], highest wooden altar in the world, 1517]]\n\n[[Visual art]] in Slovakia is represented through [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[printmaking]], [[illustration]], [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]] or [[conceptual art]].

Low, Son, & Marston |location=|isbn=|page=1020}}</ref> The worldly literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period.\n\nThere were two leading persons who codified the Slovak language. The first was [[Anton Bernol\u00e1k]] whose concept was based on the western Slovak [[dialect]] in 1787. It was the codification of the first ever literary language of Slovaks. The second was [[\u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far]], whose formation of the Slovak language took principles from the central Slovak dialect in 1843.\n\nSlovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include [[Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik|Pavol Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik]], [[Matthias Bel|Matej Bel]], [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]], and its political revolutionaries and reformists, such [[Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik]] and [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Slovak cuisine}}\n{{See also|Slovak wine|Beer in Slovakia}}\n[[File:Halusky kapustnica.jpg|thumb|[[Halu\u0161ky]] with [[bryndza]] cheese, [[Sourkrawt|kapustnica]] soup and Zlat\u00fd Ba\u017eant dark beer\u2014examples of Slovak cuisine]]\n\nTraditional Slovak cuisine is based mainly on [[pork]], [[poultry]] ([[chicken]] is the most widely eaten, followed by [[duck]], [[goose]], and [[Turkey as food|turkey]]), [[flour]], [[potato]]es, [[cabbage]], and [[milk products]]. It is relatively closely related to [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]], [[Polish cuisine|Polish]] and [[Austrian cuisine]].

Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterised by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.\n\nA typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup (\"kapustnica\"). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called \"krvavnica\", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific Slovak meal.\n\nWine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or ros\u00e9 (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Slovakia}}\nSporting activities are practised widely in Slovakia, many of them on a professional level.

Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3\u20132 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k (footballer, born 1954)|J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k]]. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Ko\u0161ice]] in [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|1997\u201398]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], and [[M\u0160K \u017dilina]] in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League|2010\u201311]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage.

The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]] bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad V\u00e1hom]] near [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Z\u00e1kovsk\u00e1, Podkovice, Hubina, and Rado\u0161ina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Central Europe]].\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\nDuring the [[Bronze Age]], the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[\u0160pania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.\n\n[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br/>Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]\n\nAfter the disappearance of the \u010cakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n\n==== Hallstatt Period ====\nThe arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sere\u010f]]) and in the hill forts like Molp\u00edr, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. Common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries.\n\nA special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the \"Princes\" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught the interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.\n\n==== La T\u00e8ne Period ====\nFrom around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Dev\u00edn]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[P\u00fachov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the \"Velkobysterecky\" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].\n\n==== Roman Period ====\n[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] (178\u2013179 AD)]]\nFrom 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Sz\u0151ny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]]. The remains of Roman buildings have also survived in [[Dev\u00edn Castle]] (present-day downtown Bratislava), the suburbs of D\u00fabravka and Stupava, and Bratislava Castle Hill.\n\nNear the northernmost line of the Roman hinterlands, the [[Limes Romanus]], there existed the winter camp of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn|Laugaricio]] (modern-day [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]]) where the Auxiliary of Legion&nbsp;II fought and prevailed in a decisive battle over the Germanic [[Quadi]] tribe in 179&nbsp;CE during the [[Marcomannic Wars]]. The Kingdom of [[Vannius]], a kingdom founded by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]]an tribes of [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]], as well as several small Germanic and [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribes]], including the Osi and [[Cotini]], existed in western and central Slovakia from 8\u20136&nbsp;BCE to 179&nbsp;CE.\n\n=== Great invasions from the 4th to 7th centuries ===\nIn the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, the [[Huns]] began to leave the Central Asian steppes. They crossed the Danube in 377&nbsp;AD and occupied [[Pannonia]], which they used for 75&nbsp;years as their base for launching looting-raids into Western Europe. However, Attila's death in 453 brought about the disappearance of the Hun tribe. In 568, a Turko-Mongol tribal confederacy, the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], conducted its own invasion into the Middle Danube region. The Avars occupied the lowlands of the [[Pannonian Plain]], and established an empire dominating the [[Pannonian Basin|Carpathian Basin]].\n\nIn 623, the Slavic population living in the western parts of Pannonia seceded from their empire after a revolution led by [[Samo]], a Frankish merchant.<ref name=\"T\u00f6rt\u00e9neti Kronol\u00f3gia\">{{cite book|last=Benda|first=K\u00e1lm\u00e1n|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja ''(\"The Historical Chronology of Hungary\")''|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|year=1981|location=Budapest|page=44|isbn=963-05-2661-1}}</ref> After 626, the Avar power started a gradual decline<ref>Krist\u00f3, p.30\u201331</ref> but its reign lasted to 804.\n\n=== Slavic states ===\nThe [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes settled in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th century.

A Slavic state known as the [[Principality of Nitra]] arose in the 8th century and its ruler [[Pribina]] had the first known Christian church of the territory of present-day Slovakia consecrated by 828. Together with neighbouring [[Moravia]], the principality formed the core of the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire from 833.

Eventually this pressure led to the [[Munich Agreement]] of September 1938, which allowed the majority ethnic Germans in the [[Sudetenland]], borderlands of Czechoslovakia, to join with Germany. The remaining minorities stepped up their pressures for autonomy and the State became federalised, with Diets in Slovakia and Ruthenia.

Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop\u201440 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|C}} (less in the mountains).\n\nAutumn in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|C}}, in November to {{convert|3|C}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called Indian Summer).\n\nWinter starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C}}. In December and January it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it changes into the thaw and frost.

The education system consists of elementary school which is divided into two parts, the first grade (age 6\u201310) and the second grade (age 10\u201315) which is finished by taking nationwide testing called Monitor, from Slovak language and math. Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present at the first grade of elementary school.\n\nAfter finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.\n\nAfter finishing high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919. Although it's not the first university ever established on Slovak territory, it's the oldest university that is still running. Most universities in Slovakia are public funded, where anyone can apply. Every citizen has a right to free education in public schools.\n\nSlovakia has several privately funded universities, however public universities consistently score better in the ranking than their private counterparts. Universities have different criteria for accepting students. Anyone can apply to any number of universities.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Slovakia}}\n[[File:Vlkolinec 02.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden folk architecture can be seen in the well preserved village of [[Vlkol\u00ednec]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]\n\n=== Folk tradition ===\n{{See also|Music of Slovakia}}\n[[File:Carpathian Bazaar of Tastes, Sanok 2010 97.JPG|thumb|[[Slovaks]] wearing [[folk costume]]s from [[Eastern Slovakia]]]]\n[[Folk tradition]] has rooted strongly in Slovakia and is reflected in literature, music, dance and architecture. The prime example is a Slovak national anthem, ''\"[[Nad Tatrou sa bl\u00fdska]]\"'', which is based on a melody from ''\"[[Kopala studienku]]\"'' folk song.\n\nManifestation of Slovak folklore culture is the \"''V\u00fdchodn\u00e1''\" Folklore Festival.

The legend says he was taking from the rich and giving to the poor. J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk's life was depicted in a list of literature works and many movies throughout the 20th century. One of the most popular is a [[film]] ''J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk'' directed by [[Martin Fri\u010d]] in 1935.<ref>{{cite web|title=J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk movie on Czechoslovak Film Database|year=1935|url=http://www.csfd.cz/film/3113-janosik/}}</ref>\n\n=== Art ===\n[[File:St. James, Levo\u010da, Main altar, 2017 v2.jpg|thumb|right|Main altar in Basilica of St. James from the workshop of [[Master Paul of Levo\u010da]], highest wooden altar in the world, 1517]]\n\n[[Visual art]] in Slovakia is represented through [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[printmaking]], [[illustration]], [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]], [[sculpture]], [[photography]] or [[conceptual art]].

Low, Son, & Marston |location=|isbn=|page=1020}}</ref> The worldly literature also emerged and chronicles were written in this period.\n\nThere were two leading persons who codified the Slovak language. The first was [[Anton Bernol\u00e1k]] whose concept was based on the western Slovak [[dialect]] in 1787. It was the codification of the first ever literary language of Slovaks. The second was [[\u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far]], whose formation of the Slovak language took principles from the central Slovak dialect in 1843.\n\nSlovakia is also known for its polyhistors, of whom include [[Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik|Pavol Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik]], [[Matthias Bel|Matej Bel]], [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]], and its political revolutionaries and reformists, such [[Milan Rastislav \u0160tef\u00e1nik]] and [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Slovak cuisine}}\n{{See also|Slovak wine|Beer in Slovakia}}\n[[File:Halusky kapustnica.jpg|thumb|[[Halu\u0161ky]] with [[bryndza]] cheese, [[Sourkrawt|kapustnica]] soup and Zlat\u00fd Ba\u017eant dark beer\u2014examples of Slovak cuisine]]\n\nTraditional Slovak cuisine is based mainly on [[pork]], [[poultry]] ([[chicken]] is the most widely eaten, followed by [[duck]], [[goose]], and [[Turkey as food|turkey]]), [[flour]], [[potato]]es, [[cabbage]], and [[milk products]]. It is relatively closely related to [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]] and [[Austrian cuisine]].

Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterised by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.\n\nA typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup (\"kapustnica\"). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called \"krvavnica\", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific Slovak meal.\n\nWine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or ros\u00e9 (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Slovakia}}\nSporting activities are practised widely in Slovakia, many of them on a professional level.

Association football is the most popular sport in Slovakia.]]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3\u20132 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k (footballer, born 1954)|J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k]]. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Ko\u0161ice]] in [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|1997\u201398]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], and [[M\u0160K \u017dilina]] in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League|2010\u201311]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage.

In 1967, the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] changed the word ''nigger'' to ''Negro'' in 143 place names.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nIn [[West Texas]], \"Dead Nigger Creek\" was renamed \"[[Dead Negro Draw]]\";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/rbd17 |title=Dead Negro Draw |work=Handbook of Texas Online|accessdate=February 19, 2010}}</ref> both names probably commemorate the [[Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/46531169/ns/us_news-life/t/negro-creek-wop-draw-place-names-offend/#.VNWEIe7WhqU | title=From Negro Creek to Wop Draw, place names offend | publisher=NBC News | date=February 26, 2012 | accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref> [[Curtis Island (Maine)|Curtis Island]] in [[Maine]] used to be known as either Negro<ref>Island chronicler Charles McLane says \"Curtis Island was known as Negro Island from Revolutionary Times to the 1930s ...\" {{Cite book | last1 =McLane |first1 = Charles B. | last2 = McLane  |first2 = Carol Evarts | title = Islands of the Mid-Maine Coast | publisher =Tilbury House; Island Institute | volume = I  | year =1997  | location =  Gardiner, ME; Rockland, ME | page =124 | isbn =978-0-88448-184-3 }}</ref> or Nigger Island.<ref>An early postcard shows it as \"Nigger Island.\" cf.{{cite web | url =http://www.cardcow.com/47187/nigger-island-light-house-camden-maine/  | title = CardCow.com Postcard Sale site | author =CardCow.com| work = Nigger Island Lighthouse, Camden Maine | accessdate =April 17, 2012 }}</ref> The island was renamed in 1934 after Cyrus H.
