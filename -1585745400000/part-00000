It is the next suburb south from [[Moseley]] on the [[A435 road|A435, Alcester road]].\n\n==History==\nKings Heath came into being as a village in the 18th century when improvements to the [[Alcester]] to [[Birmingham]] road acted as a catalyst for the development of new houses and farms. Prior to this, the area was largely uninhabited wasteland run by the Royal Borough of [[Kings Norton]].\n\nThe streets running off High Street are dominated by pre-1919 terraced, owner-occupied housing.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nA number of independent shops have taken advantage of comparatively cheap rents in the side roads off High Street, leading to an influx of boutiques and the start of an (organic) [[coffee culture|caf\u00e9 culture]]. In 2008, the businesses agreed to establish a [[Business Improvement District]], which top-slices a proportion of their local business taxes to go directly into improvements and promotion of the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.enjoykingsheath.com/the-business-plan-for-2018-2023-kings-heath-bid.html |title=The Business Plan for 2018\u20132023 Kings Heath BID |date=June 2019 |work=Enjoy Kings Heath |access-date=6 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe local community still refers to Kings Heath as a \"village\" even though it has been part of Birmingham for over a century.

He was excluded and bullied constantly (see Keith Richards, ''Life'', 2010, p. 55). Disadvantaged and depressed, he failed selective 11-plus exams but was subsequently educated at each of the three South London state schools (Modern, Technical and Grammar) used for BBC's documentary: 'Who will Get In?' (2018). Then he was an undergraduate at [[University of Durham|Durham]] University (elected chairman of the students' council and of the Standing Congress of Northern Student Unions) and later a student at [[University of Bath|Bath]], he got research degrees in science as well as arts, a PhD and the higher doctorate, [[D. Litt.]], [[University of Durham|Dunelm]]. He met Averil Birch, sometime Head Girl of [[Tiffin School]] now chairman of the Durham students' council, whom he later married and she had three children.\n\nMichael Swanton first taught ''Beowulf'' at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], then [[Linguistics]] at [[University of Giessen|Justus Liebig Universit\u00e4t, Giessen]] in Germany and [[Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne]] in Switzerland, and finally Medieval Studies at [[University of Exeter|Exeter]], where he also acted as the university's [[Public Orator]] for several years. During the 1960s\u201370s he served as Honorary Editor of the UK's Royal Archaeological Institute. In 1975 he founded the Exeter Medieval Texts & Studies series (seventy-nine titles to 2020). Reckoned an authority on Anglo-Saxon England, he was elected [[Fellow]] of both the [[Royal Historical Society]] and of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. In retirement, he remains [[Emeritus Fellow]] of The Royal Historical Society and [[Emeritus Professor]] of Medieval Studies at Exeter University. He now lives in Devon, writing under noms de plume.<ref name=\"mp\"/>\n\nHis own range of scholarly publications included translations of ''[[Beowulf]]'', the ''[[Gesta Herewardi]]'' (a life of [[Hereward the Wake]]), the ''[[Vitae duorum Offarum]]'' (''The Lives of Two Offas''), and ''[[The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' as well as books on early English literature, art, architecture, and [[archaeology]].\n\n== Publications==\n[[File:Professor Michael Swanton at the publication of his book The Lives of Two Offas.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Professor Swanton holds a glass of wine in one hand and a copy of his book 'The Lives of Two Offas' in the other, at the launch of the book.|Professor Swanton at the publication of 'The Lives of Two Offas', 2010]]\n*1968-75:  Ed.

Swanton as Student Chairman.|Student Chairman, 1962\u20133\nUniversity Diary ''frontis''.]]\n\n'''Michael James Swanton''' is a British polymath, author and academic: historian, linguist, archaeologist and [[literary critic]] specialising in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its Old English literature.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn a [[Cockney]] at the outbreak of World War II, Michael emerged from ''blitz''-stricken London dockland epileptic and somewhat deformed. He was excluded and bullied constantly (see Keith Richards, ''Life'', 2010, p. 55). Disadvantaged and depressed, he failed selective 11-plus exams but was subsequently educated at each of the three South London state schools (Modern, Technical and Grammar) used for BBC's documentary: 'Who will Get In?' (2018). Then he was an undergraduate at the [[University of Durham|Durham]] (elected chairman of the students' council and of the Standing Congress of Northern Student Unions) and later a student at [[University of Bath|Bath]], he got research degrees in science as well as arts, a PhD and the higher doctorate, [[D. Litt.]], [[University of Durham|Dunelm]]. He met Averil Birch, sometime Head Girl of [[Tiffin School]] now chairman of the Durham students' council, whom he later married and she had three children.\n\nMichael Swanton first taught ''Beowulf'' at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], then [[Linguistics]] at [[University of Giessen|Justus Liebig Universit\u00e4t, Giessen]] in Germany and [[Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne]] in Switzerland, and finally Medieval Studies at [[University of Exeter|Exeter]], where he also acted as the university's [[Public Orator]] for several years. During the 1960s\u201370s he served as Honorary Editor of the UK's Royal Archaeological Institute. In 1975 he founded the Exeter Medieval Texts & Studies series (seventy-nine titles to 2020). Reckoned an authority on Anglo-Saxon England, he was elected [[Fellow]] of both the [[Royal Historical Society]] and of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]. In retirement, he remains [[Emeritus Fellow]] of The Royal Historical Society and [[Emeritus Professor]] of Medieval Studies at Exeter University. He now lives in Devon, writing under noms de plume.<ref name=\"mp\"/>\n\nHis own range of scholarly publications included translations of ''[[Beowulf]]'', the ''[[Gesta Herewardi]]'' (a life of [[Hereward the Wake]]), the ''[[Vitae duorum Offarum]]'' (''The Lives of Two Offas''), and ''[[The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' as well as books on early English literature, art, architecture, and [[archaeology]].\n\n== Publications==\n[[File:Professor Michael Swanton at the publication of his book The Lives of Two Offas.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Professor Swanton holds a glass of wine in one hand and a copy of his book 'The Lives of Two Offas' in the other, at the launch of the book.|Professor Swanton at the publication of 'The Lives of Two Offas', 2010]]\n*1968-75:  Ed.

At that time only around 11% of adult males had the vote, very few of them in the industrial north which was worst hit, and reformers identified parliamentary reform as the solution. A mass campaign to petition parliament for manhood suffrage gained three-quarters of a million signatures in 1817 but was flatly rejected by the House of Commons.  When a second slump occurred in early 1819, radical reformers sought to mobilise huge crowds to force government to back down. The movement was particularly strong in the north-west of England, where the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a mass rally in August 1819 addressed by well-known radical orator [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]].\n\nShortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the [[Manchester and Salford Yeomanry]] to arrest Hunt and several others on the platform with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehended Hunt. Cheshire Magistrates chairman [[William Hulton]] then summoned the [[15th The King's Hussars|15th Hussars]] to disperse the crowd. They charged with [[sabre]]s drawn, and 18 people were killed and 400\u2013700 were injured in the ensuing confusion. The event was first labelled the \"Peterloo massacre\" by the radical ''[[Manchester Observer]]'' newspaper, in a bitterly ironic reference to the bloody [[Battle of Waterloo]], which had taken place four years earlier.\n\nHistorian [[Robert Poole (historian)|Robert Poole]] has called the Peterloo Massacre 'the bloodiest political event of the 19th century in English soil', and 'a political earthquake in the northern powerhouse of the industrial revolution'.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Poole, Robert|title=Peterloo : the English uprising|date=18 July 2019|publisher=|isbn=978-0-19-878346-6|edition=First|location=Oxford|pages=1\u20132|oclc=1083597363}}</ref> The London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to pass the [[Six Acts]], which were aimed at suppressing any meetings for the purpose of [[radicalism (historical)|radical]] reform.

In 2007, the City Council replaced the blue plaque with a red plaque with less [[euphemism|euphemistic]] wording, explicitly referring to \"a peaceful rally\" being \"attacked by armed cavalry\"  and mentioning \"15 deaths and over 600 injuries\". In 2019, on the 200th anniversary of the massacre, Manchester City Council inaugurated a remarkable new [[Peterloo Memorial]] by the artist [[Jeremy Deller]], featuring eleven concentric circles of local stone engraved with the names of the dead and the places from which the victims came.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Suffrage===\n{{Main|Unreformed House of Commons}}\nIn 1819, [[Lancashire (UK Parliament constituency)|Lancashire]] was represented by two county [[members of parliament]] (MPs) and a further twelve borough members sitting for the towns of Clitheroe, Newton, Wigan, Lancaster, Liverpool, and Preston, with a total of 17,000 voters in a county population of nearly a million.

Johnson wrote:\n\n{{quote|Nothing but ruin and starvation stare one in the face [in the streets of Manchester and the surrounding towns], the state of this district is truly dreadful, and I believe nothing but the greatest exertions can prevent an insurrection.

The ''Manchester Observer'' reported it was called \"to take into consideration the most speedy and effectual mode of obtaining Radical reform in the Common House of Parliament\" and \"to consider the propriety of the 'Unrepresented Inhabitants of Manchester' electing a person to represent them in Parliament\".

Piles of timber lay at the end of the field nearest to the [[Friends Meeting House]], but the remainder of the field was clear.{{sfnp|Frow|Frow|1984|p=7|ps=none}} Thomas Worrell, Manchester's Assistant Surveyor of Paving, arrived to inspect the field at 7:00&nbsp;am. His job was to remove anything that might be used as a weapon, and he duly had \"about a quarter of a load\" of stones carted away.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=145|ps=none}}\n\nMonday, 16 August 1819, was a hot summer's day, with a cloudless blue sky. The fine weather almost certainly increased the size of the crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|p=119|ps=none}}\n\nThe Manchester magistrates met at 9:00&nbsp;am, to breakfast at the Star Inn on [[Deansgate]] and to consider what action they should take on Henry Hunt's arrival at the meeting. By 10:30&nbsp;am they had come to no conclusions, and moved to a house on the southeastern corner of St Peter's Field, from where they planned to observe the meeting.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=152\u2013153|ps=none}}\nThey were concerned that it would end in a riot, or even a rebellion, and had arranged for a substantial number of regular troops and militia [[yeomanry]] to be deployed. The military presence comprised 600&nbsp;men of the {{nowrap|[[15th Hussars]]}}; several hundred [[infantry]]men; a [[Royal Horse Artillery]] unit with two six-pounder guns; 400&nbsp;men of the [[Cheshire Yeomanry]]; 400&nbsp;[[special constable]]s; and 120&nbsp;cavalry of the [[Manchester and Salford Yeomanry]]. The Manchester & Salford Yeomanry were relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among local shopkeepers and tradesmen, the most numerous of which were [[publicans]].{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=88|ps=none}} Recently mocked by the ''Manchester Observer'' as \"generally speaking, the fawning dependents of the great, with a few fools and a greater proportion of coxcombs, who imagine they acquire considerable importance by wearing regimentals,{{sfnp|Bruton|1919|p=14|ps=none}} they were subsequently variously described as \"younger members of the Tory party in arms\",<ref name=\"Guardian 2007-08-13\"/> and as \"hot-headed young men, who had volunteered into that service from their intense hatred of Radicalism.\"{{sfnp|Prentice|1853|p=160|ps=none}} Socialist writer Mark Krantz has described them as \"the local business mafia on horseback\".{{sfnp|Krantz|2011|p=12|ps=none}} R J White described them as \"exclusively cheesemongers, ironmongers and newly enriched manufacturers, (who) the people of Manchester .. thought .. a joke.\"{{sfnp|White|1957|p=185|ps=none}}\n\nThe [[British Army]] in the north was under the overall command of [[John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford|General Sir John Byng]]. When he had initially learned that the meeting was scheduled for 2 August he wrote to the [[Home Office]] stating that he hoped the Manchester magistrates would show firmness on the day:\n\n{{quote|I will be prepared to go there, and will have in that neighbourhood, that is within an easy day's march, 8&nbsp;squadron of cavalry, 18&nbsp;companies of infantry and the guns. I am sure I can add to the Yeomanry if requisite. I hope therefore the civil authorities will not be deterred from doing their duty.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=136|ps=none}}}}\n\nHe then excused himself from attendance, however, as the meeting on 9th clashed with the horse races at [[York]], a fashionable event at which Byng had entries in two races. He wrote to the Home Office, saying that although he would still be prepared to be in command in Manchester on the day of the meeting if it was thought really necessary, he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel [[Guy L'Estrange]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Riding|first=Jacqueline|title=Peterloo : the story of the Manchester massacre|publisher=Head of Zeus|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78669-583-3|location=[London]|pages=157-65, 203-5|oclc=1017592330}}</ref> The postponement to 16th August made it possible for Byng to attend after the races but he chose not to, having had enough of dealing with the Manchester magistrates.

Contingents were sent from all around the region, the largest and \"best dressed\" of which was a group of 10,000 who had travelled from Oldham Green, comprising people from [[Oldham]], [[Royton]] (which included a sizeable female section), [[Shaw and Crompton|Crompton]], [[Lees, Greater Manchester|Lees]], [[Saddleworth]] and [[Mossley]].{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|p=118|ps=none}} Other sizeable contingents marched from [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] and [[Rochdale]] (6,000 strong) and [[Stockport]] (1,500\u20135,000 strong).<ref name=\"MarlowP120-121\">Marlow (1969), pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref> [[Crowd size estimation|Reports of the size of the crowd]] at the meeting vary substantially.

A reasonably reliable count of the numbers on the various marches indicates a total of around 20,000 who came in from outside Manchester, but the number who attended informally from Manchester and Salford is much harder to estimate.

He beckoned me, and I went to him. He was one of my late employers. He took my hand, and rather concernedly, but kindly, said he hoped no harm was intended by all those people who were coming in. I said \"I would pledge my life for their entire peaceableness.\" I asked him to notice them, \"did they look like persons wishing to outrage the law? were they not, on the contrary, evidently heads of decent working families? or members of such families?\" \"No, no,\" I said, \"my dear sir, and old respected master, if any wrong or violence take place, they will be committed by men of a different stamp from these.\" He said he was very glad to hear me say so; he was happy he had seen me, and gratified by the manner in which I had expressed myself. I asked, did he think we should be interrupted at the meeting? he said he did not believe we should; \"then,\" I replied, \"all will be well\"; and shaking hands, with mutual good wishes, I left him, and took my station as before.{{sfnp|Bamford|1844|p=202|ps=none}}}}\n\nAlthough some observers, like the Rev. W. R. Hay, chairman of the [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] [[Quarter Sessions]], claimed that \"The active part of the meeting may be said to have come in wholly from the country\",{{sfnp|Frangopulo|1977|p=33|ps=none}} others such as [[John Shuttleworth (industrialist)|John Shuttleworth]], a local cotton dealer, estimated that most were from Manchester, a view that would subsequently be supported by the casualty lists. Of the casualties whose residence was recorded, sixty-one per cent lived within a three-mile radius of the centre of Manchester.{{sfnp|Bush|2005|p=19|ps=none}} Some groups carried banners with texts like \"No Corn Laws\", \"Annual Parliaments\", \"Universal suffrage\" and \"Vote By Ballot\".{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|pp=119\u2013120|ps=none}} The first female reform societies were established in the textile areas in 1819 and women from the [[Manchester Female Reform Society]], dressed in white, accompanied Hunt to the platform.

They formed two lines in the crowd a few yards apart, in an attempt to form a corridor through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two wagons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the wagons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=161|ps=none}}\n\nHunt's carriage arrived at the meeting shortly after 1:00&nbsp;pm, and he made his way to the hustings. Alongside Hunt on the speakers' stand were John Knight, a cotton manufacturer and reformer, Joseph Johnson, the organiser of the meeting, John Thacker Saxton, managing editor of the ''Manchester Observer'', the publisher [[Richard Carlile]], and George Swift, reformer and shoemaker. There were also a number of reporters, including John Tyas of ''The Times'', John Smith of the ''Liverpool Mercury'' and [[Edward Baines (1800\u20131890)|Edward Baines Jr]], the son of the editor of the ''Leeds Mercury.''{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=162\u2013163|ps=none}} By this time St Peter's Field, an area of {{convert|14000|sqyd|m2|-2}}, was packed with tens of thousands of men, women and children.

He issued an arrest warrant for Henry Hunt, Joseph Johnson, John Knight, and James Moorhouse. On being handed the warrant the Constable, Jonathan Andrews, offered his opinion that the press of the crowd surrounding the hustings would make military assistance necessary for its execution. Hulton then wrote two letters, one to Major [[Thomas de Trafford|Thomas Trafford]], the commanding officer of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry Cavalry, and the other to the overall military commander in Manchester, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange. The contents of both notes were similar:{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=166\u2013167|ps=none}}\n\n{{quote|Sir, as chairman of the select committee of magistrates, I request you to proceed immediately to no.&nbsp;6&nbsp;Mount Street, where the magistrates are assembled.

At that time only around 11% of adult males had the vote, very few of them in the industrial north which was worst hit, and reformers identified parliamentary reform as the solution. A mass campaign to petition parliament for manhood suffrage gained three-quarters of a million signatures in 1817 but was flatly rejected by the House of Commons.  When a second slump occurred in early 1819, radical reformers sought to mobilise huge crowds to force government to back down. The movement was particularly strong in the north-west of England, where the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a mass rally in August 1819 addressed by well-known radical orator [[Henry Hunt (politician)|Henry Hunt]].\n\nShortly after the meeting began, local magistrates called on the [[Manchester and Salford Yeomanry]] to arrest Hunt and several others on the platform with him. The Yeomanry charged into the crowd, knocking down a woman and killing a child, and finally apprehended Hunt.

Piles of timber lay at the end of the field nearest to the [[Friends Meeting House]], but the remainder of the field was clear.{{sfnp|Frow|Frow|1984|p=7|ps=none}} Thomas Worrell, Manchester's Assistant Surveyor of Paving, arrived to inspect the field at 7:00&nbsp;am. His job was to remove anything that might be used as a weapon, and he duly had \"about a quarter of a load\" of stones carted away.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=145|ps=none}}\n\nMonday, 16 August 1819, was a hot summer's day, with a cloudless blue sky. The fine weather almost certainly increased the size of the crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|p=119|ps=none}}\n\nThe Manchester magistrates met at 9:00&nbsp;am, to breakfast at the Star Inn on [[Deansgate]] and to consider what action they should take on Henry Hunt's arrival at the meeting. By 10:30&nbsp;am they had come to no conclusions, and moved to a house on the southeastern corner of St Peter's Field, from where they planned to observe the meeting.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=152\u2013153|ps=none}}\nThey were concerned that it would end in a riot, or even a rebellion, and had arranged for a substantial number of regular troops and militia [[yeomanry]] to be deployed. The military presence comprised 600&nbsp;men of the {{nowrap|[[15th Hussars]]}}; several hundred [[infantry]]men; a [[Royal Horse Artillery]] unit with two six-pounder guns; 400&nbsp;men of the [[Cheshire Yeomanry]]; 400&nbsp;[[special constable]]s; and 120&nbsp;cavalry of the [[Manchester and Salford Yeomanry]]. The Manchester & Salford Yeomanry were relatively inexperienced militia recruited from among local shopkeepers and tradesmen, the most numerous of which were [[publicans]].{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=88|ps=none}} Recently mocked by the ''Manchester Observer'' as \"generally speaking, the fawning dependents of the great, with a few fools and a greater proportion of coxcombs, who imagine they acquire considerable importance by wearing regimentals,{{sfnp|Bruton|1919|p=14|ps=none}} they were subsequently variously described as \"younger members of the Tory party in arms\",<ref name=\"Guardian 2007-08-13\"/> and as \"hot-headed young men, who had volunteered into that service from their intense hatred of Radicalism.\"{{sfnp|Prentice|1853|p=160|ps=none}} Socialist writer Mark Krantz has described them as \"the local business mafia on horseback\".{{sfnp|Krantz|2011|p=12|ps=none}} R J White described them as \"exclusively cheesemongers, ironmongers and newly enriched manufacturers, (who) the people of Manchester .. thought .. a joke.\"{{sfnp|White|1957|p=185|ps=none}}\n\nThe [[British Army]] in the north was under the overall command of [[John Byng, 1st Earl of Strafford|General Sir John Byng]]. When he had initially learned that the meeting was scheduled for 2 August he wrote to the [[Home Office]] stating that he hoped the Manchester magistrates would show firmness on the day:\n\n{{quote|I will be prepared to go there, and will have in that neighbourhood, that is within an easy day's march, 8&nbsp;squadron of cavalry, 18&nbsp;companies of infantry and the guns. I am sure I can add to the Yeomanry if requisite. I hope therefore the civil authorities will not be deterred from doing their duty.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=136|ps=none}}}}\n\nHe then excused himself from attendance, however, as the meeting on 9th clashed with the horse races at [[York]], a fashionable event at which Byng had entries in two races. He wrote to the Home Office, saying that although he would still be prepared to be in command in Manchester on the day of the meeting if it was thought really necessary, he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel [[Guy L'Estrange]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Riding|first=Jacqueline|title=Peterloo : the story of the Manchester massacre|publisher=Head of Zeus|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78669-583-3|location=[London]|pages=157-65, 203-5|oclc=1017592330}}</ref> The postponement to 16th August made it possible for Byng to attend after the races but he chose not to, having had enough of dealing with the Manchester magistrates.

Contingents were sent from all around the region, the largest and \"best dressed\" of which was a group of 10,000 who had travelled from Oldham Green, comprising people from [[Oldham]], [[Royton]] (which included a sizeable female section), [[Shaw and Crompton|Crompton]], [[Lees, Greater Manchester|Lees]], [[Saddleworth]] and [[Mossley]].{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|p=118|ps=none}} Other sizeable contingents marched from [[Middleton, Greater Manchester|Middleton]] and [[Rochdale]] (6,000 strong) and [[Stockport]] (1,500\u20135,000 strong).<ref name=\"MarlowP120-121\">Marlow (1969), pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref> [[Crowd size estimation|Reports of the size of the crowd]] at the meeting vary substantially.

A reasonably reliable count of the numbers on the various marches indicates a total of around 20,000 who came in from outside Manchester, but the number who attended informally from Manchester and Salford is much harder to estimate.

He beckoned me, and I went to him. He was one of my late employers. He took my hand, and rather concernedly, but kindly, said he hoped no harm was intended by all those people who were coming in. I said \"I would pledge my life for their entire peaceableness.\" I asked him to notice them, \"did they look like persons wishing to outrage the law? were they not, on the contrary, evidently heads of decent working families? or members of such families?\" \"No, no,\" I said, \"my dear sir, and old respected master, if any wrong or violence take place, they will be committed by men of a different stamp from these.\" He said he was very glad to hear me say so; he was happy he had seen me, and gratified by the manner in which I had expressed myself. I asked, did he think we should be interrupted at the meeting? he said he did not believe we should; \"then,\" I replied, \"all will be well\"; and shaking hands, with mutual good wishes, I left him, and took my station as before.{{sfnp|Bamford|1844|p=202|ps=none}}}}\n\nAlthough some observers, like the Rev. W. R. Hay, chairman of the [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] [[Quarter Sessions]], claimed that \"The active part of the meeting may be said to have come in wholly from the country\",{{sfnp|Frangopulo|1977|p=33|ps=none}} others such as [[John Shuttleworth (industrialist)|John Shuttleworth]], a local cotton dealer, estimated that most were from Manchester, a view that would subsequently be supported by the casualty lists. Of the casualties whose residence was recorded, sixty-one per cent lived within a three-mile radius of the centre of Manchester.{{sfnp|Bush|2005|p=19|ps=none}} Some groups carried banners with texts like \"No Corn Laws\", \"Annual Parliaments\", \"Universal suffrage\" and \"Vote By Ballot\".{{sfnp|Marlow|1969|pp=119\u2013120|ps=none}} The first female reform societies were established in the textile areas in 1819 and women from the [[Manchester Female Reform Society]], dressed in white, accompanied Hunt to the platform.

They formed two lines in the crowd a few yards apart, in an attempt to form a corridor through the crowd between the house where the magistrates were watching and the hustings, two wagons lashed together. Believing that this might be intended as the route by which the magistrates would later send their representatives to arrest the speakers, some members of the crowd pushed the wagons away from the constables, and pressed around the hustings to form a human barrier.{{sfnp|Reid|1989|p=161|ps=none}}\n\nHunt's carriage arrived at the meeting shortly after 1:00&nbsp;pm, and he made his way to the hustings. Alongside Hunt on the speakers' stand were John Knight, a cotton manufacturer and reformer, Joseph Johnson, the organiser of the meeting, John Thacker Saxton, managing editor of the ''Manchester Observer'', the publisher [[Richard Carlile]], and George Swift, reformer and shoemaker. There were also a number of reporters, including John Tyas of ''The Times'', John Smith of the ''Liverpool Mercury'' and [[Edward Baines (1800\u20131890)|Edward Baines Jr]], the son of the editor of the ''Leeds Mercury.''{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=162\u2013163|ps=none}} By this time St Peter's Field, an area of {{convert|14000|sqyd|m2|-2}}, was packed with tens of thousands of men, women and children.

He issued an arrest warrant for Henry Hunt, Joseph Johnson, John Knight, and James Moorhouse. On being handed the warrant the Constable, Jonathan Andrews, offered his opinion that the press of the crowd surrounding the hustings would make military assistance necessary for its execution. Hulton then wrote two letters, one to Major [[Thomas de Trafford|Thomas Trafford]], the commanding officer of the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry Cavalry, and the other to the overall military commander in Manchester, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange. The contents of both notes were similar:{{sfnp|Reid|1989|pp=166\u2013167|ps=none}}\n\n{{quote|Sir, as chairman of the select committee of magistrates, I request you to proceed immediately to no.&nbsp;6&nbsp;Mount Street, where the magistrates are assembled.

{"title_page": "Diversity in open-source software", "text_new": "The [[open-source-software movement]] is commonly cited to have a diversity problem. In some ways it reflects that of the general [[gender disparity in computing]], but in general is assumed to be even more severe. The same can be extended to the racial and ethnic diversity of the movement, and to a lesser extent the diversity in people of a [[sexual minority]].\n\nThe topic has been and continues to be the subject of significant controversy within the open-source community.\n\n== Obstacles for inclusion ==\nA common criticism levelled at the open source community is that critiques of code contributed to projects have a tendency to become personal attacks. In Github's 2017 survey, 50% of the 5,500 respondents claimed they had witnessed toxic interactions while working on open-source projects, and that 18% of them had suffered through a negative interaction.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/|title=Open Source Survey|website=Open Source Survey|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> Dismissive responses, conflict, and unwelcoming language were cited as the third, fourth, and sixth biggest problems with open-source respectively.\n\nAn oft-repeated sentiment throughout the community is that conflict isn't widespread, but rather quite visible, due to the public nature of forums and mailing lists. The figures, however, make this idea questionable. Some members of the community have cited the community's toxicity as the main reason for open-source's diversity problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.codethink.co.uk/articles/2019/acceptance-strife-and-progress-in-the-lgbtiq-and-open-source-communities/|title=Acceptance, strife, and progress in the LGBTIQ+ and open source communities|website=www.codethink.co.uk|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref>\n\n== Gender diversity ==\nThe gender ratio in open source is even greater than the field-wide gender disparity in computing. This has been found by a number of surveys:\n*A 2002 survey of 2,784 open-source-software developers found that 1.1% of them were women.<ref>http://flossproject.merit.unu.edu/report/Final4.htm</ref>\n*A 2013 survey of 2,183 open-source contributors found that 81.4% were men and 10.4% were women.<ref>\"FLOSS 2013: A Survey Dataset about Free Software Contributors: Challenges for Curating, Sharing, and Combining\". https://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/msr14gregorio.pdf</ref> This survey included both software contributors and non-software contributors and women were much more likely to be non-software contributors.<ref>\"Women in Free/Libre/Open Source Software: The situation in the 2010s\".</ref>\n*A 2017 survey of 5,500 contributors to projects on [[GitHub]] found that 95% of contributors were men and 3% were women.<ref name=\"Klint2016Wired\">{{cite news |last=Klint |first=Finley |date=2 June 2017 |title=Diversity in Open Source Is Even Worse Than in Tech Overall |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/06/diversity-open-source-even-worse-tech-overall/ |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |location= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 [[RedHat]] started the Women in Open Source Awards.\nThe winners are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Women in Open Source Awards|url=https://www.redhat.com/en/about/women-in-open-source#2015finalists|access-date=Aug 26, 2019}}</ref>\n* 2019 Community Award winner [[Limor Fried]]\n* 2019 Academic Award winner [[Saloni Garg]]\n* 2018 Community Award winner [[Dana Lewis (software engineer)|Dana Lewis]]\n* 2018 Academic Award winner [[Zui Dighe]]\n* 2017 Community Award winner [[Avni Khatri]]\n* 2017 Academic Award winner [[Jigyasa Grover]]\n* 2016 Community Award winner [[Jessica McKellar]]\n* 2016 Academic Award winner [[Preeti Murthy]]\n* 2015 Community Award winner [[Sarah Sharp]]\n* 2015 Academic Award winner [[Kesha Shah]]\n\n== Racial and ethnic diversity ==\n[[Black people]] and [[Latin Americans|Latino]]s are considered to be underrepresented.<ref>\"Why Isn't Open Source A Gateway For Coders Of Color?\". https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/05/248791579/why-isnt-open-source-a-gateway-for-coders-of-color</ref>\n\n== Sexual minority diversity ==\nA higher percentage of open-source contributors are members of a [[sexual minority]].

He became well known for creating a number of witty and thought-provoking images. Often depicting ordinary objects in an unusual context, his work is known for challenging observers' preconditioned perceptions of reality. His imagery has influenced [[pop art]], [[minimalist art]] and [[conceptual art]].\n\n==Early life==\nRen\u00e9 Magritte was born in [[Lessines]], in the province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], Belgium, in 1898. He was the oldest son of L\u00e9opold Magritte, a [[tailor]] and textile merchant,<ref name=\"Meuris216\">Meuris 1991, p 216.</ref> and R\u00e9gina ([[n\u00e9e]] Bertinchamps), who was a [[Hatmaking|milliner]] before she got married. Little is known about Magritte's early life. He began lessons in drawing in 1910.\n\nOn 12 March 1912, his mother committed [[suicide]] by drowning herself in the [[Sambre|River Sambre]]. This was not her first attempt at taking her own life; she had made many over a number of years, driving her husband L\u00e9opold to lock her into her bedroom. One day she escaped, and was missing for days. Her body was later discovered a mile or so down the nearby river.\n\nAccording to a legend, 13-year-old Magritte was present when her body was retrieved from the water, but recent research has discredited this story, which may have originated with the family nurse.<ref name=\"Cal9\">Calvocoressi 1990, p. 9.</ref> Supposedly, when his mother was found, her dress was covering her face, an image that has been suggested as the source of several of Magritte's paintings in 1927\u20131928 of people with cloth obscuring their faces, including ''Les Amants''.<ref name=\"nga\">{{cite web|url=http://nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=148052 |title=National Gallery of Australia &#124; Les Amants [The lovers&#93; |publisher=Nga.gov.au |accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nMagritte's earliest paintings, which date from about 1915, were [[Impressionism|Impressionistic]] in style.<ref name=\"Cal9\" /> During 1916\u20131918, he studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Brussels]],<ref name=\"Guggenheim\">[https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/rene-magritte Solomon R.

In 1922, Magritte married [[Georgette Berger]], whom he had met as a child in 1913.<ref name=\"Meuris216\" /> Also during 1922, the poet [[Marcel Lecomte]] showed Magritte a reproduction of [[Giorgio de Chirico]]'s \"[[The Song of Love]]\" (painted in 1914).  The work brought Magritte to tears; he described this as \"one of the most moving moments of my life: my eyes ''saw'' thought for the first time.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/25/rene-magritte-every-time-i-look-at-it-i-feel-ill/|title=Every Time I Look at It I Feel Ill|last=Marler|first=Regina|date=2018-10-25|access-date=2019-01-22|language=en|issn=0028-7504}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922\u20131923, Magritte worked as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]] in a [[wallpaper]] factory, and was a poster and advertisement designer until 1926, when a contract with Galerie Le Centaure in [[Brussels]] made it possible for him to paint full-time. In 1926, Magritte produced his first surreal painting, ''The Lost Jockey'' (''Le jockey perdu''), and held his first solo exhibition in Brussels in 1927.<ref name=\"Guggenheim\" /> Critics heaped abuse on the exhibition.\n\nDepressed by the failure, he moved to Paris where he became friends with [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] and became involved in the [[surrealism|Surrealist]] group. An illusionistic, dream-like quality is characteristic of Magritte's version of Surrealism. He became a leading member of the movement, and remained in Paris for three years.<ref name=\"rene\">{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Rachel |title=The 20th-Century Art Book|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|edition=Reprinted.}}</ref> In 1929 he exhibited at Goemans Gallery in Paris with [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Jean Arp]], de Chirico, [[Max Ernst]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Yves Tanguy]].\n\nOn 15 December 1929 he participated in the last publication of [[La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste|La Revolution Surrealiste]] No. 12, where he published his essay \"Les mots et les images\", where words play with images in sync with his work [[The Treachery of Images|The Treachery of images]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inventin.lautre.net/livres/La-revolution-surrealiste-12.pdf|title=Revolution surrealiste nb 12}}</ref>\n\nGalerie Le Centaure closed at the end of 1929, ending Magritte's contract income. Having made little impact in Paris, Magritte returned to Brussels in 1930 and resumed working in advertising.<ref name=\"Meuris217\">Meuris 1991, p. 217.</ref> He and his brother, Paul, formed an agency which earned him a living wage.

James is featured in two of Magritte's works painted in 1937, ''Le Principe du Plaisir'' (''The Pleasure Principle'') and ''La Reproduction Interdite'', a painting also known as ''[[Not to Be Reproduced]]''.<ref>\"Professor Bram Hammacher\", The Edward James Foundation souvenir guide, edited Peter Sarginson, 1992.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II#1940: Denmark and Norway, France and Low Countries, Baltic Republics, Britain and Atlantic, Greece|German occupation]] of Belgium in World War II he remained in Brussels, which led to a break with Breton. He briefly adopted a colorful, painterly style in 1943\u201344, an interlude known as his \"[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] period\", as a reaction to his feelings of alienation and abandonment that came with living in German-occupied Belgium.\n\nIn 1946, renouncing the violence and [[pessimism]] of his earlier work, he joined several other Belgian artists in signing the manifesto ''Surrealism in Full Sunlight''.<ref>Meuris 1991, p. 218.</ref> During 1947\u201348, Magritte's \"Vache period,\" he painted in a provocative and crude [[Fauvism|Fauve]] style.

In the United States his work has been featured in three retrospective exhibitions: at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1965, at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1992, and again at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2013. An exhibition entitled \"The Fifth Season\" at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] in 2018 focused on the work of his later years.\n\nPolitically, Magritte stood to the left, and retained close ties to the Communist Party, even in the post-war years. However, he was critical of the functionalist cultural policy of the Communist left, stating that \"Class consciousness is as necessary as bread; but that does not mean that workers must be condemned to bread and water and that wanting chicken and champagne would be harmful. (...) For the Communist painter, the justification of artistic activity is to create pictures that can represent mental luxury.\" While remaining committed to the political left, he thus advocated a certain autonomy of art.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/quote/magritte.html |title=Ren\u00e9 Magritte on the Revolutionary Artist vs. Folk Art & Stalinism |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/Typo3/index.php?id=15 |title=Musee Magritte Museum |accessdate=2014-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903234654/http://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/Typo3/index.php?id=15 |archive-date=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Spiritually, Magritte was an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ren\u00e9 Magritte, 1898-1967|year=1994|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|isbn=9783822805466|page=[https://archive.org/details/renemagritte18980000meur_h1e1/page/70 70]|author=Jacques Meuris|quote=We shall not at this juncture risk analyzing an agnostic Magritte haunted perhaps by thoughts of ultimate destiny. \"We behave as if there were no God\" (Marien 1947).|url=https://archive.org/details/renemagritte18980000meur_h1e1/page/70}}</ref>\n\nPopular interest in Magritte's work rose considerably in the 1960s, and his imagery has influenced [[Pop art|pop]], [[Minimalist art|minimalist]], and [[conceptual art]].<ref name=\"Calvocoressi 1990, p. 26\">Calvocoressi 1990, p. 26.</ref> In 2005 he was 9th in the [[French Community of Belgium|Walloon]] version of ''[[De Grootste Belg]]'' (''The Greatest Belgian''); in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] version he was 18th.\n\n==Personal life==\nMagritte married Georgette Berger in June 1922.

In these \"''Ceci n'est pas''\" works, Magritte points out that no matter how naturalistically we depict an object, we never do catch the item itself.\n\nAmong Magritte's works are a number of surrealist versions of other famous paintings. Elsewhere, Magritte challenges the difficulty of artwork to convey meaning with a recurring motif of an easel, as in his ''The Human Condition'' series (1933, 1935) or ''The Promenades of Euclid'' (1955), wherein the spires of a castle are \"painted\" upon the ordinary streets which the canvas overlooks. In a letter to Andr\u00e9 Breton, he wrote of ''The Human Condition'' that it was irrelevant if the scene behind the easel differed from what was depicted upon it, \"but the main thing was to eliminate the difference between a view seen from outside and from inside a room.\"<ref>Sylvester 1992, p.298</ref> The windows in some of these pictures are framed with heavy drapes, suggesting a theatrical motif.<ref>Spitz 1994, p.50</ref>\n\nMagritte's style of surrealism is more representational than the [[Surrealist automatism|\"automatic\"]] style of artists such as [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. Magritte's use of ordinary objects in unfamiliar spaces is joined to his desire to create poetic imagery. He described the act of painting as \"the art of putting colors side by side in such a way that their real aspect is effaced, so that familiar objects\u2014the sky, people, trees, mountains, furniture, the stars, solid structures, graffiti\u2014become united in a single poetically disciplined image. The poetry of this image dispenses with any symbolic significance, old or new.\"<ref>Frasnay, Daniel. ''The Artist's World''. New York: The Viking Press, 1969. pp. 99-107</ref>\n\nRen\u00e9 Magritte described his paintings as \"visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitflanders.us/index.php?page=NewMagritteMuseumBrussels|title=Flanders - New Magritte Museum Brussels |publisher=visitflanders.us |accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref>\n\nMagritte's constant play with reality and illusion has been attributed to the early death of his mother. Psychoanalysts who have examined bereaved children have hypothesized that Magritte's back and forth play with reality and illusion reflects his \"constant shifting back and forth from what he wishes\u2014'mother is alive'\u2014to what he knows\u2014'mother is dead'.\"<ref>Collins, Bradley I.

He became well known for creating a number of witty and thought-provoking images. Often depicting ordinary objects in an unusual context, his work is known for challenging observers' preconditioned perceptions of reality. His imagery has influenced [[pop art]], [[minimalist art]] and [[conceptual art]].\n\n==Early life==\nRen\u00e9 Magritte was born in [[Lessines]], in the province of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], Belgium, in 1898. He was the oldest son of L\u00e9opold Magritte, a [[tailor]] and textile merchant,<ref name=\"Meuris216\">Meuris 1991, p 216.</ref> and R\u00e9gina ([[n\u00e9e]] Bertinchamps), who was a [[Hatmaking|milliner]] before she got married. Little is known about Magritte's early life. He began lessons in drawing in 1910.\n\nOn 12 March 1912, his mother committed [[suicide]] by drowning herself in the [[Sambre|River Sambre]].

James is featured in two of Magritte's works painted in 1937, ''Le Principe du Plaisir'' (''The Pleasure Principle'') and ''La Reproduction Interdite'', a painting also known as ''[[Not to Be Reproduced]]''.<ref>\"Professor Bram Hammacher\", The Edward James Foundation souvenir guide, edited Peter Sarginson, 1992.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II#1940: Denmark and Norway, France and Low Countries, Baltic Republics, Britain and Atlantic, Greece|German occupation]] of Belgium in World War II he remained in Brussels, which led to a break with Breton. He briefly adopted a colorful, painterly style in 1943\u201344, an interlude known as his \"[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] period\", as a reaction to his feelings of alienation and abandonment that came with living in German-occupied Belgium.\n\nIn 1946, renouncing the violence and [[pessimism]] of his earlier work, he joined several other Belgian artists in signing the manifesto ''Surrealism in Full Sunlight''.<ref>Meuris 1991, p. 218.</ref> During 1947\u201348, Magritte's \"Vache period,\" he painted in a provocative and crude [[Fauvism|Fauve]] style.

In the United States his work has been featured in three retrospective exhibitions: at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in 1965, at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1992, and again at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2013. An exhibition entitled \"The Fifth Season\" at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] in 2018 focused on the work of his later years.\n\nPolitically, Magritte stood to the left, and retained close ties to the Communist Party, even in the post-war years. However, he was critical of the functionalist cultural policy of the Communist left, stating that \"Class consciousness is as necessary as bread; but that does not mean that workers must be condemned to bread and water and that wanting chicken and champagne would be harmful. (...) For the Communist painter, the justification of artistic activity is to create pictures that can represent mental luxury.\" While remaining committed to the political left, he thus advocated a certain autonomy of art.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autodidactproject.org/quote/magritte.html |title=Ren\u00e9 Magritte on the Revolutionary Artist vs. Folk Art & Stalinism |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/Typo3/index.php?id=15 |title=Musee Magritte Museum |accessdate=2014-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903234654/http://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/Typo3/index.php?id=15 |archive-date=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Spiritually, Magritte was an agnostic.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ren\u00e9 Magritte, 1898-1967|year=1994|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|isbn=9783822805466|page=[https://archive.org/details/renemagritte18980000meur_h1e1/page/70 70]|author=Jacques Meuris|quote=We shall not at this juncture risk analyzing an agnostic Magritte haunted perhaps by thoughts of ultimate destiny. \"We behave as if there were no God\" (Marien 1947).|url=https://archive.org/details/renemagritte18980000meur_h1e1/page/70}}</ref>\n\nPopular interest in Magritte's work rose considerably in the 1960s, and his imagery has influenced [[Pop art|pop]], [[Minimalist art|minimalist]], and [[conceptual art]].<ref name=\"Calvocoressi 1990, p. 26\">Calvocoressi 1990, p. 26.</ref> In 2005 he was 9th in the [[French Community of Belgium|Walloon]] version of ''[[De Grootste Belg]]'' (''The Greatest Belgian''); in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] version he was 18th.\n\n==Personal life==\nMagritte married Georgette Berger in June 1922.

In these \"''Ceci n'est pas''\" works, Magritte points out that no matter how naturalistically we depict an object, we never do catch the item itself.\n\nAmong Magritte's works are a number of surrealist versions of other famous paintings. Elsewhere, Magritte challenges the difficulty of artwork to convey meaning with a recurring motif of an easel, as in his ''The Human Condition'' series (1933, 1935) or ''The Promenades of Euclid'' (1955), wherein the spires of a castle are \"painted\" upon the ordinary streets which the canvas overlooks. In a letter to Andr\u00e9 Breton, he wrote of ''The Human Condition'' that it was irrelevant if the scene behind the easel differed from what was depicted upon it, \"but the main thing was to eliminate the difference between a view seen from outside and from inside a room.\"<ref>Sylvester 1992, p.298</ref> The windows in some of these pictures are framed with heavy drapes, suggesting a theatrical motif.<ref>Spitz 1994, p.50</ref>\n\nMagritte's style of surrealism is more representational than the [[Surrealist automatism|\"automatic\"]] style of artists such as [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]. Magritte's use of ordinary objects in unfamiliar spaces is joined to his desire to create poetic imagery. He described the act of painting as \"the art of putting colors side by side in such a way that their real aspect is effaced, so that familiar objects\u2014the sky, people, trees, mountains, furniture, the stars, solid structures, graffiti\u2014become united in a single poetically disciplined image. The poetry of this image dispenses with any symbolic significance, old or new.\"<ref>Frasnay, Daniel. ''The Artist's World''. New York: The Viking Press, 1969. pp. 99-107</ref>\n\nRen\u00e9 Magritte described his paintings as \"visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?'. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitflanders.us/index.php?page=NewMagritteMuseumBrussels|title=Flanders - New Magritte Museum Brussels |publisher=visitflanders.us |accessdate=2009-03-29}}</ref>\n\nMagritte's constant play with reality and illusion has been attributed to the early death of his mother. Psychoanalysts who have examined bereaved children have hypothesized that Magritte's back and forth play with reality and illusion reflects his \"constant shifting back and forth from what he wishes\u2014'mother is alive'\u2014to what he knows\u2014'mother is dead'.\"<ref>Collins, Bradley I.
