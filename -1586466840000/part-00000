His poems appear very modern and philosophic; they have many semantic and stylistic layers which first reading tends not to reveal many. As a bilingual poet, his English poems are more evident and convincing while his Vietnamese verses are more for the linguists. He is a grand master of poetic language, and he pioneers Vietnamese alliteration poetry and a new style named ''phac-nhien'' that might partly mean rawly-natural. In September 2017, he was invited as an unheard-of international poet to Taipei Poetry Festival where he drew a large audience and evoked the media. The Taiwanese giant of contemporary literature, poet Xiang Yang wrote of Th\u00e2n, \"\u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u00e2n is successful in using black humour language to deal with real problems.

His poems appear very modern and philosophic; they have many semantic and stylistic layers which first reading tends not to reveal many. As a bilingual poet, his English poems are more evident and convincing while his Vietnamese verses are more for the linguists. He is a grand master of poetic language, and he pioneers Vietnamese alliteration poetry and a new style named ''phac-nhien'' that might partly mean rawly-natural. In September 2017, he was invited as an unheard-of international poet to Taipei Poetry Festival where he drew a large audience and evoked the media. The Taiwanese giant of contemporary literature, poet Xiang Yang wrote of Th\u00e2n, \"\u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u00e2n is successful in using black humour language to deal with real problems.

Consequently, some people might stop reading his while others cannot go with the track or understand his works at all. There should be one way to \u201cdecode\u201d him: you can first underline sentences and paragraphs you really like, then you can gradually perceive what this writer of immense genius with enormous ideas and materials really wants. Dang Than needs a pretty number of concubines who would rearrange his belongings and clean up all the trash he leaves behind in the rooms he sleeps each night. I am of the view that he is looking for ways to rearrange himself, forming a prestigious literary estate.

It was directed and written by [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] and based on the [[The Langoliers|novella]] by [[Stephen King]] from the four-part anthology book ''[[Four past Midnight]]''. The series was produced by Mitchell Galin and David R. Kappes, for Laurel Entertainment, Inc. The miniseries originally aired May 14\u201315, 1995 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a [[red-eye flight]] of a [[Lockheed L-1011]] from [[LAX|Los Angeles International Airport]] to [[Boston Logan International Airport]], the plane flies through a strange light, and most of the passengers and flight crew disappear, leaving behind only personal artifacts. Only those passengers who were asleep remain, and discover the predicament when they wake. Pilot Brian Engle, [[deadheading (employee)|deadheading]] on the flight, takes the controls; unable to contact any other airport, he decides to land the plane at [[Bangor International Airport]] because of its long runway.\n\nIn addition to Engle, the other passengers include: Nick Hopewell, a mysterious Englishman; Laurel Stevenson, a schoolteacher on vacation;  Don Gaffney, a [[tool and die]] worker on his way to meet his new granddaughter; Albert Kaussner, a violinist on his way to a music school in Boston; Bethany Sims, a girl whose estranged family is planning on sending her to a [[drug rehab]];  Bob Jenkins, a mystery-novel author; Dinah Bellman, a blind girl on her way to Boston to undergo optic surgery; Rudy Warwick, a perpetually sleepy businessman with a ravenous appetite; and Craig Toomy, an unstable business executive agitated over missing a scheduled meeting in Boston. Dinah, who has some [[telepathic]] ability, senses troubling issues with Craig and warns the others about him. In a flashback, it is shown that Craig suffered from psychological abuse from his father, who instilled in him a fear of the \"Langoliers\", creatures who hunt down and devour the lazy and irresponsible.\n\nWhen they land in Bangor, the airport seems deserted, and without any power. They also discover that everything is dull and lifeless \u2013 they cannot light matches, and food and drink are tasteless. Brian fears the jet fuel will lack any ability to move the plane. Dinah also reports hearing a strange sound in the distance. Bob postulates they passed through an [[aurora borealis]] and entered a time rift, sending them a few minutes into the past and out of sync. As the others search the airport for any type of help, Craig becomes more unstable, and after finding a gun in an airport locker, takes Bethany hostage and demands they take off again. Albert subdues Craig and Nick ties him up after realizing the gun's bullets are similarly affected by the strange environment and thus harmless, to the point that a bullet essentially bounces off Albert without actually hurting him.\n\nDinah warns them the noises in the distance are getting louder. Part of the group discover a \"pocket of the present\" on board the plane, and objects brought aboard from the airport regain their normal behavior. The group determine they can refuel and take off, heading for the time rift, and hopefully return to normal time. As Brian prepares the plane for take off, the others go to bring Craig back, but find he has escaped the bonds. When found, he stabs Dinah and Don with a knife, killing the latter. Albert again subdues Craig, and the others leave him unconscious in the airport as they race Dinah back to the plane.\n\nAs they board, the group witnesses strange creatures emerge from the horizon, consuming everything including the ground. Bob calls these creatures Langoliers, creatures that feed on time which has passed. As a panicked Craig comes running out of the airport, a weak Dinah is able to psychically convince him his meeting has moved from Boston to here. In a hallucinatory state, Craig gleefully admits to his boss he cost his company $43 million, in hopes of escaping his father's abuse. The delay leaves Craig vulnerable and he is eaten by the Langoliers. The plane takes off just as the Langoliers consume the entire airport beneath them. As they fly through the void, Dinah succumbs to her wound and dies while recalling the lines \"everything was beautiful, even things that were dead.\"\n\nAs the plane approaches the time rift, Bob hastily recalls they had survived their first trip into the rift because they had been asleep, and could disappear if they pass through it awake. Brian is able to reduce the cabin pressure, which will knock them unconscious, but someone needs to remain awake to fly the plane on course. Nick volunteers, having revealed he was a government assassin on a mission, but tells Laurel to travel to London to explain this to his estranged father after they return safely. The plan works; Nick disappears as the plane passes the rift, and Brian wakes shortly after to land the plane safely in Los Angeles.\n\nThe passengers are concerned they seem to be in a similar state as they were in Bangor, but Bob, using the evidence in front of him, such as the return of sound and smell, believes they may be a few minutes ahead of everyone else, and they will shortly catch up to them. As they watch, they see other people start to blur into view, before they suddenly snap into the proper time stream. Only the onlooking children spot their appearance, calling them out as the arrival of \"the new people\". They run happily through the airport, having returned to their world.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patricia Wettig]]: Laurel Stevenson, a [[school teacher]] who uncharacteristically answered a personal ad to meet a man in Boston.\n* [[Dean Stockwell]]: Bob Jenkins, a [[mystery novel|mystery]] writer with a strong ability for deduction.

It was directed and written by [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] and based on the [[The Langoliers|novella]] by [[Stephen King]] from the four-part anthology book ''[[Four past Midnight]]''. The series was produced by Mitchell Galin and David R. Kappes, for Laurel Entertainment, Inc. The miniseries originally aired May 14\u201315, 1995 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a [[red-eye flight]] of a [[Lockheed L-1011]] from [[LAX|Los Angeles International Airport]] to [[Boston Logan International Airport]], the plane flies through a strange light, and most of the passengers and flight crew disappear, leaving behind only personal artifacts. Only those passengers who were asleep remain, and discover the predicament when they wake. Pilot Brian Engle, [[deadheading (employee)|deadheading]] on the flight, takes the controls; unable to contact any other airport, he decides to land the plane at [[Bangor International Airport]] because of its long runway.\n\nIn addition to Engle, the other passengers include: Nick Hopewell, a mysterious Englishman; Laurel Stevenson, a schoolteacher on vacation;  Don Gaffney, a [[tool and die]] worker on his way to meet his new granddaughter; Albert Kaussner, a violinist on his way to a music school in Boston; Bethany Sims, a girl whose estranged family is planning on sending her to a [[drug rehab]];  Bob Jenkins, a mystery-novel author; Dinah Bellman, a blind girl on her way to Boston to undergo optic surgery; Rudy Warwick, a perpetually sleepy businessman with a ravenous appetite; and Craig Toomy, an unstable business executive agitated over missing a scheduled meeting in Boston. Dinah, who has some [[telepathic]] ability, senses troubling issues with Craig and warns the others about him. In a flashback, it is shown that Craig suffered from psychological abuse from his father, who instilled in him a fear of the \"Langoliers\", creatures who hunt down and devour the lazy and irresponsible.\n\nWhen they land in Bangor, the airport seems deserted, and without any power. They also discover that everything is dull and lifeless \u2013 they cannot light matches, and food and drink are tasteless. Brian fears the jet fuel will lack any ability to move the plane. Dinah also reports hearing a strange sound in the distance. Bob postulates they passed through an [[aurora borealis]] and entered a time rift, sending them a few minutes into the past and out of sync. As the others search the airport for any type of help, Craig becomes more unstable, and after finding a gun in an airport locker, takes Bethany hostage and demands they take off again. Albert subdues Craig and Nick ties him up after realizing the gun's bullets are similarly affected by the strange environment and thus harmless, to the point that a bullet essentially bounces off Albert without actually hurting him.\n\nDinah warns them the noises in the distance are getting louder. Part of the group discover a \"pocket of the present\" on board the plane, and objects brought aboard from the airport regain their normal behavior. The group determine they can refuel and take off, heading for the time rift, and hopefully return to normal time. As Brian prepares the plane for take off, the others go to bring Craig back, but find he has escaped the bonds. When found, he stabs Dinah and Don with a knife, killing the latter. Albert again subdues Craig, and the others leave him unconscious in the airport as they race Dinah back to the plane.\n\nAs they board, the group witnesses strange creatures emerge from the horizon, consuming everything including the ground. Bob calls these creatures Langoliers, creatures that feed on time which has passed. As a panicked Craig comes running out of the airport, a weak Dinah is able to psychically convince him his meeting has moved from Boston to here. In a hallucinatory state, Craig gleefully admits to his boss he cost his company $43 million, in hopes of escaping his father's abuse. The delay leaves Craig vulnerable and he is eaten by the Langoliers. The plane takes off just as the Langoliers consume the entire airport beneath them. As they fly through the void, Dinah succumbs to her wound and dies while recalling the lines \"everything was beautiful, even things that were dead.\"\n\nAs the plane approaches the time rift, Bob hastily recalls they had survived their first trip into the rift because they had been asleep, and could disappear if they pass through it awake. Brian is able to reduce the cabin pressure, which will knock them unconscious, but someone needs to remain awake to fly the plane on course. Nick volunteers, having revealed he was a government assassin on a mission, but tells Laurel to travel to London to explain this to his estranged father after they return safely. The plan works; Nick disappears as the plane passes the rift, and Brian wakes shortly after to land the plane safely in Los Angeles.\n\nThe passengers are concerned they seem to be in a similar state as they were in Bangor, but Bob, using the evidence in front of him, such as the return of sound and smell, believes they may be a few minutes ahead of everyone else, and they will shortly catch up to them. As they watch, they see other people start to blur into view, before they suddenly snap into the proper time stream. Only the onlooking children spot their appearance, calling them out as the arrival of \"the new people\". They run happily through the airport, having returned to their world.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patricia Wettig]]: Laurel Stevenson, a [[school teacher]] who uncharacteristically answered a personal ad to meet a man in Boston.\n* [[Dean Stockwell]]: Bob Jenkins, a [[mystery novel|mystery]] writer with a strong ability for deduction.

The concept car's headlights featured ''adaptive lighting'' that pivoted the headlight projectors in concert with steering inputs. The headlight assemblies incorporated a series of [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] that would blink in sequence for turn indication. Side vents at the rear of the front wheel wells were adorned with the Lincoln star. The MKS Concept featured a large sunroof and moonroof combination that takes the place of a conventional roof. The MKS Concept's rear were LED-based parking and brake lamps and dual chrome, trapezoidal-shaped exhaust tips. The MKS Concept rode on 20x8.5-inch, ten spoke wheels.<ref name=\"concept\">{{cite press release |title=2006 MKS Concept Overview |website=Media.Ford.com |date=January 9, 2006 |url= http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1372&item_id=4260&press_section_id=2870 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183229/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1372&item_id=4260&press_section_id=2870 |url-status= dead |archive-date= May 25, 2011 |accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref>\n\nThe MKS Concept seats were covered in cream-colored [[Aniline leather]] while the doors and interior panels were covered in pearl-white [[suede]]. The dashboard was covered in dark grey suede. Instrumentation and controls featured satin nickel inserts and chrome trim with backlighting provided by white LEDs.

The MKS Concept provided a preliminary view of the design direction that Lincoln was taking for their new [[Full-size car|full-size]] flagship sedan of the same name.\n\nThe MKS included Lincoln's signature waterfall grille with a crosshatching that was later used in the grille for the 2007-2009 [[Lincoln MKZ]]. The concept car's headlights featured ''adaptive lighting'' that pivoted the headlight projectors in concert with steering inputs. The headlight assemblies incorporated a series of [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] that would blink in sequence for turn indication. Side vents at the rear of the front wheel wells were adorned with the Lincoln star. The MKS Concept featured a large sunroof and moonroof combination that takes the place of a conventional roof. The MKS Concept's rear were LED-based parking and brake lamps and dual chrome, trapezoidal-shaped exhaust tips. The MKS Concept rode on 20x8.5-inch, ten spoke wheels.<ref name=\"concept\">{{cite press release |title=2006 MKS Concept Overview |website=Media.Ford.com |date=January 9, 2006 |url= http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1372&item_id=4260&press_section_id=2870 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110525183229/http://media.ford.com/press_kits_detail.cfm?presskit_id=1372&item_id=4260&press_section_id=2870 |url-status= dead |archive-date= May 25, 2011 |accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref>\n\nThe MKS Concept seats were covered in cream-colored [[Aniline leather]] while the doors and interior panels were covered in pearl-white [[suede]]. The dashboard was covered in dark grey suede. Instrumentation and controls featured satin nickel inserts and chrome trim with backlighting provided by white LEDs. An [[applique]] of real [[maple]] wood ran across the instrument panel, dividing it into upper and lower sections. Features included [[Bluetooth]] device connectivity, a [[DVD]]-based navigation system, a 14-speaker, 500-[[watt]] audio system, a passive entry system that identifies the driver and allows starting the vehicle by carrying its key fob, and a push button ignition system. Safety was provided by dual front [[airbag]]s, driver and passenger side airbags, and side curtain airbags.<ref name=\"concept\"/>\n\nThe MKS Concept was based on Ford's [[front-wheel drive]], [[Volvo]]-derived [[Ford D3 platform|D3]] [[Automobile platform]] that was already in use in the then-[[Ford Five Hundred]], [[Ford Taurus X|Ford Freestyle]], and [[Mercury Montego]] (the version used for the MKS in particular was coded ''D385''). It has independent suspension with [[MacPherson strut]]s and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a stabilizer bar in the front and a multilink coil over shock setup with a stabilizer bar in the rear. The MKS Concept featured an active [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] system.

Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard while all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. In a significant departure from the MKS Concept and past Lincoln flagship sedans, the production MKS does not offer a V8 engine. In the place of the 4.4&nbsp;L [[Ford Yamaha V8 engine#Volvo 4.4L V8|Ford/Yamaha]] V8 found in the MKS Concept, the production MKS is powered by an all-aluminum 3.7&nbsp;L [[Ford Duratec engine|Duratec]] [[DOHC]] V6, a larger bore derivative of the Duratec 35 and a member of Ford's [[Ford Cyclone engine|Cyclone]] engine family. The engine was designed to accept either regular grade, 87 [[Octane rating|octane]] gasoline or premium grade, 91 octane gasoline. Using regular grade gasoline, the 3.7&nbsp;L V6 produces 273&nbsp;hp (204&nbsp;kW) at 6250&nbsp;rpm and 270&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (366&nbsp;N\u00b7m) of torque at 4250&nbsp;rpm.
