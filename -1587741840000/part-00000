Of these five schools, Askersunds flickskola and Wallinska skolan were considered to offer the highest academic quality to their students, and the Wallinska skolan was the most progressive of them all.<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> \nIt was the fourth girls' school in Sweden and the first in the capital of Stockholm to give female students an almost equal education to that of boys, in accordance with a structured pedagogic method.<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref>        \nIt was not an uncontroversial project, but Anders Fryxell had, reportedly, \"the, for a principal of a radical pioneer school, invaluable talent to be able to handle parents\".<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> \n \nWallinska skolan was managed by two principals in parallel, one male and one female. Upon its foundation, the school had five teachers and a student number of 33: the subjects were Christianity, Swedish, German, natural science, French, history, handicrafts and drawing.  \nIt was partitioned in four classes with the two first divided in four home works groups and the two later classes in three. The course was expansive and scientifically developed for its time.<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> The school year was long, with only a month's summer vacation and two weeks of Christmas vacation. \nThe school gradually changed over the years by continuously adjusting itself to the contemporary progressive ideals of women's education, reforms which were generally controversial, but always introduced nonetheless.<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> \n\nWallinska skolan was to remain the only serious secondary education school for girls in the capital until the 1860s, when the [[Royal Seminary]] was founded and the other girls' schools in Stockholm, notably ''[[\u00c5hlinska skolan]]'' which was founded by [[Karin \u00c5hlin]] in 1847, started to reform into serious secondary schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://skbl.se/sv/artikel/KarinAhlin |title=Karin Dorothea Wilhelmina \u00c5hlin|publisher =  Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon\n|author=  Sara Backman Prytz |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===University Preparation Institution===\n\nBy two reforms in 1870 and 1873, women in Sweden were given access to university education. To make this possible, access to the other levels of education was necessary, and the same year, Wallinska skolan became the first [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for females in Sweden: it formed its first gymnasium class in 1870, and two years later, the first of its students at this level, Johanna Levysohn, took her ''[[Studentexamen]]'' at the male [[Gymnasium (school)|Stockholm gymnasium]].<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> \n\nIn 1874, because it met with the demands stated in the [[Girls' School Committee of 1866]], Wallinska skolan was given governmental support. \nThe same year, 1874, it became the first girls' school in Sweden to win the right to administer the ''studentexamen'' for its students. It was one of five girls' schools in Sweden to be given this right prior before 1900, followed by ''Ateneum f\u00f6r flickor'' (Ateneum for Girls), ''Lyceum f\u00f6r flickor'' (Lyceum for Girls) in 1882, ''[[\u00c5hlinska skolan]]'' in 1894 and ''Tekla \u00c5bergs h\u00f6gre l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor'' in [[Malm\u00f6]] in 1898, the first outside the capital. \n\nThe reforms of the 1870s signified a breakthrough for the school, by then known as \"Wallinium\": the number of students increased from 70\u201380 to 250 during the 1870s, and Wallinska skolan long became nationally known as \"the school where you could take the studentexamen\"<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> and continue to university. \nThe progressive reforms and expansion during the later half of the 19th-century were credited to [[Evelina Fahnehjelm]] (principal 1872\u20131898), who was given the [[Ilis quorum]] in recognition. In 1914, the number of students were 373, and the number of teachers 35. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=   https://skbl.se/sv/artikel/EvelinaFahnehjelm|title=Evelina Wilhelmina Fahnehjelm|publisher =  Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon\n|author=  Esbj\u00f6rn Larsson|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Dissolution===\nIn 1939, the school was united with the [[\u00c5hlinska skolan]] to the co-educational ''Wallin-\u00c5hlinska gymnasiet'' (Wallin-\u00c5hlin Gymnasium) as a result of the new educational reform.\n\n==Notable students==\nA great number of notable personalities have been students at the school during its existence.

The course was expansive and scientifically developed for its time.<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> The school year was long, with only a month's summer vacation and two weeks of Christmas vacation. \nThe school gradually changed over the years by continuously adjusting itself to the contemporary progressive ideals of women's education, reforms which were generally controversial, but always introduced nonetheless.<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> \n\nWallinska skolan was to remain the only serious secondary education school for girls in the capital until the 1860s, when the [[Royal Seminary]] was founded and the other girls' schools in Stockholm, notably ''[[\u00c5hlinska skolan]]'' which was founded by [[Karin \u00c5hlin]] in 1847, started to reform into serious secondary schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://skbl.se/sv/artikel/KarinAhlin |title=Karin Dorothea Wilhelmina \u00c5hlin|publisher =  Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon\n|author=  Sara Backman Prytz |accessdate=November 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===University Preparation Institution===\n\nBy two reforms in 1870 and 1873, women in Sweden were given access to university education. To make this possible, access to the other levels of education was necessary, and the same year, Wallinska skolan became the first [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for females in Sweden: it formed its first gymnasium class in 1870, and two years later, the first of its students at this level, Johanna Levysohn, took her ''[[Studentexamen]]'' at the male [[Stockholms gymnasium]].<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> \n\nIn 1874, because it met with the demands stated in the [[Girls' School Committee of 1866]], Wallinska skolan was given governmental support. \nThe same year, 1874, it became the first girls' school in Sweden to win the right to administer the ''studentexamen'' for its students. It was one of five girls' schools in Sweden to be given this right prior before 1900, followed by ''Ateneum f\u00f6r flickor'' (Ateneum for Girls), ''Lyceum f\u00f6r flickor'' (Lyceum for Girls) in 1882, ''[[\u00c5hlinska skolan]]'' in 1894 and ''Tekla \u00c5bergs h\u00f6gre l\u00e4roverk f\u00f6r flickor'' in [[Malm\u00f6]] in 1898, the first outside the capital. \n\nThe reforms of the 1870s signified a breakthrough for the school, by then known as \"Wallinium\": the number of students increased from 70\u201380 to 250 during the 1870s, and Wallinska skolan long became nationally known as \"the school where you could take the studentexamen\"<ref>Heckscher, Ebba, N\u00e5gra drag ur den svenska flickskolans historia: under fleres medverkan samlade, Norstedt & s\u00f6ner, Stockholm, 1914</ref> and continue to university. \nThe progressive reforms and expansion during the later half of the 19th-century were credited to [[Evelina Fahnehjelm]] (principal 1872\u20131898), who was given the [[Ilis quorum]] in recognition. In 1914, the number of students were 373, and the number of teachers 35. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=   https://skbl.se/sv/artikel/EvelinaFahnehjelm|title=Evelina Wilhelmina Fahnehjelm|publisher =  Svenskt kvinnobiografiskt lexikon\n|author=  Esbj\u00f6rn Larsson|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Dissolution===\nIn 1939, the school was united with the [[\u00c5hlinska skolan]] to the co-educational ''Wallin-\u00c5hlinska gymnasiet'' (Wallin-\u00c5hlin Gymnasium) as a result of the new educational reform.\n\n==Notable students==\nA great number of notable personalities have been students at the school during its existence.

During the first stages of the conflict between units of the [[Principality of Albania]] and the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]] he participated at the battle of his native Kor\u00e7a, where the Albanian forces defended unsuccessfully the town against the attack by the forces of the pro-Greek Northern Epirus movement.
