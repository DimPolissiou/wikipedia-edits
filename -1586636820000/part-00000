{"title_page": "Political status of Taiwan", "text_new": "{{Short description|Sovereignty debate}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Politics of Taiwan}}\n\nThe controversy regarding the '''political status of Taiwan''', sometimes referred to as the '''Taiwan Issue''' or '''Taiwan Strait Issue''', or from a Taiwanese perspective as the '''Mainland Issue''', is a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the subsequent split of China into the two present-day self-governing entities of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC; commonly known as \"China\") and the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC; commonly known as \"Taiwan\").\n\nThe issue hinges on whether the islands of [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]], and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] should remain the territory of the ROC as an effectively separate self-governing entity; become [[Chinese unification|unified]] with the PRC under the existing communist government; convert the ROC to a new \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\"; or unite with the mainland under the ROC government (after the dissolution of the PRC government).\n\nThis controversy also concerns whether the existence and legal status as a [[sovereign state]] of both the ROC and the PRC is [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] as a matter of [[international law]].\n\n[[Free Area of the Republic of China|Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and some other minor islands]] effectively make up the jurisdiction of the [[state (polity)|state]] with the official name of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (ROC)]] but commonly known as \"[[Taiwan]]\".  The ROC, which took control of Taiwan (including Penghu and other nearby islands) in 1945, ruled [[mainland China]] and claimed sovereignty over [[Outer Mongolia]] (now [[Mongolia]]) and [[Tannu Uriankhai]] (part of which is present day [[Tuva]], Russia) before losing the [[Chinese Civil War]] to the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and relocating its government and [[capital city]] from [[Nanjing]] (alternately spelled as \"Nanking\") to [[Taipei]] as [[temporary capital]] in December 1949. The CPC established new government on the mainland as [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in October 1949.\n\nSince the ROC [[China and the United Nations|lost its United Nations seat]] as \"China\" in 1971 ([[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758|replaced]] by the PRC), most sovereign states have switched their diplomatic recognition to the PRC, recognizing the PRC as the representative of all China, though the majority of countries avoid clarifying what territories are meant by \"China\" in order to associate with both the PRC and ROC.  {{Numrec|ROC|asof=S|alt2=the ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with||UN member states}} and the [[Holy See]],<ref name=NewsMalawi>{{cite news | title= Taiwan breaks ties with Malawi | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200801141806.htm|date=14 January 2008 | newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> although informal relations are maintained with nearly all others. Agencies of foreign governments such as the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] operate as ''de facto'' embassies of their home countries in Taiwan, and Taiwan operates similar ''de facto'' embassies and consulates in most countries under such names as \"Taipei Representative Office\" (TRO) or \"Taipei Economic and Cultural (Representative) Office\" (TECO). In certain contexts, Taiwan is also referred to as [[Chinese Taipei]].\n\nThe ROC government has in the past actively pursued the claim as the sole legitimate government over mainland China and Taiwan. This position began to change in the early 1990s as democracy was introduced and new Taiwanese leaders were elected, changing to one that does not actively challenge the legitimacy of PRC rule over mainland China.  Both the PRC and the ROC carry out [[Cross-Strait relations]] through specialized agencies (such as the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC), rather than through foreign ministries. Different groups have different concepts of what the current formal political situation of Taiwan is. (''See also: [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]], [[Taiwan independence]], and [[Cross-Strait relations]]'')\n\nIn addition, the situation can be confusing because of the different parties and the effort by many groups to deal with the controversy through a [[policy of deliberate ambiguity]].  The political solution that is accepted by many of the current groups is the perspective of the status quo: to unofficially treat Taiwan as a state and at a minimum, to officially declare no support for the government of this state making a formal declaration of independence. What a formal declaration of independence would consist of is not clear and can be confusing given the fact that the People's Republic of China has never controlled Taiwan and the Republic of China still exists, albeit on a decreased scale.\n\nThe status quo is accepted in large part because it does not define the legal or future status of Taiwan, leaving each group to interpret the situation in a way that is politically acceptable to its members.  At the same time, a policy of status quo has been criticized as being dangerous precisely because different sides have different interpretations of what the status quo is, leading to the possibility of war through [[brinkmanship]] or miscalculation. The People's Republic Of China seeks to end Taiwan's de facto independence through the process of reunification. If Taiwan refuses this process, The People's Republic of China is prepared to use force through military means, in order to achieve unification.<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FP_20190226_taiwan_bush_hass.pdf\n</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|History of Taiwan}}\n\nTaiwan (excluding [[Penghu]]) was first populated by [[Austronesian people]] and was colonized by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who had arrived in 1623. The [[Kingdom of Tungning]], lasting from 1661 to 1683, was the first [[Han Chinese]] government to rule [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. From 1683, the [[Qing Dynasty]] ruled [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] as a [[prefecture]] and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures. In 1885 the island was made into a separate [[Chinese province]] to speed up development in this region. In the aftermath of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Taiwan and [[Penghu]] were ceded by the Qing Dynasty to Japan in 1895. Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China at end of [[World War II]], putting Taiwan under a Chinese government again after [[History of Taiwan#Japanese rule|50 years of Japanese rule]]. The ROC would then claim sovereignty on the basis of the Qing dynasty's administration, [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]], [[Potsdam Declaration]], and [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]], but this became contested by pro-independence groups in subsequent years due to different perceptions of the said documents' legality. Upon losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, the ROC government retreated to Taipei, and kept control over a few islands along the coast of [[mainland China]] and in the [[South China Sea]]. The People's Republic of China (PRC) was established in mainland China on 1 October 1949, claiming to be the [[succession of states theory|successor]] to the ROC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&m_id=4 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |accessdate=2 August 2008 |publisher=Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |date=21 February 2000}}</ref>\n\n[[Quemoy]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and [[Wuchiu]] on the coast of [[Fujian|Fukien]], [[Taiping (island)|Taiping]] and [[Pratas]] in the [[South China Sea]], are part of the ROC's present territory, but were not ceded to Japan. Some arguments supporting the independence of Taiwan do not apply to these islands.\n\n=== Cession, retrocession, legal status, and self-determination of Taiwan ===\n[[File:\"Japan\" with inset map \"Formosa and Riu-Kiu Islands\" from A Literary and Historical Atlas of Asia, by J.G. Bartholomew. J.M. Dent and Sons, Ltd. 1912.jpg|thumb|right|230px|According to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] Taiwan was part of Japan at the establishment of the ROC in 1912. The PRC (founded 1 October 1949) argues that the Treaty of Shimonoseki was never valid, saying it was one of several [[unequal treaties]] forced upon the Qing.]]\n{{Anchor|Cession and retrocession|Cession and Retrocession|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self-determination|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self determination|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self-determination of Taiwan|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self determination of Taiwan}}China, during the [[Qing Dynasty]], ceded the island of Taiwan, including [[Penghu]], to Japan \"in perpetuity\" at the end of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895)|First Sino-Japanese War]] by signing the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. In the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] of 1943, the allied powers agreed to have Japan restore \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\", specifically listing \"Formosa\" and Penghu, to the Republic of China after the defeat of Japan. According to both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, this agreement was given legal force by the [[Instrument of Surrender of Japan]] in 1945. The PRC's UN Ambassador, [[Wang Yingfan]], has stated multiple times in the UN general committee: \"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory since antiquity\" and \"both the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 [[Potsdam Declaration]] have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China's sovereignty over Taiwan as a matter of [[international law]].\" The PRC rejects arguments involving the lack of a specific treaty (San Francisco Peace Treaty) transferring Taiwan's sovereignty to China by noting that neither PRC nor ROC was a signatory to any such treaty, making the treaties irrelevant with regard to Chinese claims. Also, according to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, China legally surrendered its sovereignty and jurisdiction over Taiwan (Formosa) forever. So, this treaty therefore renders Japan's declaration of the returning of sovereignty over Taiwan to China as well as the PRC's UN Ambassador, Wang Yingfan's claims regarding China's right to sovereignty over Taiwan, as legally extraneous and unsubstantiated. The US and UK governments also hold that the Cairo Declaration made in 1943 is just a war-time statement of intention and cannot itself transfer the sovereignty of Taiwan from Japan to China.\n\nThe ROC argues that the [[Treaty of Taipei]] implicitly transferred sovereignty of Taiwan to it, however the US State Dept. disagreed with such an interpretation in its 1971 Starr Memorandum.<ref>{{citation |last=Starr |first=Robert I. |title=Legal Status of Taiwan |date=13 July 1971 |url=http://www.taiwanbasic.com/nstatus/starr.htm |accessdate=26 December 2009 | publisher= US State Dept.}}; reprinted as Appendix C of {{cite book |editor-last=Tkacik |editor-first=John J. |title=Rethinking One China |publisher=Heritage Foundation |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780891952701|date=30 October 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==== Legal status dispute under international law ====\n{{Anchor|Legal status dispute under international law|International law|Dispute under international law}}On the other hand, a number of supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] argue that Taiwan was only formally incorporated as a Chinese territory under the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1683, and as a province in 1885. Subsequently, because of the Shimonoseki Treaty of 1895, Taiwan had been ''[[de jure]]'' part of Japan when the ROC was established in 1912 and thus was not part of the Chinese republic. Also, because the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Declaration]] was an unsigned press communiqu\u00e9, the independence advocates argue that the legal effectiveness of the Declaration is highly questionable. Furthermore, they point out that the Instrument of Surrender of Japan was no more than an [[armistice]], a \"[[modus vivendi]]\" in nature, which served as a temporary or provisional agreement that would be replaced with a [[peace treaty]].  Therefore, only a military occupation of Taiwan began on 25 October 1945, and both the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] and [[Treaty of Taipei]] hold legal supremacy over the surrender instrument. These treaties did not transfer the title of Taiwan from Japan to China. According to this argument, the sovereignty of Taiwan was returned to the people of Taiwan when Japan renounced sovereignty of Taiwan in the Treaty of San Francisco (also known as [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], SFPT) in 1951, based on the policy of [[self-determination]] which has been applied to \"territories which detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War\" as defined by article 76b and 77b of the [[United Nations Charter]] and also by the protocol of the [[Yalta Conference]].  The United Nations General Assembly has not been particularly receptive to this argument, and the ROC's applications for admission to the United Nations have been rejected 15 times.<ref>{{cite web |title=UN again rejects Taiwan allies' letter on UN bid |date=2008-04-02 |url=http://www.taiwanembassy.org/UK/ct.asp?xItem=57422&ctNode=3244&mp=132&nowPage=1&pagesize=15 |agency=Central News Agency |publisher=Taipei Representative Office in the UK |accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the interpretation of the peace treaties was used to challenge the legitimacy of the ROC on Taiwan before the 1990s, the introduction of popular elections in Taiwan has compromised this position. Except for the most extreme Taiwan independence supporters, most Taiwanese support the [[popular sovereignty]] theory and no longer see much conflict between this theory of sovereignty and the ROC position. In this sense, the ROC government currently administering Taiwan is not the same ROC which accepted Japanese surrender because the ruling authorities were given [[Mandate (politics)|popular mandate]] by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other is the Taiwanese constituencies. In fact, former president [[Chen Shui-bian]] has been frequently emphasizing the popular sovereignty theory in his speeches.\n\n[[File:The Taiwan State.jpg|thumb|300px|A shopping bag produced by an independence-leaning pastry establishment. The address uses \"State of Taiwan, Taipei County\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u53f0\u7063\u570b\u53f0\u5317\u7e23}}) rather than \"Taiwan Province\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u53f0\u7063\u7701}}) or \"Republic of China\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b}})]]\n\nHowever, as of 2010, the conflict between these two theories still plays a role in internal Taiwanese politics. The popular sovereignty theory, which the [[pan-green coalition]] emphasizes, suggests that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes by means of a popular referendum. The ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[pan-blue coalition]], suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.\n\n== Historical overview ==\n\n=== 1895&ndash;1945&ndash; Japanese rule ===\n[[File:China old map.jpg|thumb|right|A ROC Map, printed in 1926, which showed Taiwan as part of Japan.]]\n\n==== Treaty of Shimonoseki ====\n\n[[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (Formosa) including the [[Pescadores]] were permanently ceded by [[Qing Dynasty]] [[China]] to [[Imperial Japan]] via Articles 2b and 2c of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] on 8 May 1895 in one of what the Chinese term as an [[unequal treaty]]. [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] on the coast of [[Fujian#Quemoy and Matsu|Fukien]], and the [[South China Sea Islands|islands in the South China Sea]] currently administered by the [[Republic of China]] on Taiwan were not part of the cession.\n\nIn 1895, subsequent to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], officials in Taiwan declared independence in the hope of returning the island to Qing rule. The [[Republic of Taiwan (1895)]] collapsed after 12 days due to political infighting, but local leaders continued resistance in the hope of achieving self-rule. The incoming Japanese crushed the island's independence bid in a five-month campaign.\n\nThe [[China|Chinese]] [[Qing Dynasty]] was subsequently overthrown and replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC). Upon the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the ROC declared the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] void in its declaration of war on Japan. The war soon merged with [[World War II]], and Japan was subsequently defeated in 1945 by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], of which the ROC was a part.\n\n==== Potsdam Declaration and surrender of Japan ====\nThe United States entered the War in December 1941. Most military attacks against Japanese installations and Japanese troops in Taiwan were conducted by [[United States]] military forces. At the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]], the U.S., [[United Kingdom]], and the ROC agreed that Taiwan was to be restored to the ROC after the war. This agreement was enunciated in the Cairo Declaration and the [[Potsdam Declaration]], which outlined the terms of Japanese surrender, specified that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.\n\nWhen [[Japan]] unconditionally surrendered, it accepted in its [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.  Japanese troops in Taiwan were directed to surrender to the representatives of the Supreme Allied Commander in the China Theater, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (i.e. the Republic of China military forces) on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], according to the directions of General [[Douglas MacArthur]], head of the United States Military Government, in [[General Order No. 1]], which was issued 2 September 1945. Chief Executive [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] of [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] soon proclaimed \"Taiwan [[Retrocession Day]]\" on 25 October 1945.\n\n=== 1945&ndash;Today &ndash; post-World War II status ===\n\n==== 1947 &ndash; 228 Incident ====\n\nWhen the [[228 Incident]] erupted on 28 February 1947, the U.S. Consulate-General in [[Taipei]] prepared a report in early March, calling for an immediate intervention in the name of the U.S. or the [[United Nations]]. Based on the argument that the Japanese surrender did not formally transfer sovereignty, Taiwan was still legally part of Japan and occupied by the United States (with administrative authority for the occupation delegated to the Chinese Nationalists), and a direct intervention was appropriate for a territory with such status. This proposed intervention, however, was rejected by the [[U.S. State Department]]. In a news report on the aftermath of the ''228 Incident'', some Taiwanese residents were reported to be talking of appealing to the United Nations to put the island under an international mandate, since China's possession of Taiwan had not been formalized by any international treaties by that time and the island was therefore still under belligerent occupation.<ref name=NYT033047>{{cite news |title=FORMOSANS' PLEA FOR RED AID SEEN; Harsh Repression of Revolt Is Expected to Increase Efforts to Escape Rule by China |last=Durdin |first=Tillman |date=30 March 1947 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F1EF63B5F1A7A93C2AA1788D85F438485F9 |accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref><!--archived copyvio requote at https://web.archive.org/web/20070306103355/http://228.lomaji.com/news/033047.html-->\nThey later made a demand for a treaty role to be represented at the forthcoming peace conference on Japan, in the hope of requesting a [[plebiscite]] to determine the island's political future.<ref>{{cite news |title=Formosans Ask Treaty Role |date=5 October 1947 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F5061FFF395E17738DDDAC0894D8415B8788F1D3 |accessdate=2007-10-06 }}</ref><!--archived copyvio requote at https://web.archive.org/web/20070306142800/http://228.lomaji.com/news/100547.html-->\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6c11\u9078\u9996\u90fd\u5e02\u9577\u5433\u4e09\u9023\u65bc1951\u5e74\u52dd\u9078\u5f8c First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|Non-partisan Taiwanese political candidate Wu San-lian (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first [[Taipei city]] mayoral election in January 1951 with his supporters.

In June 1950, President Truman, who had previously given only passive support to Chiang Kai-shek and was prepared to see Taiwan fall into the hands of the [[Chinese Communists]], vowed to stop the spread of communism and sent the [[U.S. Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan Strait]] to prevent the PRC from attacking Taiwan, but also to prevent the ROC from attacking mainland China. He then declared that \"the determination of the future status of Formosa must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations.\"<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=800\n|title=Statement by the President on the Situation in Korea\n|date=27 June 1950\n|publisher=Truman library\n|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref>   President Truman later reaffirmed the position \"that all questions affecting Formosa be settled by peaceful means as envisaged in the [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]\" in his special message to the Congress in July 1950.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=822\n|title=Special Message to the Congress Reporting on the Situation in Korea\n|date=19 July 1950\n|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> The PRC denounced his moves as flagrant interference in the internal affairs of China.\n\nOn 8 September 1950, President Truman ordered [[John Foster Dulles]], then Foreign Policy Advisor to the [[U.S. Secretary of State]], to carry out his decision on \"neutralizing\" Taiwan in drafting the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] ([[San Francisco]] Peace Treaty) of 1951. According to [[George H. Kerr]]'s memoir ''[[Formosa Betrayed (1965 book)|Formosa Betrayed]]'', Dulles devised a plan whereby Japan would first merely renounce its sovereignty over Taiwan without a recipient country to allow the sovereignty over Taiwan to be determined together by the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Soviet Union]], and Republic of China on behalf of other nations on the peace treaty. The question of Taiwan would be taken into the United Nations (which the ROC was [[China and the United Nations|still part]]), if these four parties could not reach into an agreement within one year.\n\n==== 1952 &ndash; Treaty of Peace with Japan (San Francisco) ====\n\nWhen Japan regained sovereignty over itself in 1952 with the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] (San Francisco Peace Treaty) with 48 nations, Japan renounced all claims and title over Taiwan and the Pescadores. Many claim that Japanese sovereignty only terminated at that point.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mandate for Change 1953\u20131956 |publisher=Doubleday & Co., New York |last=Eisenhower |first=Dwight D. |page=461 |url=http://www.taiwanbasic.com/nstatus/eisenhower.htm |oclc=2551357 |date=1963 |quote=The Japanese peace treaty of 1951 ended Japanese sovereignty over the islands but did not formally cede them to \"China,\" either Communist or Nationalist. |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref> Notably absent at the peace conference was the ROC which was expelled from [[mainland China]] in December 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and had retreated to Taiwan. The PRC, which was proclaimed 1 October 1949, was also not invited. The lack of invitation was probably due to the dispute over which government was the legitimate government of China (which both governments claimed to be); however, [[Cold War]] considerations might have played a part as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Some major governments represented in the San Francisco Conference, such as the UK and Soviet Union, had already established relations with the PRC, while others, such as the U.S. and Japan, still held relations with the ROC.\n\nThe UK at that time stated for the record that the San Francisco Peace Treaty \"itself does not determine the future of these islands,\" and therefore the UK, along with [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], was happy to sign the peace treaty.<ref name=taipeitimes20070930>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/09/30/2003381074\n|title=John Tkacik on Taiwan: Taiwan's status remains 'unsettled'\n|date=30 September 2007\n|author=John Tkacik\n|publisher=Taipei Times\n|page=8}}</ref>  One of the major reasons that the delegate from the Soviet Union gave for not signing the treaty was that: \"The draft contains only a reference to the renunciation by Japan of its rights to these territories [Taiwan] but intentionally omits any mention of the further fate of these territories.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 />\n\nArticle 25 of this treaty officially stipulated that only the Allied Powers defined in the treaty could benefit from this treaty. China was not listed as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]; however, article 21 still provided limited benefits from Articles 10 and 14(a)2 for China. Japan's cession of Taiwan is unusual in that no recipient of Taiwan was stated as part of Dulles's plan of \"neutralizing\" Taiwan. The ROC protested its lack of invitation to the San Francisco Peace conference, to no avail.\n\n==== 1952 &ndash; Treaty of Taipei ====\n\nSubsequently, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was concluded between the ROC and Japan on 28 April 1952 (effective 5 August), where Japan basically re-affirmed the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and formalized the peace between the ROC and Japan. It also nullified all previous treaties made between China and Japan.  Article 10 of the treaty specifies:<blockquote>\"For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be [[deem (law)|deemed]] to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).\"</blockquote> However, the ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs George Kung-ch'ao Yeh told the Legislative Yuan after signing the treaty that: \"The delicate international situation makes it that they [Taiwan and Penghu] do not belong to us. Under present circumstances, Japan has no right to transfer [Taiwan] to us; nor can we accept such a transfer from Japan even if she so wishes.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 /> In July 1971 the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s position was, and remains: \"As Taiwan and the Pescadores are not covered by any existing international disposition, sovereignty over the area is an unsettled question subject to future international resolution.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 />\n\n== Question of sovereignty over Taiwan ==\n\n=== Position of the People's Republic of China (PRC) ===\n[[File:Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents (front).jpg|alt=|thumb|350x350px|[[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]].

Therefore the PRC claims that both factions belong to the same sovereign country\u2014China.

The PRC points out the fact that the [[Montevideo Convention]] was only signed by 19 states at the Seventh International Conference of American States. Thus the authority of the United Nations as well as UN Resolutions should supersede the [[Montevideo Convention]]. However, \"When speaking of statehood, one invariably refers to the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States,60 which, laying down what is now considered a rule of customary international law, states that \"[t] he State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other States.\"61 Taiwan indeed satisfies all these criteria for statehood.\"<ref>[https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/chnint8&i=461 Chan, Phil C.

The PRC government is unwilling to negotiate with the ROC government under any formulation other than One-China policy, although a more flexible definition of \"one China\" such as found in the [[1992 consensus]] is possible under PRC policy. The PRC government considers the 1992 consensus a temporary measure to set aside sovereignty disputes and to enable talks.\n\nThe PRC government considers perceived violations of its \"One-China policy\" or inconsistencies with it such as supplying the ROC with arms a violation of its rights to [[territorial integrity]].<ref name=\"pdaily041010\">{{cite news |url = http://english.people.com.cn/200410/10/eng20041010_159539.html |title = China expresses strong indignation for \"US-Taiwan defense conference\": FM spokesman |newspaper=[[People's Daily]] |date = 10 October 2004 }}</ref> International news organizations often report that \"China considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be united with the mainland by force if necessary\", even though the PRC does not explicitly say that Taiwan is a \"renegade province\" in any press releases.

Many argue that the ROC meets all these criteria. However, to make such an argument, one has to reject the PRC's claim of sovereignty over the territory of the [[Taiwan island]], a claim that the PRC has forced all other states to accept as a condition to establish [[diplomatic relations]] with it, as well as severing said relations with the ROC.

It was only in the mid-1930s when both the CCP and KMT realised the future strategic importance of Taiwan that they altered their party positions to make a claim on Taiwan as a part of China. After losing the Civil War against the Communist Party in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, and continued to maintain that their government represented all of China, i.e. both Taiwan and the mainland.\n\nThe position of most supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] is that the PRC is the government of \"China\" and that Taiwan is not part of China, defining \"China\" as only including Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Regarding the ROC, one ideology within Taiwan independence regards the ROC as already an independent, sovereign state, and seeks to amend the ROC's existing name, constitution, and existing framework to reflect the loss of ROC's mainland territory, and transform ROC into a Taiwan state; while another ideology of Taiwan independence regards the ROC as both a military government that has been administering the Taiwan island as a result of post-war [[military occupation]] on behalf of the [[allies of World War II]] since 1945, and a Chinese refugee regime currently in exile on Taiwan since 1949, and seeks to eliminate the ROC and establish a new independent Taiwan state.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party states that Taiwan has never been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that the PRC does not exercise any hold over the 23 million Taiwanese on the island. On the other hand, the position of most [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] supporters is that the [[Chinese Civil War]] is still not over since no peace agreement has ever been signed, and that the current status is a state of [[ceasefire]] between two [[belligerents]] of \"[[One China]]\". Therefore, the current political separation across the Taiwan strait is only temporary and a reunified China including both mainland China and Taiwan will be the result.\n\nThe position of the [[Republic of China]] has been that it is a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereign state. \"Republic of China,\" according to the ROC government's definition, extended to both [[mainland China]] (Including [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) and the island of Taiwan.<ref name=mac>{{cite press release | publisher = Mainland Affairs Council, ROC Executive Yuan |date= 29 March 2005 | title = The Official Position of the Republic of China (Taiwan) on China's Passing of the Anti-secession (Anti-Separation) Law|url =http://www.mac.gov.tw/english/english/anti/mofa940329e.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] unofficially claimed that the government would no longer challenge the rule of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists in mainland China]], the ROC government under [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) rule actively maintained that it was the sole legitimate government of China.  The Courts in Taiwan have never accepted President Lee's statement, primarily due to the reason that the (now defunct) [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] never officially changed the acclaimed national borders. Notably, the People's Republic of China claims that changing the national borders would be \"a precursor to Taiwan independence\".  The task of changing the national borders now requires a constitutional amendment passed by the [[Legislative Yuan]] and ratified by a majority of all eligible ROC voters, which the PRC has implied would constitute grounds for military attack.\n\n[[File:Exit and Entry Permit of Republic of China (Taiwan).jpg|thumb|Exit and Entry Permit Taiwan, Republic of China. This permit is issued by the Republic of China to enable residents of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to travel to Taiwan. The Republic of China refuses to accept [[People's Republic of China passport]]s.]]\nOn the other hand, though the [[constitution of the Republic of China]] promulgated in 1946 does not state exactly what territory it includes, the draft of the constitution of 1925 did individually list the provinces of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]] was not among them, since Taiwan was arguably ''de jure'' part of Japan as the result of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] of 1895. The constitution also stipulated in Article I.4, that \"the territory of the ROC is the original territory governed by it; unless authorized by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], it cannot be altered.\" However, in 1946, [[Sun Fo]], son of [[Sun Yat-Sen]] and the minister of the [[Executive Yuan]] of the ROC, reported to the National Assembly that \"there are two types of territory changes: 1. renouncing territory and 2. annexing new territory. The first example would be the independence of [[Mongolia]], and the second example would be the reclamation of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. Both would be examples of territory changes.\" Japan renounced all rights to Taiwan in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1951 and the [[Treaty of Taipei]] of 1952 without an explicit recipient. While the ROC continuously ruled Taiwan after the government was directed to Taiwan by the [[General Order No. 1]] (1945) to receive Japanese surrender, there has never been a meeting of the ROC National Assembly in making a territory change according to the ROC constitution. The explanatory memorandum to the constitution explained the omission of individually listing the provinces as opposed to the earlier drafts was an act of deliberate ambiguity: as the ROC government does not recognize the validity of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, based on Chiang Kai-shek's [[Denunciation]] of the treaty in the late 1930s, hence (according to this argument) the sovereignty of Taiwan was never disposed by China. A ratification by the ROC National Assembly is therefore unnecessary.\n\nThe [[s:Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]] have mentioned \"Taiwan Province,\" and the now defunct National Assembly passed constitutional amendments that give the people of the \"[[Free Area of the Republic of China]]\", comprising the territories under its current jurisdiction, the sole right, until reunification, to exercise the sovereignty of the Republic through elections<ref name=mac /><ref>{{cite news |title= Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref> of the President and the entire Legislature as well as through elections to ratify amendments to the ROC constitution. Also, Chapter I, Article 2 of the ROC constitution states that \"The sovereignty of the Republic of China shall reside in the whole body of citizens.\" This suggests that the constitution implicitly admits that the sovereignty of the ROC is limited to the areas that it controls even if there is no constitutional amendment that explicitly spells out the ROC's borders.\n\n[[File:Taiwan the Province Government Building.JPG|thumb|The building of the Provincial Government of the Taiwan Province of the Republic of China at Jhongsing Village]]\n[[File:Presidential Office Taipei.jpg|thumb|The Republic of China Presidential Office Building is located in the Zhongzheng District of [[Taipei]].]]\n\nIn 1999, ROC President [[Lee Teng-hui]] proposed a [[Special state-to-state relations|two-state theory]] (\u5169\u570b\u8ad6) in which both the [[Republic of China]] and the People's Republic of China would acknowledge that they are two separate countries with a special diplomatic, cultural and historic relationship.<ref name=2states_1>{{cite news | first=Sanya | last=Bunnag | title=Understanding Taiwan's tactics |date=20 July 1999 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/399381.stm }}</ref><ref name = 2000vote>{{cite journal | author=Willem van Kemenade | title=Taiwan, Voting for Trouble? | journal=The Washington Quarterly | year=2000 | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages=135\u2013151 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v023/23.2kemenade.html | doi=10.1162/016366000560809 }}</ref> This however drew an angry reaction from the PRC who believed that Lee was covertly supporting [[Taiwan independence]].<ref name=2states_2>{{cite news | title=Beijing media ups the ante |date=20 July 1999|publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/399350.stm }}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Chen Shui-bian]] (2000 \u2013 May 2008) fully supported the idea that the \"[[Republic of China]] is an independent, sovereign country\" but held the view that the Republic of China is Taiwan and Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China. This is suggested in his [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]. Due to the necessity of avoiding war with the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] however, President Chen had refrained from formally declaring Taiwan's independence. Government publications have implied that Taiwan refers to the ROC, and \"China\" refers to the PRC.<ref name=mac /> After becoming chairman of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in July 2002, Chen appeared to move further than Lee's special two-state theory and in early August 2002, by putting forward the \"[[one country on each side]]\" concept, he stated that Taiwan may \"go on its own Taiwanese road\" and that \"it is clear that the two sides of the straits are separate countries.\" These statements essentially eliminate any \"special\" factors in the relations and were strongly criticized by opposition parties in Taiwan. President Chen has repeatedly refused to endorse the [[One China policy|One China Principle]] or the more \"flexible\" [[1992 Consensus]] the PRC demands as a precursor to negotiations with the PRC. During Chen's presidency, there had not been any successful attempts to restart negotiations on a semi-official level.\n\nIn the 2008 ROC elections, the people delivered KMT's [[Ma Ying-jeou]] with an election win as well as a sizable majority in the legislature. President Ma, throughout his election campaign, maintained that he would accept the 1992 consensus and promote better relations with the PRC.

On 9 January 1950, the Israeli government extended recognition to the People's Republic of China.

On 25 October 1971, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[UN General Assembly]], which \"decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\"  Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to rejoin the UN, no longer to represent all of China but just the people of the territories it governs, have not made it past committee, largely due to diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC, which claims Resolution 2758 has settled the matter.

The Treaty of Shimonoseki was a [[dispositive treaty]], therefore it is not voidable or nullifiable (this doctrine being that treaties specifying particular actions which can be ''completed,'' once the action ''gets completed,'' ''cannot'' be voided or reversed without a new treaty specifically reversing that clause). Hence, the ''[[unequal treaty doctrine]]'' cannot be applied to this treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} By way of comparison, as 200,000,000 Kuping [[tael]]s were not returned to China from [[Japan]], and [[Korea]] had not become a Chinese-dependent country again, the cession in the treaty was executed and cannot be nullified. The disposition of Formosa and the Pescadores in this treaty was a legitimate cession by conquest, confirmed by treaty, and thus is not a theft, as described as \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\" in Cairo Declaration.\n#It should also be noted that the Qing court exercised effective sovereignty over primarily the west coast of Taiwan only, and even then did not regard the area as an integral part of national Chinese territory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n# The \"Cairo Declaration\" was merely an unsigned press communiqu\u00e9 which does not carry a '''legal status''', while the [[Potsdam Declaration|Potsdam Proclamation]] and [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] are simply [[modus vivendi]] and [[armistice]] that function as temporary records and do not bear legally binding power to transfer sovereignty. Good faith of interpretation only takes place at the level of treaties.\n# The \"retrocession\" proclaimed by ROC in 1945 was legally null and impossible since Taiwan was still ''de jure'' part of Japan before the post-war [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect on 28 April 1952.  Consequently, the announcement of the mass-naturalization of native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens in January 1946 is unjust and void ''[[Ab initio]]''. After the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect, the sovereignty of Taiwan naturally belonged to the Taiwanese people.\n# Some of Taiwan independence supporters once used arguments not in favor of Chinese sovereignty to dispute to legitimacy of the [[Kuomintang]]-controlled government that ruled over Taiwan, they have dropped these arguments due to the democratization of Taiwan. This has allowed the more moderate supporters of independence to stress the [[popular sovereignty]] theory in order to accept the legitimacy of the Republic of China (whose government the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] used to control) in Taiwan.  Former President [[Chen Shui-bian]], by his interpretation of the \"Republic of China\", has repeatedly confirmed that the \"Republic of China is Taiwan.\"\n# Sovereignty transfer to the ROC by [[custom (law)|prescription]] does not apply to Taiwan's case since:\n## Prescription is the manner of acquiring property by a long, honest, and uninterrupted possession or use during the time required by law. The possession must have been ''possessio longa, continua, et pacifica, nec sit ligitima interruptio'' (long, continued, peaceable, and without lawful interruption). For prescription to apply, the state with title to the territory must acquiesce to the action of the other state. Yet, PRC has never established an occupation on Taiwan and exercised sovereignty;\n## Prescription as a rule for acquiring sovereignty itself is not universally accepted.

The ROC, as a founding member of the United Nations, has a treaty obligation to comply with the UN Charter and to help the people living in Taiwan enjoy the right of [[self-determination]].\n# The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] is definitive, where Japan ceded Taiwan (like [[Sakhalin]] and [[Kuril Islands]] etc.) without specifying a clear recipient. China was prohibited{{By whom|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} from acquiring Taiwan sovereignty as a benefit when the treaty was finalized{{Original research inline|date=October 2010}}. Moreover, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] only became effective on 5 August 1952, over three months after the coming into force of the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] on 28 April 1952. Hence, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] cannot be interpreted to have ceded the sovereignty of Taiwan to the ROC or the PRC, but only as a recognition of the territories which ROC had and under its control, as Japan cannot cede what it no longer possessed.\n# Since the peace brokered in the Boxer Protocol of 1901 was breached by the second Sino-Japanese War, the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] specifies that the date to be used in returning territory to China in Article 10 was 1901, not 1895. The [[postliminium]] restoration of China was completed without sovereignty over Taiwan since Taiwan was not part of China when the first Chinese Republic was established in 1911. Moreover, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was abrogated by Japan upon the PRC's request in 1972.\n# Cession of Taiwan without a recipient was neither unusual nor unique, since [[Cuba]], as a precedent, was ceded by Spain without recipient in [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] as the result of [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Cuba reached independence in May 1902.  At the end of WWII, [[Libya]] and [[Somaliland]] were also relinquished without recipient by Italy in the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)|Treaty of peace with Italy of 1947]] and both reached independence later.\n# The Nationality Law of the Republic of China was originally promulgated in February 1929. However, no amendment or change to this law or any other law has ever been made by the Legislative Yuan in the post WWII period to reflect any mass-naturalization of native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens.  This is important because Article 10 of the [[Treaty of Taipei]] specifies: \"For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) ... \" Since no relevant laws or regulations have ever been promulgated, there is no legal basis to consider native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens.\n# Furthermore it is recognized that the ROC government currently administering Taiwan is not the same ROC that accepted Japanese surrender in 1945, because the ruling authorities were given popular mandate by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other local Taiwanese. The popular sovereignty theory, to which the [[Pan-Green coalition]] subscribes, emphasizes that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes and choose a new national title by means of a popular referendum.  (In contrast, the ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[Pan-Blue coalition]] suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.)\n# Nevertheless the popular sovereignty theory does not contradict any arguments in favor of [[self-determination]], nor does it affirm arguments in favor of Chinese sovereignty.  This means that at present the only obstacle against declaring Taiwan independence is a lack of consensus among the Taiwanese people to do so; however it is clear that the consensus is changing as the Taiwanese people begin preparations for their 15th application for entrance to the United Nations in the fall of 2007.\n# The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]]'s omission of China as a participant was not an accident of history, but reflected the status that the ROC had failed to maintain its original position as the ''de jure''{{Which|date=October 2010}} and ''de facto'' government of the whole China.

In 1979, with the U.S. change of diplomatic recognition to the PRC, the ROC lost its ally needed to \"recover the mainland.\" Meanwhile, the PRC's desire to be accepted in the international community led it to promote peaceful unification under what would later be termed \"[[one country, two systems]]\", rather than to \"liberate Taiwan\" and to make Taiwan a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]].\n\n=== PRC's condition on military intervention ===\nNotwithstanding, the PRC government has issued triggers for an immediate war with Taiwan, most notably via its controversial [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|Anti-Secession Law of 2005]].

Both sides have chosen to have a strong naval presence. However, naval strategies between both powers greatly shifted in the 1980s and 1990s, while the ROC assumed a more defensive attitude by building and buying [[frigate]]s and missile [[destroyer]]s, and the PRC a more aggressive posture by developing long-range [[cruise missile]]s and supersonic [[surface-to-surface missile]]s.\n\nAlthough the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] is considered large, most of its fleet consists of older generation [[Chengdu J-7|J-7]] fighters (localized [[MiG-21]]s and Mig-21BIs), raising doubts over the PLAAF's ability to control Taiwan's airspace in the event of a conflict. Since mid-1990s PRC has been purchasing, and later localizing, [[SU-27]] based fighters. These Russian fighters, as well as their Chinese [[Shenyang J-11|J11A]] variants, are currently over 170 in number, and have increased the effectiveness of PLAAF's [[Beyond Visual Range missile|Beyond Visual Range]] (BVR) capabilities. The introduction of 60 new-generation [[Chengdu J-10|J10A]] fighters is anticipated to increase the PLAAF's firepower. PRC's acquisition of Russian [[Sukhoi Su-30|Su30MKKs]] further enhanced the PLAAF's [[air-to-ground]] support ability. The [[Republic of China Air Force|ROC's air force]], on the other hand, relies on Taiwan's fourth generation fighters, consisting of 150 US-built [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s, approximately 60 French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5s]], and approximately 130 locally developed [[AIDC Ching-kuo|IDFs]] (Indigenous Defense Fighters).

Some analysts believed that the PRC could launch [[preemptive strike]]s on military bases in Japan to deter US and Japanese forces from coming to the ROC's aid. Japanese strategic planners also see an independent Taiwan as vital, not only because the ROC controls valuable shipping routes, but also because its capture by PRC would make Japan more vulnerable. During [[World War II]], the US invaded the [[Philippines]], but another viable target to enable direct attacks on Japan would have been Taiwan (then known as Formosa). However, critics of the preemptive strike theory assert that the PRC would be loath to give Japan and the US such an excuse to intervene.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4217193543447225711&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33&sciodt=0,33 Smith, R.

Although the risk of a crisis in the short-term is low, in the absence of new political developments, Taiwan will likely dominate future military modernization and planning. However, also other priorities are becoming increasingly prominent and possible due to increasing military resources. Many of mainland China's most advanced military systems are stationed in areas opposite Taiwan. The rapid military modernization is continually changing the military balance of power towards mainland China.<ref>ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS, Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China, 2011, Office of the Secretary of Defense</ref>\n\nA 2008 report by the [[RAND Corporation]] analyzing a theoretical 2020 attack by mainland China on Taiwan suggested that the US would likely not be able to defend Taiwan.

The current controversy is over the term ''one China'', as the PRC insists that the ROC must recognize this term to begin negotiations.  Although the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has moderated its support for [[Taiwan independence]], there is still insufficient support within that party for former President Chen Shui-bian to agree to one China.  By contrast, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP) appear willing to agree to some variation of one China, and observers believed the position of the PRC was designed to sideline Chen until the [[2004 ROC presidential election|2004 presidential election]] where it was hoped that someone who was more supportive of [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] would come to power.  Partly to counter this, Chen Shui-bian announced in July 2002 that if the PRC does not respond to Taiwan's goodwill, Taiwan may \"go on its own ... road.\" {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\nWhat ROC president, Chen Shui-bian, means by this is that there are other ways of combatting China as a powerful hegemon. For example, \u201cIf Taiwan\u2019s Chen Shui-bian had declared legal independence by a popular referendum, scholars agree that is could have immediately triggered a crisis in China, due to its political sensitivity on the mainland\u201d.<ref>Wei, C.

However, public opinion in Taiwan reacted unfavorably towards the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|anti-secession law]] passed by the PRC in March 2005. Following two high-profile visits by KMT and PFP party leaders to the PRC, the balance of public opinion appears to be ambiguous, with the Pan-Green Coalition gaining a majority in the [[2005 ROC National Assembly election|2005 National Assembly elections]], but the Pan-Blue Coalition scoring a landslide victory in the 2005 municipal elections.\n\nLegislative elections were held in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] on [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|January 12, 2008]]. The results gave the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] an absolute majority (86 of the 113 seats) in the [[Legislative Yuan|legislature]], handing a heavy defeat to President [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s [[Democratic Progressive Party]], which won the remaining 27 seats. The junior partner in the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], won no seats.\n\nThe election for the 12th President of ROC was held on [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|March 22, 2008]]. [[Kuomintang]] candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] won, with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leadership. Along with the 2008 legislative election, Ma's landslide victory brought the Kuomintang back to power in Taiwan. This new political situation has led to a decrease of tension between both sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]] and the increase of [[cross-strait relations]], making a declaration of independence, or war, something unlikely.\n\nTaiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart \u2013 the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait]] (ARATS) signed four agreements in Taipei on 4 November 2008.

In other words, if reunification supporters wanted to reunify Taiwan with mainland China in such a way that would effectively abolish the ROC or affect the ROC's sovereignty, or if independence supporters wanted to abolish the ROC and establish a Republic of Taiwan, they would also need to amend or abolish the ROC constitution and redraft a new constitution.  Passing an amendment requires an unusually broad political consensus, which includes approval from three-quarters of a quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan.  This quorum requires at least three-quarters of all members of the Legislature.  After passing the legislature, the amendments need ratification from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC, ''irrespective'' of voter turnout.\n\nGiven these harsh constitutional requirements, neither the pan-greens nor pan-blues can unilaterally change Taiwan's political and legal status with respect to the ROC's constitution.  However, extreme Taiwan independence supporters view the ROC's constitution as illegal and therefore believe that amendments to the ROC constitution are an invalid way to change Taiwan's political status.\n\n== Note on terminology ==\n\n=== Political status vs. Taiwan issue or Mainland issue ===\nSome scholarly sources as well as political entities like the PRC refer to Taiwan's controversial status as the \"Taiwan question\", \"Taiwan issue\", or \"Taiwan problem\".  The ROC government does not like these terminologies, emphasizing that it should be called the \"'''Mainland issue'''\" or \"Mainland question\", because from the ROC's point of view, the PRC is making an issue out of or creating a problem out of Taiwan.  Others use the term \"Taiwan Strait Issue\" because it implies nothing about sovereignty and because \"[[Cross-Strait relations]]\" is a term used by both the ROC and the PRC to describe their interactions. However, this term is also objectionable to some because it still implies that there is an issue, which they feel is created only by the PRC.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n=== ''De facto'' vs. ''de jure'' and whether ROC ceased to exist ===\nThe use of the terms ''de facto'' and ''[[de jure]]'' to describe Taiwan's as well as the Republic of China's status as a state is itself a contentious issue. This partially stems from the lack of precedents regarding derecognized, but still constitutionally functioning states. For instance, it is argued by Jacques deLisle that Taiwan satisfies three of the four requirements of statehood at international law as stated in the [[Montevideo Convention]]. A state must have distinct and substantial territory which Taiwan is capable of satisfying since it is an island and controls few surrounding islands such as Penghu and Green Island. A state must also have a distinct population and substantial population which Taiwan satisfies by having a population of around 23 million people. A state must also have a government that provides order, does not answer to a higher government or government abroad, thus protecting its relative sovereignty, which Taiwan or the Republic of China satisfies. However, as Delisle states, \u201cThe fourth criterion for state status, according to the Montevideo Convention and customary international law, is the capacity to engage in relations with other states. Here, Taiwan has some troubles on the \u201cformal\u201d side.  No other country formally recognizes Taiwan as a separate state and only a small number of countries (now twenty-three) either recognize the ROC government or merely maintain formal diplomatic relations with it.\u201d <ref>[https://www.fpri.org/docs/media/201107.delisle.taiwan.pdf desLisle, J.

If the latter argument is accepted, then the Republic of China may have ceased to be a state post-1971 as a matter of international law (\"''de jure''\"), yet continued to otherwise function as the state that it previously was recognised as (\"''de facto''\").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, media wire services sometimes describe Taiwan as having de facto independence, whereas the Republic of China has always considered itself as a continuously functioning ''de jure'' state.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Taiwan}}\n{{wikinewspar2|Pentagon report reflects concerns over China's increased military|Chinese General threatens U.S. with nuclear weapons over possible Taiwan Strait conflict, Beijing downplays comment}}\n\n* [[History of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|History of Taiwan under Japanese rule]]\n* [[History of Republic of China]]\n* [[Chinese Civil War]]\n* [[Secession in China]]\n* [[228 Incident]], for historical context of ROC-Taiwanese conflict\n* [[Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan]]\n* [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Taiwan Province]]\n* [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Claimed Taiwan Province of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Taiwan independence]]\n* [[Cross-Strait Unification]]\n* [[Cross-Strait relations]]\n* [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Military Power of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction]]\n* [[People's Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction]]\n* [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC\n* [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the PRC\n* [[Foreign relations of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan in United Nations]]\n* [[Taiwan Relations Act]]\n* [[Three Communiqu\u00e9s]]\n* [[51st state#Taiwan]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bush, R. & O'Hanlon, M.

The ROC, which took control of Taiwan (including Penghu and other nearby islands) in 1945, ruled [[mainland China]] and claimed sovereignty over [[Outer Mongolia]] (now [[Mongolia]]) and [[Tannu Uriankhai]] (part of which is present day [[Tuva]], Russia) before losing the [[Chinese Civil War]] to the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and relocating its government and [[capital city]] from [[Nanjing]] (alternately spelled as \"Nanking\") to [[Taipei]] as [[temporary capital]] in December 1949. The CPC established new government on the mainland as [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in October 1949.\n\nSince the ROC [[China and the United Nations|lost its United Nations seat]] as \"China\" in 1971 ([[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758|replaced]] by the PRC), most sovereign states have switched their diplomatic recognition to the PRC, recognizing the PRC as the representative of all China, though the majority of countries avoid clarifying what territories are meant by \"China\" in order to associate with both the PRC and ROC.  {{Numrec|ROC|asof=S|alt2=the ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with||UN member states}} and the [[Holy See]],<ref name=NewsMalawi>{{cite news | title= Taiwan breaks ties with Malawi | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200801141806.htm|date=14 January 2008 | newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=2 February 2008}}</ref> although informal relations are maintained with nearly all others. Agencies of foreign governments such as the [[American Institute in Taiwan]] operate as ''de facto'' embassies of their home countries in Taiwan, and Taiwan operates similar ''de facto'' embassies and consulates in most countries under such names as \"Taipei Representative Office\" (TRO) or \"Taipei Economic and Cultural (Representative) Office\" (TECO). In certain contexts, Taiwan is also referred to as [[Chinese Taipei]].\n\nThe ROC government has in the past actively pursued the claim as the sole legitimate government over mainland China and Taiwan. This position began to change in the early 1990s as democracy was introduced and new Taiwanese leaders were elected, changing to one that does not actively challenge the legitimacy of PRC rule over mainland China.  Both the PRC and the ROC carry out [[Cross-Strait relations]] through specialized agencies (such as the [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC), rather than through foreign ministries. Different groups have different concepts of what the current formal political situation of Taiwan is. (''See also: [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]], [[Taiwan independence]], and [[Cross-Strait relations]]'')\n\nIn addition, the situation can be confusing because of the different parties and the effort by many groups to deal with the controversy through a [[policy of deliberate ambiguity]].  The political solution that is accepted by many of the current groups is the perspective of the status quo: to unofficially treat Taiwan as a state and at a minimum, to officially declare no support for the government of this state making a formal declaration of independence. What a formal declaration of independence would consist of is not clear and can be confusing given the fact that the People's Republic of China has never controlled Taiwan and the Republic of China still exists, albeit on a decreased scale.\n\nThe status quo is accepted in large part because it does not define the legal or future status of Taiwan, leaving each group to interpret the situation in a way that is politically acceptable to its members.  At the same time, a policy of status quo has been criticized as being dangerous precisely because different sides have different interpretations of what the status quo is, leading to the possibility of war through [[brinkmanship]] or miscalculation. The People's Republic Of China seeks to end Taiwan's de facto independence through the process of reunification. If Taiwan refuses this process, The People's Republic of China is prepared to use force through military means, in order to achieve unification. <ref>https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/FP_20190226_taiwan_bush_hass.pdf\n</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|History of Taiwan}}\n\nTaiwan (excluding [[Penghu]]) was first populated by [[Austronesian people]] and was colonized by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], who had arrived in 1623. The [[Kingdom of Tungning]], lasting from 1661 to 1683, was the first [[Han Chinese]] government to rule [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. From 1683, the [[Qing Dynasty]] ruled [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] as a [[prefecture]] and in 1875 divided the island into two prefectures. In 1885 the island was made into a separate [[Chinese province]] to speed up development in this region. In the aftermath of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Taiwan and [[Penghu]] were ceded by the Qing Dynasty to Japan in 1895. Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered to the Republic of China at end of [[World War II]], putting Taiwan under a Chinese government again after [[History of Taiwan#Japanese rule|50 years of Japanese rule]]. The ROC would then claim sovereignty on the basis of the Qing dynasty's administration, [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]], [[Potsdam Declaration]], and [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]], but this became contested by pro-independence groups in subsequent years due to different perceptions of the said documents' legality. Upon losing the Chinese civil war in 1949, the ROC government retreated to Taipei, and kept control over a few islands along the coast of [[mainland China]] and in the [[South China Sea]]. The People's Republic of China (PRC) was established in mainland China on 1 October 1949, claiming to be the [[succession of states theory|successor]] to the ROC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=WhitePaper&title=White%20Papers%20On%20Taiwan%20Issue&m_id=4 |title=The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue |accessdate=2 August 2008 |publisher=Taiwan Affairs Office and the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |date=21 February 2000}}</ref>\n\n[[Quemoy]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and [[Wuchiu]] on the coast of [[Fujian|Fukien]], [[Taiping (island)|Taiping]] and [[Pratas]] in the [[South China Sea]], are part of the ROC's present territory, but were not ceded to Japan. Some arguments supporting the independence of Taiwan do not apply to these islands.\n\n=== Cession, retrocession, legal status, and self-determination of Taiwan ===\n[[File:\"Japan\" with inset map \"Formosa and Riu-Kiu Islands\" from A Literary and Historical Atlas of Asia, by J.G. Bartholomew. J.M. Dent and Sons, Ltd. 1912.jpg|thumb|right|230px|According to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] Taiwan was part of Japan at the establishment of the ROC in 1912. The PRC (founded 1 October 1949) argues that the Treaty of Shimonoseki was never valid, saying it was one of several [[unequal treaties]] forced upon the Qing.]]\n{{Anchor|Cession and retrocession|Cession and Retrocession|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self-determination|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self determination|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self-determination of Taiwan|Cession, retrocession, legal status and self determination of Taiwan}}China, during the [[Qing Dynasty]], ceded the island of Taiwan, including [[Penghu]], to Japan \"in perpetuity\" at the end of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895)|First Sino-Japanese War]] by signing the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. In the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] of 1943, the allied powers agreed to have Japan restore \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\", specifically listing \"Formosa\" and Penghu, to the Republic of China after the defeat of Japan. According to both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, this agreement was given legal force by the [[Instrument of Surrender of Japan]] in 1945. The PRC's UN Ambassador, [[Wang Yingfan]], has stated multiple times in the UN general committee: \"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory since antiquity\" and \"both the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 [[Potsdam Declaration]] have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China's sovereignty over Taiwan as a matter of [[international law]].\" The PRC rejects arguments involving the lack of a specific treaty (San Francisco Peace Treaty) transferring Taiwan's sovereignty to China by noting that neither PRC nor ROC was a signatory to any such treaty, making the treaties irrelevant with regard to Chinese claims. Also, according to the Treaty of Shimonoseki, China legally surrendered its sovereignty and jurisdiction over Taiwan (Formosa) forever. So, this treaty therefore renders Japan's declaration of the returning of sovereignty over Taiwan to China as well as the PRC's UN Ambassador, Wang Yingfan's claims regarding China's right to sovereignty over Taiwan, as legally extraneous and unsubstantiated. The US and UK governments also hold that the Cairo Declaration made in 1943 is just a war-time statement of intention and cannot itself transfer the sovereignty of Taiwan from Japan to China.\n\nThe ROC argues that the [[Treaty of Taipei]] implicitly transferred sovereignty of Taiwan to it, however the US State Dept. disagreed with such an interpretation in its 1971 Starr Memorandum.<ref>{{citation |last=Starr |first=Robert I. |title=Legal Status of Taiwan |date=13 July 1971 |url=http://www.taiwanbasic.com/nstatus/starr.htm |accessdate=26 December 2009 | publisher= US State Dept.}}; reprinted as Appendix C of {{cite book |editor-last=Tkacik |editor-first=John J. |title=Rethinking One China |publisher=Heritage Foundation |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=9780891952701|date=30 October 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==== Legal status dispute under international law ====\n{{Anchor|Legal status dispute under international law|International law|Dispute under international law}}On the other hand, a number of supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] argue that Taiwan was only formally incorporated as a Chinese territory under the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1683, and as a province in 1885. Subsequently, because of the Shimonoseki Treaty of 1895, Taiwan had been ''[[de jure]]'' part of Japan when the ROC was established in 1912 and thus was not part of the Chinese republic. Also, because the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Declaration]] was an unsigned press communiqu\u00e9, the independence advocates argue that the legal effectiveness of the Declaration is highly questionable. Furthermore, they point out that the Instrument of Surrender of Japan was no more than an [[armistice]], a \"[[modus vivendi]]\" in nature, which served as a temporary or provisional agreement that would be replaced with a [[peace treaty]].  Therefore, only a military occupation of Taiwan began on 25 October 1945, and both the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] and [[Treaty of Taipei]] hold legal supremacy over the surrender instrument. These treaties did not transfer the title of Taiwan from Japan to China. According to this argument, the sovereignty of Taiwan was returned to the people of Taiwan when Japan renounced sovereignty of Taiwan in the Treaty of San Francisco (also known as [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]], SFPT) in 1951, based on the policy of [[self-determination]] which has been applied to \"territories which detached from enemy states as a result of the Second World War\" as defined by article 76b and 77b of the [[United Nations Charter]] and also by the protocol of the [[Yalta Conference]].  The United Nations General Assembly has not been particularly receptive to this argument, and the ROC's applications for admission to the United Nations have been rejected 15 times.<ref>{{cite web |title=UN again rejects Taiwan allies' letter on UN bid |date=2008-04-02 |url=http://www.taiwanembassy.org/UK/ct.asp?xItem=57422&ctNode=3244&mp=132&nowPage=1&pagesize=15 |agency=Central News Agency |publisher=Taipei Representative Office in the UK |accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the interpretation of the peace treaties was used to challenge the legitimacy of the ROC on Taiwan before the 1990s, the introduction of popular elections in Taiwan has compromised this position. Except for the most extreme Taiwan independence supporters, most Taiwanese support the [[popular sovereignty]] theory and no longer see much conflict between this theory of sovereignty and the ROC position. In this sense, the ROC government currently administering Taiwan is not the same ROC which accepted Japanese surrender because the ruling authorities were given [[Mandate (politics)|popular mandate]] by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other is the Taiwanese constituencies. In fact, former president [[Chen Shui-bian]] has been frequently emphasizing the popular sovereignty theory in his speeches.\n\n[[File:The Taiwan State.jpg|thumb|300px|A shopping bag produced by an independence-leaning pastry establishment. The address uses \"State of Taiwan, Taipei County\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u53f0\u7063\u570b\u53f0\u5317\u7e23}}) rather than \"Taiwan Province\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u53f0\u7063\u7701}}) or \"Republic of China\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b}})]]\n\nHowever, as of 2010, the conflict between these two theories still plays a role in internal Taiwanese politics. The popular sovereignty theory, which the [[pan-green coalition]] emphasizes, suggests that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes by means of a popular referendum. The ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[pan-blue coalition]], suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.\n\n== Historical overview ==\n\n=== 1895&ndash;1945&ndash; Japanese rule ===\n[[File:China old map.jpg|thumb|right|A ROC Map, printed in 1926, which showed Taiwan as part of Japan.]]\n\n==== Treaty of Shimonoseki ====\n\n[[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (Formosa) including the [[Pescadores]] were permanently ceded by [[Qing Dynasty]] [[China]] to [[Imperial Japan]] via Articles 2b and 2c of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in 8 May 1895 in one of what the Chinese term as an [[unequal treaty]]. [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands]] on the coast of [[Fujian#Quemoy and Matsu|Fukien]], and the [[South China Sea Islands|islands in the South China Sea]] currently administered by the [[Republic of China]] on Taiwan were not part of the cession.\n\nIn 1895, subsequent to the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]], officials in Taiwan declared independence in the hope of returning the island to Qing rule. The [[Republic of Taiwan (1895)]] collapsed after 12 days due to political infighting, but local leaders continued resistance in the hope of achieving self-rule. The incoming Japanese crushed the island's independence bid in a five-month campaign.\n\nThe [[China|Chinese]] [[Qing Dynasty]] was subsequently overthrown and replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] (ROC). Upon the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the ROC declared the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] void in its declaration of war on Japan. The war soon merged with [[World War II]], and Japan was subsequently defeated in 1945 by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], of which the ROC was a part.\n\n==== Potsdam Declaration and surrender of Japan ====\nThe United States entered the War in December 1941. Most military attacks against Japanese installations and Japanese troops in Taiwan were conducted by [[United States]] military forces. At the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]], the U.S., [[United Kingdom]], and the ROC agreed that Taiwan was to be restored to the ROC after the war. This agreement was enunciated in the Cairo Declaration and the [[Potsdam Declaration]], which outlined the terms of Japanese surrender, specified that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out.\n\nWhen [[Japan]] unconditionally surrendered, it accepted in its [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] the terms of the Potsdam Declaration.  Japanese troops in Taiwan were directed to surrender to the representatives of the Supreme Allied Commander in the China Theater, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (i.e. the Republic of China military forces) on behalf of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], according to the directions of General [[Douglas MacArthur]], head of the United States Military Government, in [[General Order No. 1]], which was issued 2 September 1945. Chief Executive [[Chen Yi (Kuomintang)|Chen Yi]] of [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] soon proclaimed \"Taiwan [[Retrocession Day]]\" on 25 October 1945.\n\n=== 1945&ndash;Today &ndash; post-World War II status ===\n\n==== 1947 &ndash; 228 Incident ====\n\nWhen the [[228 Incident]] erupted on 28 February 1947, the U.S. Consulate-General in [[Taipei]] prepared a report in early March, calling for an immediate intervention in the name of the U.S. or the [[United Nations]]. Based on the argument that the Japanese surrender did not formally transfer sovereignty, Taiwan was still legally part of Japan and occupied by the United States (with administrative authority for the occupation delegated to the Chinese Nationalists), and a direct intervention was appropriate for a territory with such status. This proposed intervention, however, was rejected by the [[U.S. State Department]]. In a news report on the aftermath of the ''228 Incident'', some Taiwanese residents were reported to be talking of appealing to the United Nations to put the island under an international mandate, since China's possession of Taiwan had not been formalized by any international treaties by that time and the island was therefore still under belligerent occupation.<ref name=NYT033047>{{cite news |title=FORMOSANS' PLEA FOR RED AID SEEN; Harsh Repression of Revolt Is Expected to Increase Efforts to Escape Rule by China |last=Durdin |first=Tillman |date=30 March 1947 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F1EF63B5F1A7A93C2AA1788D85F438485F9 |accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref><!--archived copyvio requote at https://web.archive.org/web/20070306103355/http://228.lomaji.com/news/033047.html-->\nThey later made a demand for a treaty role to be represented at the forthcoming peace conference on Japan, in the hope of requesting a [[plebiscite]] to determine the island's political future.<ref>{{cite news |title=Formosans Ask Treaty Role |date=5 October 1947 |newspaper=New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F5061FFF395E17738DDDAC0894D8415B8788F1D3 |accessdate=2007-10-06 }}</ref><!--archived copyvio requote at https://web.archive.org/web/20070306142800/http://228.lomaji.com/news/100547.html-->\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u83ef\u6c11\u570b\u7b2c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6c11\u9078\u9996\u90fd\u5e02\u9577\u5433\u4e09\u9023\u65bc1951\u5e74\u52dd\u9078\u5f8c First People-elected Mayor of Taipei, the Capital of TAIWAN.jpg|thumb|Non-partisan Taiwanese political candidate Wu San-lian (2L) celebrated his landslide victory (65.5%) in the first [[Taipei city]] mayoral election in January 1951 with his supporters.

In June 1950, President Truman, who had previously given only passive support to Chiang Kai-shek and was prepared to see Taiwan fall into the hands of the [[Chinese Communists]], vowed to stop the spread of communism and sent the [[U.S. Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan Strait]] to prevent the PRC from attacking Taiwan, but also to prevent the ROC from attacking mainland China. He then declared that \"the determination of the future status of Formosa must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, a peace settlement with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations.\"<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=800\n|title=Statement by the President on the Situation in Korea\n|date=27 June 1950\n|publisher=Truman library\n|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref>   President Truman later reaffirmed the position \"that all questions affecting Formosa be settled by peaceful means as envisaged in the [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]]\" in his special message to the Congress in July 1950.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/viewpapers.php?pid=822\n|title=Special Message to the Congress Reporting on the Situation in Korea\n|date=19 July 1950\n|accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref> The PRC denounced his moves as flagrant interference in the internal affairs of China.\n\nOn 8 September 1950, President Truman ordered [[John Foster Dulles]], then Foreign Policy Advisor to the [[U.S. Secretary of State]], to carry out his decision on \"neutralizing\" Taiwan in drafting the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] ([[San Francisco]] Peace Treaty) of 1951. According to [[George H. Kerr]]'s memoir ''[[Formosa Betrayed (1965 book)|Formosa Betrayed]]'', Dulles devised a plan whereby Japan would first merely renounce its sovereignty over Taiwan without a recipient country to allow the sovereignty over Taiwan to be determined together by the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], [[Soviet Union]], and Republic of China on behalf of other nations on the peace treaty. The question of Taiwan would be taken into the United Nations (which the ROC was [[China and the United Nations|still part]]), if these four parties could not reach into an agreement within one year.\n\n==== 1952 &ndash; Treaty of Peace with Japan (San Francisco) ====\n\nWhen Japan regained sovereignty over itself in 1952 with the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Peace with Japan]] (San Francisco Peace Treaty) with 48 nations, Japan renounced all claims and title over Taiwan and the Pescadores. Many claim that Japanese sovereignty only terminated at that point.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mandate for Change 1953\u20131956 |publisher=Doubleday & Co., New York |last=Eisenhower |first=Dwight D. |page=461 |url=http://www.taiwanbasic.com/nstatus/eisenhower.htm |oclc=2551357 |date=1963 |quote=The Japanese peace treaty of 1951 ended Japanese sovereignty over the islands but did not formally cede them to \"China,\" either Communist or Nationalist. |accessdate=2011-07-07}}</ref> Notably absent at the peace conference was the ROC which was expelled from [[mainland China]] in December 1949 as a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and had retreated to Taiwan. The PRC, which was proclaimed 1 October 1949, was also not invited. The lack of invitation was probably due to the dispute over which government was the legitimate government of China (which both governments claimed to be); however, [[Cold War]] considerations might have played a part as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Some major governments represented in the San Francisco Conference, such as the UK and Soviet Union, had already established relations with the PRC, while others, such as the U.S. and Japan, still held relations with the ROC.\n\nThe UK at that time stated for the record that the San Francisco Peace Treaty \"itself does not determine the future of these islands,\" and therefore the UK, along with [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], was happy to sign the peace treaty.<ref name=taipeitimes20070930>{{Citation\n|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/09/30/2003381074\n|title=John Tkacik on Taiwan: Taiwan's status remains 'unsettled'\n|date=30 September 2007\n|author=John Tkacik\n|publisher=Taipei Times\n|page=8}}</ref>  One of the major reasons that the delegate from the Soviet Union gave for not signing the treaty was that: \"The draft contains only a reference to the renunciation by Japan of its rights to these territories [Taiwan] but intentionally omits any mention of the further fate of these territories.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 />\n\nArticle 25 of this treaty officially stipulated that only the Allied Powers defined in the treaty could benefit from this treaty. China was not listed as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]]; however, article 21 still provided limited benefits from Articles 10 and 14(a)2 for China. Japan's cession of Taiwan is unusual in that no recipient of Taiwan was stated as part of Dulles's plan of \"neutralizing\" Taiwan. The ROC protested its lack of invitation to the San Francisco Peace conference, to no avail.\n\n==== 1952 &ndash; Treaty of Taipei ====\n\nSubsequently, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was concluded between the ROC and Japan on 28 April 1952 (effective 5 August), where Japan basically re-affirmed the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and formalized the peace between the ROC and Japan. It also nullified all previous treaties made between China and Japan.  Article 10 of the treaty specifies:<blockquote>\"For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be [[deem (law)|deemed]] to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores).\"</blockquote> However, the ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs George Kung-ch'ao Yeh told the Legislative Yuan after signing the treaty that: \"The delicate international situation makes it that they [Taiwan and Penghu] do not belong to us. Under present circumstances, Japan has no right to transfer [Taiwan] to us; nor can we accept such a transfer from Japan even if she so wishes.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 /> In July 1971 the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]]'s position was, and remains: \"As Taiwan and the Pescadores are not covered by any existing international disposition, sovereignty over the area is an unsettled question subject to future international resolution.\"<ref name=taipeitimes20070930 />\n\n== Question of sovereignty over Taiwan ==\n\n=== Position of the People's Republic of China (PRC) ===\n[[File:Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents (front).jpg|alt=|thumb|350x350px|[[Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents]].

The PRC points out the fact that the [[Montevideo Convention]] was only signed by 19 states at the Seventh International Conference of American States. Thus the authority of the United Nations as well as UN Resolutions should supersede the [[Montevideo Convention]]. However, \"When speaking of statehood, one invariably refers to the 1933 Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States,60 which, laying down what is now considered a rule of customary international law, states that \"[t] he State as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with other States.\"61 Taiwan indeed satisfies all these criteria for statehood.\"<ref>[https://heinonline.org/HOL/P?h=hein.journals/chnint8&i=461 Chan, Phil C.

The PRC government considers the 1992 consensus a temporary measure to set aside sovereignty disputes and to enable talks.\n\nThe PRC government considers perceived violations of its \"One-China policy\" or inconsistencies with it such as supplying the ROC with arms a violation of its rights to [[territorial integrity]].<ref name=\"pdaily041010\">{{cite news |url = http://english.people.com.cn/200410/10/eng20041010_159539.html |title = China expresses strong indignation for \"US-Taiwan defense conference\": FM spokesman |newspaper=[[People's Daily]] |date = 10 October 2004 }}</ref> International news organizations often report that \"China considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be united with the mainland by force if necessary\", even though the PRC does not explicitly say that Taiwan is a \"renegade province\" in any press releases.

However, to make such an argument, one has to reject the PRC's claim of sovereignty over the territory of the [[Taiwan island]], a claim that the PRC has forced all other states to accept as a condition to establish [[diplomatic relations]] with it, as well as severing said relations with the ROC.

It was only in the mid-1930s when both the CCP and KMT realised the future strategic importance of Taiwan that they altered their party positions to make a claim on Taiwan as a part of China. After losing the Civil War against the Communist Party in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party fled to Taiwan, and continued to maintain that their government represented all of China, i.e. both Taiwan and the mainland.\n\nThe position of most supporters of [[Taiwan independence]] is that the PRC is the government of \"China\" and that Taiwan is not part of China, defining \"China\" as only including Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. Regarding the ROC, one ideology within Taiwan independence regards the ROC as already an independent, sovereign state, and seeks to amend the ROC's existing name, constitution, and existing framework to reflect the loss of ROC's mainland territory, and transform ROC into a Taiwan state; while another ideology of Taiwan independence regards the ROC as both a military government that has been administering the Taiwan island as a result of post-war [[military occupation]] on behalf of the [[allies of World War II]] since 1945, and a Chinese refugee regime currently in exile on Taiwan since 1949, and seeks to eliminate the ROC and establish a new independent Taiwan state.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Party states that Taiwan has never been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that the PRC does not exercise any hold over the 23 million Taiwanese on the island. On the other hand, the position of most [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] supporters is that the [[Chinese Civil War]] is still not over since no peace agreement has ever been signed, and that the current status is a state of [[ceasefire]] between two [[belligerents]] of \"[[One China]]\". Therefore, the current political separation across the Taiwan strait is only temporary and a reunified China including both mainland China and Taiwan will be the result.\n\nThe position of the [[Republic of China]] has been that it is a ''[[de jure]]'' sovereign state. \"Republic of China,\" according to the ROC government's definition, extended to both [[mainland China]] (Including [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]) and the island of Taiwan.<ref name=mac>{{cite press release | publisher = Mainland Affairs Council, ROC Executive Yuan |date= 29 March 2005 | title = The Official Position of the Republic of China (Taiwan) on China's Passing of the Anti-secession (Anti-Separation) Law|url =http://www.mac.gov.tw/english/english/anti/mofa940329e.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Lee Teng-hui]] unofficially claimed that the government would no longer challenge the rule of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists in mainland China]], the ROC government under [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) rule actively maintained that it was the sole legitimate government of China.  The Courts in Taiwan have never accepted President Lee's statement, primarily due to the reason that the (now defunct) [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] never officially changed the acclaimed national borders. Notably, the People's Republic of China claims that changing the national borders would be \"a precursor to Taiwan independence\".  The task of changing the national borders now requires a constitutional amendment passed by the [[Legislative Yuan]] and ratified by a majority of all eligible ROC voters, which the PRC has implied would constitute grounds for military attack.\n\n[[File:Exit and Entry Permit of Republic of China (Taiwan).jpg|thumb|Exit and Entry Permit Taiwan, Republic of China. This permit is issued by the Republic of China to enable residents of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to travel to Taiwan. The Republic of China refuses to accept [[People's Republic of China passport]]s.]]\nOn the other hand, though the [[constitution of the Republic of China]] promulgated in 1946 does not state exactly what territory it includes, the draft of the constitution of 1925 did individually list the provinces of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and [[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]] was not among them, since Taiwan was arguably ''de jure'' part of Japan as the result of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] of 1895. The constitution also stipulated in Article I.4, that \"the territory of the ROC is the original territory governed by it; unless authorized by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]], it cannot be altered.\" However, in 1946, [[Sun Fo]], son of [[Sun Yat-Sen]] and the minister of the [[Executive Yuan]] of the ROC, reported to the National Assembly that \"there are two types of territory changes: 1. renouncing territory and 2. annexing new territory. The first example would be the independence of [[Mongolia]], and the second example would be the reclamation of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]]. Both would be examples of territory changes.\" Japan renounced all rights to Taiwan in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1951 and the [[Treaty of Taipei]] of 1952 without an explicit recipient. While the ROC continuously ruled Taiwan after the government was directed to Taiwan by the [[General Order No. 1]] (1945) to receive Japanese surrender, there has never been a meeting of the ROC National Assembly in making a territory change according to the ROC constitution. The explanatory memorandum to the constitution explained the omission of individually listing the provinces as opposed to the earlier drafts was an act of deliberate ambiguity: as the ROC government does not recognize the validity of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, based on Chiang Kai-shek's [[Denunciation]] of the treaty in the late 1930s, hence (according to this argument) the sovereignty of Taiwan was never disposed by China. A ratification by the ROC National Assembly is therefore unnecessary.\n\nThe [[s:Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China|Additional Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China]] have mentioned \"Taiwan Province,\" and the now defunct National Assembly passed constitutional amendments that give the people of the \"[[Free Area of the Republic of China]]\", comprising the territories under its current jurisdiction, the sole right, until reunification, to exercise the sovereignty of the Republic through elections<ref name=mac /><ref>{{cite news |title= Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref> of the President and the entire Legislature as well as through elections to ratify amendments to the ROC constitution. Also, Chapter I, Article 2 of the ROC constitution states that \"The sovereignty of the Republic of China shall reside in the whole body of citizens.\" This suggests that the constitution implicitly admits that the sovereignty of the ROC is limited to the areas that it controls even if there is no constitutional amendment that explicitly spells out the ROC's borders.\n\n[[File:Taiwan the Province Government Building.JPG|thumb|The building of the Provincial Government of the Taiwan Province of the Republic of China at Jhongsing Village]]\n[[File:Presidential Office Taipei.jpg|thumb|The Republic of China Presidential Office Building is located in the Zhongzheng District of [[Taipei]].]]\n\nIn 1999, ROC President [[Lee Teng-hui]] proposed a [[Special state-to-state relations|two-state theory]] (\u5169\u570b\u8ad6) in which both the [[Republic of China]] and the People's Republic of China would acknowledge that they are two separate countries with a special diplomatic, cultural and historic relationship.<ref name=2states_1>{{cite news | first=Sanya | last=Bunnag | title=Understanding Taiwan's tactics |date=20 July 1999 | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/399381.stm }}</ref><ref name = 2000vote>{{cite journal | author=Willem van Kemenade | title=Taiwan, Voting for Trouble? | journal=The Washington Quarterly | year=2000 | volume=23 | issue=2 | pages=135\u2013151 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/washington_quarterly/v023/23.2kemenade.html | doi=10.1162/016366000560809 }}</ref> This however drew an angry reaction from the PRC who believed that Lee was covertly supporting [[Taiwan independence]].<ref name=2states_2>{{cite news | title=Beijing media ups the ante |date=20 July 1999|publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/399350.stm }}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Chen Shui-bian]] (2000 \u2013 May 2008) fully supported the idea that the \"[[Republic of China]] is an independent, sovereign country\" but held the view that the Republic of China is Taiwan and Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China. This is suggested in his [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]. Due to the necessity of avoiding war with the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] however, President Chen had refrained from formally declaring Taiwan's independence. Government publications have implied that Taiwan refers to the ROC, and \"China\" refers to the PRC.<ref name=mac /> After becoming chairman of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in July 2002, Chen appeared to move further than Lee's special two-state theory and in early August 2002, by putting forward the \"[[one country on each side]]\" concept, he stated that Taiwan may \"go on its own Taiwanese road\" and that \"it is clear that the two sides of the straits are separate countries.\" These statements essentially eliminate any \"special\" factors in the relations and were strongly criticized by opposition parties in Taiwan. President Chen has repeatedly refused to endorse the [[One China policy|One China Principle]] or the more \"flexible\" [[1992 Consensus]] the PRC demands as a precursor to negotiations with the PRC. During Chen's presidency, there had not been any successful attempts to restart negotiations on a semi-official level.\n\nIn the 2008 ROC elections, the people delivered KMT's [[Ma Ying-jeou]] with an election win as well as a sizable majority in the legislature. President Ma, throughout his election campaign, maintained that he would accept the 1992 consensus and promote better relations with the PRC. In respect of Taiwan political status, his policy was 1. he would not negotiate with the PRC on the subject of reunification during his term; 2. he would never declare Taiwan independence; and 3. he would not provoke the PRC into attacking Taiwan. He officially accepted the 1992 Consensus in his inauguration speech which resulted in direct semi-official talks with the PRC, and this later led to the commencement of weekend direct charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan.

[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505]], passed on 1 February 1952 considered the Chinese communists to be rebels against the Republic of China. However, the 1970s saw a switch in diplomatic recognitions from the ROC to the PRC. On 25 October 1971, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]] was passed by the [[UN General Assembly]], which \"decides to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\"  Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to rejoin the UN, no longer to represent all of China but just the people of the territories it governs, have not made it past committee, largely due to diplomatic maneuvering by the PRC, which claims Resolution 2758 has settled the matter. (''See [[China and the United Nations]].'')\n\nThe PRC refuses to maintain diplomatic relations with any nation that recognizes the ROC,<ref name = prc_wp /> but does not object to nations conducting economic, cultural, and other such exchanges with Taiwan that do not imply diplomatic relation. Therefore, many nations that have diplomatic relations with Beijing maintain quasi-diplomatic offices in Taipei.

Hence, the ''[[unequal treaty doctrine]]'' cannot be applied to this treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} By way of comparison, as 200,000,000 Kuping [[tael]]s were not returned to China from [[Japan]], and [[Korea]] had not become a Chinese-dependent country again, the cession in the treaty was executed and cannot be nullified. The disposition of Formosa and the Pescadores in this treaty was a legitimate cession by conquest, confirmed by treaty, and thus is not a theft, as described as \"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\" in Cairo Declaration.\n#It should also be noted that the Qing court exercised effective sovereignty over primarily the west coast of Taiwan only, and even then did not regard the area as an integral part of national Chinese territory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n# The \"Cairo Declaration\" was merely an unsigned press communiqu\u00e9 which does not carry a '''legal status''', while the [[Potsdam Declaration|Potsdam Proclamation]] and [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]] are simply [[modus vivendi]] and [[armistice]] that function as temporary records and do not bear legally binding power to transfer sovereignty. Good faith of interpretation only takes place at the level of treaties.\n# The \"retrocession\" proclaimed by ROC in 1945 was legally null and impossible since Taiwan was still ''de jure'' part of Japan before the post-war [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect on 28 April 1952.  Consequently, the announcement of the mass-naturalization of native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens in January 1946 is unjust and void ''[[Ab initio]]''. After the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect, the sovereignty of Taiwan naturally belonged to the Taiwanese people.\n# Some of Taiwan independence supporters once used arguments not in favor of Chinese sovereignty to dispute to legitimacy of the [[Kuomintang]]-controlled government that ruled over Taiwan, they have dropped these arguments due to the democratization of Taiwan. This has allowed the more moderate supporters of independence to stress the [[popular sovereignty]] theory in order to accept the legitimacy of the Republic of China (whose government the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] used to control) in Taiwan.  Former President [[Chen Shui-bian]], by his interpretation of the \"Republic of China\", has repeatedly confirmed that the \"Republic of China is Taiwan.\"\n# Sovereignty transfer to the ROC by [[custom (law)|prescription]] does not apply to Taiwan's case since:\n## Prescription is the manner of acquiring property by a long, honest, and uninterrupted possession or use during the time required by law.

For prescription to apply, the state with title to the territory must acquiesce to the action of the other state. Yet, PRC has never established an occupation on Taiwan and exercised sovereignty;\n## Prescription as a rule for acquiring sovereignty itself is not universally accepted.

Moreover, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] only became effective on 5 August 1952, over three months after the coming into force of the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] on 28 April 1952.

The [[postliminium]] restoration of China was completed without sovereignty over Taiwan since Taiwan was not part of China when the first Chinese Republic was established in 1911. Moreover, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was abrogated by Japan upon the PRC's request in 1972.\n# Cession of Taiwan without a recipient was neither unusual nor unique, since [[Cuba]], as a precedent, was ceded by Spain without recipient in [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]] as the result of [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Cuba reached independence in May 1902.  At the end of WWII, [[Libya]] and [[Somaliland]] were also relinquished without recipient by Italy in the [[Treaty of peace with Italy (1947)|Treaty of peace with Italy of 1947]] and both reached independence later.\n# The Nationality Law of the Republic of China was originally promulgated in February 1929. However, no amendment or change to this law or any other law has ever been made by the Legislative Yuan in the post WWII period to reflect any mass-naturalization of native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens.  This is important because Article 10 of the [[Treaty of Taipei]] specifies: \"For the purposes of the present Treaty, nationals of the Republic of China shall be deemed to include all the inhabitants and former inhabitants of Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) and their descendants who are of the Chinese nationality in accordance with the laws and regulations which have been or may hereafter be enforced by the Republic of China in Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu (the Pescadores) ... \" Since no relevant laws or regulations have ever been promulgated, there is no legal basis to consider native Taiwanese persons as ROC citizens.\n# Furthermore it is recognized that the ROC government currently administering Taiwan is not the same ROC that accepted Japanese surrender in 1945, because the ruling authorities were given popular mandate by different pools of constituencies: one is the mainland Chinese electorate, the other local Taiwanese. The popular sovereignty theory, to which the [[Pan-Green coalition]] subscribes, emphasizes that Taiwan could make fundamental constitutional changes and choose a new national title by means of a popular referendum.  (In contrast, the ROC legal theory, which is supported by the [[Pan-Blue coalition]] suggests that any fundamental constitutional changes would require that the amendment procedure of the ROC constitution be followed.)\n# Nevertheless the popular sovereignty theory does not contradict any arguments in favor of [[self-determination]], nor does it affirm arguments in favor of Chinese sovereignty.  This means that at present the only obstacle against declaring Taiwan independence is a lack of consensus among the Taiwanese people to do so; however it is clear that the consensus is changing as the Taiwanese people begin preparations for their 15th application for entrance to the United Nations in the fall of 2007.\n# The [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]]'s omission of China as a participant was not an accident of history, but reflected the status that the ROC had failed to maintain its original position as the ''de jure''{{Which|date=October 2010}} and ''de facto'' government of the whole China.

In 1979, with the U.S. change of diplomatic recognition to the PRC, the ROC lost its ally needed to \"recover the mainland.\" Meanwhile, the PRC's desire to be accepted in the international community led it to promote peaceful unification under what would later be termed \"[[one country, two systems]]\", rather than to \"liberate Taiwan\" and to make Taiwan a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Region]].\n\n=== PRC's condition on military intervention ===\nNotwithstanding, the PRC government has issued triggers for an immediate war with Taiwan, most notably via its controversial [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|Anti-Secession Law of 2005]]. These conditions are:\n* if events occur leading to the ''\"separation\"'' of Taiwan from China ''in any name'', or\n* if a major event occurs which would lead to Taiwan's ''\"separation\"'' from China, or\n* if all possibility of peaceful unification is lost.\n\nIt has been interpreted that these criteria encompass the scenario of Taiwan developing nuclear weapons (''see main article'' [[Taiwan and weapons of mass destruction]] also [[Timeline of the Republic of China's nuclear program]]).\n\nMuch [[saber-rattling]] by the PRC has been done over this, with [[Jiang Zemin]], after assuming the mantle of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, becoming a leading voice.\n\nThe third condition has especially caused a stir in Taiwan as the term \"indefinitely\" is open to interpretation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} It has also been viewed by some as meaning that preserving the ambiguous status quo is not acceptable to the PRC, although the PRC stated on many occasions that there is no explicit timetable for reunification.\n\nConcern over a formal declaration of ''de jure'' [[Taiwan independence]] is a strong impetus for the military buildup between Taiwan and mainland China.

Both sides have chosen to have a strong naval presence. However, naval strategies between both powers greatly shifted in the 1980s and 1990s, while the ROC assumed a more defensive attitude by building and buying [[frigate]]s and missile [[destroyer]]s, and the PRC a more aggressive posture by developing long-range [[cruise missile]]s and supersonic [[surface-to-surface missile]]s.\n\nAlthough the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] is considered large, most of its fleet consists of older generation [[Chengdu J-7|J-7]] fighters (localized [[MiG-21]]s and Mig-21BIs), raising doubts over the PLAAF's ability to control Taiwan's airspace in the event of a conflict. Since mid-1990s PRC has been purchasing, and later localizing, [[SU-27]] based fighters. These Russian fighters, as well as their Chinese [[Shenyang J-11|J11A]] variants, are currently over 170 in number, and have increased the effectiveness of PLAAF's [[Beyond Visual Range missile|Beyond Visual Range]] (BVR) capabilities. The introduction of 60 new-generation [[Chengdu J-10|J10A]] fighters is anticipated to increase the PLAAF's firepower. PRC's acquisition of Russian [[Sukhoi Su-30|Su30MKKs]] further enhanced the PLAAF's [[air-to-ground]] support ability. The [[Republic of China Air Force|ROC's air force]], on the other hand, relies on Taiwan's fourth generation fighters, consisting of 150 US-built [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]s, approximately 60 French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5s]], and approximately 130 locally developed [[AIDC Ching-kuo|IDFs]] (Indigenous Defense Fighters). All of these ROC fighter jets are able to conduct [[BVR]] combat missions with BVR missiles, but the level of technology in mainland Chinese fighters is catching up.

In 1979, the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]] passed the [[Taiwan Relations Act]], a law generally interpreted as mandating U.S. defense of Taiwan in the event of an attack from the Chinese Mainland (the Act is applied to Taiwan and Penghu, but not to Kinmen or Matsu, which are usually considered to be part of Mainland China). The United States maintains the world's largest permanent fleet in the Pacific Region near Taiwan. The [[Seventh Fleet]], operating primarily out of various bases in Japan, is a powerful naval contingent built upon the world's only permanently forward-deployed [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|George Washington|CVN-73|6}}. Although the stated purpose of the fleet is not Taiwanese defense, it can be safely assumed from past actions, that is one of the reasons why the fleet is stationed in those waters.{{cn|date=January 2020}} It is written into the strategy of the United States department of defense within this region that, \u201cFirst, we are strengthening our military capacity to ensure the United States can successfully deter conflict and coercion and respond decisively when needed.

Some analysts believed that the PRC could launch [[preemptive strike]]s on military bases in Japan to deter US and Japanese forces from coming to the ROC's aid. Japanese strategic planners also see an independent Taiwan as vital, not only because the ROC controls valuable shipping routes, but also because its capture by PRC would make Japan more vulnerable. During [[World War II]], the US invaded the [[Philippines]], but another viable target to enable direct attacks on Japan would have been Taiwan (then known as Formosa). However, critics of the preemptive strike theory assert that the PRC would be loath to give Japan and the US such an excuse to intervene. <ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4217193543447225711&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33&sciodt=0,33 Smith, R.

The current controversy is over the term ''one China'', as the PRC insists that the ROC must recognize this term to begin negotiations.  Although the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] has moderated its support for [[Taiwan independence]], there is still insufficient support within that party for former President Chen Shui-bian to agree to one China.  By contrast, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People First Party]] (PFP) appear willing to agree to some variation of one China, and observers believed the position of the PRC was designed to sideline Chen until the [[2004 ROC presidential election|2004 presidential election]] where it was hoped that someone who was more supportive of [[Cross-Strait Unification|Chinese reunification]] would come to power.  Partly to counter this, Chen Shui-bian announced in July 2002 that if the PRC does not respond to Taiwan's goodwill, Taiwan may \"go on its own ... road.\" {{cn|date=January 2020}}\nWhat ROC president, Chen Shui-bian, means by this is that there are other ways of combatting China as a powerful hegemon. For example, \u201cIf Taiwan\u2019s Chen Shui-bian had declared legal independence by a popular referendum, scholars agree that is could have immediately triggered a crisis in China, due to its political sensitivity on the mainland\u201d. <ref>Wei, C.

However, public opinion in Taiwan reacted unfavorably towards the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China|anti-secession law]] passed by the PRC in March 2005. Following two high-profile visits by KMT and PFP party leaders to the PRC, the balance of public opinion appears to be ambiguous, with the Pan-Green Coalition gaining a majority in the [[2005 ROC National Assembly election|2005 National Assembly elections]], but the Pan-Blue Coalition scoring a landslide victory in the 2005 municipal elections.\n\nLegislative elections were held in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] on [[2008 Republic of China legislative election|January 12, 2008]]. The results gave the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] an absolute majority (86 of the 113 seats) in the [[Legislative Yuan|legislature]], handing a heavy defeat to President [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s [[Democratic Progressive Party]], which won the remaining 27 seats. The junior partner in the [[Pan-Green Coalition]], the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], won no seats.\n\nThe election for the 12th President of ROC was held on [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|March 22, 2008]]. [[Kuomintang]] candidate [[Ma Ying-jeou]] won, with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) leadership. Along with the 2008 legislative election, Ma's landslide victory brought the Kuomintang back to power in Taiwan. This new political situation has led to a decrease of tension between both sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]] and the increase of [[cross-strait relations]], making a declaration of independence, or war, something unlikely.\n\nTaiwan's [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart \u2013 the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait]] (ARATS) signed four agreements in Taipei on 4 November 2008. Both SEF and ARATS have agreed to address direct sea links, daily charter flights, direct postal service and food safety.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taiwan reached deals with China at the expense of sovereignty and democracy|publisher=[[European Federation of Taiwanese Associations|EFTA]]|date=6 November 2008|url=http://www.eutaiwan.org/en2.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Public opinion ===\nPublic opinion in Taiwan regarding relations with the PRC is notoriously difficult to gauge, as poll results tend to be extremely sensitive to how the questions are phrased and what options are given, and there is a tendency by all political parties to [[spin (politics)|spin]] the results to support their point of view. <ref>Lin, Yitzu, and Hsieh, John Fuh-Sheng. \u201cChange and Continuity in Taiwan\u2019s Public Opinion on the Cross-Strait Economic Interactions.\u201d Journal of Asian and African Studies, vol. 52, no. 8, SAGE Publications, Dec. 2017, pp. 1103\u201316, d oi:10.1177/0021909616649210.</ref>\n\nAccording to a November 2005 poll from the [[Mainland Affairs Council]], 37.7% of people living in the ROC favor maintaining the status quo until a decision can be made in the future, 18.4% favors maintaining the status quo indefinitely, 14% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual independence, 12% favors maintaining the status quo until eventual reunification, 10.3% favors independence as soon as possible, and 2.1% favors reunification as soon as possible.

In other words, if reunification supporters wanted to reunify Taiwan with mainland China in such a way that would effectively abolish the ROC or affect the ROC's sovereignty, or if independence supporters wanted to abolish the ROC and establish a Republic of Taiwan, they would also need to amend or abolish the ROC constitution and redraft a new constitution.  Passing an amendment requires an unusually broad political consensus, which includes approval from three-quarters of a quorum of members of the Legislative Yuan.  This quorum requires at least three-quarters of all members of the Legislature.  After passing the legislature, the amendments need ratification from at least fifty percent of all eligible voters of the ROC, ''irrespective'' of voter turnout.\n\nGiven these harsh constitutional requirements, neither the pan-greens nor pan-blues can unilaterally change Taiwan's political and legal status with respect to the ROC's constitution.  However, extreme Taiwan independence supporters view the ROC's constitution as illegal and therefore believe that amendments to the ROC constitution are an invalid way to change Taiwan's political status.\n\n== Note on terminology ==\n\n=== Political status vs. Taiwan issue or Mainland issue ===\nSome scholarly sources as well as political entities like the PRC refer to Taiwan's controversial status as the \"Taiwan question\", \"Taiwan issue\", or \"Taiwan problem\".  The ROC government does not like these terminologies, emphasizing that it should be called the \"'''Mainland issue'''\" or \"Mainland question\", because from the ROC's point of view, the PRC is making an issue out of or creating a problem out of Taiwan.  Others use the term \"Taiwan Strait Issue\" because it implies nothing about sovereignty and because \"[[Cross-Strait relations]]\" is a term used by both the ROC and the PRC to describe their interactions. However, this term is also objectionable to some because it still implies that there is an issue, which they feel is created only by the PRC.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n=== ''De facto'' vs. ''de jure'' and whether ROC ceased to exist ===\nThe use of the terms ''de facto'' and ''[[de jure]]'' to describe Taiwan's as well as the Republic of China's status as a state is itself a contentious issue. This partially stems from the lack of precedents regarding derecognized, but still constitutionally functioning states. For instance, it is argued by Jacques deLisle that Taiwan satisfies three of the four requirements of statehood at international law as stated in the [[Montevideo Convention]]. A state must have distinct and substantial territory which Taiwan is capable of satisfying since it is an island and controls few surrounding islands such as Penghu and Green Island. A state must also have a distinct population and substantial population which Taiwan satisfies by having a population of around 23 million people. A state must also have a government that provides order, does not answer to a higher government or government abroad, thus protecting its relative sovereignty, which Taiwan or the Republic of China satisfies. However, as Delisle states, \u201cThe fourth criterion for state status, according to the Montevideo Convention and customary international law, is the capacity to engage in relations with other states. Here, Taiwan has some troubles on the \u201cformal\u201d side.  No other country formally recognizes Taiwan as a separate state and only a small number of countries (now twenty-three) either recognize the ROC government or merely maintain formal diplomatic relations with it.\u201d <ref>[https://www.fpri.org/docs/media/201107.delisle.taiwan.pdf desLisle, J. (2011). Taiwan: Sovereignty and Participation in International Organizations. Foreign Policy Research Institute: A Catalyst for Ideas, E-Notes. Pg. 1-5. Pg. 1, Par. 3, Lines 1-5.]</ref>\nAt the same time, there is continued debate on whether UN membership or recognition as a state by the UN is a decisive feature of statehood (since it represents broad recognition by the international community); the debate arises because non-state entities can often satisfy the Montevideo Convention factors, while the list of states recognised by the UN, for the most part, correlates well with entities recognised as states by [[customary international law]]. If the latter argument is accepted, then the Republic of China may have ceased to be a state post-1971 as a matter of international law (\"''de jure''\"), yet continued to otherwise function as the state that it previously was recognised as (\"''de facto''\").{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, media wire services sometimes describe Taiwan as having de facto independence, whereas the Republic of China has always considered itself as a continuously functioning ''de jure'' state.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Taiwan}}\n{{wikinewspar2|Pentagon report reflects concerns over China's increased military|Chinese General threatens U.S. with nuclear weapons over possible Taiwan Strait conflict, Beijing downplays comment}}\n\n* [[History of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|History of Taiwan under Japanese rule]]\n* [[History of Republic of China]]\n* [[Chinese Civil War]]\n* [[Secession in China]]\n* [[228 Incident]], for historical context of ROC-Taiwanese conflict\n* [[Theory of the Undetermined Status of Taiwan]]\n* [[Four-stage Theory of the Republic of China]]\n* [[Taiwan Province]]\n* [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Claimed Taiwan Province of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Taiwan independence]]\n* [[Cross-Strait Unification]]\n* [[Cross-Strait relations]]\n* [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Military Power of the People's Republic of China]]\n* [[Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction]]\n* [[People's Republic of China and weapons of mass destruction]]\n* [[Mainland Affairs Council]] of the ROC\n* [[Taiwan Affairs Office]] of the PRC\n* [[Foreign relations of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan in United Nations]]\n* [[Taiwan Relations Act]]\n* [[Three Communiqu\u00e9s]]\n* [[51st state#Taiwan]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bush, R. & O'Hanlon, M.

After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires. After knowing that [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] refused his wishes, Vishwamitra promises him the impossible. But his [[yajna]] got rejected by Indra and other gods.\n|-\n|8\n|Vishwamitra begins creating alternate heaven for Trishanku when gods dismiss him from Indra's heaven.\n|-\n|9\n|[[B\u1e5bhaspati]] (along with [[Narada]] ) tries to persuade Vishwamitra to abandon creation new heaven for Trishanku which he agrees. However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task. She decides to take help from [[Rati]] and [[Kamadeva|Kamadev]].\n|-\n|12\n|After severe attempts Menaka successfully gained the attention of Vishwamitra and made him fell in love with her. \n|-\n|13\n|Both of them got married and thus Indra task finally got fulfilled. He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle. Harishchandra saves his subject from wild animals.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma. He hands over his entire kingdom to Vishwamitra but when he prepares to leaves for Kashi with his wife and son, Vishwamitra asks for the money promised to him for yajna purpose. Harishchandra asks for a month's time to fulfill the promise. Vishwamitra sends his disciple Nakshatrik to accompany them.\n|-\n|23\n|On his journey to Kashi, Vishwamitra creates many hurdles to deviate Harishchandra from dharma. He creates Mayamuni to misguide Harishchandra from the correct path. Vishwamitra's disciple Nakshatrik also keeps giving a hard time to Harishchandra throughout his journey. Vishwamitra creates a Betaal to scare Harishchandra and his family at night but Harishchandra kills him in a duel. Finally, they reach Kashi and Nakshatrik asks for the promised money. Unable to pay anything, Harishchandra asks for some time but Nakshatrik gives him the choice to back-out from his words as there is no way he can deliver his commitment. Taramati asks his husband to sell her off as a slave so that he can pay the money to Vishwamitra. A reluctant Harishchandra agrees for it.\n|-\n|24\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.

He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra's camp. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma. He hands over his entire kingdom to Vishwamitra but when he prepares to leaves for Kashi with his wife and son, Vishwamitra asks for the money promised to him for yajna purpose. Harishchandra asks for a month's time to fulfill the promise. Vishwamitra sends his disciple Nakshatrik to accompany them.\n|-\n|\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.
