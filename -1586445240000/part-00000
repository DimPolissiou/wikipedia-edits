{"title_page": "Communist party", "text_new": "{{short description|Political party that promotes communist philosophy and values}}\n{{Communism sidebar|Aspects}}\n{{Communist parties}}\n{{About|the factors all communist parties have in common|a list of communist parties of the past and present|List of communist parties|and|Communist Party (disambiguation)}}\n\nA '''communist party''' is a [[political party]] that seeks to realize the social and economic goals of [[communism]] through revolution and the establishment of a strong state. The term ''communist party'' was popularized by the title of the ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Manifesto of the Communist Party]]'' (1848), by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. As a [[vanguard party]], the communist party guides the political education and development of the [[working class]] (proletariat); as the ruling party, the communist party exercises power through the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] developed the idea of the communist party as the revolutionary vanguard, when [[social democracy]] in [[Imperial Russia]] was divided into ideologically opposed factions, the [[Bolshevik]] faction (\"'' of the majority''\") and the [[Menshevik]] faction (\"of the minority\"). To be politically effective, Lenin proposed a small vanguard party managed with [[democratic centralism]], which allowed centralized command of a disciplined [[Cadre (politics)|cadre]] of professional revolutionaries; once the policy was agreed upon, realizing political goals required every Bolshevik's total commitment to the agreed-upon policy.\n\nIn contrast, the Menshevik faction included [[Trotsky]], who emphasized that the party should not neglect the importance of mass populations in realizing a communist revolution. In the course of the revolution, the Bolshevik party,  which became the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), assumed government power in Russia after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917. With the creation of the [[Comintern|Communist International],] (Comintern) in 1919, the concept of \"communist party leadership\" was adopted by many revolutionary parties, worldwide. In an effort to standardize the international [[Communism|communist]] movement ideologically and maintain central control of the member parties, the Comintern required that parties identify as a communist party. Under the leadership of the CPSU, the interpretations of  [[Orthodox Marxism]] were applied to Russia and led to the [[Leninist]] and [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] political parties throughout the world. After the death of Lenin, the Comintern's official interpretation of [[Leninism]] was the book ''[[Foundations of Leninism]]'' (1924), by Joseph Stalin.\n\n==Mass organizations==\n{{see also|Front organization|Communist front}}\nAs the membership of a communist party was to be limited to active [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] in Lenin's theory, there was a need for networks of separate organizations to mobilize mass support for the party. Typically, communist parties built up various [[front organizations]] whose membership was often open to non-communists. In many countries, the single most important front organization of the communist parties was its youth wing. During the time of the [[Communist International]], the youth leagues were explicit communist organizations, using the name '[[Young Communist League]]'. Later the youth league concept was broadened in many countries, and names like 'Democratic Youth League' were adopted.\n\nSome [[trade union]]s and students', women's, grifters', peasants', and cultural organizations have been connected to communist parties. Traditionally, these mass organizations were often politically subordinated to the political leadership of the party. After the fall of communist party regimes in the 1990s, mass organizations sometimes outlived their communist party founders.\n[[File:HanoiPropagandaPoster.JPG|thumb|The [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist Party]]'s propaganda poster in [[Hanoi]], Vietnam]]\nAt the international level, the Communist International organized various international front organizations (linking national mass organizations with each other), such as the [[Young Communist International]], [[Profintern]], [[Krestintern]], [[International Red Aid]], [[Sportintern]], etc. Many of these organizations were disbanded after the dissolution of the Communist International. After the [[Second World War]] new international coordination bodies were created, such as the [[World Federation of Democratic Youth]], [[International Union of Students]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions]], [[Women's International Democratic Federation]] and the [[World Peace Council]]. The Soviet Union unified many of the Comintern's original goals among its East European allies under the aegis of a new organization, the [[Cominform]].\n\nHistorically, in countries where communist parties were struggling to attain state power, the formation of wartime alliances with non-communist parties and wartime groups was enacted (such as the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Front of Albania]]). Upon attaining state power these Fronts were often transformed into nominal (and usually electoral) \"National\" or \"Fatherland\" Fronts in which non-communist parties and organizations were given token representation (a practice known as ''[[Blockpartei]]''), the most popular examples of these being the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of East Germany]] (as a historical example) and the [[United Front (China)|United Front of the People's Republic of China]] (as a modern-day example). Other times the formation of such Fronts were undertaken without the participation of other parties, such as the [[Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia]] and the [[National Front (Afghanistan)|National Front of Afghanistan]], though the purpose was the same: to promote the communist party line to generally non-communist audiences and to mobilize them to carry out tasks within the country under the aegis of the Front.\n\nRecent scholarship has developed the comparative political study of global communist parties by examining similarities and differences across historical geographies.  In particular, the rise of revolutionary parties, their spread internationally, the appearance of charismatic revolutionary leaders and their ultimate demise during the decline and fall of communist parties worldwide have all been the subject of investigation.<ref>McAdams, A. James. Vanguard of the Revolution: The Global Idea of the Communist Party. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017.</ref>\n\n==Naming==\nA uniform naming scheme for communist parties was adopted by the Communist International. All parties were required to use the name 'Communist Party of (''name of the country'')', resulting in separate communist parties in some countries operating using (largely) homonymous party names (e.g. [[List of communist parties in India|in India]]). Today, there are a few cases where the original sections of the Communist International have retained those names. But throughout the twentieth century, many parties changed their names.  Common causes for these shifts in naming were either moves to avoid state repression{{fact|date=September 2019}} or as measures to generate greater acceptance by local populations.\n\nAn important example of the latter was the renaming of many [[Eastern Europe|East European]] communist parties after the Second World War, sometimes as a result of mergers with the local [[Social Democratic]] parties.{{fact|date=September 2019}} New names in the post-war era included \"[[Socialist Party]]\", \"[[Socialist Unity Party (disambiguation)|Socialist Unity Party]]\", \"[[People's Party (disambiguation)|People's (or Popular) Party]]\", \"[[Workers' Party (disambiguation)|Workers' Party]]\" and \"[[Party of Labour (disambiguation)|Party of Labour]]\".\n\nThe naming conventions of communist parties became more diverse as the international communist movement was fragmented due to the [[Sino-Soviet split]] in the 1960s. Those who sided with China and [[Albania]] in their criticism of the Soviet leadership, often added words like 'Revolutionary' or '[[Marxist-Leninist]]' to distinguish themselves from the pro-Soviet parties.\n\n== Membership ==\nIn 1985, approximately 38 percent of the world's population lived under communist governments (1.67&nbsp; billion out of 4.4&nbsp; billion). The CPSU's International Department officially recognized 95 ruling and nonruling communist parties. Overall, if one includes the 107 parties with significant memberships, there were approximately 82 million communist party members worldwide.<ref>These calculations are based on parties for which sufficient data is available.

One approach, sometimes known as the totalitarian school of communist studies, has implicitly treated all communist parties as the same types of organizations. Scholars such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Francois Furet have relied upon conceptions of the party emphasizing centralized control, a top-down hierarchical structure, ideological rigidity, and strict party discipline.<ref>See Carl Joachim Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1965); Fran\u00e7ois Furet, et.al., ''The Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999); Martin Malia, ''The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917\u20131991'' (New York: Free Press, 1995).</ref>  In contrast, other studies have emphasized the differences among communist parties. Multi-party studies, such as those by Robert C. Tucker and A. James McAdams, have emphasized the differences in both these parties' organizational structure and their use of Marxist and Leninist ideas to justify their policies.<ref>Franz Borkenau, ''World Communism'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1962); Robert C. Tucker, ''The Marxian Revolutionary Idea'' (New York: W. W. Norton), 1969; McAdams, ''Vanguard of the Revolution'';</ref>\n\nAnother important question is why communist parties were able to rule for as long as they did. Some scholars have depicted these parties as fatally from their inception and only remained in power their leaders were willing to use their monopoly of power to crush all forms of opposition.<ref>Zbigniew Brzezinski, ''The Grand Failure: The Birth and Death of Communism in the Twentieth Century'' (New York: Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1989); Martin Malia, ''The Soviet Tragedy''; and Andrzej Walicki, ''Marxism and the Leap to the Kingdom of Freedom: The Rise and Fall of the Communist Utopia'' (Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, 1997).</ref> In contrast, other studies have emphasized these parties\u2019 ability to adapt their policies to changing times and circumstances.<ref>See George Breslauer, ''Five Images of the Soviet Future: A Critical Review and Synthesis'' (Berkeley, CA: Center for International Studies, 1978); Stephen F.

One approach, sometimes known as the totalitarian school of communist studies, has implicitly treated all communist parties as the same types of organizations. Scholars such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Francois Furet have relied upon conceptions of the party emphasizing centralized control, a top-down hierarchical structure, ideological rigidity, and strict party discipline.<ref>See Carl Joachim Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1965); Fran\u00e7ois Furet, et.al., ''The Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999); Martin Malia, ''The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917\u20131991'' (New York: Free Press, 1995).</ref>  In contrast, other studies have emphasized the differences among communist parties. Multi-party studies, such as those by Robert C. Tucker and A. James McAdams, have emphasized the differences in both these parties' organizational structure and their use of Marxist and Leninist ideas to justify their policies.<ref>Franz Borkenau, ''World Communism'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1962); Robert C. Tucker, ''The Marxian Revolutionary Idea'' (New York: W. W. Norton), 1969; McAdams, ''Vanguard of the Revolution'';</ref>\n\nAnother important question is why communist parties were able to rule for as long as they did. Some scholars have depicted these parties as fatally from their inception and only remained in power their leaders were willing to use their monopoly of power to crush all forms of opposition.<ref>Zbigniew Brzezinski, ''The Grand Failure: The Birth and Death of Communism in the Twentieth Century'' (New York: Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1989); Martin Malia, ''The Soviet Tragedy''; and Andrzej Walicki, ''Marxism and the Leap to the Kingdom of Freedom: The Rise and Fall of the Communist Utopia'' (Palo Alto, CA: Stanford University Press, 1997).</ref> In contrast, other studies have emphasized these parties\u2019 ability to adapt their policies to changing times and circumstances.<ref>See George Breslauer, ''Five Images of the Soviet Future: A Critical Review and Synthesis'' (Berkeley, CA: Center for International Studies, 1978); Stephen F.

The [[Normans|Norman]] conquest of England in 1066 and the later [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]], soon restricted only to [[The Pale]]. The 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Acts of Union 1707]] and [[Acts of Union 1800]] aimed to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as [[Crown Dependencies]]. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the dispersal of some of the islands' population and culture throughout the world, and a rapid depopulation of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919\u20131922), with six counties remaining in the UK as Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Ireland, the term \"British Isles\" is [[British Isles naming dispute|controversial]] ,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rasBRQwwOIIC&pg=PA7 Social work in the British Isles by Malcolm Payne, Steven Shardlow] When we think about social work in the British Isles, a contentious term if ever there was one, what do we expect to see?</ref> where there are nationalist objections to its usage.<ref name=\"postwarculture\">{{Citation|first1=Alistair|last1=Davies|first2=Alan|last2=Sinfield|title=British Culture of the Postwar: An Introduction to Literature and Society, 1945\u20131999|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=978-0-415-12811-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/britishcultureof00adav/page/9 9]|quote=Some of the Irish dislike the 'British' in 'British Isles', while a minority of the Welsh and Scottish are not keen on 'Great Britain'. ...

Animal and plant life is similar to that of the northwestern [[European mainland]]. There are however, fewer numbers of species, with Ireland having even less. All native [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in Ireland is made up of species that migrated from elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. The only window when this could have occurred was between the end of [[Pleistocene|the last Ice Age]] (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).\n\nAs with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, [[wych elm]], birch and pine. Beech and [[Tilia|lime]], though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, [[hedgerows]], mountain slopes and marshes host [[Ericaceae|heather]], wild grasses, [[gorse]] and [[bracken]].\n\nMany larger animals, such as wolf, bear and the European elk are today extinct. However, some species such as red deer are protected. Other small mammals, such as rabbits, foxes, [[badger]]s, [[hare]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and [[stoat]]s, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. [[Wild boar]] have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain [[otter]]s and [[Pinniped|seal]]s are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the [[common chaffinch]], common blackbird, house sparrow and [[common starling]]; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as [[pheasant]], [[partridge]], and [[red grouse]]. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular salmon, trout, perch and [[Esox|pike]]. Sea fish include [[Squalidae|dogfish]], cod, [[sole (fish)|sole]], pollock and bass, as well as mussels, crab and oysters along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.\n\nFew species of reptiles or amphibians are found in Great Britain or Ireland. Only three snakes are native to Great Britain: the [[Vipera berus|common European adder]], the [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] and the [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]];<ref>{{cite web| title = Guide to British Snakes | publisher = Wildlife Britain wildlifebritain.com | url = http://www.wildlifebritain.com/britishsnakes.php | accessdate =17 August 2010 }}</ref> none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with weasels, [[European polecat|polecat]]s, wildcats, most [[shrews]], [[European mole|moles]], [[European water vole|water voles]], [[roe deer]] and common toads also being absent from Ireland. This pattern is also true for birds and insects. Notable exceptions include the [[Kerry slug]] and certain species of woodlouse native to Ireland but not Great Britain.\n\nDomestic animals include the Connemara pony, Shetland pony, English Mastiff, Irish wolfhound and many varieties of cattle and sheep.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Demography of the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:British Isles population density 2011 NUTS3.svg|upright|thumb|alt=A map of the British Isles showing the relative population densities across the area.|Population density per km\u00b2 of the British Isles' [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|regions]].]]\n\nEngland has a generally high population density, with almost 80% of the total population of the islands.

However, since the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]], the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles.

Ice covered almost all of what is now Scotland, most of Ireland and Wales, and the hills of northern England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from Great Britain and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.\n\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about two thousand years ago, various tribes, which spoke [[Celtic languages|Celtic dialects]] of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] group, were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building [[Hadrian's Wall]] to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as Hiberni, the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as Picts and the southern two thirds by Britons.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Alfred Jewel]] (9th century)]]\nAnglo-Saxons arrived as [[Fall of Rome|Roman power waned in the 5th century AD]]. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in [[Hen Ogledd|the north of what is now England]], in [[Cornwall]] and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, for being [[Christianisation of Ireland|Christianised]]\u2014traditionally by the Romano-Briton, Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as [[Dark Ages (historiography)|the Dark Ages]], Ireland entered a [[golden age]] and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|responded with missions]] (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities. These were later joined by [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]s of a similar nature.\n\nViking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and [[Wexford]]. England, however, was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of [[Denmark]]. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in [[Normandy]], in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England in 1066]]. The remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day.  A century later, the marriage of the future [[Henry II of England]] to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] created the [[Angevin Empire]], partially under the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]]. At the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], a provincial king, and under [[Laudabiliter|the authority of]] [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Angevins invaded Ireland]] in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair|the Irish High King]] to ensure the terms of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of [[Lord of Ireland]]. This title was granted to his younger son, but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died, the title of [[King of England]] and Lord of Ireland became entwined in one person.\n\n[[File:James I of England by Daniel Mytens.jpg|thumb|upright|James VI of Scotland (James I of England)]]\n\nBy the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Power in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]]. A similar situation existed in the [[Principality of Wales]], which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England from being [[vassal]] of the [[King of France]]. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as \"the only Supreme Head in Earth of the [[Church of England]]\", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared [[Kingdom of Ireland|a separate kingdom]] in personal union with England.\n\nScotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland [[Union of the Crowns|inherited the Crown of England]], and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in [[Ulster]]. Religious division heightened and the king in England came into conflict with parliament over his tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting [[English Civil War]] or [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] led to a [[revolutionary republic]] in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created a new [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class which obliterated the remnants of Old English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and English, whilst the populace was largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and at the militarily crucial [[Battle of Aughrim]] in Ireland. Resistance held out, eventually forcing the guarantee of religious tolerance in the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. However, the terms were never honoured and a new monarchy was installed.\n\nThe Kingdoms of England and Scotland were [[Acts of Union 1707|unified in 1707]] creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Following an attempted republican [[1798 Rebellion|revolution in Ireland in 1798]], the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were [[Acts of Union 1800|unified in 1801]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North America that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the [[British Empire]] expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate, however, and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working classes. Mass migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919\u20131922), with the six counties that formed Northern Ireland remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics in the British Isles}}\n{{See also|Ireland\u2013United Kingdom relations|Politics of the United Kingdom|Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland\u2013Isle of Man relations|Politics of the Isle of Man|Politics of Jersey|Politics of Guernsey|Politics of Alderney|Politics of Sark|}}\n\n[[File:British Isles terms.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Subdivisions of the British Isles<br />See also [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/British_Isles_Euler_Diagram_13.svg diagrammatic version]]]\n\nThere are two sovereign states in the British Isles: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. Ireland, sometimes called the Republic of Ireland, governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply \"the United Kingdom\", which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The Isle of Man and the two Bailiwicks of the Channel Islands, [[Jersey]] and [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], are known as the [[Crown dependencies]]. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence;<ref name=\"gov.je\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyWorld/InternationalAffairs/Pages/RelationshipEUandUK.aspx |title=Jersey's relationship with the UK and EU |publisher=Gov.je |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> responsibility for international representation rests largely with the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent parts]]: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and Northern Ireland in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have [[Devolution|devolved]] governments, meaning that each has its own parliament or assembly and is self-governing with respect to certain matters set down by law. For judicial purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and [[English law|England and Wales]] (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdictions, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.\n\nIreland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown dependencies are all [[parliamentary democracies]], with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return [[member of parliament|members]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament in London]]. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a [[Scottish Parliament|parliament in Edinburgh]] and to assemblies in [[National Assembly for Wales|Cardiff]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Belfast]] respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule; however, Northern Ireland uses a system of [[Consociationalism|power sharing]] whereby [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and [[Irish nationalist|nationalists]] share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups is required for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland to join with the rest of Ireland.) The [[British monarch]] is the head of state of the United Kingdom, while in the Republic of Ireland the head of state is the [[President of Ireland]].\n\nIreland is part of the European Union (EU) and the UK was part until 31 January 2020.<ref name=\"gov.je\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gov.gg/ccm/navigation/about-guernsey/constitution/ |title=States of Guernsey: Constitution |publisher=Gov.gg |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |title=Relationship with European Union \u2013 Isle of Man Government \u2013 Chief Secretarys Office |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=7 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925081145/http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |archivedate=25 September 2010  }}</ref> Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland are part of the [[Schengen Area]], which allows passport-free travel between certain EU member states. However, since the [[partition of Ireland]], an informal free-travel area has existed across the island of Ireland. This area required formal recognition in 1997 during the course of negotiations for the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of the European Union, and (together with the Crown dependencies) is now known as the [[Common Travel Area]].\n\nReciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional referendums]] in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than what was required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Justice]] report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement, arguing that \"the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries\".<ref>Goldsmith, 2008, [http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Citizenship: Our Common Bond], Ministry of Justice: London {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327121654/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole\u2014for example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI), a charity that operates a lifeboat service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112024357/http://www.rnli.org.uk/home RNLI.org.uk], The RNLI is a charity that provides a 24-hour lifesaving service around the UK and Republic of Ireland.</ref>\n\nThe [[Northern Ireland peace process]] has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both, and the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland also meet as the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] to develop policies common across the island of Ireland. These arrangements were made following the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]].\n\n===British\u2013Irish Council===\n{{main|British\u2013Irish Council}}\n\nAnother body established under the Good Friday Agreement, the British\u2013Irish Council, is made up of all of the states and territories of the British Isles. The [[British\u2013Irish Parliamentary Assembly]] ({{lang-ga|Tion\u00f3l Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na h\u00c9ireann}}) predates the British\u2013Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]], with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[States of Jersey]], the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[High Court of Tynwald]] (Isle of Man).\n\nThe Council does not have executive powers, but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the Parliamentary Assembly has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the British\u2013Irish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council.<ref>[Communiqu\u00e9 of the British-Irish Council], February 2008</ref> Leading on from developments in the British\u2013Irish Council, the chair of the British\u2013Irish Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, [[Niall Blaney]], has suggested that the body should shadow the British\u2013Irish Council's work.<ref>Martina Purdy, 28 February 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7268911.stm Unionists urged to drop boycott], BBC: London</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Culture of Ireland|Culture of the United Kingdom|Sport in Ireland|Sport in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Lords match in progress.jpg|thumb|One Day Cricket International at Lord's; England v Australia 10 July 2005]]\n[[File:P\u00e1draig Harrington 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[P\u00e1draig Harrington]] teeing off at [[the Open Championship]] ([[golf]]) [[2007 Open Championship|in 2007]].]]\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have separate media, although British television, newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |title=Ireland |publisher=Museum.tv |accessdate=17 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214101405/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |archive-date=14 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in the United Kingdom.

A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]] are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.\n\nMany globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including golf, [[association football]], [[Cricket in the British Isles|cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[History of snooker|snooker]] and darts, as well as many minor sports such as [[croquet]], [[bowls]], [[pitch and putt]], [[History of water polo|water polo]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]]. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is association football. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. [[Rugby union]] is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. The [[British and Irish Lions]] is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the Southern Hemisphere rugby-playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] as part of the [[Six Nations Championship]]. Also, since 2001, the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete against each other in the [[Pro14]].\n\nThe [[Ryder Cup]] in golf was originally played between a United States team and a team representing Great Britain and Ireland.

The [[Normans|Norman]] conquest of England in 1066 and the later [[Angevin Empire|Angevin]] partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]], soon restricted only to [[The Pale]]. The 1603 [[Union of the Crowns]], [[Acts of Union 1707]] and [[Acts of Union 1800]] aimed to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as [[Crown Dependencies]]. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the dispersal of some of the islands' population and culture throughout the world, and a rapid depopulation of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century.

Animal and plant life is similar to that of the northwestern [[European mainland]]. There are however, fewer numbers of species, with Ireland having even less. All native [[flora]] and [[fauna]] in Ireland is made up of species that migrated from elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. The only window when this could have occurred was between the end of [[Pleistocene|the last Ice Age]] (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).\n\nAs with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state forestation programmes. Almost all land outside urban areas is farmland. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. Oak, elm, ash and beech are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, pine and birch are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, [[wych elm]], birch and pine. Beech and [[Tilia|lime]], though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of grasses and flowering plants. Woods, [[hedgerows]], mountain slopes and marshes host [[Ericaceae|heather]], wild grasses, [[gorse]] and [[bracken]].\n\nMany larger animals, such as wolf, bear and the European elk are today extinct. However, some species such as red deer are protected. Other small mammals, such as rabbits, foxes, [[badger]]s, [[hare]]s, [[hedgehog]]s, and [[stoat]]s, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. [[Wild boar]] have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain [[otter]]s and [[Pinniped|seal]]s are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the [[common chaffinch]], common blackbird, house sparrow and [[common starling]]; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as [[pheasant]], [[partridge]], and [[red grouse]]. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular salmon, trout, perch and [[Esox|pike]]. Sea fish include [[Squalidae|dogfish]], cod, [[sole (fish)|sole]], pollock and bass, as well as mussels, crab and oysters along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.\n\nFew species of reptiles or amphibians are found in Great Britain or Ireland. Only three snakes are native to Great Britain: the [[Vipera berus|common European adder]], the [[Natrix natrix|grass snake]] and the [[Coronella austriaca|smooth snake]];<ref>{{cite web| title = Guide to British Snakes | publisher = Wildlife Britain wildlifebritain.com | url = http://www.wildlifebritain.com/britishsnakes.php | accessdate =17 August 2010 }}</ref> none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with weasels, [[European polecat|polecat]]s, wildcats, most [[shrews]], [[European mole|moles]], [[European water vole|water voles]], [[roe deer]] and common toads also being absent from Ireland. This pattern is also true for birds and insects. Notable exceptions include the [[Kerry slug]] and certain species of woodlouse native to Ireland but not Great Britain.\n\nDomestic animals include the Connemara pony, Shetland pony, English Mastiff, Irish wolfhound and many varieties of cattle and sheep.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|Demographics of the Republic of Ireland|Demography of the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:British Isles population density 2011 NUTS3.svg|upright|thumb|alt=A map of the British Isles showing the relative population densities across the area.|Population density per km\u00b2 of the British Isles' [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|regions]].]]\n\nEngland has a generally high population density, with almost 80% of the total population of the islands.

However, since the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]], the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles.

Ice covered almost all of what is now Scotland, most of Ireland and Wales, and the hills of northern England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from Great Britain and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.\n\nAt the time of the Roman Empire, about two thousand years ago, various tribes, which spoke [[Celtic languages|Celtic dialects]] of the [[Insular Celtic languages|Insular Celtic]] group, were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building [[Hadrian's Wall]] to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as Hiberni, the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as Picts and the southern two thirds by Britons.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jewel.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Alfred Jewel]] (9th century)]]\nAnglo-Saxons arrived as [[Fall of Rome|Roman power waned in the 5th century AD]]. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in [[Hen Ogledd|the north of what is now England]], in [[Cornwall]] and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, for being [[Christianisation of Ireland|Christianised]]\u2014traditionally by the Romano-Briton, Saint Patrick. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as [[Dark Ages (historiography)|the Dark Ages]], Ireland entered a [[golden age]] and [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|responded with missions]] (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of monasteries and universities. These were later joined by [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]s of a similar nature.\n\nViking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]] and [[Wexford]]. England, however, was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of [[Denmark]]. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in [[Normandy]], in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the [[Normans|Norman]] [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England in 1066]]. The remnants of the [[Duchy of Normandy]], which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the Channel Islands to this day.  A century later, the marriage of the future [[Henry II of England]] to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] created the [[Angevin Empire]], partially under the [[List of French monarchs|French Crown]]. At the invitation of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], a provincial king, and under [[Laudabiliter|the authority of]] [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Angevins invaded Ireland]] in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair|the Irish High King]] to ensure the terms of the [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of [[Lord of Ireland]]. This title was granted to his younger son, but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died, the title of [[King of England]] and Lord of Ireland became entwined in one person.\n\n[[File:James I of England by Daniel Mytens.jpg|thumb|upright|James VI of Scotland (James I of England)]]\n\nBy the [[Late Middle Ages]], Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. Power in Ireland fluxed between [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic kingdoms]], [[Hiberno-Norman|Hiberno-Norman lords]] and the English-dominated [[Lordship of Ireland]]. A similar situation existed in the [[Principality of Wales]], which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England from being [[vassal]] of the [[King of France]]. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as \"the only Supreme Head in Earth of the [[Church of England]]\", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared [[Kingdom of Ireland|a separate kingdom]] in personal union with England.\n\nScotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland [[Union of the Crowns|inherited the Crown of England]], and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in [[Ulster]]. Religious division heightened and the king in England came into conflict with parliament over his tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting [[English Civil War]] or [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] led to a [[revolutionary republic]] in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created a new [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] class which obliterated the remnants of Old English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and English, whilst the populace was largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] and at the militarily crucial [[Battle of Aughrim]] in Ireland. Resistance held out, eventually forcing the guarantee of religious tolerance in the [[Treaty of Limerick]]. However, the terms were never honoured and a new monarchy was installed.\n\nThe Kingdoms of England and Scotland were [[Acts of Union 1707|unified in 1707]] creating the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. Following an attempted republican [[1798 Rebellion|revolution in Ireland in 1798]], the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were [[Acts of Union 1800|unified in 1801]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North America that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the [[British Empire]] expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate, however, and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working classes. Mass migrations following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] and [[Highland Clearances]] resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the [[Irish War of Independence]] and the subsequent [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] (1919\u20131922), with the six counties that formed Northern Ireland remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics in the British Isles}}\n{{See also|Ireland\u2013United Kingdom relations|Politics of the United Kingdom|Politics of the Republic of Ireland|Ireland\u2013Isle of Man relations|Politics of the Isle of Man|Politics of Jersey|Politics of Guernsey|Politics of Alderney|Politics of Sark|}}\n\n[[File:British Isles terms.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|left|Subdivisions of the British Isles<br />See also [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/British_Isles_Euler_Diagram_13.svg diagrammatic version]]]\n\nThere are two sovereign states in the British Isles: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]]. Ireland, sometimes called the Republic of Ireland, governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply \"the United Kingdom\", which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The Isle of Man and the two Bailiwicks of the Channel Islands, [[Jersey]] and [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Guernsey]], are known as the [[Crown dependencies]]. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence;<ref name=\"gov.je\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.je/Government/JerseyWorld/InternationalAffairs/Pages/RelationshipEUandUK.aspx |title=Jersey's relationship with the UK and EU |publisher=Gov.je |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> responsibility for international representation rests largely with the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent parts]]: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and Northern Ireland in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have [[Devolution|devolved]] governments, meaning that each has its own parliament or assembly and is self-governing with respect to certain matters set down by law. For judicial purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and [[English law|England and Wales]] (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdictions, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.\n\nIreland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown dependencies are all [[parliamentary democracies]], with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return [[member of parliament|members]] to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament in London]]. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a [[Scottish Parliament|parliament in Edinburgh]] and to assemblies in [[National Assembly for Wales|Cardiff]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Belfast]] respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule; however, Northern Ireland uses a system of [[Consociationalism|power sharing]] whereby [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and [[Irish nationalist|nationalists]] share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups is required for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland to join with the rest of Ireland.) The [[British monarch]] is the head of state of the United Kingdom, while in the Republic of Ireland the head of state is the [[President of Ireland]].\n\nIreland is part of the European Union (EU) and the UK was part until 31 January 2020.<ref name=\"gov.je\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gov.gg/ccm/navigation/about-guernsey/constitution/ |title=States of Guernsey: Constitution |publisher=Gov.gg |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |title=Relationship with European Union \u2013 Isle of Man Government \u2013 Chief Secretarys Office |publisher=Gov.im |accessdate=7 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925081145/http://www.gov.im/cso/externalrelations/eu.xml |archivedate=25 September 2010  }}</ref> Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland are part of the [[Schengen Area]], which allows passport-free travel between certain EU member states. However, since the [[partition of Ireland]], an informal free-travel area has existed across the island of Ireland. This area required formal recognition in 1997 during the course of negotiations for the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] of the European Union, and (together with the Crown dependencies) is now known as the [[Common Travel Area]].\n\nReciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|constitutional referendums]] in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than what was required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|UK Ministry of Justice]] report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement, arguing that \"the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries\".<ref>Goldsmith, 2008, [http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Citizenship: Our Common Bond], Ministry of Justice: London {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327121654/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole\u2014for example the [[Samaritans (charity)|Samaritans]], which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] (RNLI), a charity that operates a lifeboat service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070112024357/http://www.rnli.org.uk/home RNLI.org.uk], The RNLI is a charity that provides a 24-hour lifesaving service around the UK and Republic of Ireland.</ref>\n\nThe [[Northern Ireland peace process]] has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both, and the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom consult on matters not devolved to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]]. The Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland also meet as the [[North/South Ministerial Council]] to develop policies common across the island of Ireland. These arrangements were made following the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]].\n\n===British\u2013Irish Council===\n{{main|British\u2013Irish Council}}\n\nAnother body established under the Good Friday Agreement, the British\u2013Irish Council, is made up of all of the states and territories of the British Isles. The [[British\u2013Irish Parliamentary Assembly]] ({{lang-ga|Tion\u00f3l Pharlaiminteach na Breataine agus na h\u00c9ireann}}) predates the British\u2013Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the [[Oireachtas]], the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the [[parliament of the United Kingdom]], with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], the [[States of Jersey]], the [[States of Guernsey]] and the [[High Court of Tynwald]] (Isle of Man).\n\nThe Council does not have executive powers, but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the Parliamentary Assembly has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the British\u2013Irish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council.<ref>[Communiqu\u00e9 of the British-Irish Council], February 2008</ref> Leading on from developments in the British\u2013Irish Council, the chair of the British\u2013Irish Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, [[Niall Blaney]], has suggested that the body should shadow the British\u2013Irish Council's work.<ref>Martina Purdy, 28 February 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7268911.stm Unionists urged to drop boycott], BBC: London</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Culture of Ireland|Culture of the United Kingdom|Sport in Ireland|Sport in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Lords match in progress.jpg|thumb|One Day Cricket International at Lord's; England v Australia 10 July 2005]]\n[[File:P\u00e1draig Harrington 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[P\u00e1draig Harrington]] teeing off at [[the Open Championship]] ([[golf]]) [[2007 Open Championship|in 2007]].]]\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland have separate media, although British television, newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |title=Ireland |publisher=Museum.tv |accessdate=17 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214101405/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/I/htmlI/ireland/ireland.htm |archive-date=14 December 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in the United Kingdom.

A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the [[Costa Book Awards]] are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The [[Mercury Music Prize]] is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.\n\nMany globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including golf, [[association football]], [[Cricket in the British Isles|cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[History of snooker|snooker]] and darts, as well as many minor sports such as [[croquet]], [[bowls]], [[pitch and putt]], [[History of water polo|water polo]] and [[Gaelic handball|handball]]. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is association football. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. [[Rugby union]] is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. The [[British and Irish Lions]] is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the Southern Hemisphere rugby-playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] as part of the [[Six Nations Championship]]. Also, since 2001, the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete against each other in the [[Pro14]].\n\nThe [[Ryder Cup]] in golf was originally played between a United States team and a team representing Great Britain and Ireland.

It became a hit in 1992, reaching number 3 in the United States. A 1993 re-release of the song in the [[United Kingdom]], where the initial release had been a minor hit, peaked at number 8. \"Jump Around\" was featured at position 580 on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''1001 Best Songs Ever'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref> number 24 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'',<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ | title = 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> number 66 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', number 325 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s ''500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'' and number 47 on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''100 Best Songs Of The 1990s''. The song is popular among [[dancehall]] [[disc jockey|DJ]]s and is widely regarded in the United Kingdom as a club classic.\n\n==Development==\nDJ Muggs has stated that he originally produced the beat for Cypress Hill, but rapper B-Real did not want to record at that time. It was subsequently offered to [[Ice Cube]], who refused it, before finally being taken and used by House of Pain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/12/how-we-made-cypress-hill-insane-in-the-brain-muggs-sen-dog|title=How we made Cypress Hill's Insane in the Brain|last=Simpson|first=Interviews by Dave|date=2019-02-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-23|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\n===Samples===\nThe song features a distinctive [[French horn|horn]] [[fanfare]] intro, sampled from [[Bob & Earl|Bob & Earl's]] 1963 track \"[[Harlem Shuffle]]\". The song also samples \"Popeye the Hitchhiker\" by [[Chubby Checker]], but it is best known for a high-pitched squealing sound that appears at the beginning of almost every bar\u201466 times in the course of the recording.\n\nThe origin of the squeal has been the subject of debate. The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, Americans blogger [[Anil Dash]] and musician [[Questlove]] of hip-hop band [[The Roots]] have insisted on [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' reader performed a [[spectrogram]] where the sample more closely matches \"Shoot Your Shot\", and House of Pain member [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] himself told Questlove that it is a horn making the squeal and not Prince. However, Anil Dash claims the band has denied that the sample is Prince to avoid paying royalties to the singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/princes-gett-and-24-year-mystery-hip-hop-sample-456856|title=PRINCE'S 'GETT OFF' AND THE 24-YEAR MYSTERY OF AN ICONIC HIP-HOP SAMPLE|author=Zach Schonfeld|date=May 16, 2016|website=Newsweek}}</ref> For his part, DJ Muggs says the sample came from neither Prince nor Junior Walker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/02/house-pain-look-back-20-years-jump-around/|title=House of Pain Look Back at 20 Years of \u2018Jump Around\u2019|date=February 24, 2012|website=SPIN}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nBill Lamb from [[About.com]] said that \"after one time of hearing this riveting blend of rap and rock, you will likely never forget the sampled saxophone squeal from [[Jr. Walker]] and the All Stars that leads off every bar.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/top-pop-songs-of-1992-4054134|title=Top 10 Pop Songs of 1992|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=May 24, 2019|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> He also noted that \"for a brief period of time in the 1990s, it seemed that the marriage of edgy rock and hip-hop could actually become a thing. \"Jump Around\" is proof that the union could either be incredibly infectious or annoying, depending on one's tolerance for the incessant siren that accompanies the pounding beats.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/top-songs-from-the-90s-3245307|title=The Best 100 Songs From the 1990s|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=September 7, 2019|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] editor Rob Theakston described the song as a \"dynamite classic\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/house-of-pain-mw0000086245|title=House of Pain - House of Pain|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=March 3, 2020}}</ref> He also added that the \"anthem\" that got the Irish boys rolling in the first place \"still sounds as timeless and energetic nearly a decade along\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/shamrocks-and-shenanigans-the-best-of-house-of-pain-and-everlast-mw0000325634|title=House of Pain - Shamrocks and Shenanigans: The Best of House of Pain and Everlast|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|date=|accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref> [[J.D.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year.

Wicker was an officer in the [[United States Air Force]] from 1976 to 1980 and later served as a member of the [[United States Air Force Reserves]] from 1980 to 2003.

Wicker ran to succeed him, spending $750,000 over the course of the election.<ref name=faststart/> He finished first in a crowded six-way Republican primary with 7,156 votes (26.62%) and proceeded to a runoff with attorney Grant Fox, who received 5,208 votes (19.37%).

However, this was not considered an upset, as the 1st has always been a rather conservative district (especially in the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] suburbs). The district had only supported the official Democratic candidate for president once since 1956, when [[Jimmy Carter]] carried the district in 1976. Although Whitten had a nearly unbreakable hold on the district, it had been considered very likely that he would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.\n\nWicker was re-elected six times without serious difficulty, never dropping below 65 percent of the vote. In 2004, he was unopposed by a Democratic candidate, facing only [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] nominee [[2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Mississippi|Barbara Dale Washer]], whom he defeated by 219,328 votes (79.01%) to 58,256 (20.99%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4206 |title=MS District 1 2004 |publisher=OurCampaigns |accessdate=November 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nAssuming office in 1995, he was President of the freshman class, which included 53 other new Republican Congressmen, elected as part of the [[Republican Revolution|1994 \"Republican Revolution\"]].<ref name=faststart/>\n\nHe was a member of the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]].
