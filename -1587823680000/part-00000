In captivity, groundhogs reportedly live up to 14 years. Human development, which often produces openings juxtaposed with [[Secondary forest|second growth]] trees that are incidentally also favored by groundhogs, often ensures that groundhogs in well-developed areas are nearly free of predators, beyond [[humans]] (through various forms of pest control or roadkills) or mid-to-large sized [[dogs]].<ref>Lehrer, E.

Many of these predators are successful stealth stalkers so can catch groundhogs by surprise before the large rodents can escape to their burrows; badgers likely hunt them by digging them out from their burrows.

The nest chamber may be about twenty inches to three feet below ground surface. It is about sixteen inches wide and fourteen inches high. There are typically two burrow openings or holes. One is the main entrance, the other a spy hole. Description of the length of the burrow often includes side galleries.

They will eat many commonly grown vegetables, and their burrows can destroy farm ponds and undermine foundations.\n\nVery often the dens of groundhogs provide homes for other animals including skunks, red foxes, and cottontail rabbits. The fox and skunk feed upon field mice, grasshoppers, beetles and other creatures that destroy farm crops. In aiding these animals, the groundhog indirectly helps the farmer. In addition to providing homes for itself and other animals, the groundhog aids in soil improvement by bringing subsoil to the surface. The groundhog is also a valuable game animal and is considered a difficult sport when hunted in a fair manner.<ref>Schoonmaker, W.J., The World of the Woodchuck, 1966, pp. 129\u2013131</ref> In some parts of the U.S., they have been eaten.<ref name=\"Castro\">{{cite web|last1=Castro|first1=Everett J.|title=Celebrate Groundhog Day With Groundhog Recipes|url=https://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/groundhog-day-groundhog-recipes|website=Mother Earth News|date=January 1984}}</ref>\n\nA report in 1883 by the New Hampshire Legislative Woodchuck Committee humorously describes the groundhog's objectionable character:<ref>Seton, Ernest Thompson, Lives of Game Animals, p. 328</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=The woodchuck, despite its deformities both of mind and body, possesses some of the amenities of a higher civilization.

W. J. Schoonmaker excavated 11 dens finding the earth removed from these averaged six cubic feet or four and eight-tenths bushels per den. The longest burrow was 24 feet plus 2 short side galleries. The amount of soil taken from this den was eight bushels and it weighed 640 pounds. The average weight of the earth taken from all eleven dens was 384 pounds.<ref>Schoonmaker, W. J., ''The World of the Woodchuck'' p. 108-109</ref> Though groundhogs are the most solitary of the marmots, several individuals may occupy the same burrow. Groundhog burrows usually have two to five entrances, providing groundhogs their primary means of escape from predators. Burrows can pose a serious threat to agricultural and residential development by damaging farm machinery and even undermining building foundations.<ref name=\"adweb\">{{cite web | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Marmota_monax.html | title = Animal Diversity Web: Marmota monax | publisher = University of Michigan Museum of Zoology | last = Light | first = Jessica E. | accessdate = 2009-07-14 }}</ref> In a June 7, 2009 Humane Society of the United States article, \"How to Humanely Chuck a Woodchuck Out of Your Yard\", John Griffin, director of Humane Wildlife Services, stated you would have to have a lot of woodchucks working over a lot of years to create tunnel systems that would pose any risk to a structure.\n\nThe burrow is used for safety, retreat in bad weather, hibernating, sleeping, love nest, and nursery.\nIn addition to the nest, there is an excrement chamber. The nest chamber may be about twenty inches to three feet below ground surface. It is about sixteen inches wide and fourteen inches high. There are typically two burrow openings or holes. One is the main entrance, the other a spy hole. Description of the length of the burrow often includes side galleries. Excluding side galleries, Schoonmaker reports the longest was twenty-four feet, and the average length of eleven dens was fourteen feet.<ref>Schoonmaker, W.

Some of these holes were only a few feet deep and never occupied but the numerous burrows gave the impression that groundhogs live in communities.<ref>Seton, Ernest Thompson, ''Lives of Game Animals'', p. 318</ref>\n\n===Hibernation===\nGroundhogs are one of the few species that enter into true [[hibernation]], and often build a separate \"winter burrow\" for this purpose. This burrow is usually in a wooded or brushy area and is dug below the [[frost line]] and remains at a stable temperature well above freezing during the winter months. In most areas, groundhogs hibernate from October to March or April, but in more temperate areas, they may hibernate as little as three months.<ref name=\"rhodeisland\">[http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/bnatres/fishwild/pdf/woodchuc.pdf Woodchucks in Rhode Island] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412090734/http://www.dem.ri.gov/programs/bnatres/fishwild/pdf/woodchuc.pdf |date=2007-04-12 }}.

They will eat many commonly grown vegetables, and their burrows can destroy farm ponds and undermine foundations.\n\nVery often the dens of groundhogs provide homes for other animals including skunks, red foxes, and cottontail rabbits. The fox and skunk feed upon field mice, grasshoppers, beetles and other creatures that destroy farm crops. In aiding these animals, the groundhog indirectly helps the farmer. In addition to providing homes for itself and other animals, the groundhog aids in soil improvement by bringing subsoil to the surface. The groundhog is also a valuable game animal and is considered a difficult sport when hunted in a fair manner.<ref>Schoonmaker, W.J., The World of the Woodchuck, 1966, pp. 129\u2013131</ref> In some parts of the U.S., they have been eaten.<ref name=\"Castro\">{{cite web|last1=Castro|first1=Everett J.|title=Celebrate Groundhog Day With Groundhog Recipes|url=https://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/groundhog-day-groundhog-recipes|website=Mother Earth News|date=January 1984}}</ref>\n\nA report in 1883 by the New Hampshire Legislative Woodchuck Committee humorously describes the groundhog's objectionable character:<ref>Seton, Ernest Thompson, Lives of Game Animals, p. 328</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=The woodchuck, despite its deformities both of mind and body, possesses some of the amenities of a higher civilization.

In 1193 and 1203, his bravery in the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] wars brought him fame all over Kievan Rus'. At that time, he married Maria, a daughter of Kypchak [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Koten|Kotian]]. In 1209 he was mentioned as a ruler of [[Principality of Toropets|Toropets]].

He also was the maternal grandfather of prince [[Lev Danylovich|Leo of Galicia]], who became [[Grand Prince of Kiev]].\n\nHe was the son of [[Mstislav Rostislavich|Mstislav the Brave]] of [[Smolensk]] by a princess of [[Ryazan]]. In 1193 and 1203, his bravery in the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] wars brought him fame all over Kievan Rus'. At that time, he married Maria, a daughter of Kypchak [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Koten|Kotian]]. In 1209 he was mentioned as a ruler of [[Principality of Toropets|Toropets]]. A year later, he came and took the [[Novgorod]]ian throne, seizing [[Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich of Vladimir|Sviatoslav Vsevolodovich]]'s men (Sviatoslav himself was detained in the archbishop's compound in Novgorod).<ref>Michael C. Paul, \"Was the Prince of Novgorod a 'Third-rate Bureaucrat' after 1136?\" ''Jahrb\u00fccher f\u00fcr Geschichte Osteuropas'' 56, No. 1 (2008): 91.</ref>\n\nOn his way to Novgorod, Mstislav delivered the key town of [[Torzhok]] from a siege laid to it by [[Vsevolod the Big Nest|Vsevolod&nbsp;III]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. He led two successful Novgorodian campaigns against the [[Chud]]es in 1212 and 1214. In 1215, he expelled [[Vsevolod IV of Kiev|Vsevolod&nbsp;IV]] from [[Kiev]] and elevated his uncle [[Mstislav III of Kiev|Mstislav Romanovich]] to the throne.<ref>Paul, \"Third-rate Bureaucrat\" 91-92.</ref>\n\nIn 1216, Mstislav mustered a large coalition of princes of Rus' which defeated [[Vladimir-Suzdal]] on the [[Battle of Lipitsa|Lipitsa River]]. After that he installed his ally [[Konstantin of Rostov]] as [[Grand Prince of Vladimir]] and married his own daughter to [[Yaroslav II of Russia|Yaroslav of Vladimir]], who had fortified himself in Torzhok. In the meantime, his other enemies had him deposed in Novgorod, and Mstislav had to abandon Northern Rus for [[Halych]]. In 1219, he concluded peace with his chief rival, [[Danylo of Halych]], who thereupon married Mstislav's daughter Anna.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn 1223, Mstislav joined a coalition of perhaps 18 princes, which, along with [[Cuman]] (Polovtsian) allies, pursued the [[Mongols]] from the Dnieper River for nine days and joined battle with them at [[Battle of the Kalka River|Kalka River]].  While three princes were captured and later killed at the battle site, and six more were killed in headlong pursuit back to the Dnieper River, Mstislav is the only prince specifically named among the nine or so who escaped.  He managed to escape by cutting loose the boats on the [[Dnieper River]] so he could not be pursued.<ref>A. N.

When a user creates a ProtonMail account, their browser generates a pair of public and private [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] keys:\n* The public key is used to encrypt the user's emails and other user data.\n* The private key capable of decrypting the user's data is symmetrically encrypted with the user's mailbox password.\n\nThis symmetrical encryption happens in the user's web browser using [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256]]. Upon account registration, the user is asked to provide a login password for their account. ProtonMail also offers users an option to log in with a two-password mode which requires a login password and a mailbox password.\n* The login password is used for authentication.\n* The mailbox password encrypts the user's mailbox that contains received emails, contacts, and user information as well as a private encryption key.\n\nUpon logging in, the user has to provide both passwords. This is to access the account and the encrypted mailbox and its private encryption key. The decryption takes place client-side either in a web browser or in one of the apps. The public key and the encrypted private key are both stored on ProtonMail servers. Thus ProtonMail stores decryption keys only in their encrypted form so ProtonMail developers are unable to retrieve user emails or reset user mailbox passwords.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/58541/how-are-protonmail-keys-distributed/58552#58552|title=How are ProtonMail keys distributed?|last=Stockman|first=Jason|date=22 May 2014|website=[[Stack Exchange]]|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> This system absolves ProtonMail from:\n* Storing either the unencrypted data or the mailbox password.\n* Divulging the contents of past emails but not future emails.\n* Decrypting the mailbox if requested or compelled by a court order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehackernews.com/2014/05/protonmail-nsa-proof-end-to-end.html|title=ProtonMail: 'NSA-Proof' End-to-End Encrypted Email Service|last=Khandelwal|first=Swati|date=26 May 2014|website=The Hacker News|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nProtonMail exclusively supports [[HTTPS]] and uses [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] with ephemeral [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange|key exchange]] to encrypt all Internet traffic between users and ProtonMail servers.

Once encrypted, only the private key of the recipient can decrypt the email. When the recipient logs in, their mailbox password decrypts their private key and unlocks their inbox.\n\nEmails sent from ProtonMail to non-ProtonMail email addresses may optionally be sent in [[plain text]] or with end-to-end encryption. With encryption, the email is encrypted with AES under a user-supplied password. The recipient receives a link to the ProtonMail website on which they can enter the password and read the decrypted email. ProtonMail assumes that the sender and the recipient have exchanged this password through a [[backchannel]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Such emails can be set to self-destruct after a period of time.<ref name=\"security-details\">{{Cite web|url=https://protonmail.com/security-details|title=ProtonMail Security Details|last=|first=|date=31 January 2016|website=ProtonMail Security|accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Two-factor authentication ==\n\nProtonMail currently supports [[multi-factor authentication|two-factor authentication]] with [[Time-based One-time Password algorithm|TOTP]] tokens for its login process.<ref name=\"TFA\">{{cite web|url=https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/two-factor-authentication/|title=Two Factor Authentication (2FA)|last=|first=|date=|website=ProtonMail Support|access-date=}}</ref> According to official ProtonMail feedback site, [[Universal 2nd Factor|U2F]] support for [[YubiKey]] and [[FIDO Alliance|FIDO]] physical security keys is currently under development and will be available soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/284483-feedback/suggestions/19006441-yubikey-fido-u2f-support-for-two-factor-authenti|title=Yubikey / FIDO U2F Support for Two Factor Authentication|website=Customer Feedback for ProtonMail|date=22 August 2018|accessdate=29 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929082226/https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/284483-feedback/suggestions/19006441-yubikey-fido-u2f-support-for-two-factor-authenti|archive-date=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Data centers ==\n[[File:Protonmail system architecture 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Architecture of a ProtonMail [[data center]].]]ProtonMail maintains and owns its own server hardware and network in order to avoid utilizing a third party.

When a user creates a ProtonMail account, their browser generates a pair of public and private [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] keys:\n* The public key is used to encrypt the user's emails and other user data.\n* The private key capable of decrypting the user's data is symmetrically encrypted with the user's mailbox password.\n\nThis symmetrical encryption happens in the user's web browser using [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-256]]. Upon account registration, the user is asked to provide a login password for their account. ProtonMail also offers users an option to log in with a two-password mode which requires a login password and a mailbox password.\n* The login password is used for authentication.\n* The mailbox password encrypts the user's mailbox that contains received emails, contacts, and user information as well as a private encryption key.\n\nUpon logging in, the user has to provide both passwords. This is to access the account and the encrypted mailbox and its private encryption key. The decryption takes place client-side either in a web browser or in one of the apps. The public key and the encrypted private key are both stored on ProtonMail servers. Thus ProtonMail stores decryption keys only in their encrypted form so ProtonMail developers are unable to retrieve user emails or reset user mailbox passwords.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/58541/how-are-protonmail-keys-distributed/58552#58552|title=How are ProtonMail keys distributed?|last=Stockman|first=Jason|date=22 May 2014|website=[[Stack Exchange]]|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref> This system absolves ProtonMail from:\n* Storing either the unencrypted data or the mailbox password.\n* Divulging the contents of past emails but not future emails.\n* Decrypting the mailbox if requested or compelled by a court order.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thehackernews.com/2014/05/protonmail-nsa-proof-end-to-end.html|title=ProtonMail: 'NSA-Proof' End-to-End Encrypted Email Service|last=Khandelwal|first=Swati|date=26 May 2014|website=The Hacker News|accessdate=19 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nProtonMail exclusively supports [[HTTPS]] and uses [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] with ephemeral [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange|key exchange]] to encrypt all Internet traffic between users and ProtonMail servers.

Once encrypted, only the private key of the recipient can decrypt the email. When the recipient logs in, their mailbox password decrypts their private key and unlocks their inbox.\n\nEmails sent from ProtonMail to non-ProtonMail email addresses may optionally be sent in [[plain text]] or with end-to-end encryption. With encryption, the email is encrypted with AES under a user-supplied password. The recipient receives a link to the ProtonMail website on which they can enter the password and read the decrypted email. ProtonMail assumes that the sender and the recipient have exchanged this password through a [[backchannel]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Such emails can be set to self-destruct after a period of time.<ref name=\"security-details\">{{Cite web|url=https://protonmail.com/security-details|title=ProtonMail Security Details|last=|first=|date=31 January 2016|website=ProtonMail Security|accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Two-factor authentication ==\n\nProtonMail currently supports [[multi-factor authentication|two-factor authentication]] with [[Time-based One-time Password algorithm|TOTP]] tokens for its login process.<ref name=\"TFA\">{{cite web|url=https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/two-factor-authentication/|title=Two Factor Authentication (2FA)|last=|first=|date=|website=ProtonMail Support|access-date=}}</ref> According to official ProtonMail feedback site, [[Universal 2nd Factor|U2F]] support for [[YubiKey]] and [[FIDO Alliance|FIDO]] physical security keys is currently under development and will be available soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/284483-feedback/suggestions/19006441-yubikey-fido-u2f-support-for-two-factor-authenti|title=Yubikey / FIDO U2F Support for Two Factor Authentication|website=Customer Feedback for ProtonMail|date=22 August 2018|accessdate=29 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929082226/https://protonmail.uservoice.com/forums/284483-feedback/suggestions/19006441-yubikey-fido-u2f-support-for-two-factor-authenti|archive-date=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Data centers ==\n[[File:Protonmail system architecture 2014.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Architecture of a ProtonMail [[data center]].]]ProtonMail maintains and owns its own server hardware and network in order to avoid utilizing a third party.

This leads to a bitter, cold dynamic between the two sisters, Eunice regarding Ellen as a selfish snob,  and Ellen seeing Eunice as obnoxious, embarrassing and crazy.\n\nEunice and her mother, Thelma Harper have a very dysfunctional relationship. Eunice often tries to please her mother, but she is never satisfied, and nags Eunice to the point where she becomes irate and so agitated she goes into screaming fits. Mama often also guilts Eunice, putting her more on edge. This leads to Eunice snapping back at her mother, calling her \"old lady\", and hysterically ranting.\n\nEunice is unhappy with her marriage. She views her husband, Ed, as a dolt and has called him a dumb cluck or a goon numerous times. He eventually leaves her.\n\nEunice is generally very unhappy and bitter, distraught and broken down by her mother, and very emotionally unstable and going on many destructive hissy fits. She eventually visits a psychiatrist, where Eunice reveals she is worried about her fits, and is not happy about herself. The psychiatrist eventually helps her realize she does not have to let her abusive mother affect her, and leads her on the road to recovery.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Higgins, Eunice Harper}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Mama's Family characters]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name = Eunice Higgins\n| image = Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Eunice Carol Burnett Show.JPG\n| caption = Carol Burnett (left) as Eunice Higgins \n| first = ''Family'' sketch episode \"Phillip's Visit\" \n| last = ''Mama's Family'' episode \"Rashomama\" (last seen played by Carol Burnett) <br> ''Mama's Family'' episode \"Sins of the Mother\" (last seen in general) <br> ''Mama's Family'' episode \"Pomp and Circumstance\" (last heard, portrayed in voice only)\n| nickname = Eunie (by [[Ed Higgins|Ed]])\n| occupation = [[Homemaker]] <br> [[Mother]]\n| title = Mrs. Higgins\n| family = Carl Harper (father; deceased) <br> [[Thelma Harper]] (mother) <br> [[Ellen Jackson]] (sister) <br> [[Vinton Harper]] (brother)\n| spouse = [[Ed Higgins]]\n| children = [[Bubba Higgins]] (son) <br> Billy Joe Higgins (son; mentioned in ''Mama\u2019s Family'' sketches)\n| relatives = [[Fran Crowley]] (aunt; deceased)<br> [[Buzz Harper]] (nephew)<br> [[Sonja Harper]] (niece)<br> Tiffany Thelma Harper (niece)<br> Mary Beth Jackson (niece)\n| portrayer = [[Carol Burnett]]<br />Tanya Fenmore as a child version of Eunice (''Mama's Family'' episode \"Mama's Birthday\")<br />Heather Kerr as a teenage version of Eunice (''Mama's Family'' episode \"Sins of the Mother\")<br />Phyllis Franklin in a voice-only portrayal (''Mama's Family'' episode \"Pomp and Circumstance\") \n| creator = [[Dick Clair]]\n}}\n'''Eunice Higgins''' ([[n\u00e9e]] '''Harper''') is the [[main character]] in \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" comedy sketches played by [[Carol Burnett]] and featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' (1974\u201378) and ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'' (1979).

Her older sister is [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Ellen_Harper|Ellen Harper]] and she has at least one brother, depending on the installment (Vinton Harper in ''Mama's Family''; Larry, Phillip, and Jack in the original sketches.)\n\nEunice had a strained relationship with her parents growing up, as they blatantly favored her sister Ellen. She was bitter towards her father, who called her his \"Prune Tart\", while calling Ellen \"Apple Dumpling\".\n\n==Relationships==\n{{all plot|section|date=July 2018}}\nEven in adulthood, Eunice's mother blatantly favors her rich  sister Ellen, though Eunice visits her mother much more often and takes care of her more. This leads to a bitter, cold dynamic between the two sisters, Eunice regarding Ellen as a selfish snob,  and Ellen seeing Eunice as obnoxious, embarrassing and crazy.\n\nEunice and her mother, Thelma Harper have a very dysfunctional relationship. Eunice often tries to please her mother, but she is never satisfied, and nags Eunice to the point where she becomes irate and so agitated she goes into screaming fits. Mama often also guilts Eunice, putting her more on edge. This leads to Eunice snapping back at her mother, calling her \"old lady\", and hysterically ranting.\n\nEunice is unhappy with her marriage. She views her husband, Ed, as a dolt and has called him a dumb cluck or a goon numerous times. He eventually leaves her.\n\nEunice is generally very unhappy and bitter, distraught and broken down by her mother, and very emotionally unstable and going on many destructive hissy fits. She eventually visits a psychiatrist, where Eunice reveals she is worried about her fits, and is not happy about herself. The psychiatrist eventually helps her realize she does not have to let her abusive mother affect her, and leads her on the road to recovery.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Higgins, Eunice Harper}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Mama's Family characters]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eunice_Harper_Higgins"}
