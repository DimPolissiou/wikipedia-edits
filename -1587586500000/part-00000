Nonfiltrability of the agents of genetic recombination in Escherichia coli|pmid=14784479|publisher=J Bacteriol | volume=60|issue=4|pmc=385908|date=October 1950|journal=J. Bacteriol.|pages=507\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==Moralistic fallacy==\nIn a short article published in ''Nature'' in 1978, Davis coined the term \"[[moralistic fallacy]]\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis BD |title=The moralistic fallacy |journal=Nature |volume=272 |issue=5652 |page=390 |year=1978 |pmid=11643452 |doi=10.1038/272390a0|doi-access=free }}</ref> after calls for ethical guidelines to control the study of what could allegedly become \"dangerous knowledge.\"  The term was intended as a converse to the [[naturalistic fallacy]], a term coined by [[G.E. Moore]] in the early twentieth century but often applied to certain related views of [[David Hume]] in the eighteenth century. Hume pointed out the logical fallacy that occurs when deductive reasoning jumps from statements about ''what is'' to prescriptions about ''what ought to be''. Davis thus referred to the \"moralistic fallacy\" as \"in effect, an illogical effort to derive an 'is' from an 'ought'.\" \n\nSometimes a theory is rejected with a reference to the danger of misuse. In doing so, one fails to differentiate sufficiently clearly between its [[epistemological]] value and its practical value, or between the moral, value-free knowledge and \u2013 in consideration of moral valuations \u2013 the potentially negative consequences of the knowledge. From a perspective of scientific theory, the accuracy of a theory is relevant, not its practical value, its origin or history of use. No theory is protected against misuse, nor can a theory be falsified by misuse. Both misuse as well as renunciation of knowledge can have disadvantageous consequences.\n\nAn example of the naturalistic fallacy would be approving of all wars if scientific evidence showed warfare was part of human nature, whereas an example of the moralistic fallacy would be claiming that, because warfare is wrong, it cannot be part of human nature.\n\n==On scientific writing==\nOn the current format of scientific writing, Davis had opined, \"A scientific paper is an unusual art form. It has to be as compact as possible, while giving the reader all the information needed to repeat the experiments. Because the literature is vast, the format of a paper is standardized so the reader can quickly find the parts that interest him; readers skim most of the papers that they look at, except those very close to their interests. The aim is efficient, impersonal transmission of the essentials, rather than a narrative account of the steps along the way.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Davis B. \"The Moralistic Fallacy,\"''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 1978 Mar 30, 272: 390.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11643452&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum]\n* Davis B.

Bacteriol.|pages=507\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==Moralistic fallacy==\nIn a short article published in ''Nature'' in 1978, Davis coined the term \"[[moralistic fallacy]]\"<ref>{{cite journal |author=Davis BD |title=The moralistic fallacy |journal=Nature |volume=272 |issue=5652 |page=390 |year=1978 |pmid=11643452 |doi=10.1038/272390a0|doi-access=free }}</ref> after calls for ethical guidelines to control the study of what could allegedly become \"dangerous knowledge.\"  The term was intended as a converse to the [[naturalistic fallacy]], a term coined by [[G.E. Moore]] in the early twentieth century but often applied to certain related views of [[David Hume]] in the eighteenth century. Hume pointed out the logical fallacy that occurs when deductive reasoning jumps from statements about ''what is'' to prescriptions about ''what ought to be''. Davis thus referred to the \"moralistic fallacy\" as \"in effect, an illogical effort to derive an 'is' from an 'ought'.\" \n\nSometimes a theory is rejected with a reference to the danger of misuse. In doing so, one fails to differentiate sufficiently clearly between its [[epistemological]] value and its practical value, or between the moral, value-free knowledge and \u2013 in consideration of moral valuations \u2013 the potentially negative consequences of the knowledge. From a perspective of scientific theory, the accuracy of a theory is relevant, not its practical value, its origin or history of use. No theory is protected against misuse, nor can a theory be falsified by misuse. Both misuse as well as renunciation of knowledge can have disadvantageous consequences.\n\nAn example of the naturalistic fallacy would be approving of all wars if scientific evidence showed warfare was part of human nature, whereas an example of the moralistic fallacy would be claiming that, because warfare is wrong, it cannot be part of human nature.\n\n==On scientific writing==\nOn the current format of scientific writing, Davis had opined, \"A scientific paper is an unusual art form. It has to be as compact as possible, while giving the reader all the information needed to repeat the experiments. Because the literature is vast, the format of a paper is standardized so the reader can quickly find the parts that interest him; readers skim most of the papers that they look at, except those very close to their interests. The aim is efficient, impersonal transmission of the essentials, rather than a narrative account of the steps along the way.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Davis B. \"The Moralistic Fallacy,\"''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 1978 Mar 30, 272: 390.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=11643452&query_hl=1&itool=pubmed_docsum]\n* Davis B.
