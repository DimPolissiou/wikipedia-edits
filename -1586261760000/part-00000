{"title_page": "Low-cost carrier", "text_new": "{{short description|Airline with generally lower fares}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=July 2010}}\n{{More footnotes|date=December 2012}}\n}}\n[[File:Southwest N726SW abq.jpg|thumb|[[Southwest Airlines]] is the world's largest low-cost carrier.]]\n[[File:Ryanair Wizz (7141688277).jpg|thumb|[[Ryanair]] and [[Wizz Air|W!zz Air]] airplanes at [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]]. The airlines are two competing low-cost carriers in the European market.]]\nA '''low-cost carrier''' or '''low-cost airline''' (occasionally referred to as ''[[no-frills]]'', ''budget'' or ''[[Discounts and allowances|discount]] carrier'', and abbreviated as ''LCC'') is an [[airline]] that is operated with an especially high emphasis on minimizing operating costs and without some of the traditional services and amenities provided in the fare, resulting in lower fares and fewer comforts. To make up for revenue lost in decreased ticket prices, the airline may charge extra fees \u2013 such as for carry-on baggage. As of October 2019, the world's largest low-cost carrier is [[Southwest Airlines]], which operates in the United States and some surrounding areas.\n[[File:2013-05-06 Airbus A319 of Germanwings and Airbus A320 of Air Berlin at ZRH.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A319]] of [[Germanwings]] and an [[Airbus A320]] of [[Air Berlin]] at [[Zurich Airport]] in 2013. Both carriers were among the largest budget airlines in Germany at the time the picture was taken.]]\nThe term originated within the airline industry referring to airlines with a lower operating cost structure than their competitors. While the term is often applied to any carrier with low ticket prices and limited services, regardless of their operating models, low-cost carriers should not be confused with regional airlines that operate short flights without service, or with [[Airline#Operating costs|full-service airlines]] offering some reduced fares.\n\nSome airlines actively advertise themselves as '''low-cost''', '''budget''', or '''discount airlines''' while maintaining products usually associated with traditional [[mainline (aeronautics)|mainline carrier's]] services\u2014which can increase operational complexity. These products include preferred or [[assigned seating]], catering other items rather than basic beverages, differentiated [[First class (aviation)|premium cabins]], satellite or ground-based [[Wi-Fi]] [[internet]], and [[In-flight entertainment|in-flight audio and video entertainment]]. More recently, the term \"ultra low-cost carrier\" differentiates some low-cost carriers, particularly in North America where traditional airlines increasingly offer a similar service model to low-cost carriers.\n\n==Business model==\n[[File:Wizz Air A320.jpg|thumb|A [[Wizz Air|W!zz Air]] [[Airbus A320 family#A320|Airbus A320]] at [[Katowice International Airport]].]]\n[[File:SunExpress Boeing 737-800; TC-SUL@DUS;10.04.2013 702ds (8669186251).jpg|thumb|A [[SunExpress]] [[Boeing 737-800]] at [[Zurich Airport]].]]\nLow-cost carrier [[business model]] practices vary widely. Some practices are more common in certain regions, while others are generally universal. The common theme among all low-cost carriers is the reduction of cost and reduced overall fares compared to legacy carriers. They effectively reduce costs by cutting on passenger luxuries.\n\nTraditional airlines have also reduced their cost using several of these practices.\n\n===Common practices===\n\n====Aircraft====\nMost low-cost carriers operate aircraft configured with a single passenger class, and most operate just a single aircraft type, so cabin and ground crew will only have to be trained to work on one type of aircraft, however some low-cost carriers choose to operate more than one type and configure their aircraft with more than one passenger class. This is also beneficial from a maintenance standpoint as spare parts and mechanics will only be dedicated to one type of aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2012/06/southwest-airlines|title=The secrets of Southwest's continued success|website=The Economist}}</ref> These airlines tend to operate short-haul flights that suit the range of [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] (single aisle) planes. As of lately however there is also a rise in demand for long range low-cost flights and the availability of next generation planes that make long haul routes more feasible for LCCs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/insights/analysis/long-haul-low-cost-becomes-mainstream-as-full-service-airlines-gradually-embrace-new-business-models-348105|title=Long haul low cost becomes mainstream as full service airlines gradually embrace new business models|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, low-cost carriers tended to operate older aircraft purchased second-hand, such as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] and older models of the [[Boeing 737]]. Since 2000, fleets generally consist of the newest aircraft, commonly the [[Airbus A320 family]] and [[Boeing 737]]. Although buying new aircraft is usually more expensive than second-hand, new planes are cheaper to operate in the long run since they are extremely efficient in terms of fuel, training, maintenance, and crew costs per passenger.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 2013, [[ch-aviation]] published a study about the fleet strategy of low-cost carriers. They summarized that major LCCs that order aircraft in large numbers get large discounts for doing so, and due to this they can sell their aircraft just a few years after delivery at a price high enough to keep their operating costs relatively low.<ref>[http://www.ch-aviation.ch/blog/2013/07/10/low-cost-carriers-eliminate-rivals-with-unique-fleet-strategy/ ch-aviation: Low-cost carriers eliminate rivals with unique fleet strategy], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821104913/http://www.ch-aviation.ch/blog/2013/07/10/low-cost-carriers-eliminate-rivals-with-unique-fleet-strategy/ |date=2013-08-21 }} July 20, 2013.</ref>{{clarify|date=February 2019|reason=This seems to be something any large airline can do, not something unique to being a low-cost carrier. What does this have to do with being a low-cost carrier?}} Of course, the strategies of negotiating discounts for large orders and reselling planes are also available to higher-cost carriers as well.\n\nAircraft often operate with a minimum set of optional equipment, further reducing costs of acquisition and maintenance, as well as keeping the weight of the aircraft lower and thus saving fuel. [[Ryanair]] seats do not recline and do not have rear pockets, to reduce cleaning and maintenance costs. Others have no window shades. Pilot conveniences, such as [[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System|ACARS]],  may be excluded. Often, no [[in-flight entertainment]] systems are made available, though many US low-cost carriers do offer satellite television or radio in-flight.  It is also becoming a popular approach to install LCD monitors onto the aircraft and broadcast advertisements on them, coupled with the traditional route\u2013altitude\u2013speed information. Most do not offer reserved seating, hoping to encourage passengers to board early and quickly, thus decreasing turnaround times. Some allow priority boarding for an extra fee instead of reserved seating, and some allow reserving a seat in an emergency exit row (for longer leg room) at an extra cost.\n\n====Bases====\n[[File:Norwegian 737-800 acsending.jpg|thumb|A [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] [[Boeing 737-800]] at [[Trondheim Airport]].]]\nLike the major carriers, many low-cost carriers develop one or more bases to maximize destination coverage and defend their market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|author=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Chapter 5: Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca}}</ref> Many do not operate traditional [[airline hub|hubs]], but rather [[Focus city|focus cities]].\n\n====Simplicity====\n[[File:Spring Airlines aircraft with passenger boarding stairs @ PVG.jpg|thumb|Passengers boarding a [[Spring Airlines]] aircraft via passenger boarding stairs at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]].]]\nAirlines often offer a simpler fare scheme, such as charging one-way tickets half that of round-trips. Typically fares increase as the plane fills up, which rewards early reservations. \nIn Europe (and early in Southwest's history) luggage is not transferred from one flight to another, even if both flights are with the same airline. This saves costs and is thought to encourage passengers to take direct flights. Tickets are not sold with transfers, so the airline can avoid responsibility for passengers' connections in the event of a delay. Low-cost carriers often have a sparse schedule with one flight per day and route, so it would be hard to find an alternative for a missed connection. Modern US-based low-cost carriers generally transfer baggage for continuing flights, as well as transferring baggage to other airlines. Many airlines opt to have passengers board via stairs, since [[jetways]] generally cost more to lease.\n\nOften, low-cost carriers fly to smaller, less congested secondary airports and/or fly to airports during off-peak hours to avoid air traffic delays and take advantage of lower [[landing fee]]s. This is why [[Ryanair]] flies to [[Gatwick Airport]], [[Luton Airport]], and [[Stansted Airport]] in the London area and how easyJet is able to fly to [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris-Charles de Gaulle]], and [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]. In London's case however, low-cost carriers would not be able to use Heathrow anyway as the airport is running at near capacity, so there is no room to build a base. The airlines tend to offload, service and re-load the aircraft (turnaround) in shorter time periods and don't wait for late passengers, allowing maximum utilization of aircraft.\n\n====Non-flight revenue====\nLow-cost carriers generate [[ancillary revenue]] from a variety of activities, such as \u00e0 la carte features and commission-based products. Some airlines may charge a fee for a pillow or blanket or for carry-on baggage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oony.co.uk/blog/8-things-to-consider-before-booking-a-low-cost-flight|title=8 things to consider before booking a low-cost flight|work=Oony UK|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> In Europe, it is common for each and every convenience and service to have an additional charge.  [[AirAsia]], for example, generates revenue by courier services and hotels as well as flights.\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas MD-83, Allegiant Air JP7489386.jpg|thumbnail|[[Allegiant Air]] is a large United States low-cost airline.]]\n\n====Limit personnel costs====\n[[File:EASYJET AIRBUS A319 AND A320 AND A RYANAIR BOEING 737-800 AT LIVERPOOL JOHN LENNON AIRPORT JULY 2013 (9228530699).jpg|thumb|[[Ryanair]] and [[easyJet]] airplanes at [[John Lennon Airport]], [[Liverpool]], two competing low-cost carriers in the European market.]]\n[[File:PK-LFP Boeing 737-9GP ER (cn 35717 2455) Lion Air.

Both carriers are among the largest budget airlines in Southeast Asia.]]\nLow-cost carriers intend to be low-cost, so in many cases employees work multiple roles. At some airlines flight attendants also work as gate agents or assume other roles, thereby limiting personnel costs. [[Southwest Airlines]] is well known for using fuel [[Fuel hedging|hedging]] programs to reduce its overall fuel costs. Check-in at the gate of luggage requires fees, as it requires addition to the weight calculation and last-minute baggage handling.\n\nOnline check-in is becoming common, again in the interest of avoiding personnel costs.\n\nWhere permissible, some airlines have a disinclination to handle Special Service passengers, for instance by placing a higher age limit on [[unaccompanied minor]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-air.net/UMsfaq.htm |title=Definition of unaccompanied minors |publisher=Uk-air.net |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref> than full-service carriers. Often these airlines don't offer connecting tickets, since the airline will have to pay for ground crew to transfer luggage. A customer may create a connection manually by purchasing two separate tickets, but these are considered separate contracts, and the passenger bears the risk if a delayed inbound flight causes a missed connection.<ref>See e.g. connecting flight policy of [http://www.easyjet.com/en/help/at-the-airport/connect-and-transit easyJet] and [https://wizzair.com/en-gb/information-and-services/booking-information/how-to-book#faq-can-i-book-connecting-flights Wizz Air]</ref>\n\nWhen most countries had national monopolies, crews could negotiate pay raises and good pension benefits (something that costs money for the airlines only in the long term). During this period, most passengers were business travelers who paid high fares that covered these costs.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} After deregulation, which led to lower fares, many airlines remained bound to these salary agreements and pensions, whereas new low-cost carriers employed new staff with lower salaries, especially for cabin crew, keeping personnel costs low and allowing for competitive fares. In some cases airlines have gone bankrupt (e.g., [[Alitalia]], [[Sabena]], and [[Swissair]]), and new airlines replaced them.\n\nTraditional carriers followed the low-cost carriers by enabling web check-in, encouraging machine check-in at the airport, and generally reducing ground personnel cost. Ryanair is unique because it primarily operates at secondary airports without any competition, so it can easily negotiate large cost reductions and deals with the airport owners.\n\nThe number of [[Flight attendant|crew members]] follow international conventions that require one flight attendant per 50 passenger seats and two pilots. No carrier can save money by reducing flight crew, but they can reduce ground crew.\n\nCarriers like Ryanair hire pilots through third-party agencies based in low-tax countries without benefits for sick pay, pensions or health insurance.<ref name=ryanair-cancellations>{{cite news|last1=Humphries|first1=Conor|last2=Bryan|first2=Victoria|title=Ryanair crisis exposes low-cost scramble for senior pilots|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ryanair-cancellations/ryanair-crisis-exposes-low-cost-scramble-for-senior-pilots-idUKKCN1BX2C1|accessdate=22 September 2017|agency=Reuters|date=22 Sep 2017}}</ref> Traditional carriers have also started to try this, including starting their own low-tax agencies.<ref>[https://skift.com/2017/06/14/why-scandinavias-sas-is-creating-a-new-airline-with-the-same-name-in-ireland/ Why Scandinavia\u2019s SAS Is Creating a New Airline With the Same Name in Ireland]</ref> These agencies can easily find less experienced co-pilots and cabin crew, as the profession is popular, but there are problems for low-cost carriers to recruit and keep captains who have to be experienced.<ref name=ryanair-cancellations/>\n\n====Principles of operation====\n[[File:Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos B737-8EH (PR-GTL) at Afonso Pena International Airport.jpg|thumb|A [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]] [[Boeing 737-800]] at [[Afonso Pena International Airport]].]]\nAt [[IATA]], a LCC operation is defined as including the following characteristics, at least to some degree:<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/Documents/economics/airline_cost_performance.pdf |title= Airline Cost Performance |publisher= IATA |date= July 2006 |access-date= 2015-06-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150226013033/http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/Documents/economics/airline_cost_performance.pdf |archive-date= 2015-02-26 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n* Primarily point-to-point operations\n* Short-haul routes, often between regional or secondary airports\n* Strong focus on price-sensitive traffic, mostly leisure passengers\n* Typically a single service class, with no (or limited) customer loyalty programmes\n* Limited passenger services, with additional charges for some services (e.g., on-board catering)\n* Low average fares, with a strong focus on price competition\n* Different fares offered, related to aircraft load factors and length of time before departure\n* A very high proportion of bookings made through the Internet\n* High aircraft utilisation rates, with short turnaround between operations\n* A fleet of just one or two aircraft types\n* Private-sector companies\n* A simple management and overhead structure with a lean strategic decision-making process\n\nWhile low-cost airlines differ in service offerings, by definition they feature most of the following:\n* Standardized fleet (lower training, maintenance costs;

Many airlines these days work with aircraft manufacturers, but airlines such as AirAsia goes a step further, working with airports to develop specially designed [[Low cost carrier terminal|low-cost terminals]] that require far less overhead. Lower costs are passed on to the airline, and in turn to the customer. Ryanair generally make the airports accept their boarding passes which passengers print themselves, although at some airports (where Ryanair is not dominating) passengers have to replace it with a normal boarding pass from the airport. Other practices that reduce expenses are the use of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] for aircraft checkups, tablet PCs instead of logs on paper (reduces airplane weight), and smartglasses for the pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtrafficmanagement.net/2014/05/easyjet-to-use-drones-for-aircraft-checks/|title=easyJet to use drones for aircraft checks|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Differentiation===\nNot every low-cost carrier implements all of the above points. For example, some try to differentiate themselves with allocated seating, while others operate more than one aircraft type, still others have relatively high operating costs but lower fares. [[JetBlue]], for instance, has in-flight entertainment in every passenger seat. Other airlines are limited on what points they can implement based on local laws. For example, [[Ryanair]] cannot remove window blinds from its aircraft, as they are required by the Irish Aviation Authority. As supply increases, this sort of differentiation by brand is an important criteria for the future success of low-cost carriers, since many experts believe price competition alone is not enough, given the number of carriers.<ref>Strauss, Michael (2010) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0557612462 Value Creation in Travel Distribution]</ref>\n\nAs the number of low-cost carriers has grown, these airlines have begun to compete with one another in addition to the traditional carriers. In the US, airlines have responded by introducing variations to the model. [[JetBlue Airways]] advertises satellite television. Advertiser-supported [[Skybus Airlines]] launched from Columbus in 2007, but ceased operations in April 2008. In Europe, the emphasis has remained on reducing costs and no-frills service. In 2004, Ryanair announced proposals to eliminate reclining seats, window blinds, seat headrest covers, and seat pockets from its aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/16/1076779906593.html?from=storyrhs |title=Ryanair cuts reclining seats; suitcases next to go \u2013 BusinessNews |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date=17 February 2004 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>\n\nIndia's [[Air India Express]] offers a complimentary meal with beverages on most of its flights.<ref>[http://www.mihinlanka.com/eng/pages/on_board_service ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924035946/http://www.mihinlanka.com/eng/pages/on_board_service |date=September 24, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Ultra low-cost carrier===\nA secondary term \"ultra low-cost carrier\" (ULCC) has been used to differentiate some low-cost airlines whose model deviates further from that of a standard low-cost carrier, with ultra low-cost carriers having minimal inclusions in the fare and a greater number of add-on fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationpros.com/news/12007038/ultra-low-cost-carriers-set-their-sights-on-expansion|title=Ultra-low-cost Carriers Set Their Sights On Expansion|work=AviationPros.com|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> [[Spirit Airlines]] and [[Allegiant Air]] have been most commonly referred to as Ultra Low-Cost,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flymsy.com/press-room/New-Ultra-Low-Cost-Airline-Begins-Service-in-February?&Sort=|title=New Ultra-Low Cost Airline Begins Service in February \u2013 Press Room|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> with [[Frontier Airlines]] in 2015 announcing a new strategy to reposition themselves as ultra low-cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_25650263/frontier-unveils-fare-strategy-carry-pricing|title=Frontier unveils ultra-low-cost fare strategy, carry-on pricing|work=The Denver Post|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> Following the appointment of former Allegiant Air COO Jude Bricker as their new CEO, [[Sun Country Airlines]] began transitioning to an ultra low-cost carrier model in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2017/08/22/sun-country-signals-shift-ultra-low-cost-airline/|title=Sun Country signals shift to ultra low-cost airline \u2013 Business Traveller \u2013 The leading magazine for frequent flyers|date=2017-08-22|work=Business Traveller \u2013 The leading magazine for frequent flyers|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2017/08/17/sun-country-changes/|title=Sun Country Will Transform Into An Ultra Low Cost Carrier \u2013 One Mile at a Time|date=2017-08-17|work=One Mile at a Time|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-US}}</ref> In Canada, [[Swoop (airline)|Swoop]] is an ultra low-cost carrier operated by [[WestJet]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/swoop-cancelled-flights-air-passenger-rights-cta-1.5210121|title=30 cancelled Swoop flights leave customers bitter.

Like other carriers, even if the advertised price may be very low, it often does not include charges and taxes. With some airlines, some flights are advertised as free (plus applicable taxes, fees and charges). Depending on the airline, perhaps as many (or as few) as ten percent of the seats on any flight are offered at the lowest price and are the first to sell. The prices steadily rise thereafter to a point where they can be comparable or more expensive than a flight on a full-service carrier.\n\nMost airlines charge additional taxes and fees on their tickets. Some low-cost airlines have been known to charge fees for the seemingly ridiculous, such as levying a credit card charge if credit card is the only payment method accepted. Many consumers and legislative bodies{{Who|date=January 2019}} consider this to be fraudulent, but some still allow it and similar practices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nTraditional perceptions of the \"low-cost carrier\" as a stripped-down, no-frills airline have been changing as new entrants to the market offer passengers more options, as well as premium amenities. [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] offers all passengers generous legroom, complementary snacks, and live in-flight television.  JetBlue also offers a first class cabin with lie-flat seats on some flights. [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] allows passengers to check two bags for free. Other amenities found on low-cost airlines include premium cabins, in-flight [[Wifi]], and rewards programs.\n\n==Criticism==\nSome elements of the low-cost model have been subject to criticism by governments and regulators; and in the UK in particular, the issue of \"unbundling\" of ancillary charges by both low-cost carriers and other airlines (showing airport fees or taxes as separate charges rather than as part of the advertised fare) to make the \"headline fare\" appear lower has resulted in enforcement action.<ref>{{ cite web | url = https://scottscheapflights.com/resources/history/low-cost-airline/ | title = A Brief History of the Low-Cost Airline | work = Scott's Cheap Flights | accessdate = July 27, 2017 }}</ref> Believing that this amounts to a misleading approach to pricing, the United Kingdom's [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) in February 2007 gave all carriers and travel companies three months to include all fixed non-optional costs in their basic advertised prices. Although the full-service carriers had complied within the specified timescales, the low-cost carriers have been less compliant in this respect, leading to the prospect of legal action by the OFT.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6759197.stm |title=UK &#124; Action threatened over air fares |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-16 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>\n\nSome destination cities lie relatively far from the airports that low-cost airlines use to save costs. Examples of this are [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport|Hahn]], [[Weeze Airport|Weeze]] and [[Girona\u2013Costa Brava Airport|Girona]] airports\u2014which low-cost airlines advertise as the destinations for [[Frankfurt]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], and [[Barcelona]], respectively\u2014even though these airports are 50 to 90 kilometres away.

For instance, [[Aer Lingus]] turned down the opportunity to buy [[Ryanair]] for 29 million [[Irish pound]]s (\u20ac{{#expr:29/0.787564round1}} million). The company further stated that it would not have developed Ryanair and instead would have shut it down.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://atwonline.com/blog/can-air-transport-industry-be-uber-ized |title= Can the air transport industry be \u2018Uber-ized\u2019? |date= Nov 10, 2017 |author= Victoria Moores |work= Aviation Week Network}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWhile tour and package operators have offered lower-priced, lower-frilled traveling for a large part of modern airline history, not until during the post\u2013[[Vietnam War]] era did this business model escalate. Through various ticket consolidators, [[charter airline]]s, and innovators in lower-frills flying, such as [[Channel Airways]] and [[Court Line]], the traveling public had been conditioned to want to travel to new and increasingly further away and exotic locations on vacation, rather than short-haul trips to nearby beach resorts.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe world's first low-cost airline was [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]], which started intrastate flights connecting Southern and Northern California on 6 May 1949. PSA's light-hearted atmosphere and efficient operations were a runaway success early on, and inspired a number of low-cost start-ups across the United States, beginning in the mid-60s. [[Herb Kelleher]] studied the success of PSA, and copied their culture closely when he established [[Southwest Airlines]] in 1971.\n\nThe first airline to offer cheaper transatlantic fares was Icelandic airline [[Loftleidir|Loftlei\u00f0ir]] in 1964, often referred to as \"the Hippie Airline\". Many young Americans travelled to Europe after graduation, to experience the \"old-world culture\", and they were more concerned with getting there cheaply than comfortably or even exactly on time. Loftlei\u00f0ir were not famous for speed or punctuality, but flying with the company became a sort of rite of passage for those young \"hippies\", one of whom was [[Bill Clinton]], later US President.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.loftleidir.com/our-history/|title = Our History|date = |accessdate = March 22, 2015|website = [[Loftleidir Icelandic]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n[[File:THE NEW CEMENT LITTER BASKETS ON FIFTH AVENUE ARE DESIGNED TO BE THEFT-PROOF AND TO PAY FOR THEMSELVES THROUGH THE... - NARA - 549812.jpg|thumb|Advert for Loftlei\u00f0ir Icelandic Airlines on Fifth Avenue, New York in 1973]]\n\nThe first airline offering no-frills transatlantic service was [[Freddie Laker]]'s [[Laker Airways]], which operated its famous \"Skytrain\" service between London and New York City during the late 1970s. The service was suspended after Laker's competitors, [[British Airways]] and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], were able to price Skytrain out of the market.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the United States, airline carriers such as [[Midway Airlines (1976\u20131991)|Midway Airlines]] and [[America West Airlines]], which commenced operations after 1978, soon realized a [[Available seat miles|cost of available seat mile]] (CASM) advantage in relation to the traditional and established, [[Legacy carrier|legacy airlines]] such as [[Trans World Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]]. Often this CASM advantage has been attributed solely to the lower labor costs of the newly hired and lower pay grade workers of new start-up carriers, such as [[ValuJet]], [[Midway Airlines (1976\u20131991)|Midway Airlines]], and their like. However, these lower costs can also be attributed to the less complex aircraft fleets and route networks with which these new carriers began operations, in addition to their reduced labor costs.\n\nTo combat the new round of low-cost and start-up entrants into the very competitive and deregulated United States airline industry, the [[Mainline (flight)|mainline]] [[major carrier]]s and [[legacy carrier|network legacy carriers]] strategically developed no-frills divisions within the main airlines brand and corporate structures. Among these were [[Continental Lite]], [[Delta Express]], [[MetroJet]], [[Shuttle by United]], [[Song (airline)|Song]], and [[Ted (airline)|Ted]]. However, most of these \"airlines within an airline\" were short-lived and quickly disposed-of when economic rationalization or competitive pressures subsided.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nTaking a page{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} from the mainline, major, or legacy carriers' desire to reduce costs in all ways possible in regards regional route networks by outsourcing regional operations to the lowest expense airline bidder capable of operating regional aircraft, a new generation of low-cost airlines (in name only) soon evolved in the US with varying levels of success. Among these varieties of low-cost and discount operators were noteworthy starts-ups that managed to get off the ground by using the larger aircraft services of established charter airlines. Among this group were the [[virtual airline (economics)|virtual airlines]]; [[Direct Air]], [[People Express Airlines|PeoplExpress]], [[Western (airline)|Western]], and those that never began service such as [[JetAmerica]].

To make up for revenue lost in decreased ticket prices, the airline may charge extra fees \u2013 such as for carry-on baggage. As of October 2019, the world's largest low-cost carrier is [[Southwest Airlines]], which operates in the United States and some surrounding areas.\n[[File:2013-05-06 Airbus A319 of Germanwings and Airbus A320 of Air Berlin at ZRH.jpg|thumb|[[Airbus A319]] of [[Germanwings]] and an [[Airbus A320]] of [[Air Berlin]] at [[Zurich Airport]] in 2013.

While the term is often applied to any carrier with low ticket prices and limited services, regardless of their operating models, low-cost carriers should not be confused with regional airlines that operate short flights without service, or with [[Airline#Operating costs|full-service airlines]] offering some reduced fares.\n\nSome airlines actively advertise themselves as '''low-cost''', '''budget''', or '''discount airlines''' while maintaining products usually associated with traditional [[mainline (aeronautics)|mainline carrier's]] services\u2014which can increase operational complexity. These products include preferred or [[assigned seating]], catering other items rather than basic beverages, differentiated [[First class (aviation)|premium cabins]], satellite or ground-based [[Wi-Fi]] [[internet]], and [[In-flight entertainment|in-flight audio and video entertainment]]. More recently, the term \"ultra low-cost carrier\" differentiates some low-cost carriers, particularly in North America where traditional airlines increasingly offer a similar service model to low-cost carriers.\n\n==Business model==\n[[File:Wizz Air A320.jpg|thumb|A [[Wizz Air|W!zz Air]] [[Airbus A320 family#A320|Airbus A320]] at [[Katowice International Airport]].]]\n[[File:SunExpress Boeing 737-800; TC-SUL@DUS;10.04.2013 702ds (8669186251).jpg|thumb|A [[SunExpress]] [[Boeing 737-800]] at [[Zurich Airport]].]]\nLow-cost carrier [[business model]] practices vary widely. Some practices are more common in certain regions, while others are generally universal. The common theme among all low-cost carriers is the reduction of cost and reduced overall fares compared to legacy carriers.\n\nTraditional airlines have also reduced their cost using several of these practices.\n\n===Common practices===\n\n====Aircraft====\nMost low-cost carriers operate aircraft configured with a single passenger class, and most operate just a single aircraft type, so cabin and ground crew will only have to be trained to work on one type of aircraft, however some low-cost carriers choose to operate more than one type and configure their aircraft with more than one passenger class. This is also beneficial from a maintenance standpoint as spare parts and mechanics will only be dedicated to one type of aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2012/06/southwest-airlines|title=The secrets of Southwest's continued success|website=The Economist}}</ref> These airlines tend to operate short-haul flights that suit the range of [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] (single aisle) planes. As of lately however there is also a rise in demand for long range low-cost flights and the availability of next generation planes that make long haul routes more feasible for LCCs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://centreforaviation.com/insights/analysis/long-haul-low-cost-becomes-mainstream-as-full-service-airlines-gradually-embrace-new-business-models-348105|title=Long haul low cost becomes mainstream as full service airlines gradually embrace new business models|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn the past, low-cost carriers tended to operate older aircraft purchased second-hand, such as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] and older models of the [[Boeing 737]]. Since 2000, fleets generally consist of the newest aircraft, commonly the [[Airbus A320 family]] and [[Boeing 737]]. Although buying new aircraft is usually more expensive than second-hand, new planes are cheaper to operate in the long run since they are extremely efficient in terms of fuel, training, maintenance, and crew costs per passenger.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 2013, [[ch-aviation]] published a study about the fleet strategy of low-cost carriers. They summarized that major LCCs that order aircraft in large numbers get large discounts for doing so, and due to this they can sell their aircraft just a few years after delivery at a price high enough to keep their operating costs relatively low.<ref>[http://www.ch-aviation.ch/blog/2013/07/10/low-cost-carriers-eliminate-rivals-with-unique-fleet-strategy/ ch-aviation: Low-cost carriers eliminate rivals with unique fleet strategy], {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821104913/http://www.ch-aviation.ch/blog/2013/07/10/low-cost-carriers-eliminate-rivals-with-unique-fleet-strategy/ |date=2013-08-21 }} July 20, 2013.</ref>{{clarify|date=February 2019|reason=This seems to be something any large airline can do, not something unique to being a low-cost carrier. What does this have to do with being a low-cost carrier?}} Of course, the strategies of negotiating discounts for large orders and reselling planes are also available to higher-cost carriers as well.\n\nAircraft often operate with a minimum set of optional equipment, further reducing costs of acquisition and maintenance, as well as keeping the weight of the aircraft lower and thus saving fuel. [[Ryanair]] seats do not recline and do not have rear pockets, to reduce cleaning and maintenance costs. Others have no window shades. Pilot conveniences, such as [[Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System|ACARS]],  may be excluded. Often, no [[in-flight entertainment]] systems are made available, though many US low-cost carriers do offer satellite television or radio in-flight.  It is also becoming a popular approach to install LCD monitors onto the aircraft and broadcast advertisements on them, coupled with the traditional route\u2013altitude\u2013speed information. Most do not offer reserved seating, hoping to encourage passengers to board early and quickly, thus decreasing turnaround times. Some allow priority boarding for an extra fee instead of reserved seating, and some allow reserving a seat in an emergency exit row (for longer leg room) at an extra cost.\n\n====Bases====\n[[File:Norwegian 737-800 acsending.jpg|thumb|A [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] [[Boeing 737-800]] at [[Trondheim Airport]].]]\nLike the major carriers, many low-cost carriers develop one or more bases to maximize destination coverage and defend their market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|author=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. & von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Chapter 5: Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca}}</ref> Many do not operate traditional [[airline hub|hubs]], but rather [[Focus city|focus cities]].\n\n====Simplicity====\n[[File:Spring Airlines aircraft with passenger boarding stairs @ PVG.jpg|thumb|Passengers boarding a [[Spring Airlines]] aircraft via passenger boarding stairs at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]].]]\nAirlines often offer a simpler fare scheme, such as charging one-way tickets half that of round-trips. Typically fares increase as the plane fills up, which rewards early reservations. \nIn Europe (and early in Southwest's history) luggage is not transferred from one flight to another, even if both flights are with the same airline. This saves costs and is thought to encourage passengers to take direct flights. Tickets are not sold with transfers, so the airline can avoid responsibility for passengers' connections in the event of a delay. Low-cost carriers often have a sparse schedule with one flight per day and route, so it would be hard to find an alternative for a missed connection. Modern US-based low-cost carriers generally transfer baggage for continuing flights, as well as transferring baggage to other airlines. Many airlines opt to have passengers board via stairs, since [[jetways]] generally cost more to lease.\n\nOften, low-cost carriers fly to smaller, less congested secondary airports and/or fly to airports during off-peak hours to avoid air traffic delays and take advantage of lower [[landing fee]]s. This is why [[Ryanair]] flies to [[Gatwick Airport]], [[Luton Airport]], and [[Stansted Airport]] in the London area and how easyJet is able to fly to [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris-Charles de Gaulle]], and [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol|Amsterdam]]. In London's case however, low-cost carriers would not be able to use Heathrow anyway as the airport is running at near capacity, so there is no room to build a base. The airlines tend to offload, service and re-load the aircraft (turnaround) in shorter time periods and don't wait for late passengers, allowing maximum utilization of aircraft.\n\n====Non-flight revenue====\nLow-cost carriers generate [[ancillary revenue]] from a variety of activities, such as \u00e0 la carte features and commission-based products. Some airlines may charge a fee for a pillow or blanket or for carry-on baggage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oony.co.uk/blog/8-things-to-consider-before-booking-a-low-cost-flight|title=8 things to consider before booking a low-cost flight|work=Oony UK|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> In Europe, it is common for each and every convenience and service to have an additional charge.  [[AirAsia]], for example, generates revenue by courier services and hotels as well as flights.\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas MD-83, Allegiant Air JP7489386.jpg|thumbnail|[[Allegiant Air]] is a large United States low-cost airline.]]\n\n====Limit personnel costs====\n[[File:EASYJET AIRBUS A319 AND A320 AND A RYANAIR BOEING 737-800 AT LIVERPOOL JOHN LENNON AIRPORT JULY 2013 (9228530699).jpg|thumb|[[Ryanair]] and [[easyJet]] airplanes at [[John Lennon Airport]], [[Liverpool]], two competing low-cost carriers in the European market.]]\n[[File:PK-LFP Boeing 737-9GP ER (cn 35717 2455) Lion Air.

At some airlines flight attendants also work as gate agents or assume other roles, thereby limiting personnel costs. [[Southwest Airlines]] is well known for using fuel [[Fuel hedging|hedging]] programs to reduce its overall fuel costs. Check-in at the gate of luggage requires fees, as it requires addition to the weight calculation and last-minute baggage handling.\n\nOnline check-in is becoming common, again in the interest of avoiding personnel costs.\n\nWhere permissible, some airlines have a disinclination to handle Special Service passengers, for instance by placing a higher age limit on [[unaccompanied minor]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uk-air.net/UMsfaq.htm |title=Definition of unaccompanied minors |publisher=Uk-air.net |date=2012-01-27 |accessdate=2012-04-09}}</ref> than full-service carriers. Often these airlines don't offer connecting tickets, since the airline will have to pay for ground crew to transfer luggage. A customer may create a connection manually by purchasing two separate tickets, but these are considered separate contracts, and the passenger bears the risk if a delayed inbound flight causes a missed connection.<ref>See e.g. connecting flight policy of [http://www.easyjet.com/en/help/at-the-airport/connect-and-transit easyJet] and [https://wizzair.com/en-gb/information-and-services/booking-information/how-to-book#faq-can-i-book-connecting-flights Wizz Air]</ref>\n\nWhen most countries had national monopolies, crews could negotiate pay raises and good pension benefits (something that costs money for the airlines only in the long term). During this period, most passengers were business travelers who paid high fares that covered these costs.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} After deregulation, which led to lower fares, many airlines remained bound to these salary agreements and pensions, whereas new low-cost carriers employed new staff with lower salaries, especially for cabin crew, keeping personnel costs low and allowing for competitive fares. In some cases airlines have gone bankrupt (e.g., [[Alitalia]], [[Sabena]], and [[Swissair]]), and new airlines replaced them.\n\nTraditional carriers followed the low-cost carriers by enabling web check-in, encouraging machine check-in at the airport, and generally reducing ground personnel cost. Ryanair is unique because it primarily operates at secondary airports without any competition, so it can easily negotiate large cost reductions and deals with the airport owners.\n\nThe number of [[Flight attendant|crew members]] follow international conventions that require one flight attendant per 50 passenger seats and two pilots. No carrier can save money by reducing flight crew, but they can reduce ground crew.\n\nCarriers like Ryanair hire pilots through third-party agencies based in low-tax countries without benefits for sick pay, pensions or health insurance.<ref name=ryanair-cancellations>{{cite news|last1=Humphries|first1=Conor|last2=Bryan|first2=Victoria|title=Ryanair crisis exposes low-cost scramble for senior pilots|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ryanair-cancellations/ryanair-crisis-exposes-low-cost-scramble-for-senior-pilots-idUKKCN1BX2C1|accessdate=22 September 2017|agency=Reuters|date=22 Sep 2017}}</ref> Traditional carriers have also started to try this, including starting their own low-tax agencies.<ref>[https://skift.com/2017/06/14/why-scandinavias-sas-is-creating-a-new-airline-with-the-same-name-in-ireland/ Why Scandinavia\u2019s SAS Is Creating a New Airline With the Same Name in Ireland]</ref> These agencies can easily find less experienced co-pilots and cabin crew, as the profession is popular, but there are problems for low-cost carriers to recruit and keep captains who have to be experienced.<ref name=ryanair-cancellations/>\n\n====Principles of operation====\n[[File:Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos B737-8EH (PR-GTL) at Afonso Pena International Airport.jpg|thumb|A [[Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos]] [[Boeing 737-800]] at [[Afonso Pena International Airport]].]]\nAt [[IATA]], a LCC operation is defined as including the following characteristics, at least to some degree:<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.iata.org/whatwedo/Documents/economics/airline_cost_performance.pdf |title= Airline Cost Performance |publisher= IATA |date= July 2006 |access-date= 2015-06-30 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150226013033/http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/Documents/economics/airline_cost_performance.pdf |archive-date= 2015-02-26 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n* Primarily point-to-point operations\n* Short-haul routes, often between regional or secondary airports\n* Strong focus on price-sensitive traffic, mostly leisure passengers\n* Typically a single service class, with no (or limited) customer loyalty programmes\n* Limited passenger services, with additional charges for some services (e.g., on-board catering)\n* Low average fares, with a strong focus on price competition\n* Different fares offered, related to aircraft load factors and length of time before departure\n* A very high proportion of bookings made through the Internet\n* High aircraft utilisation rates, with short turnaround between operations\n* A fleet of just one or two aircraft types\n* Private-sector companies\n* A simple management and overhead structure with a lean strategic decision-making process\n\nWhile low-cost airlines differ in service offerings, by definition they feature most of the following:\n* Standardized fleet (lower training, maintenance costs;

Many airlines these days work with aircraft manufacturers, but airlines such as AirAsia goes a step further, working with airports to develop specially designed [[Low cost carrier terminal|low-cost terminals]] that require far less overhead. Lower costs are passed on to the airline, and in turn to the customer. Ryanair generally make the airports accept their boarding passes which passengers print themselves, although at some airports (where Ryanair is not dominating) passengers have to replace it with a normal boarding pass from the airport. Other practices that reduce expenses are the use of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAVs]] for aircraft checkups, tablet PCs instead of logs on paper (reduces airplane weight), and smartglasses for the pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtrafficmanagement.net/2014/05/easyjet-to-use-drones-for-aircraft-checks/|title=easyJet to use drones for aircraft checks|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Differentiation===\nNot every low-cost carrier implements all of the above points. For example, some try to differentiate themselves with allocated seating, while others operate more than one aircraft type, still others have relatively high operating costs but lower fares. [[JetBlue]], for instance, has in-flight entertainment in every passenger seat. Other airlines are limited on what points they can implement based on local laws. For example, [[Ryanair]] cannot remove window blinds from its aircraft, as they are required by the Irish Aviation Authority. As supply increases, this sort of differentiation by brand is an important criteria for the future success of low-cost carriers, since many experts believe price competition alone is not enough, given the number of carriers.<ref>Strauss, Michael (2010) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0557612462 Value Creation in Travel Distribution]</ref>\n\nAs the number of low-cost carriers has grown, these airlines have begun to compete with one another in addition to the traditional carriers. In the US, airlines have responded by introducing variations to the model. [[JetBlue Airways]] advertises satellite television. Advertiser-supported [[Skybus Airlines]] launched from Columbus in 2007, but ceased operations in April 2008. In Europe, the emphasis has remained on reducing costs and no-frills service. In 2004, Ryanair announced proposals to eliminate reclining seats, window blinds, seat headrest covers, and seat pockets from its aircraft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/16/1076779906593.html?from=storyrhs |title=Ryanair cuts reclining seats; suitcases next to go \u2013 BusinessNews |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date=17 February 2004 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>\n\nIndia's [[Air India Express]] offers a complimentary meal with beverages on most of its flights.<ref>[http://www.mihinlanka.com/eng/pages/on_board_service ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924035946/http://www.mihinlanka.com/eng/pages/on_board_service |date=September 24, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Ultra low-cost carrier===\nA secondary term \"ultra low-cost carrier\" (ULCC) has been used to differentiate some low-cost airlines whose model deviates further from that of a standard low-cost carrier, with ultra low-cost carriers having minimal inclusions in the fare and a greater number of add-on fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationpros.com/news/12007038/ultra-low-cost-carriers-set-their-sights-on-expansion|title=Ultra-low-cost Carriers Set Their Sights On Expansion|work=AviationPros.com|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> [[Spirit Airlines]] and [[Allegiant Air]] have been most commonly referred to as Ultra Low-Cost,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flymsy.com/press-room/New-Ultra-Low-Cost-Airline-Begins-Service-in-February?&Sort=|title=New Ultra-Low Cost Airline Begins Service in February \u2013 Press Room|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> with [[Frontier Airlines]] in 2015 announcing a new strategy to reposition themselves as ultra low-cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_25650263/frontier-unveils-fare-strategy-carry-pricing|title=Frontier unveils ultra-low-cost fare strategy, carry-on pricing|work=The Denver Post|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref> Following the appointment of former Allegiant Air COO Jude Bricker as their new CEO, [[Sun Country Airlines]] began transitioning to an ultra low-cost carrier model in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2017/08/22/sun-country-signals-shift-ultra-low-cost-airline/|title=Sun Country signals shift to ultra low-cost airline \u2013 Business Traveller \u2013 The leading magazine for frequent flyers|date=2017-08-22|work=Business Traveller \u2013 The leading magazine for frequent flyers|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://onemileatatime.boardingarea.com/2017/08/17/sun-country-changes/|title=Sun Country Will Transform Into An Ultra Low Cost Carrier \u2013 One Mile at a Time|date=2017-08-17|work=One Mile at a Time|access-date=2018-02-05|language=en-US}}</ref> In Canada, [[Swoop (airline)|Swoop]] is an ultra low-cost carrier operated by [[WestJet]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/swoop-cancelled-flights-air-passenger-rights-cta-1.5210121|title=30 cancelled Swoop flights leave customers bitter.

Like other carriers, even if the advertised price may be very low, it often does not include charges and taxes. With some airlines, some flights are advertised as free (plus applicable taxes, fees and charges). Depending on the airline, perhaps as many (or as few) as ten percent of the seats on any flight are offered at the lowest price and are the first to sell. The prices steadily rise thereafter to a point where they can be comparable or more expensive than a flight on a full-service carrier.\n\nMost airlines charge additional taxes and fees on their tickets. Some low-cost airlines have been known to charge fees for the seemingly ridiculous, such as levying a credit card charge if credit card is the only payment method accepted. Many consumers and legislative bodies{{Who|date=January 2019}} consider this to be fraudulent, but some still allow it and similar practices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nTraditional perceptions of the \"low-cost carrier\" as a stripped-down, no-frills airline have been changing as new entrants to the market offer passengers more options, as well as premium amenities. [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] offers all passengers generous legroom, complementary snacks, and live in-flight television.  JetBlue also offers a first class cabin with lie-flat seats on some flights. [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]] allows passengers to check two bags for free. Other amenities found on low-cost airlines include premium cabins, in-flight [[Wifi]], and rewards programs.\n\n==Criticism==\nSome elements of the low-cost model have been subject to criticism by governments and regulators; and in the UK in particular, the issue of \"unbundling\" of ancillary charges by both low-cost carriers and other airlines (showing airport fees or taxes as separate charges rather than as part of the advertised fare) to make the \"headline fare\" appear lower has resulted in enforcement action.<ref>{{ cite web | url = https://scottscheapflights.com/resources/history/low-cost-airline/ | title = A Brief History of the Low-Cost Airline | work = Scott's Cheap Flights | accessdate = July 27, 2017 }}</ref> Believing that this amounts to a misleading approach to pricing, the United Kingdom's [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) in February 2007 gave all carriers and travel companies three months to include all fixed non-optional costs in their basic advertised prices. Although the full-service carriers had complied within the specified timescales, the low-cost carriers have been less compliant in this respect, leading to the prospect of legal action by the OFT.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6759197.stm |title=UK &#124; Action threatened over air fares |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-16 |accessdate=2009-03-10}}</ref>\n\nSome destination cities lie relatively far from the airports that low-cost airlines use to save costs. Examples of this are [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport|Hahn]], [[Weeze Airport|Weeze]] and [[Girona\u2013Costa Brava Airport|Girona]] airports\u2014which low-cost airlines advertise as the destinations for [[Frankfurt]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], and [[Barcelona]], respectively\u2014even though these airports are 50 to 90 kilometres away.

For instance, [[Aer Lingus]] turned down the opportunity to buy [[Ryanair]] for 29 million [[Irish pound]]s (\u20ac{{#expr:29/0.787564round1}} million). The company further stated that it would not have developed Ryanair and instead would have shut it down.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://atwonline.com/blog/can-air-transport-industry-be-uber-ized |title= Can the air transport industry be \u2018Uber-ized\u2019? |date= Nov 10, 2017 |author= Victoria Moores |work= Aviation Week Network}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWhile tour and package operators have offered lower-priced, lower-frilled traveling for a large part of modern airline history, not until during the post\u2013[[Vietnam War]] era did this business model escalate. Through various ticket consolidators, [[charter airline]]s, and innovators in lower-frills flying, such as [[Channel Airways]] and [[Court Line]], the traveling public had been conditioned to want to travel to new and increasingly further away and exotic locations on vacation, rather than short-haul trips to nearby beach resorts.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe world's first low-cost airline was [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]], which started intrastate flights connecting Southern and Northern California on 6 May 1949. PSA's light-hearted atmosphere and efficient operations were a runaway success early on, and inspired a number of low-cost start-ups across the United States, beginning in the mid-60s. [[Herb Kelleher]] studied the success of PSA, and copied their culture closely when he established [[Southwest Airlines]] in 1971.\n\nThe first airline to offer cheaper transatlantic fares was Icelandic airline [[Loftleidir|Loftlei\u00f0ir]] in 1964, often referred to as \"the Hippie Airline\". Many young Americans travelled to Europe after graduation, to experience the \"old-world culture\", and they were more concerned with getting there cheaply than comfortably or even exactly on time. Loftlei\u00f0ir were not famous for speed or punctuality, but flying with the company became a sort of rite of passage for those young \"hippies\", one of whom was [[Bill Clinton]], later US President.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.loftleidir.com/our-history/|title = Our History|date = |accessdate = March 22, 2015|website = [[Loftleidir Icelandic]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n[[File:THE NEW CEMENT LITTER BASKETS ON FIFTH AVENUE ARE DESIGNED TO BE THEFT-PROOF AND TO PAY FOR THEMSELVES THROUGH THE... - NARA - 549812.jpg|thumb|Advert for Loftlei\u00f0ir Icelandic Airlines on Fifth Avenue, New York in 1973]]\n\nThe first airline offering no-frills transatlantic service was [[Freddie Laker]]'s [[Laker Airways]], which operated its famous \"Skytrain\" service between London and New York City during the late 1970s. The service was suspended after Laker's competitors, [[British Airways]] and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], were able to price Skytrain out of the market.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the United States, airline carriers such as [[Midway Airlines (1976\u20131991)|Midway Airlines]] and [[America West Airlines]], which commenced operations after 1978, soon realized a [[Available seat miles|cost of available seat mile]] (CASM) advantage in relation to the traditional and established, [[Legacy carrier|legacy airlines]] such as [[Trans World Airlines]] and [[American Airlines]]. Often this CASM advantage has been attributed solely to the lower labor costs of the newly hired and lower pay grade workers of new start-up carriers, such as [[ValuJet]], [[Midway Airlines (1976\u20131991)|Midway Airlines]], and their like. However, these lower costs can also be attributed to the less complex aircraft fleets and route networks with which these new carriers began operations, in addition to their reduced labor costs.\n\nTo combat the new round of low-cost and start-up entrants into the very competitive and deregulated United States airline industry, the [[Mainline (flight)|mainline]] [[major carrier]]s and [[legacy carrier|network legacy carriers]] strategically developed no-frills divisions within the main airlines brand and corporate structures. Among these were [[Continental Lite]], [[Delta Express]], [[MetroJet]], [[Shuttle by United]], [[Song (airline)|Song]], and [[Ted (airline)|Ted]]. However, most of these \"airlines within an airline\" were short-lived and quickly disposed-of when economic rationalization or competitive pressures subsided.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nTaking a page{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=December 2017}} from the mainline, major, or legacy carriers' desire to reduce costs in all ways possible in regards regional route networks by outsourcing regional operations to the lowest expense airline bidder capable of operating regional aircraft, a new generation of low-cost airlines (in name only) soon evolved in the US with varying levels of success. Among these varieties of low-cost and discount operators were noteworthy starts-ups that managed to get off the ground by using the larger aircraft services of established charter airlines. Among this group were the [[virtual airline (economics)|virtual airlines]]; [[Direct Air]], [[People Express Airlines|PeoplExpress]], [[Western (airline)|Western]], and those that never began service such as [[JetAmerica]]. Though harkened as something new, this business model of hiring other mainline airlines and marketing it as a whole other airline business was actually pioneered by the ubiquitous [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] with its [[Pan Am Express]] operations operated by [[Air Atlanta]] and [[Emerald Air (United States)|\nEmerald Air ]] among others during the early years following airline deregulation, as established airlines fought to survive.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn Japan, low-cost airlines made major inroads into the market in 2012 when [[Peach (airline)|Peach]], [[Jetstar Japan]] and [[AirAsia Japan]] began operations, each with financial sponsorship by a domestic legacy airline and one or more foreign investors. By mid-2013, these new LCCs were operating at a unit cost of around 8 yen per seat-kilometer, compared to 10\u201311 yen per seat-kilometer for domestic legacy airlines. However, their unit cost was still much higher than the 3 yen per seat-kilometer for [[AirAsia]] in [[Malaysia]], due to the higher cost of landing fees and personnel in Japan.<ref>{{cite news |script-title=ja:\u660e\u6697\u5206\u3051\u305f\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u6d41\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u300d\u3000\u30d4\u30fc\u30c1\u3001\u6e80\u8db3\u5ea6\u300c\u5927\u624b\u4e26\u307f\u300d|trans-title=|language=ja|url=http://www.nikkei.com/paper/article/?ng=DGKDZO57680790U3A720C1TJ1000|accessdate=24 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Nikkei]] |date=24 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Market share===\nBy 2017, low-cost carriers had achieved market share of 57.2% in South Asia and 52.6% in Southeast Asia.

At that time, most of the area remained covered with forests and [[Marsh|marshlands]], through which the Paondhoi, Dhamola and Ganda Nala rivers flowed. The climate was humid and [[Malaria|malaria]] outbreaks were common. [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], the Sultan of Delhi (1325\u20131351), undertook a campaign in the northern ''doab'' to crush the rebellion of the [[Siwalik Hills|Shivalik]] kings in 1340, when according to local tradition he learned of the presence of a [[sufi]] saint on the banks of the Paondhoi River. After visiting the sage, he ordered that henceforth this region would be known as 'Shah-Haroonpur', after the Sufi Saint ''Shah Haroon Chishti''.<ref>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_375.gif History] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], v. 21, p.&nbsp;369. 1909.</ref> The simple but well-preserved tomb of this saint is situated in the oldest quarter of Saharanpur city, between the Mali Gate/Bazar Dinanath and Halwai Hatta. By the end of the 14th century, the power of the Sultanate had declined and it was attacked by Emperor [[Timur]] (1336\u20131405) of Central Asia. Timur had marched through the Saharanpur region in 1399 to sack Delhi and people of the region fought his army unsuccessfully. A weakened Sultanate was later conquered by the Central Asian Mogul king [[Babur]] (1483\u20131531).\n\n===Mughal period===\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]], [[Akbar]] (1542\u20131605), Saharanpur became an administrative unit under the Province of Delhi. Akbar bestowed the feudal ''[[jagir]]'' of Saharanpur to the Mughal treasurer, Sah Ranveer Singh, an [[Agrawal Jain]]<ref name=\"indiatvnews.com\"/> who laid the foundations of the present-day city on the site of an army cantonment. The nearest settlements at that time were [[Shekhpura]] and Malhipur. Saharanpur was a walled city, with five gates: The Hathi Gate the Sarai Gate, the Mali Gate, the Buria Gate, and the Lakhi Gate. The city was divided into the neighbourhoods of Nakhasa Bazar, Shah Behlol, Rani Bazar and Lakhi Gate. The ruins of Shah Ran Veer Singh's old fort can still be seen in the Chaudharian locality of Saharanpur, not far from the better known 'Bada-Imam-bada'. He also built a large [[Jain]] [[Temple|temple]] in Muhallah/Toli Chaundhariyan,<ref>Madhu Jain, O. C. Handa, and Omacanda Handa, ''Wood Handicraft: A Study of Its Origin and Development in Saharanpur'', Indus Publishing (2000), pp.&nbsp;22\u201324. {{ISBN|81-7387-103-5}}</ref> it is now known as the 'Digamber-Jain Panchayati Mandir'.\n\n===The Sayyids and Rohillas===\nMughal emperors Akbar and later [[Shah Jehan]] (1592\u20131666) bestowed the administrative ''[[pargana]]'' of Sarwat on Muslim [[Sayyid]] families. In 1633 one of them founded a city and named it and the surrounding region [[Muzaffarnagar]], in honour of his father, Sayyid Muzaffar Ali Khan. The Sayyids ruled the area until the 1739 invasion by [[Nadir Shah]]. After his departure, anarchy prevailed across the entire ''doab'' with the region ruled or ravaged in succession by Rajputs, Tyagis, Brahmins, and Jats. Taking advantage of this anarchy, the [[Rohillas]] took control of the entire Trans-Gangetic region.\n\n[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] ruler who invaded Northwestern and Northern India in the 1750s, conferred the territory of Saharanpur as Jagir on Rohilla chief Najaf Khan, who assumed the title of Nawab Najeeb-ud-Daula and took up residence in Saharanpur in 1754. He made Gaunsgarh his capital and tried to strengthen his position against [[Maratha Empire]] attacks by entering an alliance with the [[Hindu]] [[Gurjar]] chieftain Manohar Singh. In 1759, Najeeb-ud-Daula issued a Deed of Agreement handing over 550 villages to Manohar Singh, who became the Raja of Landaura. Thus the Rohillas and the Gurjars now controlled Saharanpur.\n\n===Maratha rule (1757\u20131803 AD)===\nIn 1757, the Maratha army invaded the Saharanpur region, which resulted in Najeeb-ud-Daula losing control of Saharanpur to the Maratha rulers [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]] and [[Malharao Holkar]]. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18{{nbsp}}December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general [[Mahadji Scindia|Mahadaji Scindia]]. The most significant contribution of Nawab Ghulam Qadir to Saharanpur city is the Nawab Ganj area and the Ahmedabadi fortress therein, which still stands. The death of Ghulam Qadir put an end to the Rohilla administration in Saharanpur and it became the northernmost district of the Maratha Empire. Ghani Bahadur Banda was appointed its first Maratha governor. The Maratha Regime saw the construction of the Bhuteshwar Temple and Bagheshwar Temple in Saharanpur city. In 1803, following the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], when the [[British East India Company]] defeated the Maratha Empire, Saharanpur came under British suzerainty.\n\n===British colonial period (1803\u20131947 AD)===\nWhen India rebelled in 1857 against the foreign Company's occupation, now referred to as the First War of Indian Independence, the Saharanpur and the present-day Muzaffarnagar Districts were part of that uprising. The center of freedom fighters' operations was Shamli, a small town in the Muzaffarnagar region which was liberated for some time. After the uprising failed, British retribution was severe. Death and destruction were particularly directed against the Muslims of the region, whom the British considered as the main instigators of the rebellion; Muslim society was devastated beyond recognition. When social reconstruction started, the cultural and political history of Muslims began to revolve around Deoband and Aligarh. Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, both proponents of the reformer Shah Waliullah's ideology for social and political rejuvenation, established a school in Deoband in 1867. It found popularity and global recognition as the Darul Uloom. Its founders' mission was twofold: to raise and spread a team of scholars able to awaken the religious and social consciousness of Muslims through peaceful methods and to make efforts, through them, to educate Muslims in their faith and culture; and to bring about a feeling of nationalism and national unity by promoting the concept of Hindu-Muslim unity and a united India. Muslim scholars in the city of Saharanpur were active supporters of this ideology and went on to establish the Mazahirul Uloom Saharanpur theological seminary six months later.\n\n===Royal Family===\n\nIn 1845 Nawab Rao Wazir-ud-din khan became the member and voter of Mughal Darbar at [[Red fort]] [[Delhi]] due to his cordial relation with Mugal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]]. He was the richest person of district Saharanpur with 52 thousand bega land and lord of 57 villages like Shaikhpura, Landohra, Tapri, Piragpur, Yousfpur, Badshapur, Harhati, Nazirpura, Santgarh, Lakhnor, Subri, Pathri, etc., of district Saharanpur. British governor's had a good relation with Rao Wazir-ud-din and title Badsha-e-Waqt (the king of his Period ) was bestowed to him. He died in 1895 at Sheikpura Qudeem (Saharanpur). He had two son's Nawab Rao Mashooq Ali khan and Nawab Rao Ghafoor Muhammad Ali Khan. Rao Ghafoor Muhammad Ali Khan had only seven children out of seven his elder son Nawab Rao Maqsood Ali khan was a great person. He was highly educated. He got his education from [[Aligarh Muslim University]] and [[University of Oxford]]. He was an intellectual and a spiritual person. Due to his kindness and amiable nature he was popular among people. He proved his resourcefulness and abilities by saving the poor from famine and loss of crops. He became the disciple of Sufi Hazrat Sheik Bahauddin a descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]]. He spread [[Sufism]] across the Saharanpur region. He was a great scholar and Many books in English and Persian were written by him but all his work lost after his death. He was a great Nawab of Saharanpur. He was the lord of a large property in the Saharanpur region and in [[Dehradun]]. He worked for the welfare and upliftment of people and donated to poor farmers and land for Madarsa's and Darga's. Due to his Phalinthrophist work Nawab Maqsood Ali khan was awarded by the [[Viceroy of India]] [[Lord Irwin]] at [[Dehradun]]. Brother's of him migrated to [[Pakistan]] and [[England]]. He died in 1973 at Sheikpura Qudeem and left behind his sons Nawab Rao Ghulam Muhi-ud-Din Khan, Nawab Rao Zamir Haider khan, Nawab Rao Yaqoob khan. Nawab Rao Gulam Hafiz khan.\nNawab Rao Zamir Haider Son Prince Shameem Hyder Rao is a Fashion Model and a Poet.\n\n==Geography==\nSaharanpur is located at {{coord|29.97|N|77.55|E|}},[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Saharanpur.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Saharanpur] about {{convert|140|km}} south-southeast of [[Chandigarh]], {{convert|170|km}} north-northeast of [[Delhi]], {{convert|65|km}} north-northeast of [[Shamli]] and about {{convert|61|km}} south-west of [[Dehradun]].

At that time, most of the area remained covered with forests and [[Marsh|marshlands]], through which the Paondhoi, Dhamola and Ganda Nala rivers flowed. The climate was humid and [[Malaria|malaria]] outbreaks were common. [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], the Sultan of Delhi (1325\u20131351), undertook a campaign in the northern ''doab'' to crush the rebellion of the [[Siwalik Hills|Shivalik]] kings in 1340, when according to local tradition he learned of the presence of a [[sufi]] saint on the banks of the Paondhoi River. After visiting the sage, he ordered that henceforth this region would be known as 'Shah-Haroonpur', after the Sufi Saint ''Shah Haroon Chishti''.<ref>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_375.gif History] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], v. 21, p.&nbsp;369. 1909.</ref> The simple but well-preserved tomb of this saint is situated in the oldest quarter of Saharanpur city, between the Mali Gate/Bazar Dinanath and Halwai Hatta. By the end of the 14th century, the power of the Sultanate had declined and it was attacked by Emperor [[Timur]] (1336\u20131405) of Central Asia. Timur had marched through the Saharanpur region in 1399 to sack Delhi and people of the region fought his army unsuccessfully. A weakened Sultanate was later conquered by the Central Asian Mogul king [[Babur]] (1483\u20131531).\n\n===Mughal period===\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]], [[Akbar]] (1542\u20131605), Saharanpur became an administrative unit under the Province of Delhi. Akbar bestowed the feudal ''[[jagir]]'' of Saharanpur to the Mughal treasurer, Sah Ranveer Singh, an [[Agrawal Jain]]<ref name=\"indiatvnews.com\"/> who laid the foundations of the present-day city on the site of an army cantonment. The nearest settlements at that time were [[Shekhpura]] and Malhipur. Saharanpur was a walled city, with five gates: The Hathi Gate the Sarai Gate, the Mali Gate, the Buria Gate, and the Lakhi Gate. The city was divided into the neighbourhoods of Nakhasa Bazar, Shah Behlol, Rani Bazar and Lakhi Gate. The ruins of Shah Ran Veer Singh's old fort can still be seen in the Chaudharian locality of Saharanpur, not far from the better known 'Bada-Imam-bada'. He also built a large [[Jain]] [[Temple|temple]] in Muhallah/Toli Chaundhariyan,<ref>Madhu Jain, O. C. Handa, and Omacanda Handa, ''Wood Handicraft: A Study of Its Origin and Development in Saharanpur'', Indus Publishing (2000), pp.&nbsp;22\u201324. {{ISBN|81-7387-103-5}}</ref> it is now known as the 'Digamber-Jain Panchayati Mandir'.\n\n===The Sayyids and Rohillas===\nMughal emperors Akbar and later [[Shah Jehan]] (1592\u20131666) bestowed the administrative ''[[pargana]]'' of Sarwat on Muslim [[Sayyid]] families. In 1633 one of them founded a city and named it and the surrounding region [[Muzaffarnagar]], in honour of his father, Sayyid Muzaffar Ali Khan. The Sayyids ruled the area until the 1739 invasion by [[Nadir Shah]]. After his departure, anarchy prevailed across the entire ''doab'' with the region ruled or ravaged in succession by Rajputs, Tyagis, Brahmins, and Jats. Taking advantage of this anarchy, the [[Rohillas]] took control of the entire Trans-Gangetic region.\n\n[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] ruler who invaded Northwestern and Northern India in the 1750s, conferred the territory of Saharanpur as Jagir on Rohilla chief Najaf Khan, who assumed the title of Nawab Najeeb-ud-Daula and took up residence in Saharanpur in 1754. He made Gaunsgarh his capital and tried to strengthen his position against [[Maratha Empire]] attacks by entering an alliance with the [[Hindu]] [[Gurjar]] chieftain Manohar Singh. In 1759, Najeeb-ud-Daula issued a Deed of Agreement handing over 550 villages to Manohar Singh, who became the Raja of Landaura. Thus the Rohillas and the Gurjars now controlled Saharanpur.\n\n===Maratha rule (1757\u20131803 AD)===\nIn 1757, the Maratha army invaded the Saharanpur region, which resulted in Najeeb-ud-Daula losing control of Saharanpur to the Maratha rulers [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]] and [[Malharao Holkar]]. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18{{nbsp}}December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general [[Mahadji Scindia|Mahadaji Scindia]]. The most significant contribution of Nawab Ghulam Qadir to Saharanpur city is the Nawab Ganj area and the Ahmedabadi fortress therein, which still stands. The death of Ghulam Qadir put an end to the Rohilla administration in Saharanpur and it became the northernmost district of the Maratha Empire. Ghani Bahadur Banda was appointed its first Maratha governor. The Maratha Regime saw the construction of the Bhuteshwar Temple and Bagheshwar Temple in Saharanpur city. In 1803, following the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], when the [[British East India Company]] defeated the Maratha Empire, Saharanpur came under British suzerainty.\n\n===British colonial period (1803\u20131947 AD)===\nWhen India rebelled in 1857 against the foreign Company's occupation, now referred to as the First War of Indian Independence, the Saharanpur and the present-day Muzaffarnagar Districts were part of that uprising. The center of freedom fighters' operations was Shamli, a small town in the Muzaffarnagar region which was liberated for some time. After the uprising failed, British retribution was severe. Death and destruction were particularly directed against the Muslims of the region, whom the British considered as the main instigators of the rebellion; Muslim society was devastated beyond recognition. When social reconstruction started, the cultural and political history of Muslims began to revolve around Deoband and Aligarh. Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, both proponents of the reformer Shah Waliullah's ideology for social and political rejuvenation, established a school in Deoband in 1867. It found popularity and global recognition as the Darul Uloom. Its founders' mission was twofold: to raise and spread a team of scholars able to awaken the religious and social consciousness of Muslims through peaceful methods and to make efforts, through them, to educate Muslims in their faith and culture; and to bring about a feeling of nationalism and national unity by promoting the concept of Hindu-Muslim unity and a united India. Muslim scholars in the city of Saharanpur were active supporters of this ideology and went on to establish the Mazahirul Uloom Saharanpur theological seminary six months later.\n\n===Royal Family===\n\nIn 1845 Nawab Rao Wazir-ud-din khan became the member and voter of Mughal Darbar at [[Red fort]] [[Delhi]] due to his cordial relation with Mugal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]]. He was the richest person of district Saharanpur with 52 thousand bega land and lord of 57 villages like Shaikhpura, Landohra, Tapri, Piragpur, Yousfpur, Badshapur, Harhati, Nazirpura, Santgarh, Lakhnor, Subri, Pathri, etc., of district Saharanpur. British governor's had a good relation with Rao Wazir-ud-din and title Badsha-e-Waqt (the king of his Period ) was bestowed to him. He died in 1895 at Sheikpura Qudeem (Saharanpur). He had two son's Nawab Rao Mashooq Ali khan and Nawab Rao Ghafoor Muhammad Ali Khan. Rao Ghafoor Muhammad Ali Khan had only seven children out of seven his elder son Nawab Rao Maqsood Ali khan was a great person. He was highly educated. He got his education from [[Aligarh Muslim University]] and [[University of Oxford]]. He was an intellectual and a spiritual person. Due to his kindness and amiable nature he was popular among people. He proved his resourcefulness and abilities by saving the poor from famine and loss of crops. He became the disciple of Sufi Hazrat Sheik Bahauddin a descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]]. He spread [[Sufism]] across the Saharanpur region. He was a great scholar and Many books in English and Persian were written by him but all his work lost after his death. He was a great Nawab of Saharanpur. He was the lord of a large property in the Saharanpur region and in [[Dehradun]]. He worked for the welfare and upliftment of people and donated to poor farmers and land for Madarsa's and Darga's. Due to his Phalinthrophist work Nawab Maqsood Ali khan was awarded by the [[Viceroy of India]] [[Lord Irwin]] at [[Dehradun]]. Brother's of him migrated to [[Pakistan]] and [[England]]. He died in 1973 at Sheikpura Qudeem and left behind his sons Nawab Rao Ghulam Muhi-ud-Din Khan, Nawab Rao Zamir Haider khan, Nawab Rao Yaqoob khan. Nawab Rao Gulam Hafiz khan.\nNawab Rao Zamir Haider Son Prince Shameem Hyder Rao is a Fashion Model and a Poet.\n\n==Geography==\nSaharanpur is located at {{coord|29.97|N|77.55|E|}},[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Saharanpur.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Saharanpur] about {{convert|140|km}} south-southeast of [[Chandigarh]], {{convert|170|km}} north-northeast of [[Delhi]], {{convert|65|km}} north-northeast of [[Shamli]] and about {{convert|61|km}} south-west of [[Dehradun]].

It does not literally mean the creation of drugs or medical devices that are unique to a patient, but rather the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Preventive or therapeutic interventions can then be concentrated on those who will benefit, sparing expense and side effects for those who will not.

You might ask such a question, the bible says in John 4:24 that God is spirit and only by the power of his spirit can people worship him as he really is. And because he is a spirit, he has the ability to be in every place at the same time. And he can understand all of us by the holy spirit and that is why we all have access to strange languages. He can understand us by the spirit and we also can understand him by the same spirit.\n\n==Abrahamic traditions==\n{{Further|Adamic language}}\nIn Judaism and Christianity, it is unclear whether the language used by God to address [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] was the language of Adam, who as name-giver ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:19) used it to name all living things, or if it was a different divine language. But since God is portrayed as using speech during creation, and as addressing Adam before Gen 2:19, some authorities assumed that the language of God was different from the language of Paradise invented by Adam, while most medieval [[Jewish]] authorities maintained that the [[Hebrew language]] was the language of God, which was accepted in Western Europe from at least the 16th century and until the early 20th century. {{clarification needed|date=December 2015}} <ref>[[Kees Versteegh|Versteegh, Kees]], ''The Arabic language'', Edinburgh University Press, 2001, p.4</ref> {{better source needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe sacred language in Islam is [[Classical Arabic]], which is a descendant of the [[Proto-Semitic language]].

The concept of [[Spho\u1e6da]] was introduced as a kind of transcendent aspect of ''\u015a\u00e1bda''.\n\n==Occultism==\nIn 1510, [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] published Book I of his ''De Occulta Philosophia'' (translated to English in 1651 as ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]''). Chapter 23 of the book is entitled \"Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us\" - wherein he states:\n<blockquote>We might doubt whether Angels, or Demons, since they are of pure spirits, use any vocal speech, or tongue amongst themselves, or to us; but that Paul in some place saith, If I speak with the tongue of men, or angels: but what their speech or tongue is, is much doubted by many. For many think that if they use any Idiome, it is [[Hebrew]], because that was the first of all, and came from heaven, and was before the [[confusion of languages]] in Babylon, in which the Law was given by God the Father, and the Gospell was preached by Christ the Son, and so many Oracles were given to the Prophets by the Holy Ghost: and seeing all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions, this alone doth alwaies continue inviolated.</blockquote>\n\nLater, in chapter 27, Agrippa mentions the Divine Language again:\n<blockquote>But because the letters of every tongue, as we shewed in the first book, have in their number, order, and figure a Celestiall and Divine originall, I shall easily grant this calculation concerning the names of spirits to be made not only by Hebrew letters, but also by Chaldean, and Arabick, \u00c6gyptian, Greek, Latine, and any other...</blockquote>\n\nIn the late 16th century, the Elizabethan mathematician and scholar [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and the medium and alchemist [[Edward Kelley]] (both of whom were familiar with Agrippa's writings) claimed that during [[scrying]] sessions, a \"Celestial Speech\" was received directly from Angels. They recorded large portions of the language in their journals (published today as \"The Five Books of the Mysteries\" and \"A True and Faithful Relation...\"), along with a complete text in the language called the \"Book of Loagaeth\" (or \"Speech From God\"). Dee's language, called \"Angelical\" in his journals, often known today by the misnomer \"[[Enochian]]\", follows the basic Judeo-Christian mythology about the Divine Language. According to \"A True and Faithful Relation...\" Angelical was supposed to have been the language God used to create the world, and then used by Adam to speak with God and Angels and to name all things in existence. He then lost the language upon his Fall from Paradise, and constructed a form of proto-Hebrew based upon his vague memory of Angelical. This proto-Hebrew, then, was the universal human language until the time of the Confusion of Tongues at the Tower of Babel. After this, all the various human languages were developed, including an even more modified Hebrew (which we know as \"Biblical Hebrew\"). From the time of Adam to the time of Dee and Kelley, Angelical was hidden from humans with the single exception of the patriarch Enoch - who recorded the \"Book of Loagaeth\" for humanity, but the book was lost in the Deluge of Noah.\n\n[[George William Russell]] in ''The Candle of Vision'' (1918) argued that (p.&nbsp;120) \"The mind of man is made in the image of Deity, and the elements of speech are related to the powers in his mind and through it to the being of the Oversoul.

Hoffmann-La Roche AG''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[multinational corporation|multinational]] healthcare company that operates worldwide under two divisions: [[Pharmaceutical company|Pharmaceutical]]s and [[Roche Diagnostics|Diagnostics]]. Its [[holding company]], '''Roche Holding AG''', has [[Bearer instrument|bearer shares]] listed on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]]. The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].\n\nThe company controls the American [[biotechnology]] company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2018 were 56.85 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,<ref name=\"FR18\" /> or approximately US$57 billion.

In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.\n\nIn 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann-La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.<ref name=\"fundingroche\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}</ref>\n\nRoche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 <ref>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981\u20142008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}</ref> On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann-La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.

In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.\n\nIn 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann-La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.<ref name=\"fundingroche\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}</ref>\n\nRoche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 <ref>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981\u20142008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}</ref> On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann-La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.

He then left to start his own hedge fund. He had already developed a reputation as an investor by demonstrating success in [[value investing]], which he wrote about on [[message board]]s on the stock discussion site [[Silicon Investor]] beginning in 1996. He was so successful with his stock picks that he attracted the interest of companies such as [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]], [[White Mountains Insurance Group]] and prominent investors such as [[Joel Greenblatt]]. Burry has a strictly traditional understanding of [[value investing|value]]. He has said more than once that his investment style is built upon [[Benjamin Graham]] and [[David Dodd]]\u2019s 1934 book ''[[Security Analysis (book)|Security Analysis]]'': \"All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a [[margin of safety (financial)|margin of safety]].\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/12/learning-dr-michael-burry-investment-philosophy/?all=1 |title=Learning From Dr. Michael Burry's Investment Philosophy |date=December 20, 2016 |website=ValueWalk |access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter shutting down his website in November 2000, Burry started the (now defunct) hedge fund '''Scion Capital''', funded by a small inheritance and loans from his family. The company was named after [[Terry Brooks]]' ''[[The Scions of Shannara]]'' (1990), one of his favorite novels. Burry quickly earned extraordinary profits for his investors. According to the author [[Michael Lewis]], \"in his first full year, 2001, the [[S&P 500]] fell 11.88 percent. Scion was up 55 percent. Burry was able to achieve these returns by shorting overvalued tech stocks at the peak of the [[dot com bubble|internet bubble]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-burry-life-story-2017-5 |title=Michael Burry life story |website=Business Insider |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref> The next year, the S&P 500 fell again, by 22.1 percent, and yet Scion was up again: 16 percent. The next year, 2003, the stock market finally turned around and rose 28.69 percent, but Mike Burry beat it again\u2014his investments rose by 50 percent. By the end of 2004, Mike Burry was managing $600 million and turning money away.\"<ref name=\"Burry\" />\n\nIn 2005, Burry started to focus on the [[Subprime lending|subprime market]]. Through his analysis of mortgage lending practices in 2003 and 2004, he correctly predicted that the [[real estate bubble]] would collapse as early as 2007. Burry's research on the values of residential real estate convinced him that [[subprime mortgage]]s, especially those with [[Teaser rate|\"teaser\" rates]], and the bonds based on these mortgages, would begin losing value when the original rates were replaced by much higher rates, often in as little as two years after initiation. This conclusion led Burry to [[short (finance)|short]] the market by persuading [[Goldman Sachs]] and other investment firms to sell him [[credit default swap]]s against subprime deals he saw as vulnerable. This analysis proved correct, and Burry profited accordingly.<ref name=\"NYTimes-Anderson-2007-03-09\">{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Jenny |title=Winners amid gloom of defaults |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 9, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/business/09insider.html}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes-Kakutani-2010-03-15>{{cite news |title=Investors Who Foresaw the Meltdown |last=Kakutani |first=Michiko |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 15, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/books/15book.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Bloomberg\">{{cite web |title=Michael Burry Profiled: Bloomberg Risk Takers |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=July 20, 2012 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/72756316-michael-burry-profiled-bloomberg-risk-takers.html}}</ref> Burry has since said, \"I don't go out looking for good shorts.

Every bit of logic I had led me to this trade and I had to do it.\"<ref name=\"zerohedge.com\" />\n\nDuring his payments towards the credit default swaps Burry suffered an investor revolt, where some investors in his fund worried his predictions were inaccurate and demanded to withdraw their capital. Eventually, Burry's analysis proved correct: he earned a personal profit of $100 million and a profit for his remaining investors of more than $700 million.<ref name=\"Burry\" /> Scion Capital ultimately recorded returns of 489.34% (net of fees and expenses) between its November 1, 2000 inception and June 2008. The S&P 500, widely regarded as the benchmark for the US market, returned just under 3% including dividends over the same period.<ref name=\"Burry\" />\n\nAccording to his website, Burry liquidated his credit default swap short positions by April 2008 and did not benefit from the bailouts of [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008|2008]] and [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009]].<ref name=\"Scion\" /> He subsequently liquidated his company to focus on his personal investment portfolio.<ref name=\"Scion\">[http://scioncapital.com/ Scion Capital website], accessed March 30, 2010.</ref>\n\nIn an April 3, 2010, [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Burry argued that anyone who studied the financial markets carefully in 2003, 2004, and 2005 could have recognized the growing risk in the subprime markets.<ref name=\"NYTimes-Burry-2010-04-3\">{{cite news |last=Burry |first=Michael J. |title=I Saw the Crisis Coming.

He then left to start his own hedge fund. He had already developed a reputation as an investor by demonstrating success in [[value investing]], which he wrote about on [[message board]]s on the stock discussion site [[Silicon Investor]] beginning in 1996. He was so successful with his stock picks that he attracted the interest of companies such as [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]], [[White Mountains Insurance Group]] and prominent investors such as [[Joel Greenblatt]]. Burry has a strictly traditional understanding of [[value investing|value]]. He has said more than once that his investment style is built upon [[Benjamin Graham]] and [[David Dodd]]\u2019s 1934 book ''[[Security Analysis (book)|Security Analysis]]'': \"All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a [[margin of safety (financial)|margin of safety]].\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/12/learning-dr-michael-burry-investment-philosophy/?all=1 |title=Learning From Dr. Michael Burry's Investment Philosophy |date=December 20, 2016 |website=ValueWalk |access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter shutting down his website in November 2000, Burry started the (now defunct) hedge fund '''Scion Capital''', funded by a small inheritance and loans from his family. The company was named after [[Terry Brooks]]' ''[[The Scions of Shannara]]'' (1990), one of his favorite novels. Burry quickly earned extraordinary profits for his investors. According to the author [[Michael Lewis]], \"in his first full year, 2001, the [[S&P 500]] fell 11.88 percent. Scion was up 55 percent. Burry was able to achieve these returns by shorting overvalued tech stocks at the peak of the [[dot com bubble|internet bubble]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-burry-life-story-2017-5 |title=Michael Burry life story |website=Business Insider |accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref> The next year, the S&P 500 fell again, by 22.1 percent, and yet Scion was up again: 16 percent. The next year, 2003, the stock market finally turned around and rose 28.69 percent, but Mike Burry beat it again\u2014his investments rose by 50 percent. By the end of 2004, Mike Burry was managing $600 million and turning money away.\"<ref name=\"Burry\" />\n\nIn 2005, Burry started to focus on the [[Subprime lending|subprime market]]. Through his analysis of mortgage lending practices in 2003 and 2004, he correctly predicted that the [[real estate bubble]] would collapse as early as 2007. Burry's research on the values of residential real estate convinced him that [[subprime mortgage]]s, especially those with [[Teaser rate|\"teaser\" rates]], and the bonds based on these mortgages, would begin losing value when the original rates were replaced by much higher rates, often in as little as two years after initiation. This conclusion led Burry to [[short (finance)|short]] the market by persuading [[Goldman Sachs]] and other investment firms to sell him [[credit default swap]]s against subprime deals he saw as vulnerable. This analysis proved correct, and Burry profited accordingly.<ref name=\"NYTimes-Anderson-2007-03-09\">{{cite news |last=Anderson |first=Jenny |title=Winners amid gloom of defaults |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 9, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/business/09insider.html}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes-Kakutani-2010-03-15>{{cite news |title=Investors Who Foresaw the Meltdown |last=Kakutani |first=Michiko |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 15, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/books/15book.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Bloomberg\">{{cite web |title=Michael Burry Profiled: Bloomberg Risk Takers |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=July 20, 2012 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/72756316-michael-burry-profiled-bloomberg-risk-takers.html}}</ref> Burry has since said, \"I don't go out looking for good shorts.

Every bit of logic I had led me to this trade and I had to do it.\"<ref name=\"zerohedge.com\" />\n\nDuring his payments towards the credit default swaps Burry suffered an investor revolt, where some investors in his fund worried his predictions were inaccurate and demanded to withdraw their capital. Eventually, Burry's analysis proved correct: he earned a personal profit of $100 million and a profit for his remaining investors of more than $700 million.<ref name=\"Burry\" /> Scion Capital ultimately recorded returns of 489.34% (net of fees and expenses) between its November 1, 2000 inception and June 2008. The S&P 500, widely regarded as the benchmark for the US market, returned just under 3% including dividends over the same period.<ref name=\"Burry\" />\n\nAccording to his website, Burry liquidated his credit default swap short positions by April 2008 and did not benefit from the bailouts of [[Economic Stimulus Act of 2008|2008]] and [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009]].<ref name=\"Scion\" /> He subsequently liquidated his company to focus on his personal investment portfolio.<ref name=\"Scion\">[http://scioncapital.com/ Scion Capital website], accessed March 30, 2010.</ref>\n\nIn an April 3, 2010, [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Burry argued that anyone who studied the financial markets carefully in 2003, 2004, and 2005 could have recognized the growing risk in the subprime markets.<ref name=\"NYTimes-Burry-2010-04-3\">{{cite news |last=Burry |first=Michael J. |title=I Saw the Crisis Coming.

Its mandate includes responsibility for the conservation and sustainable use of Canada's fisheries resources while continuing to provide safe, effective and environmentally sound marine services that are responsive to the needs of Canadians in a global economy.  The stated vision of the department is \"Excellence in service to Canadians to ensure the [[sustainable development]] and safe use of Canadian waters.\"\n\nThe federal government is constitutionally mandated for conservation and protection of fisheries resources in all Canadian fisheries waters. However, the department is largely focused on the conservation and allotment of harvests of salt water [[fisheries]] on the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts of Canada.  The department works toward conservation and protection of inland freshwater fisheries, such as on the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Lake Winnipeg]] through cooperative agreements with various provinces. Provincial governments have enacted provincial fisheries legislation, for the licensing of their fisheries. With the exception of Saskatchewan, conservation rules for freshwater fisheries are enacted under the ''Fisheries Act''; six provinces administer these regulations in their own fisheries.\n\nTo address the need for conservation, the department has an extensive [[science]] branch, with research institutes across the country.  Typically the science branch provides evidence for the need of conservation of various species, which are then regulated by the department.  DFO also maintains a large enforcement branch with [[peace officer]]s (known as Fishery Officers) used to combat poaching and foreign [[overfishing]] within Canada's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]].\n\nDFO is responsible for several organizations, including the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation and the [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]].\n\n==History==\nThe Department of Marine and Fisheries was created on July 1, 1867, although it did not receive legislative authority until May 22, 1868.  The department's political representative in [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] was the [[Minister of Marine and Fisheries (Canada)|Minister of Marine and Fisheries]], with the first minister having been [[Peter Mitchell (politician)|Peter Mitchell]].  The department was headquartered in the Centre Block of [[Parliament Hill]] until the disastrous [[Parliament Hill#Fire, rebuilding, and beyond|fire of 1916]], after which it was moved into the West Block and then off Parliament Hill entirely when new government office buildings were constructed in [[Ottawa]].\n\n==Enforcement==\n[[File:DFOCrest.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Fisheries Management heraldic badge worn by DFO fishery officers]]\n\nThe Conservation & Protection (C&P) program is responsible for fisheries enforcement.<ref>[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ae-ve/evaluations/15-16/6B171a-eng.html]</ref> The program ensures the conservation and sustainable use of Canada's aquatic resources and the protection of species at risk, fish habitat, and oceans. C&P collaborates with a variety of domestic partners, including the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], other federal departments, other levels of government, industry, First Nations communities, recreational fishing groups, and others. Internationally, C&P participates in or indirectly contributes to more than a dozen Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (e.g. [[Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization]] and the [[North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission]]).\n\nC&P promotes compliance with legislation, regulations and management measures through education and shared stewardship initiatives; conducts monitoring, control, and surveillance activities using surface vessels, aerial surveillance aircraft and land patrols; and manages major cases and special investigations. The program includes operational enforcement units in DFO's six regions, the National Fisheries Intelligence Service, the National Digital Forensics Service and Program & Operational Readiness.\n\nEnforcement activities are conducted by three types of officials that are designated under the ''Fisheries Act'', fishery officers, fishery guardians and fishery inspectors.\n\nFishery Officers are designated under section 5(1) of the ''Act'' and defined as [[peace officers]] under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)]] with authorities to enforce all provisions of the ''Act'' and other related acts (e.g. the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-33]</ref>) and their regulations. Fishery officers are carry authorized defensive equipment, including a service [[firearm]] (as of April 2019, a Smith & Wesson model 5946<ref>[[Smith & Wesson Model 5906]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}}), baton and [[pepper spray]] while in uniform and conducting operational enforcement activities.<ref>[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/enf-loi/conditions-eng.htm Fishery Officer Career: Duties, Requirements and Conditions]</ref> There are currently more than 600 fishery officers serving in more than 100 detachments and offices across Canada. DFO's chief fishery officer is the Director General, Conservation & Protection; as of April 2019, the incumbent is Darren Goetze.<ref>[https://geds-sage.gc.ca/en/GEDS?pgid=015&dn=cn%3DGoetze%5C%2C+Darren%2Cou%3DDGO-BDG%2Cou%3DCP-CP%2Cou%3DADMFHM-SMAGPP%2COU%3DDM-SM%2COU%3DDFO-MPO%2CO%3DGC%2CC%3DCA]</ref>\n\nFishery Guardians are also designated under section 5(1) of the ''Act'' and as peace officers but are not necessarily employed by the department. For example, a provincial conservation officer may be designated as a fishery guardian for the purpose of enforcing the ''Act''. In general, fishery guardians cannot conduct a search unless authorized by a warrant or conditions are met under the warrantless search provisions of the Criminal Code. Under the Aboriginal Guardian Program, certain first nations may submit to the Minister to designate certain band members as guardians. In October 2017, DFO and the National Indigenous Fisheries Institute (NIFI)<ref>[https://indigenousfisheries.ca/en/]</ref> launched a full and collaborative review of the Department's Indigenous programs, including the Aboriginal Guardian Program.<ref>[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/aboriginal-autochtones/review-examen-eng.htm]</ref>\n\nFishery Inspectors are designated under section 38(1) of the ''Act'', specifically to enforce the pollution prevention sections of ''Fisheries Act''. They are not peace officers and have limited powers ''vis-a-vis'' the other two designations<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-14/page-5.html#docCont]</ref>\n\n==Operations==\nDFO is organized into six administrative regions<ref>{{cite web|title=Regions|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/regions-eng.htm|work=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> which collectively cover all provinces and territories of Canada.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Whereas fisheries management wasn't as important as it became in the latter part of the 20th century, a major responsibility for the Department of Marine and Fisheries included the provisioning of rescue stations and facilities at the notorious [[shipwreck]] sites of [[Sable Island]] and [[St. Paul Island, Nova Scotia|St. Paul Island]] off [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe department also had responsibility for overseeing the qualification of apprenticing sailors who desired to become mates or shipping masters, as well as several marine police forces, which attempted to combat illegal [[crimp (recruitment)|crimp]]ing (the trafficking of sailors in human bondage at major ports).\n\nThe foray into enforcement saw the department operate the \"Dominion cruisers\" which were armed enforcement vessels operating for the Fisheries Protection Service of Canada, a continuation of the [[Provincial Marine]] enforcement agencies of the [[British North America]]n colonies.  These ships and other chartered [[schooner]]s and the like, would cruise the fishing grounds off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, watching for violations within Canada's [[territorial sea]], then only three nautical miles (6&nbsp;km) from shore.\n\n===Naval service===\nPrior to the [[First World War]], Canada had limited naval forces, with the majority of protection having been offered by the enforcement vessels of the Department of Marine and Fisheries (the Dominion Cruisers), and by Britain's [[Royal Navy]].\n\nIn 1909-1910, the Department of Marine and Fisheries became linked to efforts to develop a Canadian naval force, when on March 29, 1909, a Member of Parliament, George Foster, introduced a resolution in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] calling for the establishment of a \"Canadian Naval Service\". The resolution was not successful; however, on January 12, 1910, the government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] took Foster's resolution and introduced it as the Naval Service Bill. After third reading, the bill received royal assent on May 4, 1910, and became the ''[[Naval Service Act]]'', administered by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries at the time.\n\nThe official title of the navy was the \"Naval Service of Canada\" (also \"Canadian Naval Forces\"), and the first Director of the Naval Service of Canada was Rear-Admiral [[Charles Kingsmill]] (Royal Navy, retired), who was previously in charge of the Marine Service of the Department of Marine and Fisheries.  The \"Naval Service of Canada\" changed its name to [[Royal Canadian Navy]] on January 30, 1911, but it was not until August 29, 1911 that the use of \"Royal\" Canadian Navy was permitted by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].\n\n==Departmental name changes==\nSince Confederation, the responsibilities of the original Department of Marine and Fisheries, namely the Fisheries Service and the Marine Service, have transferred among several departments.

Media outlets such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, who are required by their journalistc style guides to use names as groups and individuals self-identify, are obligated to use 'Fisheries and Oceans Canada, DFO'.

{{lang-fr|P\u00eaches et Oc\u00e9ans Canada, MPO}}), is a [[Ministry (government department)|department]] of the [[Government of Canada]] that is responsible for developing and implementing policies and programs in support of Canada's economic, ecological and scientific interests in oceans and inland waters.  Its mandate includes responsibility for the conservation and sustainable use of Canada's fisheries resources while continuing to provide safe, effective and environmentally sound marine services that are responsive to the needs of Canadians in a global economy.  The stated vision of the department is \"Excellence in service to Canadians to ensure the [[sustainable development]] and safe use of Canadian waters.\"\n\nThe federal government is constitutionally mandated for conservation and protection of fisheries resources in all Canadian fisheries waters. However, the department is largely focused on the conservation and allotment of harvests of salt water [[fisheries]] on the Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic coasts of Canada.  The department works toward conservation and protection of inland freshwater fisheries, such as on the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Lake Winnipeg]] through cooperative agreements with various provinces. Provincial governments have enacted provincial fisheries legislation, for the licensing of their fisheries. With the exception of Saskatchewan, conservation rules for freshwater fisheries are enacted under the ''Fisheries Act''; six provinces administer these regulations in their own fisheries.\n\nTo address the need for conservation, the department has an extensive [[science]] branch, with research institutes across the country.  Typically the science branch provides evidence for the need of conservation of various species, which are then regulated by the department.  DFO also maintains a large enforcement branch with [[peace officer]]s (known as Fishery Officers) used to combat poaching and foreign [[overfishing]] within Canada's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]].\n\nDFO is responsible for several organizations, including the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation and the [[Canadian Hydrographic Service]].\n\n==History==\nThe Department of Marine and Fisheries was created on July 1, 1867, although it did not receive legislative authority until May 22, 1868.  The department's political representative in [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] was the [[Minister of Marine and Fisheries (Canada)|Minister of Marine and Fisheries]], with the first minister having been [[Peter Mitchell (politician)|Peter Mitchell]].  The department was headquartered in the Centre Block of [[Parliament Hill]] until the disastrous [[Parliament Hill#Fire, rebuilding, and beyond|fire of 1916]], after which it was moved into the West Block and then off Parliament Hill entirely when new government office buildings were constructed in [[Ottawa]].\n\n==Enforcement==\n[[File:DFOCrest.jpg|left|thumb|130px|Fisheries Management heraldic badge worn by DFO fishery officers]]\n\nThe Conservation & Protection (C&P) program is responsible for fisheries enforcement.<ref>[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ae-ve/evaluations/15-16/6B171a-eng.html]</ref> The program ensures the conservation and sustainable use of Canada's aquatic resources and the protection of species at risk, fish habitat, and oceans. C&P collaborates with a variety of domestic partners, including the [[Canadian Coast Guard]], other federal departments, other levels of government, industry, First Nations communities, recreational fishing groups, and others. Internationally, C&P participates in or indirectly contributes to more than a dozen Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (e.g. [[Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization]] and the [[North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission]]).\n\nC&P promotes compliance with legislation, regulations and management measures through education and shared stewardship initiatives; conducts monitoring, control, and surveillance activities using surface vessels, aerial surveillance aircraft and land patrols; and manages major cases and special investigations. The program includes operational enforcement units in DFO's six regions, the National Fisheries Intelligence Service, the National Digital Forensics Service and Program & Operational Readiness.\n\nEnforcement activities are conducted by three types of officials that are designated under the ''Fisheries Act'', fishery officers, fishery guardians and fishery inspectors.\n\nFishery Officers are designated under section 5(1) of the ''Act'' and defined as [[peace officers]] under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)]] with authorities to enforce all provisions of the ''Act'' and other related acts (e.g. the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-33]</ref>) and their regulations. Fishery officers are carry authorized defensive equipment, including a service [[firearm]] (as of April 2019, a Smith & Wesson model 5946<ref>[[Smith & Wesson Model 5906]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2019}}), baton and [[pepper spray]] while in uniform and conducting operational enforcement activities.<ref>[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/enf-loi/conditions-eng.htm Fishery Officer Career: Duties, Requirements and Conditions]</ref> There are currently more than 600 fishery officers serving in more than 100 detachments and offices across Canada. DFO's chief fishery officer is the Director General, Conservation & Protection; as of April 2019, the incumbent is Darren Goetze.<ref>[https://geds-sage.gc.ca/en/GEDS?pgid=015&dn=cn%3DGoetze%5C%2C+Darren%2Cou%3DDGO-BDG%2Cou%3DCP-CP%2Cou%3DADMFHM-SMAGPP%2COU%3DDM-SM%2COU%3DDFO-MPO%2CO%3DGC%2CC%3DCA]</ref>\n\nFishery Guardians are also designated under section 5(1) of the ''Act'' and as peace officers but are not necessarily employed by the department. For example, a provincial conservation officer may be designated as a fishery guardian for the purpose of enforcing the ''Act''. In general, fishery guardians cannot conduct a search unless authorized by a warrant or conditions are met under the warrantless search provisions of the Criminal Code. Under the Aboriginal Guardian Program, certain first nations may submit to the Minister to designate certain band members as guardians. In October 2017, DFO and the National Indigenous Fisheries Institute (NIFI)<ref>[https://indigenousfisheries.ca/en/]</ref> launched a full and collaborative review of the Department's Indigenous programs, including the Aboriginal Guardian Program.<ref>[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/aboriginal-autochtones/review-examen-eng.htm]</ref>\n\nFishery Inspectors are designated under section 38(1) of the ''Act'', specifically to enforce the pollution prevention sections of ''Fisheries Act''. They are not peace officers and have limited powers ''vis-a-vis'' the other two designations<ref>[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-14/page-5.html#docCont]</ref>\n\n==Operations==\nDFO is organized into six administrative regions<ref>{{cite web|title=Regions|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/regions-eng.htm|work=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> which collectively cover all provinces and territories of Canada.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Whereas fisheries management wasn't as important as it became in the latter part of the 20th century, a major responsibility for the Department of Marine and Fisheries included the provisioning of rescue stations and facilities at the notorious [[shipwreck]] sites of [[Sable Island]] and [[St. Paul Island, Nova Scotia|St. Paul Island]] off [[Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe department also had responsibility for overseeing the qualification of apprenticing sailors who desired to become mates or shipping masters, as well as several marine police forces, which attempted to combat illegal [[crimp (recruitment)|crimp]]ing (the trafficking of sailors in human bondage at major ports).\n\nThe foray into enforcement saw the department operate the \"Dominion cruisers\" which were armed enforcement vessels operating for the Fisheries Protection Service of Canada, a continuation of the [[Provincial Marine]] enforcement agencies of the [[British North America]]n colonies.  These ships and other chartered [[schooner]]s and the like, would cruise the fishing grounds off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, watching for violations within Canada's [[territorial sea]], then only three nautical miles (6&nbsp;km) from shore.\n\n===Naval service===\nPrior to the [[First World War]], Canada had limited naval forces, with the majority of protection having been offered by the enforcement vessels of the Department of Marine and Fisheries (the Dominion Cruisers), and by Britain's [[Royal Navy]].\n\nIn 1909-1910, the Department of Marine and Fisheries became linked to efforts to develop a Canadian naval force, when on March 29, 1909, a Member of Parliament, George Foster, introduced a resolution in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] calling for the establishment of a \"Canadian Naval Service\". The resolution was not successful; however, on January 12, 1910, the government of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]] took Foster's resolution and introduced it as the Naval Service Bill. After third reading, the bill received royal assent on May 4, 1910, and became the ''[[Naval Service Act]]'', administered by the Minister of Marine and Fisheries at the time.\n\nThe official title of the navy was the \"Naval Service of Canada\" (also \"Canadian Naval Forces\"), and the first Director of the Naval Service of Canada was Rear-Admiral [[Charles Kingsmill]] (Royal Navy, retired), who was previously in charge of the Marine Service of the Department of Marine and Fisheries.  The \"Naval Service of Canada\" changed its name to [[Royal Canadian Navy]] on January 30, 1911, but it was not until August 29, 1911 that the use of \"Royal\" Canadian Navy was permitted by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]].\n\n==Departmental name changes==\nSince Confederation, the responsibilities of the original Department of Marine and Fisheries, namely the Fisheries Service and the Marine Service, have transferred among several departments.  The legal name of the department is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  It is also referred to as \"Fisheries and Oceans Canada\" under the [[Federal Identity Program]].\n\n*1867 - 1884 Department of Marine and Fisheries\n*1884 - 1892 Department of Fisheries\n*1892 - 1914 Department of Marine and Fisheries\n*1914 - 1920 Department of Naval Services\n*1920 - 1930 Department of Marine and Fisheries\n*1930 - 1969 Department of Fisheries\n*1930 - 1935 Department of Marine*\n*1969 - 1971 Department of Fisheries and Forestry\n*1971 - 1976 Department of the Environment\n*1976 - 1979 Department of Fisheries and the Environment\n*1979 - 2020 Department of Fisheries and Oceans\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>In 1935, the Department of Marine was merged with the [[Department of Railways and Canals (Canada)|Department of Railways and Canals]] and the Civil Aviation Branch of the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] to form the Department of Transport, also known as [[Transport Canada]].\n\n==Related legislation==\nText of each law and its regulations can be found by entering the name of the law at the Canadian Legal Information Institute website.\n* ''Canada Shipping Act''\n* ''Canada Shipping Act'', 2001\n* ''Coastal Fisheries Protection Act''\n* ''Department of Fisheries and Oceans Act''\n* ''Financial Administration Act''\n* ''Fish Inspection Act''\n* ''Fisheries Act''\n* ''Fisheries Development Act''\n* ''Fisheries Prices Support Act'' (repealed)\n* ''Fishing and Recreational Harbours Act''\n* ''Freshwater Fish Marketing Act''\n* ''Navigable Waters Protection Act''\n* ''Oceans Act''\n* ''Species at Risk Act''\n\n==See also==\n*[[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery]]\n*[[Marine Mammal Regulations]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/ Canadian Legal Information Institute].\n*[http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/ Fisheries and Oceans Canada]\n*{{YouTube|u=FisheriesCanada|{{PAGENAMEBASE}}}}\n*[http://archives.library.utoronto.ca/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll The University of Toronto Archives houses some material concerning the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.]\n*[http://utarms.library.utoronto.ca/ Archival papers held at University of Toronto Archives and Records Management Services]\n\n{{Government Departments of Canada}}\n{{Law enforcement agencies in Canada}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fisheries And Oceans Canada}}\n[[Category:Fisheries and Oceans Canada| ]]\n[[Category:Fisheries protection]]\n[[Category:Canadian federal departments and agencies]]\n[[Category:Federal law enforcement agencies of Canada]]\n[[Category:Fisheries in Canada]]\n[[Category:Uniformed services of Canada|Fisheries and Oceans]]\n[[Category:Ministries established in 1868]]\n[[Category:1867 establishments in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "93.66.224.182", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDepartmental name changes:minor detail)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheries_and_Oceans_Canada"}
