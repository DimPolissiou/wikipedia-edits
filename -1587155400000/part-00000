M\u0101ori originated with settlers from eastern [[Polynesia]], who arrived in New Zealand in several waves of {{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|waka]]}} (canoe) voyages roughly between 1320 and 1350.<ref name=\"Walters et al (2017)\">{{Cite journal | last1=Walters | first1=Richard | last2=Buckley | first2=Hallie|last3=Jacomb|first3=Chris|last4=Matisoo-Smith|first4=Elizabeth|title=Mass Migration and the Polynesian Settlement of New Zealand|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|volume=30| issue=4 |pages=351\u2013376|doi=10.1007/s10963-017-9110-y|date=7 October 2017|doi-access=free}}</ref> Over several centuries in isolation, these settlers developed [[M\u0101ori culture|their own distinctive culture]], whose language, mythology, crafts and performing arts evolved independently from other eastern Polynesian cultures.\n\nThe arrival of Europeans in New Zealand, starting in the 17th century, brought enormous changes to the M\u0101ori way of life. M\u0101ori people gradually adopted many aspects of Western society and culture. Initial relations between M\u0101ori and Europeans were largely amicable, and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840, the two cultures coexisted. Rising tensions over disputed land sales led to conflict in the 1860s, and massive land confiscations. Social upheaval, and epidemics of introduced disease took a devastating toll on the M\u0101ori population, which fell dramatically. By the start of the 20th century, the M\u0101ori population had begun to recover, and efforts have been made to increase their standing in wider New Zealand society and achieve social justice.\n\nTraditional M\u0101ori culture has thereby enjoyed a significant revival, which was further bolstered by a [[M\u0101ori protest movement]] that emerged in the 1960s. However, disproportionate numbers of M\u0101ori face significant economic and social obstacles, and generally have lower life expectancies and incomes compared with other New Zealand ethnic groups. They suffer higher levels of crime, health problems, and educational under-achievement. A number of socioeconomic initiatives have been instigated with the aim of \"closing the gap\" between M\u0101ori and other New Zealanders. Political and economic redress for historical grievances is also ongoing (see [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements]]).\n\nIn the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]], there were 775,836 people in New Zealand identifying as M\u0101ori, making up 16.5 per cent of the national population. They are the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand, after European New Zealanders. In addition, more than 140,000 M\u0101ori live in Australia. The [[M\u0101ori language]] is spoken to some extent by about .2 per cent of all M\u0101ori, representing 1 per cent of the total population although spending on the forced Maori is crippling the country and causing division in society. M\u0101ori are active in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn the [[M\u0101ori language]], the word {{Lang|mi|m\u0101ori}} means \"normal\", \"natural\" or \"ordinary\". In legends and oral traditions, the word distinguished ordinary mortal human beings\u2014{{Lang|mi|t\u0101ngata m\u0101ori}}\u2014from [[M\u0101ori religion|deities]] and spirits ({{Lang|mi|wairua}}).<ref>Atkinson, A.

For electoral purposes before 1974, the government required documented ancestry to determine the status of \"a M\u0101ori person\" and only those with at least 50% M\u0101ori ancestry were allowed to choose which seats they wished to vote in. The M\u0101ori Affairs Amendment Act 1974 changed this, allowing individuals to self-identify as to their cultural identity. Similarly, until 1986 the census required at least 50 per cent M\u0101ori \u2018blood\u2019 to claim M\u0101ori affiliation.  Currently in all contexts authorities generally require some documentation of ancestry or continuing cultural connection (such as acceptance by others as being of the people); but no minimum \"blood\" requirement.<ref>McIntosh (2005), p. 45</ref>{{Ref label|Note|iii|iii}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|M\u0101ori history}}\n<!--This section shouldn't be made too large.

Social groups were tribal, with no unified society or single M\u0101ori identity until after the arrival of Europeans. Nevertheless, common elements could be found in all M\u0101ori groups in pre-European New Zealand, including a shared Polynesian heritage, a common basic language, familial associations, traditions of warfare, and similar mythologies and religious beliefs.<ref>King (1996), pp 37, 43</ref>\n\nMost M\u0101ori lived in villages, which were inhabited by several {{lang|mi|[[wh\u0101nau]]}} (extended families) who collectively formed a {{lang|mi|[[hap\u016b]]}} (clan or subtribe). Members of a {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} cooperated with food production, gathering resources, raising families and defence. M\u0101ori society across New Zealand was broadly stratified into three classes of people: {{lang|mi|[[rangatira]]}}, chiefs and ruling families; {{lang|mi|t\u016bt\u016b\u0101}}, commoners; and {{lang|mi|m\u014dkai}}, slaves. {{lang|mi|[[Tohunga]]}} also held special standing in their communities as specialists of revered arts, skills and esoteric knowledge.<ref name=King-p42p43>King (1996), pp 42\u20133</ref><ref name=TeAra-Taonui>{{cite web |last=Taonui |first=R\u0101wiri |title=Tribal organisation |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/tribal-organisation |date=4 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nShared ancestry, intermarriage and trade strengthened relationships between different groups. Many {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} with mutually-recognised shared ancestry formed {{lang|mi|[[iwi]]}}, or tribes, which were the largest social unit in M\u0101ori society. {{lang|mi|Hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|iwi}} often united for expeditions to gather food and resources, or in times of conflict. In contrast, warfare developed as an integral part of traditional life, as different groups competed for food and resources, settled personal disputes, and sought to increase their prestige and authority.<ref name=King-p42p43/>\n\n[[File:Famille Maori 1998-1361-139.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau from Rotorua in the 1880s|M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau from [[Rotorua]] in the 1880s. Many aspects of Western life and culture, including European clothing and architecture, became incorporated into M\u0101ori society during the 19th century.]]\nEarly European settlers introduced tools, weapons, clothing and foods to M\u0101ori across New Zealand, in exchange for resources, land and labour. M\u0101ori began selectively adopting elements of Western society during the 19th century, including European clothing and food, and later Western education, religion and architecture.<ref>King (1996), pp 46\u20137, 73\u20135</ref> However, as the 19th century wore on, relations between European colonial settlers and different M\u0101ori groups became increasingly strained. Tensions led to widespread conflict in the 1860s, and the [[New Zealand land confiscations|confiscation of millions of acres of M\u0101ori land]]. Significant amounts of land were also purchased by the colonial government and later through the [[Native Land Court]].\n\n==== 20th century ====\nBy the start of the 20th century, a greater awareness had emerged of a unified M\u0101ori identity, particularly in comparison to P\u0101keh\u0101, who now overwhelmingly outnumbered the M\u0101ori as a whole. M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101 societies remained largely separate\u2014socially, culturally, economically and geographically\u2014for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>King (1996), pp 195\u20136</ref> The key reason for this was that M\u0101ori remained almost exclusively a rural population, whereas increasingly the European population was urban especially after 1900. Nevertheless, M\u0101ori groups continued to engage with the government and in legal processes to increase their standing in (and ultimately further their incorporation into) wider New Zealand society.<ref>Hill (2009), pp 519\u201329</ref> The main point of contact with the government were the four M\u0101ori Members of Parliament.\n\nMany M\u0101ori [[urbanisation|migrated to larger rural towns and cities]] during the Depression and post-WWII periods in search of employment, leaving rural communities depleted and disconnecting many urban M\u0101ori from their traditional social controls and tribal homelands. Yet while standards of living improved among M\u0101ori, they continued to lag behind P\u0101keh\u0101 in areas such as health, income, skilled employment and access to higher levels of education. M\u0101ori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with [[social issues]] stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems.<ref name=\"Sorrenson 1997, pp 339\u201341\">Sorrenson (1997), pp 339\u201341</ref>\n\nIn regards to housing, a 1961 census revealed significant differences in the living conditions of M\u0101ori and Europeans. That year, out of all the (unshared) non-M\u0101ori private dwellings in New Zealand, 96.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 94.1 per cent a hot water service, 88.7 per cent a flush toilet, 81.6 per cent a refrigerator, and 78.6 per cent an electric washing machine. By contrast, for all (unshared) M\u0101ori private dwellings that same year, 76.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 68.9 per cent a hot water service, 55.8 per cent a refrigerator, 54.1 per cent a flush toilet, and 47 per cent an electric washing machine.<ref>The Quest for security in New Zealand 1840 to 1966 by William Ball Sutch</ref>\n\nWhile the arrival of Europeans had a profound impact on the M\u0101ori way of life, many aspects of traditional society have survived into the 21st century. M\u0101ori participate fully in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, leading largely Western lifestyles while also maintaining their own cultural and social customs. The traditional social strata of {{lang|mi|rangatira}}, {{lang|mi|t\u016bt\u016b\u0101}} and {{lang|mi|m\u014dkai}} have all but disappeared from M\u0101ori society, while the roles of {{lang|mi|tohunga}} and {{lang|mi|[[kaum\u0101tua]]}} are still present.

M\u0101ori people gradually adopted many aspects of Western society and culture. Initial relations between M\u0101ori and Europeans were largely amicable, and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840, the two cultures coexisted. Rising tensions over disputed land sales led to conflict in the 1860s, and massive land confiscations. Social upheaval, and epidemics of introduced disease took a devastating toll on the M\u0101ori population, which fell dramatically. By the start of the 20th century, the M\u0101ori population had begun to recover, and efforts have been made to increase their standing in wider New Zealand society and achieve social justice.\n\nTraditional M\u0101ori culture has thereby enjoyed a significant revival, which was further bolstered by a [[M\u0101ori protest movement]] that emerged in the 1960s. However, disproportionate numbers of M\u0101ori face significant economic and social obstacles, and generally have lower life expectancies and incomes compared with other New Zealand ethnic groups. They suffer higher levels of crime, health problems, and educational under-achievement. A number of socioeconomic initiatives have been instigated with the aim of \"closing the gap\" between M\u0101ori and other New Zealanders. Political and economic redress for historical grievances is also ongoing (see [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements]]).\n\nIn the [[2018 New Zealand census|2018 census]], there were 775,836 people in New Zealand identifying as M\u0101ori, making up 16.5 per cent of the national population. They are the second-largest ethnic group in New Zealand, after European New Zealanders (\"{{lang|mi|[[P\u0101keh\u0101]]}}\"). In addition, more than 140,000 M\u0101ori live in Australia. The [[M\u0101ori language]] is spoken to some extent by about a fifth of all M\u0101ori, representing 3 per cent of the total population. M\u0101ori are active in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, with independent representation in areas such as media, politics and sport.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn the [[M\u0101ori language]], the word {{Lang|mi|m\u0101ori}} means \"normal\", \"natural\" or \"ordinary\". In legends and oral traditions, the word distinguished ordinary mortal human beings\u2014{{Lang|mi|t\u0101ngata m\u0101ori}}\u2014from [[M\u0101ori religion|deities]] and spirits ({{Lang|mi|wairua}}).<ref>Atkinson, A.

For electoral purposes before 1974, the government required documented ancestry to determine the status of \"a M\u0101ori person\" and only those with at least 50% M\u0101ori ancestry were allowed to choose which seats they wished to vote in.

Social groups were tribal, with no unified society or single M\u0101ori identity until after the arrival of Europeans. Nevertheless, common elements could be found in all M\u0101ori groups in pre-European New Zealand, including a shared Polynesian heritage, a common basic language, familial associations, traditions of warfare, and similar mythologies and religious beliefs.<ref>King (1996), pp 37, 43</ref>\n\nMost M\u0101ori lived in villages, which were inhabited by several {{lang|mi|[[wh\u0101nau]]}} (extended families) who collectively formed a {{lang|mi|[[hap\u016b]]}} (clan or subtribe). Members of a {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} cooperated with food production, gathering resources, raising families and defence. M\u0101ori society across New Zealand was broadly stratified into three classes of people: {{lang|mi|[[rangatira]]}}, chiefs and ruling families; {{lang|mi|t\u016bt\u016b\u0101}}, commoners; and {{lang|mi|m\u014dkai}}, slaves. {{lang|mi|[[Tohunga]]}} also held special standing in their communities as specialists of revered arts, skills and esoteric knowledge.<ref name=King-p42p43>King (1996), pp 42\u20133</ref><ref name=TeAra-Taonui>{{cite web |last=Taonui |first=R\u0101wiri |title=Tribal organisation |encyclopedia=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |url=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/tribal-organisation |date=4 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nShared ancestry, intermarriage and trade strengthened relationships between different groups. Many {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} with mutually-recognised shared ancestry formed {{lang|mi|[[iwi]]}}, or tribes, which were the largest social unit in M\u0101ori society. {{lang|mi|Hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|iwi}} often united for expeditions to gather food and resources, or in times of conflict. In contrast, warfare developed as an integral part of traditional life, as different groups competed for food and resources, settled personal disputes, and sought to increase their prestige and authority.<ref name=King-p42p43/>\n\n[[File:Famille Maori 1998-1361-139.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau from Rotorua in the 1880s|M\u0101ori wh\u0101nau from [[Rotorua]] in the 1880s. Many aspects of Western life and culture, including European clothing and architecture, became incorporated into M\u0101ori society during the 19th century.]]\nEarly European settlers introduced tools, weapons, clothing and foods to M\u0101ori across New Zealand, in exchange for resources, land and labour. M\u0101ori began selectively adopting elements of Western society during the 19th century, including European clothing and food, and later Western education, religion and architecture.<ref>King (1996), pp 46\u20137, 73\u20135</ref> However, as the 19th century wore on, relations between European colonial settlers and different M\u0101ori groups became increasingly strained. Tensions led to widespread conflict in the 1860s, and the [[New Zealand land confiscations|confiscation of millions of acres of M\u0101ori land]]. Significant amounts of land were also purchased by the colonial government and later through the [[Native Land Court]].\n\n==== 20th century ====\nBy the start of the 20th century, a greater awareness had emerged of a unified M\u0101ori identity, particularly in comparison to P\u0101keh\u0101, who now overwhelmingly outnumbered the M\u0101ori as a whole. M\u0101ori and P\u0101keh\u0101 societies remained largely separate\u2014socially, culturally, economically and geographically\u2014for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref>King (1996), pp 195\u20136</ref> The key reason for this was that M\u0101ori remained almost exclusively a rural population, whereas increasingly the European population was urban especially after 1900. Nevertheless, M\u0101ori groups continued to engage with the government and in legal processes to increase their standing in (and ultimately further their incorporation into) wider New Zealand society.<ref>Hill (2009), pp 519\u201329</ref> The main point of contact with the government were the four M\u0101ori Members of Parliament.\n\nMany M\u0101ori [[urbanisation|migrated to larger rural towns and cities]] during the Depression and post-WWII periods in search of employment, leaving rural communities depleted and disconnecting many urban M\u0101ori from their traditional social controls and tribal homelands. Yet while standards of living improved among M\u0101ori, they continued to lag behind P\u0101keh\u0101 in areas such as health, income, skilled employment and access to higher levels of education. M\u0101ori leaders and government policymakers alike struggled to deal with [[social issues]] stemming from increased urban migration, including a shortage of housing and jobs, and a rise in urban crime, poverty and health problems.<ref name=\"Sorrenson 1997, pp 339\u201341\">Sorrenson (1997), pp 339\u201341</ref>\n\nIn regards to housing, a 1961 census revealed significant differences in the living conditions of M\u0101ori and Europeans. That year, out of all the (unshared) non-M\u0101ori private dwellings in New Zealand, 96.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 94.1 per cent a hot water service, 88.7 per cent a flush toilet, 81.6 per cent a refrigerator, and 78.6 per cent an electric washing machine. By contrast, for all (unshared) M\u0101ori private dwellings that same year, 76.8 per cent had a bath or shower, 68.9 per cent a hot water service, 55.8 per cent a refrigerator, 54.1 per cent a flush toilet, and 47 per cent an electric washing machine.<ref>The Quest for security in New Zealand 1840 to 1966 by William Ball Sutch</ref>\n\nWhile the arrival of Europeans had a profound impact on the M\u0101ori way of life, many aspects of traditional society have survived into the 21st century. M\u0101ori participate fully in all spheres of New Zealand culture and society, leading largely Western lifestyles while also maintaining their own cultural and social customs. The traditional social strata of {{lang|mi|rangatira}}, {{lang|mi|t\u016bt\u016b\u0101}} and {{lang|mi|m\u014dkai}} have all but disappeared from M\u0101ori society, while the roles of {{lang|mi|tohunga}} and {{lang|mi|[[kaum\u0101tua]]}} are still present.

M\u0101ori have had [[M\u0101ori electorates|reserved seats]] in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] since 1868: presently, this accounts for seven of the 122 seats in New Zealand's unicameral parliament. The contesting of these seats was the first opportunity for many M\u0101ori to participate in New Zealand elections, although the elected M\u0101ori representatives initially struggled to assert significant influence. M\u0101ori received universal suffrage with other New Zealand citizens in 1893.\n\nBeing a traditionally tribal people, no one organisation ostensibly speaks for all M\u0101ori nationwide. The [[M\u0101ori King Movement]] originated in the 1860s as an attempt by several {{lang|mi|iwi}} to unify under one leader: in modern times, it serves a largely ceremonial role. Another attempt at political unity was the Kotahitanga Movement, which established a separate M\u0101ori Parliament that held annual sessions from 1892 until its last sitting in 1902.<ref>{{cite web|title=Te Kotahitanga \u2013 the M\u0101ori Parliament|publisher=[[Ministry of Women's Affairs (New Zealand)|Ministry of Women's Affairs]]|url=http://www.mwa.govt.nz/women-in-nz/maori-women-and-the-vote/te-kotahitanga-the-maori-parliament|date=16 September 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195319/http://www.mwa.govt.nz/women-in-nz/maori-women-and-the-vote/te-kotahitanga-the-maori-parliament|archivedate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere are seven designated [[M\u0101ori seats]] in the [[New Zealand Parliament]] (and M\u0101ori can and do stand in and win general roll seats), and consideration of and consultation with M\u0101ori have become routine requirements for councils and government organisations.<ref name=\"seats\">{{cite web |title=The Origins of the M\u0101ori Seats |url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/pb/research-papers/document/00PLLawRP03141/origins-of-the-m\u0101ori-seats |accessdate=4 June 2018 |date=31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nDebate occurs frequently as to the relevance and legitimacy of the M\u0101ori electoral roll and seats.
