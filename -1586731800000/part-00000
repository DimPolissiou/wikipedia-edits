While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate [[Variable renewable energy|variable renewable]] resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n===Smart grid===\n{{Main|Smart grid}}\nExpanding intermittent electrical sources, such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.<ref name=RoyalSociety>The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 \"Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty\"].

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

For richer people, emissions tend to be associated with things such as eating [[beef]], [[car]]s, [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flying]], and [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|home heating]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/behaviour-change-public-engagement-and-net-zero-imperial-college-london/|title=Behaviour change, public engagement and Net Zero (Imperial College London)|website=Committee on Climate Change|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.\n\n====Distributing emissions abatement costs====\nThere have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;103\u2013105):<ref name=banuri/>\n*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.\n*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.\n\n==Governmental and intergovernmental action==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\n{{See also|Global warming#Political response}}\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=Bringing down emissions of greenhouse gases asks a good deal of people, not least that they accept the science of climate change.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Film Preservation Board]]. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p. C16. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.</ref>\n\n==Move to cable==\nIn the 1980s, [[Ted Turner]] purchased the film from MGM, alongside ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings. It was the success of this telecast, which gained a wider audience than the first, that persuaded CBS to make the film an annual tradition on television.\n*1960 - CBS - Sunday, December 11 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1961 - CBS - Sunday, December 10 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Only time fully shown in Black & White\n*1962 - CBS - Sunday, December 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  December 16 in Hawaii - 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1964 - CBS - Sunday, January 26 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976.

It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7 - 8 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1 - 8 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6 - 8 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Film Preservation Board]]. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p. C16. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.</ref>\n\n==Move to cable==\nIn the 1980s, [[Ted Turner]] purchased the film from MGM, alongside ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer.

As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings. It was the success of this telecast, which gained a wider audience than the first, that persuaded CBS to make the film an annual tradition on television.\n*1960 - CBS - Sunday, December 11 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1961 - CBS - Sunday, December 10 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Only time fully shown in Black & White\n*1962 - CBS - Sunday, December 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  December 16 in Hawaii - 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1964 - CBS - Sunday, January 26 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976. Moved to NBC in 1968, at this time, the showings were moved from midwinter to late winter/early spring.\n*1968 - NBC - Saturday, April 20 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nFirst showing by NBC, in Spring rather than Winter. The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\n*1969 - NBC - Sunday, March 9 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1970 - NBC - Sunday, March 15 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1971 - NBC - Sunday, April 18 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1972 - NBC - Tuesday, March 7 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\n*1973 - NBC - Sunday, April 8 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m. \n*1974 - NBC - Sunday, February 24 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Due to a breaking news story, NBC decided to show the film two weeks later, on March 10, rather than show it too late or in progress.\n*1975 - NBC - Easter Sunday, March 30 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1976 - CBS - Sunday, March 14 - 7 p.m.\nThe year that ''The Wizard Of Oz'' returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7 - 8 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1 - 8 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6 - 8 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of the defender committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care), with the result is the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') brings to a Scottish court an action against an individual.

This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in a Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Corporeal heritable property in Scots law|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Incorporeal heritable property in Scots law|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Corporeal moveable property in Scots law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Rules Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=Sunday, 28 November, 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12/04/2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== '''Operation of the Feudal System''' ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: The King/Queen). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with an obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, <nowiki>http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</nowiki></ref> The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Alternatively, a vassal could substitute their place in the feudal chain with another individual by a disposition.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''dominium directum''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''dominium utile''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Condition (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n====  '''Feudal Reform and Abolition''' ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. By the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled feudal superiors such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the newly-sitting [[Scottish Parliament]] which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that ''dominium utile'' ownership would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> and on this date feudalism in Scotland ended. \n\n===Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Pledge in Scots law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> The [[Registers of Scotland]] ''2012'' ''Registration Manual'' describes the current situation:<blockquote>\"Although the islands are now part of Scotland, udal law has never been formally abolished in Orkney and Shetland.

A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref>\n\n=== The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B.

This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in a Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Corporeal heritable property in Scots law|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Incorporeal heritable property in Scots law|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Corporeal moveable property in Scots law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Rules Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=Sunday, 28 November, 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12/04/2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== '''Operation of the Feudal System''' ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: The King/Queen). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with an obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, <nowiki>http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</nowiki></ref> The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Alternatively, a vassal could substitute their place with another individual in the feudal chain by a disposition.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''dominium directum''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''dominium utile''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Condition (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n====  '''Feudal Reform and Abolition''' ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. By the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (dominium directum) in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled organisations such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, were able to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the Scottish Parliament which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that all vassals (termed the ''dominium utile'') would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> on this date feudalism in Scotland ended . \n\n===Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Pledge in Scots law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> The [[Registers of Scotland]] ''2012'' ''Registration Manual'' describes the current situation: <blockquote>\"Although the islands are now part of Scotland, udal law has never been formally abolished in Orkney and Shetland.
