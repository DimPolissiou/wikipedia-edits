She is a [[cardiologist]] at the eponymous hospital, and [[widow]] of physician [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] ([[Stuart Damon]]). The role was originated by Patsy Rahn in 1976, who played the role until [[showrunner]]s replaced her with Charleson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> Charleson's tenure with the [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] is [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors#United States|one of the longest in American soap operas]].\n\n==Character and casting==\nMonica becomes [[Chief Physician|Chief of Staff]] at General Hospital following the death of her husband, [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]]. Her specialty is [[cardiology]]. Her various affairs, primarily with fellow doctors [[Jeff Webber]] and his older brother [[Rick Webber]], and her quarrels with husband and their dysfunctional family were all major stories on the show throughout the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn her time on the show, Monica has battled [[breast cancer]], and dealt with outliving almost all of her children. Her two remaining children are Jason Morgan and Skye Quartermaine. She is the owner of the [[Quartermaine]] mansion, as she often reminds her family when they begin quarreling. She has been known to throw them out of her house.\n\nIn 2006, she only had rare appearances. New storylines developed in 2007 (an investigation into the murder of [[Rick Webber]], the deaths of her husband and daughter [[Emily Quartermaine]]), and she is being featured more prominently.\n\nWith the returns of [[Denise Alexander]] ([[Lesley Webber]]), [[Genie Francis]] ([[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]]), and [[Kin Shriner]] ([[Scott Baldwin]]), Monica remains the fourth oldest character on ''General Hospital''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|title=General Hospital 1976|date=January 1, 1976|work=[[ABC Daytime]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=[[New York City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326104340/http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|archivedate=March 26, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hvROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cwIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6987%2C5357067|title=Frank Plans To Divorce Nancy; Mac Moves Back With Rachel|date=February 21, 1977|department=The Soaps|first=Lynda|last=Hirsch|work=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|location=[[Toledo, Ohio]]|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-03-10/features/9303190826_1_leslie-charleson-soap-gloria-monty|title=Seeing 'General Hospital' Through Good Times And Ill|date=March 10, 1993|first=Marla|last=Hart|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc|tronc, inc.]]|location=[[Chicago]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref> and Charleson is the show's most tenured performer.<ref name=\"Monica Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |title=Character Monica Quartermaine Biography |publisher=[[ABC Daytime]] |work=[[General Hospital]] |location=United States |accessdate=July 10, 2018|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919003854/http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2010, it was announced that Charleson was being demoted to recurring status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/news/2010/0825-charleson.php|title=Leslie Charleson dropped to recurring status|website=[[SoapCentral]]|location=United States|publisher=Soap Central Live|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Charleson off contract\">{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Fairman|title=Leslie Charleson taken off contract at GH!|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/leslie-charleson-taken-off-contract-at-gh/2010/08/24/|website=[[Michael Fairman TV]]|publisher=The Michael Fairman Company|location=United States|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, newly appointed head writer [[Garin Wolf]] expressed his interest in having Charleson appear on a much more frequent basis.

However, Greg, Gail's husband took advantage of Monica and raped her. Gail remained unaware of this for many years but the two were able to reconcile once the truth came out. Monica was able to use her experience with Greg to help [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]] when she was raped.\n\nMonica later had an affair with David Langston and gave birth to a daughter, Dawn, whom she gave up for adoption.\n\nJust prior to her arrival on GH, Monica had been engaged to [[Rick Webber]]. However, he had broken up with her and flew off to [[Africa]] where he became caught up in a [[civil war]] and was presumed dead. Monica turned to [[Jeff Webber]], Rick's brother, for comfort and married him, not knowing that Rick was still alive.\n\n===1970s===\nMonica arrived in [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] in 1976, having recently married [[Jeff Webber]]. [[Steve Hardy]], who had been recently appointed as Chief of Staff at [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)#General Hospital|General Hospital]], invited the couple to take part in his ''Mr. and Mrs. Intern Programme'', believing that the couple had an idyllic marriage. However, the truth was that Monica had only married Jeff on the rebound. She was still deeply in love with Jeff's brother, Rick, who had been presumed dead in Africa. Thus, the marriage collapsed when Rick was revealed to be still alive and Monica cheated on Jeff with Rick, while Jeff cheated on Monica with [[Heather Grant]], with whom he had a son, [[Steven Webber]]. Jeff and Monica divorced in 1977.\n\nThroughout this time, Rick had grown close to [[Lesley Webber|Lesley Faulkner]] and planned to marry her. Monica was devastated, and tried to put a stop to it, blackmailing Lesley into turning down Rick's proposal. If Lesley didn't, Monica would tell the hospital board of Monica's affair with Rick, denying him the opportunity to become Chief of Cardiology at General Hospital. During the argument, a pregnant Lesley fell down the stairs and miscarried. Lesley was despondent, and called off her engagement to Rick, hoping to save Rick's career. Meanwhile, Monica and Rick talk about how important the promotion is to Rick, and Monica realizes she cannot go through with her threat, but doesn't tell Lesley as much. Monica's found out when Lesley's daughter Laura's tape recorder is found to have caught Monica's threats to Lesley. Lesley and Rick are married in October 1977.\n\nRick and Monica's relationship becomes embittered, and Monica nearly loses her job, though Lesley sets aside her personal feelings and vouches for Monica's talents as a doctor to Steve, saving her job. Monica claims to be moving on, but she and Rick are forced to work together with [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]] on plans for a new wing at the hospital. Monica makes a last-ditch effort to bed Rick while trapped in a remote ranger station overnight during a storm while working on the project, but is turned down. While Monica continues to antagonize Lesley and Rick, she soon begins a relationship with Alan, though she's still very much attracted to Rick.\n\nMonica had doubts about her relationship with Alan, but these were soon overshadowed when Monica's foster mother Gail Adamson discovered that Monica had slept with Gail's late husband Greg. Gail did not believe Monica's explanation that Greg had forced her into the affair and cut ties with Monica. Monica turned to Alan for support and agreed to marry him. Eventually Gail and Monica made amends. She was thrilled when Gail found happiness by finally agreeing to marry [[Lee Baldwin]] after months of putting him off. Monica became a close confidante to Laura who found that Monica treated her like an adult while her mother continuously treated her like a child.\n\nAfter their 1978 wedding, Alan bought a mansion for Monica as a wedding present, and his family ended up re-settling in Port Charles as well. Monica adored Alan's parents, Edward (who ran the family empire, ELQ) and Lila, but his sister, Tracy, felt Monica was beneath them and caused problems every chance she got. Monica continued to be a confidante to Lesley's young daughter, Laura, and when nurse Bobbie Spencer began to harass Laura and blamed her for attacking her in the hospital book store, Monica took Laura's side, realizing the extent of her own harassment towards Lesley whom she made an effort to become friends with. However, within a year of her second marriage, Monica once again fell into Rick's arms and the two had a one-night stand. Monica was pregnant and didn't know who the father was. Tracy, who had made efforts to get to know her sister-in-law whom she respected as a physician, suspected the truth and plotted to have the unborn child declared illegitimate so her son Ned would inherit the Quartermaine estate. For many months, Monica was bedridden, and innocent student nurse [[Amy Vining]] her only companion. Monica was unaware that the gossipy Amy was totally enamored of the handsome Alan who used her as a spy to keep an eye on his wife. Monica gave birth to a son, [[A. J. Quartermaine|A.J.]] during the middle of a winter storm with only Gail and Lesley present and screamed out that Rick was the father.\n\n===1980s===\nRick and Lesley divorced so Rick and Monica could be together. Alan was enraged by this turn of events and made several attempts to kill Rick and Monica, but was thwarted at every attempt. While both Scotty and Lee found Monica's actions repulsive, their wives Laura and Gail were more compassionate even though Laura was heartsick at seeing Lesley and her adoptive father separated. Monica managed to trick Alan into admitting on tape that he had tried to kill her and Rick and moved into Tracy's old apartment as she prepared to file for an uncontested divorce. Eventually, both Monica and Alan realized that A.J. was indeed Alan's son and not Rick's. Monica attempted to hide this fact from Rick, but Alan eventually exposed the truth that there were rare circumstances when two parents with type O blood could conceive a type B blood baby. Rick, disgusted with Monica's continued manipulations, left her and focused on the formation of the waterfront clinic. A confrontation with Lesley over the revelation of Alan Jr.'s paternity ended up with Monica viciously maligning Lesley's lack of passion and Lesley's surprising response of a hard slap across Monica's face. The next day when Monica went to get her final divorce decree, she discovered that Alan had contested it, and when she confronted him, he threatened her with the loss of her son for her actions, forcing her to return to him even though she couldn't stand the sight of him. Eventually, because of issues concerning Laura on the run, Rick went back to Lesley, having Monica removed as his assistant in surgery, although he later relented, citing their shared excellence in the operating room. Monica felt that she had no other alternative but to stay with Alan, biding her time to find a way out. The only good thing that happened for Monica around this time was Tracy's departure after discovering that her husband [[Mitch Williams]] was having an affair with sexy waitress [[Susan Moore (General Hospital)|Susan Moore]] who ended up being manager of the Campus Disco which Alan bought as a side investment after owner [[Frank Smith (General Hospital)|Frank Smith]] was sent to prison for mob activities.\n\nFollowing their 'reconciliation', Monica refused to sleep with Alan and insisted on separate rooms. Despite attempts by both to be civil to each other, Alan grew frustrated and in 1981, he embarked on an affair with Susan, who became pregnant and would give birth to Alan's son, [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]] while out of town. Alan moved Susan into a cottage but continued to live in the Quartermaine mansion until the tensions became so great between him and Monica that he moved in with Susan. The only calm moments between Alan and Monica was their shared desire to prove that Alan's cousin, [[Alexandria Quartermaine]] was utilizing the family fortune in ways that would not keep their holdings strong. Monica was greatly amused when Alexandria's will left all of her ELQ stock to Lila, putting her in control and keeping Edward from making deals he felt important to gain more money and power. Monica hired private investigator Larry Corrigan ([[Frank Ashmore]]) to get proof of Alan's affair with Susan, and he took a job at the campus disco, managing it after Susan went to New York to have her baby. Between Larry and Cathy Summers (A.J.'s nanny), she got the evidence she needed and used it to make Alan's life a living hell. In spite of public scenes at the hospital which caused both of them to be reprimanded by Steve Hardy, Monica would continue to be seen with Alan at social functions, including Luke and Laura's wedding, even though she was preparing to file for divorce and sell the Quartermaine house, a move that Alan put a stop to. But the chemistry between Alan and Susan soon waned and he found himself becoming bored with her which lead to him unable to make love. Arguing with Monica over Susan and Jason led to them admitting their passion for one another, and Alan broke off with Susan who sued him for palimony and major child support. The final straw for Alan came when she turned into a drunk and married Scott Baldwin after being in a horrendous car accident. In 1983, Susan was murdered by Lila's first husband, Crane Tolliver (discovered after all of the Quartermaines, including Monica, were questioned as suspects), and Susan's aunt Alice Grant took Jason in. After Alice died of an embolism a few months later, Monica and Alan fought her daughter, Heather (the same Heather whom Jeff had cheated on Monica with seven years earlier) for custody of the baby. Monica was not pleased at having her husband's illegitimate offspring in the house at first, but eventually grew to love Jason as if he were her own. She later legally adopted him as well.\n\nMonica was saddened by the sudden death in a car accident of her old rival Lesley Webber whom she had somewhat made peace with. Only a few months before, the Quartermaines had shared in the Webber family's joy over Laura Spencer's return from the dead. While determined to make her marriage to Alan work this time around, Monica did become a source of comfort for her ex-lover, Rick, and even wished him much happiness when he married [[Ginny Blake]], the natural mother of Rick and Lesley's adopted son, Mikey. The Quartermaines had more than their share of tensions on their hand when Edward's illegitimate son Jimmy Lee Holt showed up and ended up with proof that Edward and Lila's marriage had not been legal. The following year, Jimmy Lee's mother, Beatrice LaSeur, showed up and proceeded to attempt to blackmail the family, leading to her apparent murder in which Monica was once again a suspect. But she had accidentally drank Lila's heart medication which caused her death. One of the suspects in Beatrice's death was spa owner [[Lorena Sharpe]] who turned out to be Monica's long-lost cousin. In 1986, Monica had an affair with [[Sean Donely]], and kicked all the [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]]s out of the mansion. Alan concocted a bizarre scheme to frame Sean for his 'murder' and even went missing for several months as part of the plan. Eventually, Sean left Monica for [[Tiffany Hill]], and Monica reluctantly reconciled with Alan and let the Quartermaines back into the mansion.\n\nMonica went away to a spa resort and ended up sleeping with one of the workers there, a young man named Ward. To Monica's surprise, Ward turned out to be [[List of past General Hospital characters#Ned Ashton|Ned Ashton]], the son of her sister-in-law, [[Tracy Quartermaine]] (who came back after a decade's absence) and thus, Alan's nephew. The two agreed to keep the affair a secret, but soon another secret of Monica's would come out. Monica's secret daughter, [[Dawn Winthrop]] turned up and began dating Ned. These two secrets proved at last to be the deathblow to Monica and Alan's marriage and the two divorced. Alan later married [[Lucy Coe]] in 1990. During this time, the family believed that Edward had been killed in a helicopter crash and fought brutally over his estate.\n\n===1990s===\nDawn was later murdered and Monica was devastated by her death. After Alan's marriage to Lucy also proved a disaster, Monica and Alan were drawn back together by their son A.J's rebellious behavior. In 1991, the two remarried and the next three years of their marriage were relatively calm, although the return of David Langton (Dawn's father), A.J.'s relationship with David's daughter Nikki and Alan's friendship with Rhonda Wexler did give the couple some cause for concern. It was during this time that Edward was found alive and returned to Port Charles to help the Quartermaine's take on the cartel who had tried to take over ELQ. Alan and Monica also welcomed Lee and Gail Baldwin back to Port Charles, getting Gail to provide some therapy for the problematic A.J. Monica supported Alan fully when he confessed to her that he had discovered that Ray Conway, Rhonda's boyfriend, had sexually molested Karen, and had pushed him after finding Ray beating up Rhonda, causing Ray to hit his head and die.\n\nMonica's life was changed forever when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994. Monica became despondent and began pushing Alan away, though Alan fought hard to give Monica the support she needed. During this time, Monica befriended [[Paige Bowen]], a fellow cancer patient. Monica was devastated when Paige died, but ended up adopting Paige's daughter, [[Emily Quartermaine|Emily]]. Finally, Monica went into remission, but she and Alan were drifting further and further apart.\n\nBy 1995, A.J.'s alcoholism, which had been developing for several years, culminated in family tragedy when he and Jason were in a serious car accident. A.J. escaped relatively unhurt, but Jason was left with amnesia and brain damage. The family's attempts to make Jason remember alienated him from the family and he eventually rejected all of them including Monica in favor of working for local mob boss, [[Sonny Corinthos]]. As a result of all the tragedy in her life, Monica separated from Alan and longed to make herself feel better. Monica embarked on an affair with Dr. [[Pierce Dorman]], which predictably ended in disaster when Dorman made false allegations of sexual harassment against Monica. In court, Dorman's lawyers brought up Monica's past indiscretions, including her affair with Ned and ended up winning the case. Monica was fired from General Hospital as a result. Monica also had to deal with both A.J.'s alcoholism and Emily's drug addiction. Monica snapped and kidnapped Dorman, and threatened to give him a lobotomy. Only Jason's intervention stopped her from doing so. Eventually though, Monica was vindicated when Dorman was murdered and revealed to have been a drug dealer. Monica and the rest of the Quartermaines were both shocked and delighted when it was revealed that the presumably deceased Lesley Webber was very much alive. When Monica went to visit her old rival, the mentally fragile Lesley calmly said she could never ever forget Monica. The two women would socialize at hospital events even though Lesley did not return to the medical profession, but on occasion, their pasts would create some comic tension.\n\nMore family drama ensued in 1998 when [[Carly Corinthos|Carly Roberts]] claimed that her son [[Michael Corinthos III|Michael]] was Jason's. Monica's father-in-law, [[Edward Quartermaine]], wanted to gain custody of Michael and thus Jason, who had been growing close to the Quartermaines was alienated from the family once again. Eventually, it was revealed that Jason was covering for Carly and that Michael was not Jason's son, but rather A.J.'s. During this time, Alan had become addicted to painkillers, which caused another brief estrangement between Alan and Monica.\n\n===2000s===\nAlan and Monica eventually reconciled and briefly considered trying for another baby. In 2001, they decided to renew their vows only for [[Skye Quartermaine|Skye Chandler]] to turn up and claim that she was Alan's daughter. While Monica and Skye clashed at first, they eventually established a cordial relationship and Monica even allowed Skye to stay at the mansion after Tracy revealed she wasn't Alan's daughter after all. Alan and Monica stayed stable for several years, even as drama occurred amongst their children. A.J. lost custody of Michael to Carly and her new husband Sonny Corinthos, while Emily was temporarily paralyzed in an accident and later diagnosed with breast cancer. When [[Rick Webber]] returned to town for Laura's remarriage to Luke, he re-kindled his old friendship with Monica which caused Alan to become jealous of them once again and brought back some bad memories for Lesley Webber who had never stopped loving him. When Rick was suddenly killed, Alan and Monica were both mentioned as suspects, and for a long time, everybody believed that Laura had killed him in self-defense. The real killer was eventually revealed to be Scotty Baldwin.\n\nIn 2005, A.J. faked his death as part of a complicated plot to frame his ex-wife, [[Courtney Matthews]], for murder and eventually kidnap his son Michael. Alan and Monica blamed each other for failing to show A.J. enough love and attention and once again a rift began in their marriage. When A.J. turned up alive and was subsequently murdered, Alan and Monica separated. Monica also believed that she had witnessed Michael kill A.J. and helped in the cover up, though eventually it was revealed that her grandson was not to blame. Monica and Alan eventually patched up their differences and decided to remain married.\n\nAs of 2006, Monica spends most of her time at the hospital, or being amused by the various dramas that have been occurring in her family. In February 2007, she was devastated by the death of her husband Alan, followed in November 2007 by the death of Emily after district attorney and Sonny's half-brother [[Ric Lansing]] tightened security at the Metro Court Hotel. Monica blamed Jason for Emily's death. Even though he was her only child left, she would not have anything to do with him, and turned to alcohol. Her drinking led to her being sued for medical malpractice by her sister-in-law [[Tracy Quartermaine Spencer|Tracy Quartermaine]] after a botched surgery that Monica performed on Tracy's husband [[Luke Spencer]]. Monica also drank while driving, and hit [[Sam McCall]] in a hit and run. She continued to blame Jason both for her grief and her drinking problem because his job had cost her Alan, A.J. and Emily.\n\nMonica's drinking landed her in a horrific car accident; Jason insisted that she seek treatment otherwise he would report her to the police. Monica chose to get help and report herself. Monica would reconcile with Jason, apologize for the way she had treated him and reassure him that regardless of his parentage, she thought of him aa her son and she loves him. Jason would promise help her in future, be a better son, and hire his lawyer [[Diane Miller]] (who bores a striking resemblance to Ric) to defend Monica. She pleaded guilty to Sam's hit and run and driving while under the influence. Though a deal was made to have Monica attend rehab and do six months of community service, the judge insists that Monica deserves a more severe punishment, stating that Monica's grief did not give her an excuse to endanger people's lives and that she should have sought help for her condition sooner. However, Nikolas and Sam's testimonies convinced the judge to accept Monica's plea bargain.\n\nMonica resumed her position as Chief of Staff at General Hospital after completing rehab. While assisting in a patient's operation, Monica, along with the rest of the operation room's surgical staff, was infected with an airborne toxin that was inside the patient. She was taken to the ICU at Mercy, but was quickly released. Monica immediately took to newcomer [[Rebecca Shaw (General Hospital)|Rebecca Shaw]], Emily's twin sister, and shared with Rebecca her own breast cancer struggle.\n\nMonica once again became a key player in the reconstruction efforts for General Hospital to re-open after the toxin outbreak. She later stepped down from her role as Chief of Staff, contacting former physician [[Steven Webber|Dr. Steven Webber]] to take over for her so that she could re-focus on her specialty of cardiology.\n\n===2010s===\nEarly in the decade, Monica was seen infrequently, often not present from Quartermaine family events because it is too painful for her after Alan's death. After [[Elizabeth Webber]]'s son, [[Jacob Spencer|Jake Webber]], died in a hit-and-run, Monica found out that he was actually Jason's son. She was heartbroken over Jake's death, and admonished both Jason and Elizabeth for denying her the right to know her grandson. She also yelled at Luke, the driver who accidentally hit Jake. After Jason is admitted to the hospital following a car accident, Monica finds out that he & Sam are engaged. She imagines a life where Jason never got in the car with A.J., and was still Jason Quartermaine. She's later glad to still have Jason as he is. When Jason eventually woke up, she helped him and Sam plan their wedding. She gave Alan's wedding ring to Sam, who in turn gave it to Jason on their wedding day. Monica eventually returns to her job as Chief of Staff at the hospital.\n\nMonica is thrilled when Jason and Sam have a son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Daniel Morgan]], and ask her to be part of her grandson's life. Sadly, Jason disappears, and is presumed dead shortly after, and Monica had to deal with losing another child. At the same time, A.J. returns, and it's revealed that Monica helped him fake his death and sneak out of the country to avoid the criminal charges. A.J. comes back, wanting to reconnect with his family, especially Michael. Monica supported him, despite others saying he was going to cause trouble. However, he did reconnect with Michael and, in turn, Monica. When A.J. was accused of murdering [[Connie Falconeri]] and lapsed back into alcoholism, Monica got fired as chief of staff trying to support A.J. She lost her son again when A.J. was murdered by Sonny. Monica was furious, but happy when Michael disowned Sonny and started to bond more with the Quartermaines because of Sonny being like [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Cesar Faison|Cesar Faison]].\n\nMonica found out that Jake was actually alive, having been held captive by [[Helena Cassadine]], and got a chance to be a part of Jake's life. She also bonded with \"Jake Doe,\" an amnesiac patient who had a facial reconstruction surgery after an accident. It later turned out that \"Jake Doe\" was actually Jason, though he had no memories of his past. Monica promised not to make the same mistakes with Jason that she made before, and was able to reconnect with him. Meanwhile, Monica had to deal with the new chief of staff, [[Liesl Obrecht]], and her strict conduct rules. Tracy, though, helped Monica get back the job after Monica called in Dr. [[General Hospital characters (2016)#Hamilton Finn|Hamilton Finn]] to help an ailing Tracy. She fought to help Finn stay on staff, despite Liesl's objections. Jason, meanwhile, recovered his memories, and apologized to Monica for pushing her away for many years. He promised to make more of an effort to include her as his mother; Monica assured Jason that she loved him.\n\nMonica was targeted by the General Hospital serial killer, later revealed to be [[Paul Hornsby]] who is like [[Valentin Cassadine|Valentin]] and [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Victor Cassadine|Victor Cassadine]]. She was attacked and left unconscious, but was saved by Nurse [[Sabrina Santiago]]. Unfortunately, Sabrina figured out Paul was the culprit, and he killed her to keep her silent. Monica survived, but she and Tracy were forced to shut down General Hospital to prevent anyone else from getting killed. When Paul was caught and sent to prison, she and Tracy both feverishly worked to get the hospital opened up again. They succeeded, but were facing financial trouble trying to keep the hospital open. Monica and the Quartermaines rallied together, and decided to buy out the hospital so that it wouldn't be sold to develop condominiums. With Finn's help, they succeeded in stopping the Jeromes in their tracks. Monica was there when Jason and Sam decided to name their newborn daughter [[Emily Morgan (General Hospital)|Emily]], in honor of Monica's daughter. She was thrilled by the tribute, and met her granddaughter after [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Olivia St. John|Olivia Jerome]] was sent to a mental asylum when Judge Horace Sanchez found out Liv was unfit to stand trial.\n\nIn January 2019, Monica learned from Scotty that the widowed Gail Baldwin had died. Along with Lucy, Monica and Scotty shared memories of Gail whom Monica believed had help guide her through many situations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{General Hospital}}\n{{General Hospital characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quartermaine, Monica}}\n[[Category:General Hospital characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:General Hospital: Night Shift characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional female doctors]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| series = General Hospital\n| image1 = Leslie Charleson as Monica Quartermaine.png\n| caption1 = Leslie Charleson as Monica Quartermaine\n| portrayer = {{unbulleted list|Patsy Rahn (1976\u20131977)|[[Leslie Charleson]] (1977\u2013present)|[[Patty McCormack]] (2018)}}\n| creator = [[Eileen Pollock (writer)|Eileen Pollock]] and [[Robert Mason Pollock]]\n| introducer = Tom Donovan\n| years = 1976\u2013present\n| first = 1976\n| last = \n| classification = [[List of General Hospital cast members#Recurring cast|Present; recurring]]\n| books = ''[[Robin's Diary]]''<br>''[[The Secret Life of Damian Spinelli]]''\n| spinoffs = ''[[Port Charles]]'' <br> ''[[General Hospital: Night Shift]]''\n| alias = {{unbulleted list|Monica Bard|Monica Webber}}\n| occupation = ELQ shareholder (5%) <br> Chief of Staff at General Hospital <br> Chief [[cardiologist]] at General Hospital \n| residence = [[Port Charles (fictional city)|Port Charles]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| family = [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]]\n| spouse= {{unbulleted list|[[List of General Hospital characters (1970s)#Jeff Webber|Jeff Webber]] (1976\u20131977)|[[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] (1978\u20131990, 1991\u20132007)}}\n| adoptivemother = [[List of General Hospital characters (1970s)#Gail Baldwin|Gail Adamson]] (foster)\n| sons = [[A.

She is a [[cardiologist]] at the eponymous hospital, and [[widow]] of physician [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Alan Quartermaine]] ([[Stuart Damon]]). The role was originated by Patsy Rahn in 1976, who played the role until [[showrunner]]s replaced her with Charleson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> Charleson's tenure with the [[serial (radio and television)|serial]] is [[List of longest-serving soap opera actors#United States|one of the longest in American soap operas]].\n\n==Character and casting==\nMonica becomes [[Chief Physician|Chief of Staff]] at General Hospital following the death of her husband, Alan. Her with a specialty in [cardiology] at the original and on-going setting of the show. Her various affairs, primarily with fellow doctors [[Jeff Webber]] and his older brother [[Rick Webber]], as well as her quarrels with husband [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]] and their dysfunctional family, were all major stories on the show throughout the late 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn her time on the show, Monica has battled [[breast cancer]], and dealt with outliving almost all of her children. Her two remaining children are Jason Morgan and Skye Quartermaine. She is the owner of the [[Quartermaine]] mansion, which she often reminds her family of when they begin quarreling, which is a regular occurrence in the Quartermaine household. She has been known to throw them out of her house.\n\nIn 2006, she only had rare appearances; however, new storylines developed in 2007 (an investigation into the murder of [[Rick Webber]], the deaths of her husband [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]] and daughter [[Emily Quartermaine]]), and she is being featured more prominently.\n\nWith the returns of [[Denise Alexander]] ([[Lesley Webber]]), [[Genie Francis]] ([[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]]), and [[Kin Shriner]] ([[Scott Baldwin]]), Monica remains to be the fourth oldest character on ''General Hospital''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|title=General Hospital 1976|date=January 1, 1976|work=[[ABC Daytime]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=[[New York City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326104340/http://abc.go.com/daytime/generalhospital/episodes/1976-77/1976.html|archivedate=March 26, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hvROAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cwIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6987%2C5357067|title=Frank Plans To Divorce Nancy; Mac Moves Back With Rachel|date=February 21, 1977|department=The Soaps|first=Lynda|last=Hirsch|work=[[The Blade (Toledo, Ohio)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|location=[[Toledo, Ohio]]|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-03-10/features/9303190826_1_leslie-charleson-soap-gloria-monty|title=Seeing 'General Hospital' Through Good Times And Ill|date=March 10, 1993|first=Marla|last=Hart|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc|tronc, inc.]]|location=[[Chicago]]|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref> and Charleson is the show's most tenured performer.<ref name=\"Monica Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |title=Character Monica Quartermaine Biography |publisher=[[ABC Daytime]] |work=[[General Hospital]] |location=United States |accessdate=July 10, 2018|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919003854/http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/general-hospital/quartermaine-family/character-monica-quartermaine |archivedate=September 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2013/08/history-august-17.html|title=Today in Soap Opera History (August 17)|date=August 17, 2013|first=Roger|last=Newcomb|work=[[List of soap opera media outlets|We Love Soaps]]|publisher=[[Blogger (website)|Blogger]]|location=United States|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2010, it was announced that Charleson was being demoted to recurring status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/gh/news/2010/0825-charleson.php|title=Leslie Charleson dropped to recurring status|website=[[SoapCentral]]|location=United States|publisher=Soap Central Live|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Charleson off contract\">{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Fairman|title=Leslie Charleson taken off contract at GH!|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/news/leslie-charleson-taken-off-contract-at-gh/2010/08/24/|website=[[Michael Fairman TV]]|publisher=The Michael Fairman Company|location=United States|accessdate=September 15, 2012|date=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, newly appointed head writer [[Garin Wolf]] expressed his interest in having Charleson appear on a much more frequent basis.

However, Greg, Gail's husband took advantage of Monica and raped her. Gail remained unaware of this for many years but the two were able to reconcile once the truth came out. Monica was able to use her experience with Greg to help [[Laura Spencer (General Hospital)|Laura Spencer]] when she was raped.\n\nMonica later had an affair with David Langston and gave birth to a daughter, Dawn, whom she gave up for adoption.\n\nJust prior to her arrival on GH, Monica had been engaged to [[Rick Webber]]. However, he had broken up with her and flew off to [[Africa]] where he became caught up in a [[civil war]] and was presumed dead. Monica turned to [[Jeff Webber]], Rick's brother, for comfort and married him, not knowing that Rick was still alive.\n\n===1970s===\nMonica arrived in [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)|Port Charles]] in 1976, having recently married [[Jeff Webber]]. [[Steve Hardy]], who had been recently appointed as Chief of Staff at [[Port Charles, New York (fictional city)#General Hospital|General Hospital]], invited the couple to take part in his ''Mr. and Mrs. Intern Programme'', believing that the couple had an idyllic marriage. However, the truth was that Monica had only married Jeff on the rebound. She was still deeply in love with Jeff's brother, Rick, who had been presumed dead in Africa. Thus, the marriage collapsed when Rick was revealed to be still alive and Monica cheated on Jeff with Rick, while Jeff cheated on Monica with [[Heather Grant]], with whom he had a son, [[Steven Webber]]. Jeff and Monica divorced in 1977.\n\nThroughout this time, Rick had grown close to [[Lesley Webber|Lesley Faulkner]] and planned to marry her. Monica was devastated, and tried to put a stop to it, blackmailing Lesley into turning down Rick's proposal. If Lesley didn't, Monica would tell the hospital board of Monica's affair with Rick, denying him the opportunity to become Chief of Cardiology at General Hospital. During the argument, a pregnant Lesley fell down the stairs and miscarried. Lesley was despondent, and called off her engagement to Rick, hoping to save Rick's career. Meanwhile, Monica and Rick talk about how important the promotion is to Rick, and Monica realizes she cannot go through with her threat, but doesn't tell Lesley as much. Monica's found out when Lesley's daughter Laura's tape recorder is found to have caught Monica's threats to Lesley. Lesley and Rick are married in October 1977.\n\nRick and Monica's relationship becomes embittered, and Monica nearly loses her job, though Lesley sets aside her personal feelings and vouches for Monica's talents as a doctor to Steve, saving her job. Monica claims to be moving on, but she and Rick are forced to work together with [[Alan Quartermaine (General Hospital)|Dr. Alan Quartermaine]] on plans for a new wing at the hospital. Monica makes a last-ditch effort to bed Rick while trapped in a remote ranger station overnight during a storm while working on the project, but is turned down. While Monica continues to antagonize Lesley and Rick, she soon begins a relationship with Alan, though she's still very much attracted to Rick.\n\nMonica had doubts about her relationship with Alan, but these were soon overshadowed when Monica's foster mother Gail Adamson discovered that Monica had slept with Gail's late husband Greg. Gail did not believe Monica's explanation that Greg had forced her into the affair and cut ties with Monica. Monica turned to Alan for support and agreed to marry him. Eventually Gail and Monica made amends. She was thrilled when Gail found happiness by finally agreeing to marry [[Lee Baldwin]] after months of putting him off. Monica became a close confidante to Laura who found that Monica treated her like an adult while her mother continuously treated her like a child.\n\nAfter their 1978 wedding, Alan bought a mansion for Monica as a wedding present, and his family ended up re-settling in Port Charles as well. Monica adored Alan's parents, Edward (who ran the family empire, ELQ) and Lila, but his sister, Tracy, felt Monica was beneath them and caused problems every chance she got. Monica continued to be a confidante to Lesley's young daughter, Laura, and when nurse Bobbie Spencer began to harass Laura and blamed her for attacking her in the hospital book store, Monica took Laura's side, realizing the extent of her own harassment towards Lesley whom she made an effort to become friends with. However, within a year of her second marriage, Monica once again fell into Rick's arms and the two had a one-night stand. Monica was pregnant and didn't know who the father was. Tracy, who had made efforts to get to know her sister-in-law whom she respected as a physician, suspected the truth and plotted to have the unborn child declared illegitimate so her son Ned would inherit the Quartermaine estate. For many months, Monica was bedridden, and innocent student nurse [[Amy Vining]] her only companion. Monica was unaware that the gossipy Amy was totally enamored of the handsome Alan who used her as a spy to keep an eye on his wife. Monica gave birth to a son, [[A. J. Quartermaine|A.J.]] during the middle of a winter storm with only Gail and Lesley present and screamed out that Rick was the father.\n\n===1980s===\nRick and Lesley divorced so Rick and Monica could be together. Alan was enraged by this turn of events and made several attempts to kill Rick and Monica, but was thwarted at every attempt. While both Scotty and Lee found Monica's actions repulsive, their wives Laura and Gail were more compassionate even though Laura was heartsick at seeing Lesley and her adoptive father separated. Monica managed to trick Alan into admitting on tape that he had tried to kill her and Rick and moved into Tracy's old apartment as she prepared to file for an uncontested divorce. Eventually, both Monica and Alan realized that A.J. was indeed Alan's son and not Rick's. Monica attempted to hide this fact from Rick, but Alan eventually exposed the truth that there were rare circumstances when two parents with type O blood could conceive a type B blood baby. Rick, disgusted with Monica's continued manipulations, left her and focused on the formation of the waterfront clinic. A confrontation with Lesley over the revelation of Alan Jr.'s paternity ended up with Monica viciously maligning Lesley's lack of passion and Lesley's surprising response of a hard slap across Monica's face. The next day when Monica went to get her final divorce decree, she discovered that Alan had contested it, and when she confronted him, he threatened her with the loss of her son for her actions, forcing her to return to him even though she couldn't stand the sight of him. Eventually, because of issues concerning Laura on the run, Rick went back to Lesley, having Monica removed as his assistant in surgery, although he later relented, citing their shared excellence in the operating room. Monica felt that she had no other alternative but to stay with Alan, biding her time to find a way out. The only good thing that happened for Monica around this time was Tracy's departure after discovering that her husband [[Mitch Williams]] was having an affair with sexy waitress [[Susan Moore (General Hospital)|Susan Moore]] who ended up being manager of the Campus Disco which Alan bought as a side investment after owner [[Frank Smith (General Hospital)|Frank Smith]] was sent to prison for mob activities.\n\nFollowing their 'reconciliation', Monica refused to sleep with Alan and insisted on separate rooms. Despite attempts by both to be civil to each other, Alan grew frustrated and in 1981, he embarked on an affair with Susan, who became pregnant and would give birth to Alan's son, [[Jason Morgan (General Hospital)|Jason]] while out of town. Alan moved Susan into a cottage but continued to live in the Quartermaine mansion until the tensions became so great between him and Monica that he moved in with Susan. The only calm moments between Alan and Monica was their shared desire to prove that Alan's cousin, [[Alexandria Quartermaine]] was utilizing the family fortune in ways that would not keep their holdings strong. Monica was greatly amused when Alexandria's will left all of her ELQ stock to Lila, putting her in control and keeping Edward from making deals he felt important to gain more money and power. Monica hired private investigator Larry Corrigan ([[Frank Ashmore]]) to get proof of Alan's affair with Susan, and he took a job at the campus disco, managing it after Susan went to New York to have her baby. Between Larry and Cathy Summers (A.J.'s nanny), she got the evidence she needed and used it to make Alan's life a living hell. In spite of public scenes at the hospital which caused both of them to be reprimanded by Steve Hardy, Monica would continue to be seen with Alan at social functions, including Luke and Laura's wedding, even though she was preparing to file for divorce and sell the Quartermaine house, a move that Alan put a stop to. But the chemistry between Alan and Susan soon waned and he found himself becoming bored with her which lead to him unable to make love. Arguing with Monica over Susan and Jason led to them admitting their passion for one another, and Alan broke off with Susan who sued him for palimony and major child support. The final straw for Alan came when she turned into a drunk and married Scott Baldwin after being in a horrendous car accident. In 1983, Susan was murdered by Lila's first husband, Crane Tolliver (discovered after all of the Quartermaines, including Monica, were questioned as suspects), and Susan's aunt Alice Grant took Jason in. After Alice died of an embolism a few months later, Monica and Alan fought her daughter, Heather (the same Heather whom Jeff had cheated on Monica with seven years earlier) for custody of the baby. Monica was not pleased at having her husband's illegitimate offspring in the house at first, but eventually grew to love Jason as if he were her own. She later legally adopted him as well.\n\nMonica was saddened by the sudden death in a car accident of her old rival Lesley Webber whom she had somewhat made peace with. Only a few months before, the Quartermaines had shared in the Webber family's joy over Laura Spencer's return from the dead. While determined to make her marriage to Alan work this time around, Monica did become a source of comfort for her ex-lover, Rick, and even wished him much happiness when he married [[Ginny Blake]], the natural mother of Rick and Lesley's adopted son, Mikey. The Quartermaines had more than their share of tensions on their hand when Edward's illegitimate son Jimmy Lee Holt showed up and ended up with proof that Edward and Lila's marriage had not been legal. The following year, Jimmy Lee's mother, Beatrice LaSeur, showed up and proceeded to attempt to blackmail the family, leading to her apparent murder in which Monica was once again a suspect. But she had accidentally drank Lila's heart medication which caused her death. One of the suspects in Beatrice's death was spa owner [[Lorena Sharpe]] who turned out to be Monica's long-lost cousin. In 1986, Monica had an affair with [[Sean Donely]], and kicked all the [[Quartermaine family|Quartermaine]]s out of the mansion. Alan concocted a bizarre scheme to frame Sean for his 'murder' and even went missing for several months as part of the plan. Eventually, Sean left Monica for [[Tiffany Hill]], and Monica reluctantly reconciled with Alan and let the Quartermaines back into the mansion.\n\nMonica went away to a spa resort and ended up sleeping with one of the workers there, a young man named Ward. To Monica's surprise, Ward turned out to be [[List of past General Hospital characters#Ned Ashton|Ned Ashton]], the son of her sister-in-law, [[Tracy Quartermaine]] (who came back after a decade's absence) and thus, Alan's nephew. The two agreed to keep the affair a secret, but soon another secret of Monica's would come out. Monica's secret daughter, [[Dawn Winthrop]] turned up and began dating Ned. These two secrets proved at last to be the deathblow to Monica and Alan's marriage and the two divorced. Alan later married [[Lucy Coe]] in 1990. During this time, the family believed that Edward had been killed in a helicopter crash and fought brutally over his estate.\n\n===1990s===\nDawn was later murdered and Monica was devastated by her death. After Alan's marriage to Lucy also proved a disaster, Monica and Alan were drawn back together by their son A.J's rebellious behavior. In 1991, the two remarried and the next three years of their marriage were relatively calm, although the return of David Langton (Dawn's father), A.J.'s relationship with David's daughter Nikki and Alan's friendship with Rhonda Wexler did give the couple some cause for concern. It was during this time that Edward was found alive and returned to Port Charles to help the Quartermaine's take on the cartel who had tried to take over ELQ. Alan and Monica also welcomed Lee and Gail Baldwin back to Port Charles, getting Gail to provide some therapy for the problematic A.J. Monica supported Alan fully when he confessed to her that he had discovered that Ray Conway, Rhonda's boyfriend, had sexually molested Karen, and had pushed him after finding Ray beating up Rhonda, causing Ray to hit his head and die.\n\nMonica's life was changed forever when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1994. Monica became despondent and began pushing Alan away, though Alan fought hard to give Monica the support she needed. During this time, Monica befriended [[Paige Bowen]], a fellow cancer patient. Monica was devastated when Paige died, but ended up adopting Paige's daughter, [[Emily Quartermaine|Emily]]. Finally, Monica went into remission, but she and Alan were drifting further and further apart.\n\nBy 1995, A.J.'s alcoholism, which had been developing for several years, culminated in family tragedy when he and Jason were in a serious car accident. A.J. escaped relatively unhurt, but Jason was left with amnesia and brain damage. The family's attempts to make Jason remember alienated him from the family and he eventually rejected all of them including Monica in favor of working for local mob boss, [[Sonny Corinthos]]. As a result of all the tragedy in her life, Monica separated from Alan and longed to make herself feel better. Monica embarked on an affair with Dr. [[Pierce Dorman]], which predictably ended in disaster when Dorman made false allegations of sexual harassment against Monica. In court, Dorman's lawyers brought up Monica's past indiscretions, including her affair with Ned and ended up winning the case. Monica was fired from General Hospital as a result. Monica also had to deal with both A.J.'s alcoholism and Emily's drug addiction. Monica snapped and kidnapped Dorman, and threatened to give him a lobotomy. Only Jason's intervention stopped her from doing so. Eventually though, Monica was vindicated when Dorman was murdered and revealed to have been a drug dealer. Monica and the rest of the Quartermaines were both shocked and delighted when it was revealed that the presumably deceased Lesley Webber was very much alive. When Monica went to visit her old rival, the mentally fragile Lesley calmly said she could never ever forget Monica. The two women would socialize at hospital events even though Lesley did not return to the medical profession, but on occasion, their pasts would create some comic tension.\n\nMore family drama ensued in 1998 when [[Carly Corinthos|Carly Roberts]] claimed that her son [[Michael Corinthos III|Michael]] was Jason's. Monica's father-in-law, [[Edward Quartermaine]], wanted to gain custody of Michael and thus Jason, who had been growing close to the Quartermaines was alienated from the family once again. Eventually, it was revealed that Jason was covering for Carly and that Michael was not Jason's son, but rather A.J.'s. During this time, Alan had become addicted to painkillers, which caused another brief estrangement between Alan and Monica.\n\n===2000s===\nAlan and Monica eventually reconciled and briefly considered trying for another baby. In 2001, they decided to renew their vows only for [[Skye Quartermaine|Skye Chandler]] to turn up and claim that she was Alan's daughter. While Monica and Skye clashed at first, they eventually established a cordial relationship and Monica even allowed Skye to stay at the mansion after Tracy revealed she wasn't Alan's daughter after all. Alan and Monica stayed stable for several years, even as drama occurred amongst their children. A.J. lost custody of Michael to Carly and her new husband Sonny Corinthos, while Emily was temporarily paralyzed in an accident and later diagnosed with breast cancer. When [[Rick Webber]] returned to town for Laura's remarriage to Luke, he re-kindled his old friendship with Monica which caused Alan to become jealous of them once again and brought back some bad memories for Lesley Webber who had never stopped loving him. When Rick was suddenly killed, Alan and Monica were both mentioned as suspects, and for a long time, everybody believed that Laura had killed him in self-defense. The real killer was eventually revealed to be Scotty Baldwin.\n\nIn 2005, A.J. faked his death as part of a complicated plot to frame his ex-wife, [[Courtney Matthews]], for murder and eventually kidnap his son Michael. Alan and Monica blamed each other for failing to show A.J. enough love and attention and once again a rift began in their marriage. When A.J. turned up alive and was subsequently murdered, Alan and Monica separated. Monica also believed that she had witnessed Michael kill A.J. and helped in the cover up, though eventually it was revealed that her grandson was not to blame. Monica and Alan eventually patched up their differences and decided to remain married.\n\nAs of 2006, Monica spends most of her time at the hospital, or being amused by the various dramas that have been occurring in her family. In February 2007, she was devastated by the death of her husband Alan, followed in November 2007 by the death of Emily after district attorney and Sonny's half-brother [[Ric Lansing]] tightened security at the Metro Court Hotel. Monica blamed Jason for Emily's death. Even though he was her only child left, she would not have anything to do with him, and turned to alcohol. Her drinking led to her being sued for medical malpractice by her sister-in-law [[Tracy Quartermaine Spencer|Tracy Quartermaine]] after a botched surgery that Monica performed on Tracy's husband [[Luke Spencer]]. Monica also drank while driving, and hit [[Sam McCall]] in a hit and run. She continued to blame Jason both for her grief and her drinking problem because his job had cost her Alan, A.J. and Emily.\n\nMonica's drinking landed her in a horrific car accident; Jason insisted that she seek treatment otherwise he would report her to the police. Monica chose to get help and report herself. Monica would reconcile with Jason, apologize for the way she had treated him and reassure him that regardless of his parentage, she thought of him aa her son and she loves him. Jason would promise help her in future, be a better son, and hire his lawyer [[Diane Miller]] (who bores a striking resemblance to Ric) to defend Monica. She pleaded guilty to Sam's hit and run and driving while under the influence. Though a deal was made to have Monica attend rehab and do six months of community service, the judge insists that Monica deserves a more severe punishment, stating that Monica's grief did not give her an excuse to endanger people's lives and that she should have sought help for her condition sooner. However, Nikolas and Sam's testimonies convinced the judge to accept Monica's plea bargain.\n\nMonica resumed her position as Chief of Staff at General Hospital after completing rehab. While assisting in a patient's operation, Monica, along with the rest of the operation room's surgical staff, was infected with an airborne toxin that was inside the patient. She was taken to the ICU at Mercy, but was quickly released. Monica immediately took to newcomer [[Rebecca Shaw (General Hospital)|Rebecca Shaw]], Emily's twin sister, and shared with Rebecca her own breast cancer struggle.\n\nMonica once again became a key player in the reconstruction efforts for General Hospital to re-open after the toxin outbreak. She later stepped down from her role as Chief of Staff, contacting former physician [[Steven Webber|Dr. Steven Webber]] to take over for her so that she could re-focus on her specialty of cardiology.\n\n===2010s===\nEarly in the decade, Monica was seen infrequently, often not present from Quartermaine family events because it is too painful for her after Alan's death. After [[Elizabeth Webber]]'s son, [[Jacob Spencer|Jake Webber]], died in a hit-and-run, Monica found out that he was actually Jason's son. She was heartbroken over Jake's death, and admonished both Jason and Elizabeth for denying her the right to know her grandson. She also yelled at Luke, the driver who accidentally hit Jake. After Jason is admitted to the hospital following a car accident, Monica finds out that he & Sam are engaged. She imagines a life where Jason never got in the car with A.J., and was still Jason Quartermaine. She's later glad to still have Jason as he is. When Jason eventually woke up, she helped him and Sam plan their wedding. She gave Alan's wedding ring to Sam, who in turn gave it to Jason on their wedding day. Monica eventually returns to her job as Chief of Staff at the hospital.\n\nMonica is thrilled when Jason and Sam have a son, [[Daniel Morgan (General Hospital)|Daniel Morgan]], and ask her to be part of her grandson's life. Sadly, Jason disappears, and is presumed dead shortly after, and Monica had to deal with losing another child. At the same time, A.J. returns, and it's revealed that Monica helped him fake his death and sneak out of the country to avoid the criminal charges. A.J. comes back, wanting to reconnect with his family, especially Michael. Monica supported him, despite others saying he was going to cause trouble. However, he did reconnect with Michael and, in turn, Monica. When A.J. was accused of murdering [[Connie Falconeri]] and lapsed back into alcoholism, Monica got fired as chief of staff trying to support A.J. She lost her son again when A.J. was murdered by Sonny. Monica was furious, but happy when Michael disowned Sonny and started to bond more with the Quartermaines because of Sonny being like [[List of General Hospital characters (1990s)#Cesar Faison|Cesar Faison]].\n\nMonica found out that Jake was actually alive, having been held captive by [[Helena Cassadine]], and got a chance to be a part of Jake's life. She also bonded with \"Jake Doe,\" an amnesiac patient who had a facial reconstruction surgery after an accident. It later turned out that \"Jake Doe\" was actually Jason, though he had no memories of his past. Monica promised not to make the same mistakes with Jason that she made before, and was able to reconnect with him. Meanwhile, Monica had to deal with the new chief of staff, [[Liesl Obrecht]], and her strict conduct rules. Tracy, though, helped Monica get back the job after Monica called in Dr. [[General Hospital characters (2016)#Hamilton Finn|Hamilton Finn]] to help an ailing Tracy. She fought to help Finn stay on staff, despite Liesl's objections. Jason, meanwhile, recovered his memories, and apologized to Monica for pushing her away for many years. He promised to make more of an effort to include her as his mother; Monica assured Jason that she loved him.\n\nMonica was targeted by the General Hospital serial killer, later revealed to be [[Paul Hornsby]] who is like [[Valentin Cassadine|Valentin]] and [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Victor Cassadine|Victor Cassadine]]. She was attacked and left unconscious, but was saved by Nurse [[Sabrina Santiago]]. Unfortunately, Sabrina figured out Paul was the culprit, and he killed her to keep her silent. Monica survived, but she and Tracy were forced to shut down General Hospital to prevent anyone else from getting killed. When Paul was caught and sent to prison, she and Tracy both feverishly worked to get the hospital opened up again. They succeeded, but were facing financial trouble trying to keep the hospital open. Monica and the Quartermaines rallied together, and decided to buy out the hospital so that it wouldn't be sold to develop condominiums. With Finn's help, they succeeded in stopping the Jeromes in their tracks. Monica was there when Jason and Sam decided to name their newborn daughter [[Emily Morgan (General Hospital)|Emily]], in honor of Monica's daughter. She was thrilled by the tribute, and met her granddaughter after [[List of General Hospital characters (1980s)#Olivia St. John|Olivia Jerome]] was sent to a mental asylum when Judge Horace Sanchez found out Liv was unfit to stand trial.\n\nIn January 2019, Monica learned from Scotty that the widowed Gail Baldwin had died. Along with Lucy, Monica and Scotty shared memories of Gail whom Monica believed had help guide her through many situations.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{General Hospital}}\n{{General Hospital characters|present}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quartermaine, Monica}}\n[[Category:General Hospital characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:General Hospital: Night Shift characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional female doctors]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Canonblack", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCharacter and casting:Ungrammatical run-on gibberish and garbage words; redundant excess; define a term the FIRST time it appears, not ALL occurrences EXCEPT the first; excessive linking to the same article; comma proliferation; \"however\" abuse--all in the same paragraph", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Quartermaine"}

From its founding as a [[Diocese|bishopric]] in 1000 until 1821, it was under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]]. From 1821 to 1930 it was subjected directly to the [[Apostolic See]]. Between 1821 and 1972 it was officially known as '''(Arch)Diocese of Breslau'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early medieval era===\nChristianity was first introduced into [[Silesia]] by missionaries from [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]]. After the conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] of Poland and the conquest of Silesia, the work of bringing the people to the new faith went on more rapidly. Up to about the year 1000 Silesia had no bishop of its own, but was united with neighbouring dioceses. In this way, the connection of Silesia with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] continued. The upper part of the [[Oder River]] formed the boundary of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131138)|Kingdom of Poland]]. All the territory which is now Silesia \u2013 lying on the right-hand bank of the Oder \u2013 belonged, therefore, to the [[Diocese of Pozna\u0144]], which was [[suffragan]] to the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]]. This part of Silesia was thus under the jurisdiction of a priest named Jordan who was appointed first Bishop of Pozna\u0144 in 968. The part of Silesia lying on the left bank of the Oder belonged to the territory included in then [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and was consequently within the diocesan jurisdiction of [[Prague]]. The [[Bishopric of Prague]], founded in 973, was suffragan to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].\n\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], the son of Mieszko, obtained the Bohemian part of Silesia during his wars of conquest, and a change in the ecclesiastical dependence of the province followed. By a patent of Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in 995, Silesia was attached to the [[Bishopric of Meissen]], which, like Pozna\u0144, was suffragan to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Soon after, Boles\u0142aw, who had pledged allegiance to the empero Otto who ruled all of Silesia, founded the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, which, together with the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Bishopric of Ko\u0142obrzeg|Ko\u0142obrzeg]], was placed under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]], founded by Otto in 1000 during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]. The first Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw is said to have been named [[Jan (bishop of Wroc\u0142aw)|Johannes]], but nothing more than this is known of him, nor is there extant any official document giving the boundaries of the diocese at the time of its erection. However, they are defined in the Bulls of approval and protection issued by [[Pope Adrian IV]], 23 April 1155, and by [[Pope Innocent IV]], 9 August 1245.\n\nThe powerful Polish ruler Boles\u0142aw I was succeeded by his son [[Mieszko II Lambert]], who had but a short reign. After his death a revolt against Christianity and the reigning family broke out, the new Church organization of Poland disappeared from view, and the names of the Bishops of Wroc\u0142aw for the next half century are unknown. [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]], the son of Mieszko, and his mother were driven out of the country, but through German aid they returned and the affairs of the Church were brought into better order. A Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw from probably 1051 to 1062 was Hieronymus, said by later tradition to have been a [[Rome|Roman]] nobleman. He was followed by Johannes I (1062\u201372), who was succeeded by Petrus I (1071\u20131111). During the episcopate of Petrus, Count Peter Wlast entered upon the work of founding churches and monasteries which has preserved his name. Petrus was followed by: \u017byros\u0142aw I (1112\u201320); Heimo (1120\u201326), who welcomed [[Otto of Bamberg]] to Wroc\u0142aw in May 1124 when the saint was on his missionary journey to Pomerania; Robert I (1127\u201342), who was [[List of Roman Catholic bishops of Krak\u00f3w|Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]]; Robert II (1142\u201346); and Johannes II (1146\u201349), who became Archbishop of Gniezno.\n\n===Silesian duchies (Poland's fragmentation)===\nWith the episcopate of Bishop Walter (1149\u201369) the history of the diocese of Wroc\u0142aw begins to grow clearer. [[Pope Adrian IV]], at Walter's request in 1155, took the bishopric under his protection and confirmed to it the territorial possessions of which a list had been submitted to him. Among the rights which the Pope then confirmed was that of jurisdiction over the lands belonging to the castle of [[Otmuch\u00f3w]] (Ottmachau) which had been regarded as the patrimony of the diocese from its foundation. In 1163 the sons of the exiled Polish duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] returned from the Empire and, through the intervention of Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], received as an independent duchy the part of Silesia which was included at that date in the see of Wroc\u0142aw. Bishop Walter built a new, massively constructed cathedral, in which he was buried. \u017byros\u0142aw II (1170\u201398) encouraged the founding of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Lebus]] by Duke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Tall]]. In 1180 \u017byros\u0142aw took part in the national assembly at [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] at which laws for the protection of the Church and its property were promulgated. Jaros\u0142aw (1198\u20131201), the oldest son of Duke Boles\u0142aw, and Duke of [[Opole|Oppeln]], was the first prince to become Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw (see [[prince-bishop]]).\n\nCyprian (1201\u20137) was originally Abbot of the [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of St. Vincent near Wroc\u0142aw, then [[Bishop of Lebus]], and afterwards Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw. During Cyprian's episcopate Duke Heinrich I and his wife, [[Hedwig of Andechs|St. Hedwig]], founded the [[Cistercian convent at Trebnitz]]. The episcopate of Bishop Lorenz (1207\u201332) was marked by his efforts to bring colonies of Germans into the church territories, to effect the cultivation of waste lands. This introduction of German settlers by the bishop was in accordance with the example set by Heinrich I and St. Hedwig. The monasteries of the [[Augustinian Canons]], [[Premonstratensians]] and [[Cistercian]]s took an active part in carrying out the schemes of the rulers by placing great numbers of Germans, especially [[Thuringians]] and [[Franconia]]ns, on the large estates that had been granted them.\nOne of the most noted bishops of the diocese, Thomas I (1232\u201368), continued the work of German colonization with so much energy that even the marauding incursions of the [[Mongols]] (1241) made but a temporary break in the process. As German colonization in Silesia increased the city of Wroc\u0142aw began to be known by the German name of Breslau, leading to the diocese also becoming called the Bishopric of Breslau. Thomas's defence of the rights of the Church involved him in bitter conflicts with Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]]. Thomas began the construction of the present cathedral, the chancel being the first part erected. St. Hedwig died during his episcopate; and he lived until the process of her canonization was completed, but died before the final solemnity of her elevation to the altars of the Catholic Church. After Thomas I, Ladislaus, a grandson of Saint Hedwig, and [[Archbishop of Salzburg]], was Administrator of the Diocese of Breslau until his death in 1270.\n\nHe was followed by Thomas II (1270\u201392), who was involved for years in a violent dispute with Duke [[Henryk IV Probus|Henry IV]] as to the prerogatives of the Church in Silesia. In 1287 a reconciliation was effected between them at [[Regensburg]], and in 1288 the duke founded the collegiate church of the Holy Cross at Breslau. Before his death, on the Eve of St. John in 1290, the duke confirmed the rights of the Church to sovereignty over the territories of [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]] and Ottmachau. Thomas II consecrated the high altar of the cathedral; he was present at the [[First Council of Lyon]] (1274) and in 1279 held a diocesan synod. Johann III Romka (1292\u20131301), belonged to the Polish party in the [[cathedral chapter]]. His maintenance of the prerogatives of the Church brought him, also, into conflict with the temporal rulers of Silesia; in 1296 he called a synod for the defence of these rights.\n\nIn the election of Heinrich I of W\u00fcrben (1302\u201319), the German party in the cathedral chapter won, but this victory cost the new bishop the enmity of the opposing faction. He was made guardian of the youthful Dukes of Breslau, and this appointment, together with the factional disputes, led to the bringing of grave accusations against him. The researches of more recent times have proved the groundlessness of these attacks. He was kept in [[Avignon]] a number of years by a suit before the [[Curia]] which was finally settled in his favour. Notwithstanding the troubles of his life he was energetic in the performance of his duties. He carried on the construction of the cathedral, and in 1305 and 1316 held diocesan synods. The office of [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of Breslau dates from his episcopate. After his death a divided vote led to a vacancy of the see. The two candidates, Weit and Lutold, elected by the opposing factions, finally resigned, and [[Pope John XXII]] transferred Nanker of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to Breslau (1326\u201341).\n\n===Within Bohemia===\n\nThe constant division and subdivision of Silesian territory into small principalities for the members of the ruling families resulted in a condition of weakness that necessitated dependence on a stronger neighbour, and Silesia thus came under the control of Bohemia (first between 1289\u20131306; definitely from 1327 onwards), which itself was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A quarrel broke out between Bishop Nanker and the suzerain of Silesia, King [[John I of Bohemia]], when the king seized the castle of [[Milicz|Militsch]] which belonged to the cathedral chapter. The bishop excommunicated the king and those members of the Council of Breslau who sided with him. On account of this he was obliged to flee from Breslau and take refuge in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], where he died.\n\n[[File:Preczlaus de Pogrella.png|thumb|120px|right|Przec\u0142aw of Pogarell, 20th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nPrzec\u0142aw of Pogarell (1341\u20131376) was elected bishop while pursuing his studies at [[Bologna]], and was consecrated bishop at [[Avignon]]. Through his friendship with Charles, the son of King John, he was soon able to settle the discord that had arisen under his predecessor. The diocese prospered greatly under his rule. He bought the Duchy of [[Grodk\u00f3w]] (Grottkau) from Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Brzeg|Brieg]] and added it to the episcopal territory of Neisse. The Bishops of Breslau had, therefore, after this the titles of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince) of Neisse and Duke of Grottkau, and took precedence of the other Silesian rulers who held principalities in fief.\n\nEmperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] wished to separate Breslau from the [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]] and to take make it a suffragan of the newly erected [[Archbishopric of Prague]] (1344), but the plan failed, owing to the opposition of the Archbishop of Gniezno. Przec\u0142aw added to the cathedral the beautiful Lady Chapel, in which he was buried and where his tomb still exists. Dietrich, dean of the cathedral, who was elected as successor to Przec\u0142aw, could not obtain the papal confirmation, and the [[Bishop of Olomouc]] (Olm\u00fctz), who was chosen in his place, soon died. After a long contest with Charles, Bishop Wenzel of Lebus, Duke of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]], was transferred to Breslau (1382\u20131417). The new bishop devoted himself to repairing the damage<!-- ??? What damage exactly? It should be more specificated. --> inflicted on the Church in Silesia by the actions of Charles. He held two synods, in 1410 and 1415, with the object of securing a higher standard of ecclesiastical discipline; and he settled the right of inheritance in the territory under his dominion by promulgating the church decree called \"Wenzel's law\". Resigning his bishopric in 1417, Wenzel died in 1419.\n\nThe episcopate of Conrad, Duke of [[Ole\u015bnica]] (Oels), the next bishop (1417\u201347), fell in the trying time for Silesia of the [[Hussite wars]]. Conrad was placed at the head of the Silesian confederation which was formed to defend the country against hostile incursions. In 1435 the bishop issued a decree of which the chief intent was to close the prebends in the diocese of Breslau to foreigners, and thus prevent the Poles from obtaining these offices. The effort to shut out the Polish element and to loosen the connection with [[Gniezno]] was not a momentary one; it continued, and led gradually to a virtual separation from the Polish archdiocese some time before the formal separation took place. The troubles of the times brought the bishop and the diocese into serious pecuniary difficulties, and in 1444 Conrad resigned, but his resignation was not accepted, and he resumed his office. In 1446 he held a diocesan synod and died in the following year.\n[[File:Biskup Piotr Nowak.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Peter Nowak, 23rd Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nConrad's successor was the provest of the cathedral of Breslau, Peter II Nowak (1447\u201356). By wise economy Bishop Peter succeeded in bringing the diocesan finances into a better condition and was able to redeem the greater part of the church lands which his predecessor had been obliged to mortgage. At the diocesan synod of 1454 he endeavoured to suppress the abuses that had arisen in the diocese.\n\n[[File:Jodok z Ro\u017cemberku.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Jo\u0161t of Ro\u017emberk, 24th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nJodokus (Jo\u0161t) of Rosenberg (1456\u201367) was a [[Bohemian]] nobleman and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Knights of St. John]]. His love of peace made his position a very difficult one during the fierce ecclesiastic-political contention that raged between the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], and the people of Breslau, who had taken sides with the German party. Jodokus was followed by a bishop from the region of the [[Rhine]], Rudolf von R\u00fcdesheim (1468\u201382). As [[papal legate]], Rudolf had become popular in Breslau through his energetic opposition to George of Podebrady; for this reason the cathedral chapter requested his transfer from the small [[Diocese of Lavant]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], after he had confirmed their privileges. From this time these privileges were called \"the Rudolfian statutes\". Under his leadership the party opposed to Podebrady obtained the victory, and Rudolf proceeded at once to repair the damage which had been occasioned to the Church during this strife; mortgaged church lands were redeemed; in 1473 and 1475 diocesan synods were held, at which the bishop took active measures in regard to church discipline.\n[[File:JanRoth.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Johann IV. Roth, 26th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nAs coadjutor, he had selected a [[Swabians|Swabian]], Johann IV Roth, [[Bishop of Lavant]], a man of humanistic training. Urged by King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], to whom Silesia was then subject, the cathedral chapter, somewhat unwillingly, chose the coadjutor as bishop (1482\u20131506). His episcopate was marked by violent quarrels with the cathedral chapter. But at the same time he was a promoter of art and learning, and strict in his conception of church rights and duties. He endeavoured to improve the spiritual life of the diocese by holding a number of synods. Before he died the famous worker in bronze, [[Peter Vischer of Nuremberg]], cast his monument, the most beautiful bishop's tomb in Silesia. His coadjutor with right of succession was Johann V (1506\u201320), a member of the noble [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] family of [[Thurzo]]. Johann V took an active part in the intellectual life of the time and sought at the diocesan synods to promote learning and church discipline, and to improve the schools. On the ruins of the old stronghold of [[Jauernig]] he built the castle called [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|Johannisberg]], later the summer residence of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau.\n\nThe religious disturbances of the 16th century began to be conspicuously apparent during this episcopate, and soon after Johann's death Protestantism began to spread in Silesia, which belonged to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] since 1526. Princes, nobles, and town councils were zealous promoters of the new belief; even in the episcopal principality of [[Neisse-Grottkau]] Protestant doctrines found approval and acceptance. The successors of Johann V were partly responsible for this condition of affairs. Jacob von Salza (1520\u201339) was personally a stanch adherent of the Church; yet the gentleness of his disposition caused him to shrink from carrying on a war against the powerful religious movement that had arisen. To an even greater degree than Jacob von Salza his successor, Balthasar von Promnitz (1539\u201363), avoided coming into conflict with Protestantism. He was more friendly in his attitude to the new doctrine than any other Bishop of Breslau. Casper von Logau (1562\u201374) showed at first greater energy than his predecessor in endeavouring to compose the troubles of his distracted diocese, but later in his episcopate his attitude towards Lutheranism and his slackness in defending church rights gave great offence to those who had remained true to the Faith. These circumstances make the advance of Protestantism easy to understand. At the same time it must be remembered that the bishops, although also secular rulers, had a difficult position in regard to spiritual matters. At the assemblies of the nobles, and at the meetings of the diet, the bishops and the deputies of the cathedral chapter were, as a rule, the only Catholics against a large and powerful majority on the side of Protestantism. The [[Habsburg]] suzerains, who lived far from Silesia (in Vienna or Prague), and who were constantly preoccupied by the danger of a [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish invasion]], were not in a position to enforce the edicts which they issued for the protection of the Church.\n\nThe Silesian clergy had in great measure lost their high concept of the priestly office, although there were honourable exceptions. Among those faithful were the majority of the canons of the cathedral of Breslau; they distinguished themselves not only by their learning, but also by their religious zeal. It was in the main due to them that the diocese did not fall into spiritual ruin. The chapter was the willing assistant of the bishops in the reform of the diocese. Martin von Gerstmann (1574\u201385) began the renovation of the diocese, and the special means by which he hoped to attain the desired end were: the founding of a seminary for clerics, visitations of the diocese, diocesan synods, and the introduction of the Jesuits.\n\nHis successor, Andreas von Jerin (1585\u201396), a Swabian who had educated at the German College at Rome, followed in his footsteps. At the diocesan synod of 1592 he endeavoured to improve church discipline. Besides his zeal in elevating the life of the Church, he was also a promoter of the arts and learning. The silver altar with which he adorned his cathedral still exists, and he brought the schools in the principality of Neisse into a flourishing condition. The bishop also rendered important services to the emperor, as [[papal legate|legate]] at various times.\n\nBonaventura Hahn, elected in 1596 as the successor of Andreas von Jerin, was not recognized by the emperor and was obliged to resign his position. The candidate of the emperor, Paul Albert (1599\u20131600), occupied the see only one year. Johann VI (1600\u20138), a member of a noble family of Silesia named von Sitsch, took more severe measures than his predecessors against Protestantism, in the hope of checking it, especially in the episcopal principality of Neisse-Grottkau.\n\nBishop Charles (1608\u201324), an Archduke of Austria, had greater success than his predecessor after the first period of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had taken a turn favourable to Austria and the Catholic party. Charles wanted to move under protection of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], hoping to avoid participation in the war which was ravaging the Holy Roman Empire. As Charles's bishopric was nominally subordinated to the Polish Archbishopric of Gniezno, he asked the archbishop of Gniezno for mediation in talks with King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Poland about protection and subordination of his bishopric. In May 1619, Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw (the future King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]]), invited by his uncle Charles, left [[Warsaw]] and started a trip to Silesia. During talks with W\u0142adys\u0142aw in mid-1619, the Habsburgs promised to agree to a temporary occupation of part of Silesia by Polish forces, which the unsuccessfully Vasas hoped would later allow the incorporation of those areas into Poland.\n\nIn July 1619 Czech Protestants rebelled against King [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and offered the Bohemian crown to [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. On 27 September 1619, probably on hearing the news, W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Charles left Silesia in a hurry and on 7 October 1619 arrived in Warsaw. In December 1619, young W\u0142adys\u0142aw's brother, Prince [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Opole]] was chosen by Charles as auxiliary bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, which was confirmed by the Polish episcopate. The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] (1620) broke the revolt in Bohemian Crown (i.e. including the opposition of the Protestants of Silesia). The Bishopric of Breslau returned to the rule of the Archbishopric of Gniezno in 1620, having before been practically independent. Bishop Charles began the restoration of the principality of Neisse to the Catholic faith. The work was completed by his successor, Charles Ferdinand, Prince of Poland (1625\u201355), who spent most of his time in his own country, but appointed excellent administrators for the diocese, such as the Coadjutor-Bishop Liesch von Hornau, and Archdeacon Gebauer. Imperial commissioners gave back to the Catholic Church those church buildings in the chief places of the principalities which had become the property of the sovereign through the extinction of vassal families. Until 1632 ''de facto'' rule was held in Warsaw by King Sigismund III and not by the bishop or archbishop.\n\nAccording to the terms of the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]], the remaining churches, 693 in number, of such territories were secularized in the years 1653, 1654, and 1668. This led to a complete reorganization of the diocese. The person who effected it was Sebastian of Rostock, a man of humble birth who was [[vicar-general]] and administrator of the diocese under the bishops Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1656\u201362) and Archduke Charles Joseph (1663\u201364), neither of whom lived in the territory of Breslau. After Sebastian of Rostock became bishop (1664\u201371) he carried on the work of reorganization with still greater success than before.\n\n[[File:Friedrich-Kardinal.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Friedrich of Hesse-Darmstadt, 41st Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Friedrich von Hessen-Darmstadt]], Cardinal and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of St. John]], was the next Bishop of Breslau (1671\u201382). The new bishop was of Protestant origin who had become a Catholic at Rome. Under his administration the rehabilitation of the diocese went on. He beautified the cathedral and elaborated its services. For the red cap and violet almutium of the canons he substituted the red [[mozzetta]]. He was buried in a beautiful chapel which he had added to the cathedral in honour of his ancestress, St. Elizabeth of Thuringia.\n\nAfter his death the chapter presented Carl von Liechtenstein, Bishop of Olomouc, for confirmation. Their choice was opposed by the emperor, whose candidate was the [[Count Palatine]] Wolfgang of the ruling family of [[Pfalz-Neuburg]]. Count Wolfgang died, and his brother Franz Ludwig (1683\u20131732) was made bishop. The new ruler of the diocese was at the same time [[Bishop of Worms]], Grand Master of the [[German Knights]], Provost of [[Ellwangen]] and [[Elector of Trier]], and later was made [[Elector of Mainz]]. He separated the ecclesiastical administration and that of the civil tribunals, and obtained the definition, in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1699, of the extent of the jurisdiction of the vicariate-general and the consistory. In 1675, upon the death of the last reigning duke, the Silesian Duchy of [[Liegnitz-Brieg-Wohlau]] lapsed to the emperor, and a new secularization of the churches begun. But when King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] secured for the Protestants the right to their former possessions in these territories, by the Treaty of [[Altranst\u00e4dt]], in 1707, the secularization came to an end, and the churches had to be returned. The Habsburg Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] endeavoured to repair the loss of these buildings to the Catholic faith by founding the so-called Josephine vicarships.\n\n===Within Prussia (main part) and Bohemia (lesser part)===\n[[File:Schaffgotsch portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]], 45th bishop on the see.]] The next prince-bishop, [[Philipp Ludwig von Sinzendorf|Philip, Count von Sinzendorf]], Cardinal and [[Bishop of Raab]] (1732\u20131747), owed his elevation to the favour of the emperor. During his episcopate, the greater part of the diocese was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]. King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (Frederick the Great) desired to erect a \"Catholic Vicariate\" at Berlin, to be the highest spiritual authority for the Catholics of Prussia. This would have been in reality a separation from Rome, and the project failed through the opposition of the Holy See. Bishop Sinzendorf had neither the acuteness to perceive the inimical intent of the king's scheme, nor sufficient decision of character to withstand it. The king desired to secure a successor to Sinzendorf who would be under royal influence. In utter disregard of the principles of the Church, and heedless of the protests of the cathedral chapter, he presented Count [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]] as coadjutor-bishop.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Sinzendorf the king succeeded in the placement of Schaffgotsch as Bishop of Breslau (1748\u201395). Although the method of his elevation caused the new bishop to be regarded with suspicion by many strict Catholics, he was zealous in the fulfilment of his duties. During the [[Seven Years' War]] he fell into discredit with Frederick on account of his firm maintenance of the rights of the Church, and the return of peace did not fully restore him to favour. In 1766 he fled to the [[Austrian Silesia|Austrian]] part of his diocese in order to avoid confinement in [[Opole|Oppeln]] which the king had decreed against him. After this Frederick made it impossible for him to rule the Prussian part of his diocese, and until the death of the bishop this territory was ruled by [[vicars Apostolic]].\n\nThe former coadjutor of von Schaffgotsch, Joseph Christian, Prince von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein (1795\u20131817), succeeded him as bishop. During his episcopate the temporal power of the Bishops of Breslau came to an end through the secularization, in 1810, of the church estates in Prussian Silesia \u2013 only the estates in [[Austrian Silesia]] remained to the see. The cathedral foundation, eight collegiate foundations, and over eighty monasteries were suppressed, and their property confiscated. Only those monastic institutions which were occupied with teaching or nursing were allowed to exist.\n\nBishop Joseph Christian was succeeded by his coadjutor, Emmanuel von Schimonsky. The affairs of the Catholic Church in Prussia had been brought into order by the Bull \"De salute animarum\", issued in 1821. Under its provisions the cathedral chapter elected Schimonsky, who had been administrator of the diocese, as Prince-Bishop of Breslau (1824\u20131832).\n\nThe bull disentangled Breslau diocese from Gniezno ecclesiastical province and made Breslau an [[Exemption (church)|exempt]] bishopric. The bull also reconfined the Breslau diocesan area which from then on remained unchanged until 1922. Breslau diocese then included the bulk of the Catholic parishes in the Prussian [[Province of Silesia]] with the exception of Catholic parishes in the districts of [[Racib\u00f3rz|Ratibor]] and [[Leobsch\u00fctz]], which until 1972 belonged to the [[Archdiocese of Olomouc]], and Catholic parishes in the Prusso-Silesian [[County of Klodzko|County of Glatz]], which were subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] within the [[Archdiocese of Prague]] until 1972. The Breslau Diocese included the Catholic parishes in the [[Duchy of Teschen]] and the Austrian part of the [[Principality of Neisse]]. The bull also assigned the Prussian-annexed parts of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Mei\u00dfen#Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen|Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen]] in [[Lower Lusatia]] (politically part of Prussian [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] since 1815<ref>This included \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Cottbus]], [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], [[Guben]], [[Neuzelle]], [[Schwiebus]] and [[Z\u00fcllichau]] etc.</ref>) and eastern [[Upper Lusatia]] (to Silesia province as of 1815) to Breslau diocese.\n\nWith the exception of the districts of [[Byt\u00f3w|B\u00fctow]] and [[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg (Pommern)]], until 1922 both part of the [[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Diocese of Culm]], the rest of Brandenburg and [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania province]] were, since 1821, supervised by the [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]] ({{lang-de|link=no|F\u00fcrstbisch\u00f6fliche Delegatur f\u00fcr Brandenburg und Pommern}}, {{lang-pl|Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119co-biskupia Delegatura Brandenburgii i Pomorza}}).\n\nSchimonsky retained for himself and his successors the title of prince-bishop, although the episcopal rule in the Principality of Neisse had ended by its secularization. However, the rank of prince-bishop later included the [[Ex officio member]]ship in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] (since 1854) and in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)#House of Lords|Austrian House of Lords]] (since 1861).\n\nSchimonsky combatted the rationalistic tendencies which were rife among his clergy in regard to celibacy and the use of Latin in the church services and ceremonies. During the episcopate of his predecessor the government had promulgated a law which was a source of much trouble to Schimonsky and his immediate successors; this was that in those places where Catholics were few in number, the parish should be declared extinct, and the church buildings given to the newly founded [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]]. In spite of the protests of the episcopal authorities, over one hundred church buildings were lost in this way. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] put an end to this injustice, and sought to make good the injuries inflicted.\n\nFor several years after Schimonsky's death the see remained vacant. It was eventually filled by the election, through government influence, of Count [[Leopold von Sedlnitzky]] (1836\u201340). Prince-Bishop von Sedlnitzky was neither clear nor firm in his maintenance of the doctrines of the Church; on the question of [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s, which had become one of great importance, he took an undecided position. At last, upon the demand of [[Pope Gregory XVI]], he resigned his see in 1840. He went afterwards to Berlin, where he was made a privy-councillor, and where he became a Protestant in 1862. In 1871 he died in Berlin and was buried on the Protestant cemetery in Rankau (today's R\u0119k\u00f3w, a part of [[Sob\u00f3tka]]).\n\n[[File:Knauer.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop Joseph Knauer, 49th bishop on the see]] The dean of the cathedral, Dr. Ritter, administered the diocese for several years until the election Joseph Knauer (1843\u201344), before [[Grand Dean]] of the Silesian County of Glatz within the Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. The new prince-bishop, who was 79&nbsp;years old, lived only a year after his appointment.\n\nHis successor was Melchior, Freiherr von Diepenbrock (1845\u201353). This episcopate was the beginning of a new religious and ecclesiastical life in the diocese. During the revolutionary period the prince-bishop not only maintained order in his see, which was in a state of ferment, but was also a supporter of the government. He received unusual honours from the king and was made a cardinal by the Pope. He died 20 January 1853, at the [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] and was buried in the Breslau cathedral.\n\nHis successor, [[Heinrich F\u00f6rster]] (1853\u201381), carried on his work and completed it. Prince-Bishop F\u00f6rster gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and schools. The strife that arose between the Church and the State brought his labours in the Prussian part of his diocese to an end. He was deposed by the State and was obliged to leave Breslau and retire to the Austrian Silesian castle of Johannisberg where he died, 20 October 1881; he was buried in the cathedral at Breslau.\n\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] appointed as his successor in the disordered diocese Robert Herzog (1882\u201386), who had been ''Prince-Episcopal Delegate for Brandenburg and Pomerania'' and provost of [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral|St. Hedwig's]] in Berlin. Prince-Bishop Herzog made every endeavour to bring order out of the confusion into which the quarrel with the State during the immediately preceding years had thrown the affairs of the diocese. Unfortunately, his episcopate was but of short duration; he died after a long illness, 26 December 1886.\n\nThe Holy See appointed as his successor a man who had done much to allay the strife between Church and State, the [[Bishop of Fulda]], [[Georg von Kopp|Georg Kopp]]. Prince-Bishop Kopp was born in 1837, at [[Duderstadt]] in the [[Diocese of Hildesheim]]; he was ordained to the priesthood (1862); consecrated and installed Bishop of Fulda in 1881; transferred to Breslau and installed 20 October 1887; later created a cardinal (1893).\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAccording to the census of 1 December 1905, the German part of Breslau diocesan area, including the prince-episcopal delegation, comprised 3,342,221 Catholics; 8,737,746 Protestants; and 204,749 Jews. It was the richest German diocese by revenues and [[offertories]]. There were actively employed in the diocese 1,632 secular, and 121 regular, priests. The cathedral chapter included the two offices of provost and dean, and had 10 regular, and 6 honorary, canons.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was divided into 11 commissariates and 99 [[archipresbyterate]]s, in which there were 992 cures of various kinds (parishes, curacies, and stations), with 935 parish churches and 633 dependent and mother-churches. Besides the theological faculty of the [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]] in Breslau, the diocese possessed, as episcopal institutions for the training of the clergy, 5 preparatory seminaries for boys, 1 home (recently much enlarged) for theological students attending the university, and 1 [[seminary]] for priests in Breslau.

However, the ecclesiastical affiliation remained unchanged, the Breslau diocese, a cross-border bilateral bishopric since 1742 between \u2013 at last \u2013 Germany and Austro-Hungary, thus turned into a trilateral Czechoslokian-German-Polish bishopric. Since 1770 the prince-bishop had appointed separate [[vicars general]] for the Bohemian (or Austrian, since 1918 partially Czechoslovakian and Polish, resp.) part of the diocese. Also the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Dioceses of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Olomouc|of Olomouc]] comprised cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakian Bohemia and smaller parts in German Silesia (Hradec Kr. diocese: [[Bad Altheide]], [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]], [[Habelschwerdt]] and [[Neurode]]; Olomouc archdiocese: [[Branice|Branitz]], [[Kietrz|Katscher]], [[Leobsch\u00fctz]] and [[Owsiszcze|Owsch\u00fctz]]). So also the Roman Catholic parishes in Czechoslovakian T\u011b\u0161\u00edn Silesia remained part of Breslau diocese.\n\nFollowing the ''German-Polish Accord on East Silesia'',<ref>[https://archive.is/20120802065927/http://www.bundesarchiv.de/foxpublic/B19017D80A0622120000000060376978/frame.jsp?detail=findmittelinfo.html&oben=findmittelinfo_oben.html Cf.

On 7 November 1922 the Holy See disentangled the Catholic parishes in the new voivodeship from the Breslau diocese and subordinated them to an [[Apostolic Administrator]] on 17 December the same year. On 28 October 1925 [[Pope Pius XI]] elevated that apostolic administration to the new [[diocese of Katowice]] with Bishop [[August Hlond]], then a suffragan of [[Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]], by the papal Bull ''Vixdum Poloniae Unitas''.\n\nAccording to the ''Prussian [[Concordat]]'' of 1929 the prior exempt Bishopric of Breslau was elevated to the rank of archdiocese in 1930 and was henceforth known as the '''Archbishopric of Breslau''', then supervising the ''Eastern German [[ecclesiastical province|Ecclesiastical Province]]'' comprising Breslau proper and three [[suffragan]]s, to wit the new [[diocese of Berlin]], comprising the former [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]], the formerly exempt [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Ermland (Warmia)]] and the new [[Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl]].\n\n===Within Poland (main part), Czechoslovakia and East Germany (lesser parts)===\nAfter World War II, the city of Breslau was made part of Poland in 1945 and officially renamed Wroc\u0142aw. In 1972 the Archbishopric of Breslau was also renamed to the Archbishopric of Wroc\u0142aw, but still known as Vratislavia in the Latin of Rome. On 21 June 1945 [[Archbishop]] Cardinal [[Adolf Bertram]], while staying in the episcopal [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] in Czechoslovak [[Javorn\u00edk (Jesen\u00edk District)|Javorn\u00edk (Jauernig)]], appointed [[Franti\u0161ek Onderek]] (1888\u20131962) as [[vicar general]] for the Czechoslovak part of the archdiocese. Bertram died on 6 July 1945 in Johannisberg castle in Czechoslovakia, supposedly due to the Polish demands upon him (an ethnic German, who, however, had pleaded for German-Polish reconciliation during the time of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pi\u0142sudski]]'s regime). Expelled deported German ex-Silesians, from [[West Germany]], have since ca. 1946 entertained claims, that Bertram was actually killed or brought near to death by Polish \"imperialists\" inside the Catholic Church of Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOn 16 July the archdiocesan [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]], still comprising nine members, elected the Polish-speaking Ferdinand Piontek as [[capitular vicar]], whom the [[Gestapo]] had banned from Breslau in early February 1945. On his return to the town he was sworn in by the chapter on 23 July. On 12 August 1945 Cardinal [[August Hlond]] appeared and demanded Piontek to resign from his office for the archdiocesan territory east of the [[Oder-Nei\u00dfe line]], claiming to act on the authority of papal mandates, however, only applying to the pre-war territory of Poland.\n\nSo Piontek \u2013 not knowing of the restricted mandate \u2013 resigned for the Polish-held parts of the archdiocese, but not for the remaining parts in Czechoslovakia and Allied occupied Germany. Hlond divided the Polish-held archdiocesan area into the three administrative districts of [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]], [[Opole]], and Wroc\u0142aw proper and appointed a [[diocesan administrator]] for each of them on 15 August, with effect of 1 September.

In order to strengthen Piontek's position Pius XII granted him the rights of a residing bishop on 28 February 1946. However, on 9 July the Polish authorities expelled Piontek and he stranded in [[Peine]], then British zone of occupation.

This also included big parts of the [[suffragan]] [[diocese of Berlin]], except of its areas east of the Oder-Nei\u00dfe line. However, the territory of the other suffragans, the [[Bishopric of Ermland (1772-1945)|diocese of Ermland/Warmia]] had come under Polish and Soviet rule, respectively, and the Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl had become Polish.\n\nIn 1947 Piontek returned to the archdiocesan territory west of Oder-Nei\u00dfe line (then part of [[Soviet occupation zone]]) and officiated as capitular vicar at the local branch of the archdiocesan [[ordinariate]] in Silesian [[G\u00f6rlitz]], built up since October 1945. Despite the anticlerical Soviet policy he managed to build up a new [[seminary]] in [[Neuzelle]] in 1948, after the old seminary in Poland was inaccessible for candidates from west of the new border. In 1953 Pius XII invested Piontek with the right to bear a [[crosier]] and bestow episcopal [[blessing]]s. On 23 May 1959 Piontek became titular bishop of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]].\n\nThe Holy See refused to acknowledge Polish Catholic Church claims, however, and only appointed auxiliary bishops to the Archdiocese of [[Krak\u00f3w]] in order to serve the Poles, who settled in Silesia or who went there to colonize. Legally the archdiocese was still considered part of the German ''[[Fulda Conference]] of Catholic Bishops'' inside Germany of the borders of 31 December 1937. In 1951, when the [[Holy See]] \u2013 similar to [[West Germany]] \u2013 still asserted that Silesia would be returned to Germany at a near date, the Holy See appointed Theodor Bensch (1903\u20131958), titular bishop of Tabuda, as auxiliary bishop of Breslau, also responsible for the Polish part of the diocese of Berlin.\n\n===Within Poland since 1972===\n[[File:Kominek1.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Boles\u0142aw Kominek, 2nd Archbishop (first postwar) of Wroc\u0142aw]] On 28 June 1972, however, \u2013 in response to West Germany's change in [[Ostpolitik]] \u2013 [[Pope Paul VI]] redrew the archdiocesan boundary along the post-war borders.

From its founding as a [[Diocese|bishopric]] in 1000 until 1821, it was under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]]. From 1821 to 1930 it was subjected directly to the [[Apostolic See]]. Between 1821 and 1972 it was officially known as '''(Arch)Diocese of Breslau'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early medieval era===\nChristianity was first introduced into [[Silesia]] by missionaries from [[Moravia]] and [[Bohemia]]. After the conversion of Duke [[Mieszko I]] of Poland and the conquest of Silesia, the work of bringing the people to the new faith went on more rapidly. Up to about the year 1000 Silesia had no bishop of its own, but was united with neighbouring dioceses. In this way, the connection of Silesia with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] continued. The upper part of the [[Oder River]] formed the boundary of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131138)|Kingdom of Poland]]. All the territory which is now Silesia \u2013 lying on the right-hand bank of the Oder \u2013 belonged, therefore, to the [[Diocese of Pozna\u0144]], which was [[suffragan]] to the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]]. This part of Silesia was thus under the jurisdiction of a priest named Jordan who was appointed first Bishop of Pozna\u0144 in 968. The part of Silesia lying on the left bank of the Oder belonged to the territory included in then [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and was consequently within the diocesan jurisdiction of [[Prague]]. The [[Bishopric of Prague]], founded in 973, was suffragan to the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].\n\nDuke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], the son of Mieszko, obtained the Bohemian part of Silesia during his wars of conquest, and a change in the ecclesiastical dependence of the province followed. By a patent of Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in 995, Silesia was attached to the [[Bishopric of Meissen]], which, like Pozna\u0144, was suffragan to the Archbishopric of Magdeburg. Soon after this emperor Otto and Boles\u0142aw, who had pledged allegiance to the emperor, then ruled the entirety of Silesia, founded the Diocese of Wroc\u0142aw, which, together with the Bishoprics of [[Bishopric of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Bishopric of Ko\u0142obrzeg|Ko\u0142obrzeg]], was placed under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]], founded by Otto in 1000 during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]. The first Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw is said to have been named [[Jan (bishop of Wroc\u0142aw)|Johannes]], but nothing more than this is known of him, nor is there extant any official document giving the boundaries of the diocese at the time of its erection. However, they are defined in the Bulls of approval and protection issued by [[Pope Adrian IV]], 23 April 1155, and by [[Pope Innocent IV]], 9 August 1245.\n\nThe powerful Polish ruler Boles\u0142aw I was succeeded by his son [[Mieszko II Lambert]], who had but a short reign. After his death a revolt against Christianity and the reigning family broke out, the new Church organization of Poland disappeared from view, and the names of the Bishops of Wroc\u0142aw for the next half century are unknown. [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]], the son of Mieszko, and his mother were driven out of the country, but through German aid they returned, and the affairs of the Church were brought into better order. A Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw from probably 1051 to 1062 was Hieronymus, said by later tradition to have been a [[Rome|Roman]] nobleman. He was followed by Johannes I (1062\u201372), who was succeeded by Petrus I (1071\u20131111). During the episcopate of Petrus, Count Peter Wlast entered upon that work of founding churches and monasteries which has preserved his name. Petrus was followed by: \u017byros\u0142aw I (1112\u201320); Heimo (1120\u201326), who welcomed [[Otto of Bamberg]] to Wroc\u0142aw in May, 1124, when the saint was on his missionary journey to Pomerania; Robert I (1127\u201342), who was [[List of Roman Catholic bishops of Krak\u00f3w|Bishop of Krak\u00f3w]]; Robert II (1142\u201346); and Johannes II (1146\u201349), who became Archbishop of Gniezno.\n\n===Silesian duchies (Poland's fragmentation)===\nWith the episcopate of Bishop Walter (1149\u201369) the history of the diocese of Wroc\u0142aw begins to grow clearer. [[Pope Adrian IV]], at Walter's request in 1155, took the bishopric under his protection and confirmed to it the territorial possessions of which a list had been submitted to him. Among the rights which the Pope then confirmed was that of jurisdiction over the lands belonging to the castle of [[Otmuch\u00f3w]] (Ottmachau) which had been regarded as the patrimony of the diocese from its foundation. In 1163 the sons of the exiled Polish duke [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II the Exile|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] returned from the Empire and, through the intervention of Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]], received as an independent duchy the part of Silesia which was included at that date in the see of Wroc\u0142aw. Bishop Walter built a new, massively constructed cathedral, in which he was buried. \u017byros\u0142aw II (1170\u201398) encouraged the founding of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery of [[Lebus]] by Duke [[Boles\u0142aw I the Tall]]. In 1180 \u017byros\u0142aw took part in the national assembly at [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] at which laws for the protection of the Church and its property were promulgated. Jaros\u0142aw (1198\u20131201), the oldest son of Duke Boles\u0142aw, and Duke of [[Opole|Oppeln]], was the first prince to become Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw (see [[prince-bishop]]).\n\nCyprian (1201\u20137) was originally Abbot of the [[Premonstratensian]] monastery of St. Vincent near Wroc\u0142aw, then [[Bishop of Lebus]], and afterwards Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw. During Cyprian's episcopate Duke Heinrich I and his wife, [[Hedwig of Andechs|St. Hedwig]], founded the [[Cistercian convent at Trebnitz]]. The episcopate of Bishop Lorenz (1207\u201332) was marked by his efforts to bring colonies of Germans into the church territories, to effect the cultivation of waste lands. This introduction of German settlers by the bishop was in accordance with the example set by Heinrich I and St. Hedwig. The monasteries of the [[Augustinian Canons]], [[Premonstratensians]] and [[Cistercian]]s took an active part in carrying out the schemes of the rulers by placing great numbers of Germans, especially [[Thuringians]] and [[Franconia]]ns, on the large estates that had been granted them.\nOne of the most noted bishops of the diocese, Thomas I (1232\u201368), continued the work of German colonization with so much energy that even the marauding incursions of the [[Mongols]] (1241) made but a temporary break in the process. As German colonization in Silesia increased the city of Wroc\u0142aw began to be known by the German name of Breslau, leading to the diocese also becoming called the Bishopric of Breslau. Thomas's defence of the rights of the Church involved him in bitter conflicts with Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]]. Thomas began the construction of the present cathedral, the chancel being the first part erected. St. Hedwig died during his episcopate; and he lived until the process of her canonization was completed, but died before the final solemnity of her elevation to the altars of the Catholic Church. After Thomas I, Ladislaus, a grandson of Saint Hedwig, and [[Archbishop of Salzburg]], was Administrator of the Diocese of Breslau until his death in 1270.\n\nHe was followed by Thomas II (1270\u201392), who was involved for years in a violent dispute with Duke [[Henryk IV Probus|Henry IV]] as to the prerogatives of the Church in Silesia. In 1287 a reconciliation was effected between them at [[Regensburg]], and in 1288 the duke founded the collegiate church of the Holy Cross at Breslau. Before his death, on the Eve of St. John in 1290, the duke confirmed the rights of the Church to sovereignty over the territories of [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]] and Ottmachau. Thomas II consecrated the high altar of the cathedral; he was present at the [[First Council of Lyon]] (1274) and in 1279 held a diocesan synod. Johann III Romka (1292\u20131301), belonged to the Polish party in the [[cathedral chapter]]. His maintenance of the prerogatives of the Church brought him, also, into conflict with the temporal rulers of Silesia; in 1296 he called a synod for the defence of these rights.\n\nIn the election of Heinrich I of W\u00fcrben (1302\u201319), the German party in the cathedral chapter won, but this victory cost the new bishop the enmity of the opposing faction. He was made guardian of the youthful Dukes of Breslau, and this appointment, together with the factional disputes, led to the bringing of grave accusations against him. The researches of more recent times have proved the groundlessness of these attacks. He was kept in [[Avignon]] a number of years by a suit before the [[Curia]] which was finally settled in his favour. Notwithstanding the troubles of his life he was energetic in the performance of his duties. He carried on the construction of the cathedral, and in 1305 and 1316 held diocesan synods. The office of [[Auxiliary Bishop]] of Breslau dates from his episcopate. After his death a divided vote led to a vacancy of the see. The two candidates, Weit and Lutold, elected by the opposing factions, finally resigned, and [[Pope John XXII]] transferred Nanker of [[Krak\u00f3w]] to Breslau (1326\u201341).\n\n===Within Bohemia===\n\nThe constant division and subdivision of Silesian territory into small principalities for the members of the ruling families resulted in a condition of weakness that necessitated dependence on a stronger neighbour, and Silesia thus came under the control of Bohemia (first between 1289\u20131306; definitely from 1327 onwards), which itself was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A quarrel broke out between Bishop Nanker and the suzerain of Silesia, King [[John I of Bohemia]], when the king seized the castle of [[Milicz|Militsch]] which belonged to the cathedral chapter. The bishop excommunicated the king and those members of the Council of Breslau who sided with him. On account of this he was obliged to flee from Breslau and take refuge in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], where he died.\n\n[[File:Preczlaus de Pogrella.png|thumb|120px|right|Przec\u0142aw of Pogarell, 20th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nPrzec\u0142aw of Pogarell (1341\u20131376) was elected bishop while pursuing his studies at [[Bologna]], and was consecrated bishop at [[Avignon]]. Through his friendship with Charles, the son of King John, he was soon able to settle the discord that had arisen under his predecessor. The diocese prospered greatly under his rule. He bought the Duchy of [[Grodk\u00f3w]] (Grottkau) from Duke Boles\u0142aw of [[Brzeg|Brieg]] and added it to the episcopal territory of Neisse. The Bishops of Breslau had, therefore, after this the titles of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince) of Neisse and Duke of Grottkau, and took precedence of the other Silesian rulers who held principalities in fief.\n\nEmperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] wished to separate Breslau from the [[Archdiocese of Gniezno]] and to take make it a suffragan of the newly erected [[Archbishopric of Prague]] (1344), but the plan failed, owing to the opposition of the Archbishop of Gniezno. Przec\u0142aw added to the cathedral the beautiful Lady Chapel, in which he was buried and where his tomb still exists. Dietrich, dean of the cathedral, who was elected as successor to Przec\u0142aw, could not obtain the papal confirmation, and the [[Bishop of Olomouc]] (Olm\u00fctz), who was chosen in his place, soon died. After a long contest with Charles, Bishop Wenzel of Lebus, Duke of [[Legnica|Liegnitz]], was transferred to Breslau (1382\u20131417). The new bishop devoted himself to repairing the damage<!-- ??? What damage exactly? It should be more specificated. --> inflicted on the Church in Silesia by the actions of Charles. He held two synods, in 1410 and 1415, with the object of securing a higher standard of ecclesiastical discipline; and he settled the right of inheritance in the territory under his dominion by promulgating the church decree called \"Wenzel's law\". Resigning his bishopric in 1417, Wenzel died in 1419.\n\nThe episcopate of Conrad, Duke of [[Ole\u015bnica]] (Oels), the next bishop (1417\u201347), fell in the trying time for Silesia of the [[Hussite wars]]. Conrad was placed at the head of the Silesian confederation which was formed to defend the country against hostile incursions. In 1435 the bishop issued a decree of which the chief intent was to close the prebends in the diocese of Breslau to foreigners, and thus prevent the Poles from obtaining these offices. The effort to shut out the Polish element and to loosen the connection with [[Gniezno]] was not a momentary one; it continued, and led gradually to a virtual separation from the Polish archdiocese some time before the formal separation took place. The troubles of the times brought the bishop and the diocese into serious pecuniary difficulties, and in 1444 Conrad resigned, but his resignation was not accepted, and he resumed his office. In 1446 he held a diocesan synod and died in the following year.\n[[File:Biskup Piotr Nowak.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Peter Nowak, 23rd Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nConrad's successor was the provest of the cathedral of Breslau, Peter II Nowak (1447\u201356). By wise economy Bishop Peter succeeded in bringing the diocesan finances into a better condition and was able to redeem the greater part of the church lands which his predecessor had been obliged to mortgage. At the diocesan synod of 1454 he endeavoured to suppress the abuses that had arisen in the diocese.\n\n[[File:Jodok z Ro\u017cemberku.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Jo\u0161t of Ro\u017emberk, 24th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nJodokus (Jo\u0161t) of Rosenberg (1456\u201367) was a [[Bohemian]] nobleman and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Knights of St. John]]. His love of peace made his position a very difficult one during the fierce ecclesiastic-political contention that raged between the [[Hussite]] King of Bohemia, [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], and the people of Breslau, who had taken sides with the German party. Jodokus was followed by a bishop from the region of the [[Rhine]], Rudolf von R\u00fcdesheim (1468\u201382). As [[papal legate]], Rudolf had become popular in Breslau through his energetic opposition to George of Podebrady; for this reason the cathedral chapter requested his transfer from the small [[Diocese of Lavant]] in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], after he had confirmed their privileges. From this time these privileges were called \"the Rudolfian statutes\". Under his leadership the party opposed to Podebrady obtained the victory, and Rudolf proceeded at once to repair the damage which had been occasioned to the Church during this strife; mortgaged church lands were redeemed; in 1473 and 1475 diocesan synods were held, at which the bishop took active measures in regard to church discipline.\n[[File:JanRoth.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Johann IV. Roth, 26th Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\nAs coadjutor, he had selected a [[Swabians|Swabian]], Johann IV Roth, [[Bishop of Lavant]], a man of humanistic training. Urged by King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of [[Hungary]], to whom Silesia was then subject, the cathedral chapter, somewhat unwillingly, chose the coadjutor as bishop (1482\u20131506). His episcopate was marked by violent quarrels with the cathedral chapter. But at the same time he was a promoter of art and learning, and strict in his conception of church rights and duties. He endeavoured to improve the spiritual life of the diocese by holding a number of synods. Before he died the famous worker in bronze, [[Peter Vischer of Nuremberg]], cast his monument, the most beautiful bishop's tomb in Silesia. His coadjutor with right of succession was Johann V (1506\u201320), a member of the noble [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] family of [[Thurzo]]. Johann V took an active part in the intellectual life of the time and sought at the diocesan synods to promote learning and church discipline, and to improve the schools. On the ruins of the old stronghold of [[Jauernig]] he built the castle called [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|Johannisberg]], later the summer residence of the Prince-Bishop of Breslau.\n\nThe religious disturbances of the 16th century began to be conspicuously apparent during this episcopate, and soon after Johann's death Protestantism began to spread in Silesia, which belonged to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] since 1526. Princes, nobles, and town councils were zealous promoters of the new belief; even in the episcopal principality of [[Neisse-Grottkau]] Protestant doctrines found approval and acceptance. The successors of Johann V were partly responsible for this condition of affairs. Jacob von Salza (1520\u201339) was personally a stanch adherent of the Church; yet the gentleness of his disposition caused him to shrink from carrying on a war against the powerful religious movement that had arisen. To an even greater degree than Jacob von Salza his successor, Balthasar von Promnitz (1539\u201363), avoided coming into conflict with Protestantism. He was more friendly in his attitude to the new doctrine than any other Bishop of Breslau. Casper von Logau (1562\u201374) showed at first greater energy than his predecessor in endeavouring to compose the troubles of his distracted diocese, but later in his episcopate his attitude towards Lutheranism and his slackness in defending church rights gave great offence to those who had remained true to the Faith. These circumstances make the advance of Protestantism easy to understand. At the same time it must be remembered that the bishops, although also secular rulers, had a difficult position in regard to spiritual matters. At the assemblies of the nobles, and at the meetings of the diet, the bishops and the deputies of the cathedral chapter were, as a rule, the only Catholics against a large and powerful majority on the side of Protestantism. The [[Habsburg]] suzerains, who lived far from Silesia (in Vienna or Prague), and who were constantly preoccupied by the danger of a [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turkish invasion]], were not in a position to enforce the edicts which they issued for the protection of the Church.\n\nThe Silesian clergy had in great measure lost their high concept of the priestly office, although there were honourable exceptions. Among those faithful were the majority of the canons of the cathedral of Breslau; they distinguished themselves not only by their learning, but also by their religious zeal. It was in the main due to them that the diocese did not fall into spiritual ruin. The chapter was the willing assistant of the bishops in the reform of the diocese. Martin von Gerstmann (1574\u201385) began the renovation of the diocese, and the special means by which he hoped to attain the desired end were: the founding of a seminary for clerics, visitations of the diocese, diocesan synods, and the introduction of the Jesuits.\n\nHis successor, Andreas von Jerin (1585\u201396), a Swabian who had educated at the German College at Rome, followed in his footsteps. At the diocesan synod of 1592 he endeavoured to improve church discipline. Besides his zeal in elevating the life of the Church, he was also a promoter of the arts and learning. The silver altar with which he adorned his cathedral still exists, and he brought the schools in the principality of Neisse into a flourishing condition. The bishop also rendered important services to the emperor, as [[papal legate|legate]] at various times.\n\nBonaventura Hahn, elected in 1596 as the successor of Andreas von Jerin, was not recognized by the emperor and was obliged to resign his position. The candidate of the emperor, Paul Albert (1599\u20131600), occupied the see only one year. Johann VI (1600\u20138), a member of a noble family of Silesia named von Sitsch, took more severe measures than his predecessors against Protestantism, in the hope of checking it, especially in the episcopal principality of Neisse-Grottkau.\n\nBishop Charles (1608\u201324), an Archduke of Austria, had greater success than his predecessor after the first period of the [[Thirty Years' War]] had taken a turn favourable to Austria and the Catholic party. Charles wanted to move under protection of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], hoping to avoid participation in the war which was ravaging the Holy Roman Empire. As Charles's bishopric was nominally subordinated to the Polish Archbishopric of Gniezno, he asked the archbishop of Gniezno for mediation in talks with King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] of Poland about protection and subordination of his bishopric. In May 1619, Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw (the future King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]]), invited by his uncle Charles, left [[Warsaw]] and started a trip to Silesia. During talks with W\u0142adys\u0142aw in mid-1619, the Habsburgs promised to agree to a temporary occupation of part of Silesia by Polish forces, which the unsuccessfully Vasas hoped would later allow the incorporation of those areas into Poland.\n\nIn July 1619 Czech Protestants rebelled against King [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and offered the Bohemian crown to [[Prince-elector|Elector]] [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]. On 27 September 1619, probably on hearing the news, W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Charles left Silesia in a hurry and on 7 October 1619 arrived in Warsaw. In December 1619, young W\u0142adys\u0142aw's brother, Prince [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Opole]] was chosen by Charles as auxiliary bishop of Wroc\u0142aw, which was confirmed by the Polish episcopate. The [[Battle of the White Mountain]] (1620) broke the revolt in Bohemian Crown (i.e. including the opposition of the Protestants of Silesia). The Bishopric of Breslau returned to the rule of the Archbishopric of Gniezno in 1620, having before been practically independent. Bishop Charles began the restoration of the principality of Neisse to the Catholic faith. The work was completed by his successor, Charles Ferdinand, Prince of Poland (1625\u201355), who spent most of his time in his own country, but appointed excellent administrators for the diocese, such as the Coadjutor-Bishop Liesch von Hornau, and Archdeacon Gebauer. Imperial commissioners gave back to the Catholic Church those church buildings in the chief places of the principalities which had become the property of the sovereign through the extinction of vassal families. Until 1632 ''de facto'' rule was held in Warsaw by King Sigismund III and not by the bishop or archbishop.\n\nAccording to the terms of the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]], the remaining churches, 693 in number, of such territories were secularized in the years 1653, 1654, and 1668. This led to a complete reorganization of the diocese. The person who effected it was Sebastian of Rostock, a man of humble birth who was [[vicar-general]] and administrator of the diocese under the bishops Archduke Leopold Wilhelm (1656\u201362) and Archduke Charles Joseph (1663\u201364), neither of whom lived in the territory of Breslau. After Sebastian of Rostock became bishop (1664\u201371) he carried on the work of reorganization with still greater success than before.\n\n[[File:Friedrich-Kardinal.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Friedrich of Hesse-Darmstadt, 41st Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Friedrich von Hessen-Darmstadt]], Cardinal and [[Grand Prior]] of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of St. John]], was the next Bishop of Breslau (1671\u201382). The new bishop was of Protestant origin who had become a Catholic at Rome. Under his administration the rehabilitation of the diocese went on. He beautified the cathedral and elaborated its services. For the red cap and violet almutium of the canons he substituted the red [[mozzetta]]. He was buried in a beautiful chapel which he had added to the cathedral in honour of his ancestress, St. Elizabeth of Thuringia.\n\nAfter his death the chapter presented Carl von Liechtenstein, Bishop of Olomouc, for confirmation. Their choice was opposed by the emperor, whose candidate was the [[Count Palatine]] Wolfgang of the ruling family of [[Pfalz-Neuburg]]. Count Wolfgang died, and his brother Franz Ludwig (1683\u20131732) was made bishop. The new ruler of the diocese was at the same time [[Bishop of Worms]], Grand Master of the [[German Knights]], Provost of [[Ellwangen]] and [[Elector of Trier]], and later was made [[Elector of Mainz]]. He separated the ecclesiastical administration and that of the civil tribunals, and obtained the definition, in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1699, of the extent of the jurisdiction of the vicariate-general and the consistory. In 1675, upon the death of the last reigning duke, the Silesian Duchy of [[Liegnitz-Brieg-Wohlau]] lapsed to the emperor, and a new secularization of the churches begun. But when King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] secured for the Protestants the right to their former possessions in these territories, by the Treaty of [[Altranst\u00e4dt]], in 1707, the secularization came to an end, and the churches had to be returned. The Habsburg Emperor [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] endeavoured to repair the loss of these buildings to the Catholic faith by founding the so-called Josephine vicarships.\n\n===Within Prussia (main part) and Bohemia (lesser part)===\n[[File:Schaffgotsch portrait.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]], 45th bishop on the see.]] The next prince-bishop, [[Philipp Ludwig von Sinzendorf|Philip, Count von Sinzendorf]], Cardinal and [[Bishop of Raab]] (1732\u20131747), owed his elevation to the favour of the emperor. During his episcopate, the greater part of the diocese was added to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]. King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (Frederick the Great) desired to erect a \"Catholic Vicariate\" at Berlin, to be the highest spiritual authority for the Catholics of Prussia. This would have been in reality a separation from Rome, and the project failed through the opposition of the Holy See. Bishop Sinzendorf had neither the acuteness to perceive the inimical intent of the king's scheme, nor sufficient decision of character to withstand it. The king desired to secure a successor to Sinzendorf who would be under royal influence. In utter disregard of the principles of the Church, and heedless of the protests of the cathedral chapter, he presented Count [[Philipp Gotthard von Schaffgotsch]] as coadjutor-bishop.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Sinzendorf the king succeeded in the placement of Schaffgotsch as Bishop of Breslau (1748\u201395). Although the method of his elevation caused the new bishop to be regarded with suspicion by many strict Catholics, he was zealous in the fulfilment of his duties. During the [[Seven Years' War]] he fell into discredit with Frederick on account of his firm maintenance of the rights of the Church, and the return of peace did not fully restore him to favour. In 1766 he fled to the [[Austrian Silesia|Austrian]] part of his diocese in order to avoid confinement in [[Opole|Oppeln]] which the king had decreed against him. After this Frederick made it impossible for him to rule the Prussian part of his diocese, and until the death of the bishop this territory was ruled by [[vicars Apostolic]].\n\nThe former coadjutor of von Schaffgotsch, Joseph Christian, Prince von Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Bartenstein (1795\u20131817), succeeded him as bishop. During his episcopate the temporal power of the Bishops of Breslau came to an end through the secularization, in 1810, of the church estates in Prussian Silesia \u2013 only the estates in [[Austrian Silesia]] remained to the see. The cathedral foundation, eight collegiate foundations, and over eighty monasteries were suppressed, and their property confiscated. Only those monastic institutions which were occupied with teaching or nursing were allowed to exist.\n\nBishop Joseph Christian was succeeded by his coadjutor, Emmanuel von Schimonsky. The affairs of the Catholic Church in Prussia had been brought into order by the Bull \"De salute animarum\", issued in 1821. Under its provisions the cathedral chapter elected Schimonsky, who had been administrator of the diocese, as Prince-Bishop of Breslau (1824\u20131832).\n\nThe bull disentangled Breslau diocese from Gniezno ecclesiastical province and made Breslau an [[Exemption (church)|exempt]] bishopric. The bull also reconfined the Breslau diocesan area which from then on remained unchanged until 1922. Breslau diocese then included the bulk of the Catholic parishes in the Prussian [[Province of Silesia]] with the exception of Catholic parishes in the districts of [[Racib\u00f3rz|Ratibor]] and [[Leobsch\u00fctz]], which until 1972 belonged to the [[Archdiocese of Olomouc]], and Catholic parishes in the Prusso-Silesian [[County of Klodzko|County of Glatz]], which were subject to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] within the [[Archdiocese of Prague]] until 1972. The Breslau Diocese included the Catholic parishes in the [[Duchy of Teschen]] and the Austrian part of the [[Principality of Neisse]]. The bull also assigned the Prussian-annexed parts of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dresden-Mei\u00dfen#Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen|Apostolic Prefecture of Meissen]] in [[Lower Lusatia]] (politically part of Prussian [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] since 1815<ref>This included \u2013 among others \u2013 [[Cottbus]], [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie|Crossen]], [[Guben]], [[Neuzelle]], [[Schwiebus]] and [[Z\u00fcllichau]] etc.</ref>) and eastern [[Upper Lusatia]] (to Silesia province as of 1815) to Breslau diocese.\n\nWith the exception of the districts of [[Byt\u00f3w|B\u00fctow]] and [[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg (Pommern)]], until 1922 both part of the [[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Diocese of Culm]], the rest of Brandenburg and [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania province]] were, since 1821, supervised by the [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]] ({{lang-de|link=no|F\u00fcrstbisch\u00f6fliche Delegatur f\u00fcr Brandenburg und Pommern}}, {{lang-pl|Ksi\u0105\u017c\u0119co-biskupia Delegatura Brandenburgii i Pomorza}}).\n\nSchimonsky retained for himself and his successors the title of prince-bishop, although the episcopal rule in the Principality of Neisse had ended by its secularization. However, the rank of prince-bishop later included the [[Ex officio member]]ship in the [[Prussian House of Lords]] (since 1854) and in the [[Reichsrat (Austria)#House of Lords|Austrian House of Lords]] (since 1861).\n\nSchimonsky combatted the rationalistic tendencies which were rife among his clergy in regard to celibacy and the use of Latin in the church services and ceremonies. During the episcopate of his predecessor the government had promulgated a law which was a source of much trouble to Schimonsky and his immediate successors; this was that in those places where Catholics were few in number, the parish should be declared extinct, and the church buildings given to the newly founded [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]]. In spite of the protests of the episcopal authorities, over one hundred church buildings were lost in this way. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] put an end to this injustice, and sought to make good the injuries inflicted.\n\nFor several years after Schimonsky's death the see remained vacant. It was eventually filled by the election, through government influence, of Count [[Leopold von Sedlnitzky]] (1836\u201340). Prince-Bishop von Sedlnitzky was neither clear nor firm in his maintenance of the doctrines of the Church; on the question of [[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]s, which had become one of great importance, he took an undecided position. At last, upon the demand of [[Pope Gregory XVI]], he resigned his see in 1840. He went afterwards to Berlin, where he was made a privy-councillor, and where he became a Protestant in 1862. In 1871 he died in Berlin and was buried on the Protestant cemetery in Rankau (today's R\u0119k\u00f3w, a part of [[Sob\u00f3tka]]).\n\n[[File:Knauer.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Prince-Bishop Joseph Knauer, 49th bishop on the see]] The dean of the cathedral, Dr. Ritter, administered the diocese for several years until the election Joseph Knauer (1843\u201344), before [[Grand Dean]] of the Silesian County of Glatz within the Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. The new prince-bishop, who was 79&nbsp;years old, lived only a year after his appointment.\n\nHis successor was Melchior, Freiherr von Diepenbrock (1845\u201353). This episcopate was the beginning of a new religious and ecclesiastical life in the diocese. During the revolutionary period the prince-bishop not only maintained order in his see, which was in a state of ferment, but was also a supporter of the government. He received unusual honours from the king and was made a cardinal by the Pope. He died 20 January 1853, at the [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] and was buried in the Breslau cathedral.\n\nHis successor, [[Heinrich F\u00f6rster]] (1853\u201381), carried on his work and completed it. Prince-Bishop F\u00f6rster gave generous aid to the founding of churches, monastic institutions, and schools. The strife that arose between the Church and the State brought his labours in the Prussian part of his diocese to an end. He was deposed by the State and was obliged to leave Breslau and retire to the Austrian Silesian castle of Johannisberg where he died, 20 October 1881; he was buried in the cathedral at Breslau.\n\n[[Pope Leo XIII]] appointed as his successor in the disordered diocese Robert Herzog (1882\u201386), who had been ''Prince-Episcopal Delegate for Brandenburg and Pomerania'' and provost of [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral|St. Hedwig's]] in Berlin. Prince-Bishop Herzog made every endeavour to bring order out of the confusion into which the quarrel with the State during the immediately preceding years had thrown the affairs of the diocese. Unfortunately, his episcopate was but of short duration; he died after a long illness, 26 December 1886.\n\nThe Holy See appointed as his successor a man who had done much to allay the strife between Church and State, the [[Bishop of Fulda]], [[Georg von Kopp|Georg Kopp]]. Prince-Bishop Kopp was born in 1837, at [[Duderstadt]] in the [[Diocese of Hildesheim]]; he was ordained to the priesthood (1862); consecrated and installed Bishop of Fulda in 1881; transferred to Breslau and installed 20 October 1887; later created a cardinal (1893).\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAccording to the census of 1 December 1905, the German part of Breslau diocesan area, including the prince-episcopal delegation, comprised 3,342,221 Catholics; 8,737,746 Protestants; and 204,749 Jews. It was the richest German diocese by revenues and [[offertories]]. There were actively employed in the diocese 1,632 secular, and 121 regular, priests. The cathedral chapter included the two offices of provost and dean, and had 10 regular, and 6 honorary, canons.\n\nThe prince-bishopric was divided into 11 commissariates and 99 [[archipresbyterate]]s, in which there were 992 cures of various kinds (parishes, curacies, and stations), with 935 parish churches and 633 dependent and mother-churches. Besides the theological faculty of the [[Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t]] in Breslau, the diocese possessed, as episcopal institutions for the training of the clergy, 5 preparatory seminaries for boys, 1 home (recently much enlarged) for theological students attending the university, and 1 [[seminary]] for priests in Breslau. The statistics of the houses of the religious orders in the dioceses were as follows:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Benedictines]], 1 house\n*[[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], 1\n*[[Franciscans]], 8\n*[[Jesuits]], 3\n*[[Piarists]], 1\n*[[Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God|Brothers of Mercy]], 8\n*[[Order of St. Camillus of Lellis]], 1\n*[[Redemptorists]], 1\n*[[Congregation of the Society of the Divine Word]], 1\n*[[Alexian Brothers]], 1\n*[[Poor Brothers of St. Francis]], 2\n*[[Sisters of St. Elizabeth]], 6\n*[[Magdalen Sisters]], 1\n*[[Ursulines]], 6\n*[[Sisters of the Good Shepherd]], 4\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo]], (a) from the mother-house at Trebnitz, 181, (b) from the mother-house at Trier, 5\n*[[Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]], 2\n*[[Sisters of Poor Handmaids of Christ]], 3\n*[[Sister-Servants of Mary]], 27\n*[[German Dominican Sisters of St. Catharine of Siena]], 11\n*[[Polish Province of the Sisters of Nurses Third Order Regular of St. Francis|Sisters of St. Francis]], 9\n*[[Grey Sisters of St. Elizabeth]], 169\n*[[Sisters of St. Hedwig]], 9\n*[[Sisters of Mary]], 27\n*[[Poor School-Sisters of Notre Dame]], 15\n*[[Vincentian Sisters]], 7\n*[[Sisters of the Holy Cross]], 1\n*[[Sisters of St. Joseph]], 1\n{{col-end}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0065, Kardinal Dr. Adolf Bertram.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Cardinal Adolf Bertram, elevated to first Archbishop of Breslau in 1930.]] In the above-mentioned monastic houses for men there were 512 religious; in those for women, 5,208 religious.\n\nAfter World War I the [[Duchy of Teschen]], until 1918 politically an Austro-[[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] fief and ecclesiastically a part of the Breslau diocese, was politically divided into a Czechoslovakian western and a Polish eastern part ([[Cieszyn Silesia|Cieszyn/T\u011b\u0161\u00edn Silesia]]), even dividing its capital into Czech [[\u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn|T\u011b\u0161\u00edn]] and Polish [[Cieszyn]]. However, the ecclesiastical affiliation remained unchanged, the Breslau diocese, a cross-border bilateral bishopric since 1742 between \u2013 at last \u2013 Germany and Austro-Hungary, thus turned into a trilateral Czechoslokian-German-Polish bishopric. Since 1770 the prince-bishop had appointed separate [[vicars general]] for the Bohemian (or Austrian, since 1918 partially Czechoslovakian and Polish, resp.) part of the diocese. Also the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9|Dioceses of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Olomouc|of Olomouc]] comprised cross-border diocesan territories in Czechoslovakian Bohemia and smaller parts in German Silesia (Hradec Kr. diocese: [[Bad Altheide]], [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]], [[Habelschwerdt]] and [[Neurode]]; Olomouc archdiocese: [[Branice|Branitz]], [[Kietrz|Katscher]], [[Leobsch\u00fctz]] and [[Owsiszcze|Owsch\u00fctz]]). So also the Roman Catholic parishes in Czechoslovakian T\u011b\u0161\u00edn Silesia remained part of Breslau diocese.\n\nFollowing the ''German-Polish Accord on East Silesia'',<ref>[https://archive.is/20120802065927/http://www.bundesarchiv.de/foxpublic/B19017D80A0622120000000060376978/frame.jsp?detail=findmittelinfo.html&oben=findmittelinfo_oben.html Cf.

On 7 November 1922 the Holy See disentangled the Catholic parishes in the new voivodeship from the Breslau diocese and subordinated them to an [[Apostolic Administrator]] on 17 December the same year. On 28 October 1925 [[Pope Pius XI]] elevated that apostolic administration to the new [[diocese of Katowice]] with Bishop [[August Hlond]], then a suffragan of [[Archdiocese of Krak\u00f3w|Krak\u00f3w]], by the papal Bull ''Vixdum Poloniae Unitas''.\n\nAccording to the ''Prussian [[Concordat]]'' of 1929 the prior exempt Bishopric of Breslau was elevated to the rank of archdiocese in 1930 and was henceforth known as the '''Archbishopric of Breslau''', then supervising the ''Eastern German [[ecclesiastical province|Ecclesiastical Province]]'' comprising Breslau proper and three [[suffragan]]s, to wit the new [[diocese of Berlin]], comprising the former [[Prince-Episcopal Delegation for Brandenburg and Pomerania]], the formerly exempt [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Ermland (Warmia)]] and the new [[Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl]].\n\n===Within Poland (main part), Czechoslovakia and East Germany (lesser parts)===\nAfter World War II, the city of Breslau was made part of Poland in 1945 and officially renamed Wroc\u0142aw. In 1972 the Archbishopric of Breslau was also renamed to the Archbishopric of Wroc\u0142aw, but still known as Vratislavia in the Latin of Rome. On 21 June 1945 [[Archbishop]] Cardinal [[Adolf Bertram]], while staying in the episcopal [[J\u00e1nsk\u00fd vrch|castle of Johannisberg]] in Czechoslovak [[Javorn\u00edk (Jesen\u00edk District)|Javorn\u00edk (Jauernig)]], appointed [[Franti\u0161ek Onderek]] (1888\u20131962) as [[vicar general]] for the Czechoslovak part of the archdiocese. Bertram died on 6 July 1945 in Johannisberg castle in Czechoslovakia, supposedly due to the Polish demands upon him (an ethnic German, who, however, had pleaded for German-Polish reconciliation during the time of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski|Pi\u0142sudski]]'s regime). Expelled deported German ex-Silesians, from [[West Germany]], have since ca. 1946 entertained claims, that Bertram was actually killed or brought near to death by Polish \"imperialists\" inside the Catholic Church of Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nOn 16 July the archdiocesan [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]], still comprising nine members, elected the Polish-speaking Ferdinand Piontek as [[capitular vicar]], whom the [[Gestapo]] had banned from Breslau in early February 1945. On his return to the town he was sworn in by the chapter on 23 July. On 12 August 1945 Cardinal [[August Hlond]] appeared and demanded Piontek to resign from his office for the archdiocesan territory east of the [[Oder-Nei\u00dfe line]], claiming to act on the authority of papal mandates, however, only applying to the pre-war territory of Poland.\n\nSo Piontek \u2013 not knowing of the restricted mandate \u2013 resigned for the Polish-held parts of the archdiocese, but not for the remaining parts in Czechoslovakia and Allied occupied Germany. Hlond divided the Polish-held archdiocesan area into the three administrative districts of [[Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski]], [[Opole]], and Wroc\u0142aw proper and appointed a [[diocesan administrator]] for each of them on 15 August, with effect of 1 September.

However, the territory of the other suffragans, the [[Bishopric of Ermland (1772-1945)|diocese of Ermland/Warmia]] had come under Polish and Soviet rule, respectively, and the Territorial Prelature of Schneidem\u00fchl had become Polish.\n\nIn 1947 Piontek returned to the archdiocesan territory west of Oder-Nei\u00dfe line (then part of [[Soviet occupation zone]]) and officiated as capitular vicar at the local branch of the archdiocesan [[ordinariate]] in Silesian [[G\u00f6rlitz]], built up since October 1945. Despite the anticlerical Soviet policy he managed to build up a new [[seminary]] in [[Neuzelle]] in 1948, after the old seminary in Poland was inaccessible for candidates from west of the new border. In 1953 Pius XII invested Piontek with the right to bear a [[crosier]] and bestow episcopal [[blessing]]s. On 23 May 1959 Piontek became titular bishop of [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]].\n\nThe Holy See refused to acknowledge Polish Catholic Church claims, however, and only appointed auxiliary bishops to the Archdiocese of [[Krak\u00f3w]] in order to serve the Poles, who settled in Silesia or who went there to colonize. Legally the archdiocese was still considered part of the German ''[[Fulda Conference]] of Catholic Bishops'' inside Germany of the borders of 31 December 1937. In 1951, when the [[Holy See]] \u2013 similar to [[West Germany]] \u2013 still asserted that Silesia would be returned to Germany at a near date, the Holy See appointed Theodor Bensch (1903\u20131958), titular bishop of Tabuda, as auxiliary bishop of Breslau, also responsible for the Polish part of the diocese of Berlin.\n\n===Within Poland since 1972===\n[[File:Kominek1.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Boles\u0142aw Kominek, 2nd Archbishop (first postwar) of Wroc\u0142aw]] On 28 June 1972, however, \u2013 in response to West Germany's change in [[Ostpolitik]] \u2013 [[Pope Paul VI]] redrew the archdiocesan boundary along the post-war borders.

In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.<!--For this sentence only   <ref name=\"George2003\"/>  .

Also, linking to [[Earl Richardson]] will give the wrong person --> In the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], the domestic use of [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s were part of a shift for convenience.

By 1952, he was national vice-president of the IBT and was its general president between 1957 and 1971. He secured the first national agreement for teamsters' rates in 1964 with the [[National Master Freight Agreement]]. He played a major role in the growth and development of the union, which eventually became the largest (by membership) in the United States with over 2.3 million members at its peak, during his terms as its leader.\n\nHoffa became involved with [[organized crime]] from the early years of his Teamsters work; this connection continued until his disappearance in 1975. He was convicted of [[jury tampering]], attempted [[bribery]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], and [[mail fraud|mail]] and [[wire fraud]] in 1964, in two separate trials. He was imprisoned in 1967 and sentenced to 13 years. In mid-1971, he resigned as president of the union as part of a [[commutation of sentence|commutation]] agreement with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], and he was released later that year, although he was barred from union activities until 1980. Hoffa, hoping to regain support and to return to IBT leadership, unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the order.\n\nHoffa disappeared on July 30, 1975. He is believed to have been murdered by the Mafia.<ref name=\"Hoffa 1991\"/>  He was declared [[legally dead]] in 1982.\n\n==Early life and family==\n\nHoffa was born in [[Brazil, Indiana]], on February 14, 1913, to John and Viola (n\u00e9e Riddle) Hoffa.<ref name=mom/> His father, who was of German descent (now referred to as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] ancestry),<ref>{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Arthur A.|title=Hoffa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86-GAAkOIXIC|accessdate=October 27, 2014|year=1991|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0-262-19309-2|page=3|quote=Hoffa's father was a coal miner and of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) lineage.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513062457/https://books.google.com/books?id=86-GAAkOIXIC|archive-date=May 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> died in 1920 from lung disease when Hoffa was seven years old.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=John Bartlow|authorlink=John Bartlow Martin|title=Jimmy Hoffa's Hot: A Crest special|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUUYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=October 27, 2014|year=1959|publisher=[[Fawcett Publications]]|page=28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505155709/https://books.google.com/books?id=tUUYAAAAIAAJ|archive-date=May 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> His mother was of Irish ancestry.<ref name=mom>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/09/books/chapters/out-of-the-jungle.html|title=Out of the Jungle|publisher=nytimes.com|date=September 9, 2001|access-date=December 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211171134/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/09/books/chapters/out-of-the-jungle.html|archive-date=December 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The family moved to [[Detroit]] in 1924, where Hoffa was raised and lived the rest of his life. Hoffa left school at age 14 and began working full-time manual labor jobs to help support his family.\n\nHoffa married Josephine Poszywak, an 18-year-old Detroit laundry worker of [[Poland|Polish]] heritage, in [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]], [[Ohio]], on September 24, 1936; the couple had met during a non-unionized laundry workers' [[strike action]] six months earlier.<ref>Sloane, pp. 25\u201326</ref><ref name=jo/> The couple had two children: a daughter, [[Barbara Ann Crancer]], and a son, [[James P.

The workers were displeased with this situation and tried to organize a [[Trade union|union]] to better their lot. Although Hoffa was young, his courage and approachability in this role impressed fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after refusing to work for an abusive shift foreman, Hoffa left the grocery chain, in part because of his union activities. He was then invited to become an organizer with Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoffa|first=James R|title=Hoffa. The Real Story as told to Oscar Fraley|year=1975|publisher=Stein and Day|location=[[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]|page=35}}</ref>\n\n==Growth of the Teamsters==\n\nThe Teamsters union, founded in 1903, had 75,000 members in 1933. As a result of Hoffa's work with other union leaders to consolidate local union [[truck driver|trucker]] groups into regional sections, and then into a national body\u2014work that Hoffa ultimately completed over a period of two decades\u2014membership grew to 170,000 members by 1936. Three years later, there were 420,000. The number grew steadily during [[World War II]] and through the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]] to top a million members by 1951.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hoffa and the Teamsters: A Study of Union Power|author=Ralph James and Estelle James|date=1965|publisher=Van Nostrand|pages=13\u201315}}</ref>\n\nThe Teamsters organized truck drivers and warehousemen, first throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], then nationwide. Hoffa played a major role in the union's skillful use of \"quickie strikes\", [[solidarity action|secondary boycotts]], and other means of leveraging union strength at one company, to then move to organize workers, and finally to win contract demands at other companies. This process, which took several years starting in the early 1930s, eventually brought the Teamsters to a position of being one of the most powerful unions in the United States.<ref name=\"Arthur1991\">{{cite book|title=Hoffa|author=Arthur A. Sloane|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Press|date=1991}}</ref>\n\nTrucking unions in that era were heavily influenced by, and in many cases controlled by elements of, [[organized crime]]. For Hoffa to unify and expand trucking unions, he had to make accommodations and arrangements with many gangsters, beginning in the Detroit area. Organized crime influence on the IBT would expand as the union itself grew.<ref>Moldea, first edition, 1978</ref>\n\n==Hoffa's rise to power==\n\nHoffa worked to defend the Teamsters unions from raids by other unions, including the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], and extended the Teamsters' influence in the Midwestern states from the late 1930s to the late 1940s. Although he never actually worked as a truck driver, he became president of Local 299 in December 1946.<ref>Moldea, first edition, p. 44.</ref> He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwards, and advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups sometime later. During this time, Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II by successfully making a case for his union leadership skills being of more value to the nation, by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort.\n\nAt the 1952 IBT convention in [[Los Angeles]], Hoffa was selected as national vice-president by incoming president [[Dave Beck]], successor to [[Daniel J. Tobin]], who had been president since 1907. Hoffa had quelled an internal revolt against Tobin by securing Central States regional support for Beck at the convention. In exchange, Beck made Hoffa a vice-president.<ref>Sloane; Moldea, first edition, 1978, pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\nThe IBT moved its headquarters from [[Indianapolis]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], taking over a large office building in the capital in 1955. IBT staff was also enlarged during this period, with many lawyers hired to assist with contract negotiations. Following his 1952 election as vice-president, Hoffa began spending more of his time away from Detroit, either in Washington or traveling around the country for his expanded responsibilities.<ref name=\"gwu\">[http://library.gwu.edu/ead/lac0005.xml Guide to James R.

By 1952, he was national vice-president of the IBT and was its general president between 1957 and 1971. He secured the first national agreement for teamsters' rates in 1964 with the [[National Master Freight Agreement]]. He played a major role in the growth and development of the union, which eventually became the largest (by membership) in the United States with over 2.3 million members at its peak, during his terms as its leader.\n\nHoffa became involved with [[organized crime]] from the early years of his Teamsters work; this connection continued until his disappearance in 1975. He was convicted of [[jury tampering]], attempted [[bribery]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], and [[mail fraud|mail]] and [[wire fraud]] in 1964, in two separate trials. He was imprisoned in 1967 and sentenced to 13 years. In mid-1971, he resigned as president of the union as part of a [[commutation of sentence|commutation]] agreement with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], and he was released later that year, although he was barred from union activities until 1980. Hoffa, hoping to regain support and to return to IBT leadership, unsuccessfully attempted to overturn the order.\n\nHoffa disappeared on July 30, 1975. His body was never found and he was declared [[legally dead]] in 1982.\n\n==Early life and family==\n\nHoffa was born in [[Brazil, Indiana]], on February 14, 1913, to John and Viola (n\u00e9e Riddle) Hoffa.<ref name=mom/> His father, who was of German descent (now referred to as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] ancestry),<ref>{{cite book|last=Sloane|first=Arthur A.|title=Hoffa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=86-GAAkOIXIC|accessdate=October 27, 2014|year=1991|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=978-0-262-19309-2|page=3|quote=Hoffa's father was a coal miner and of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) lineage.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513062457/https://books.google.com/books?id=86-GAAkOIXIC|archive-date=May 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> died in 1920 from lung disease when Hoffa was seven years old.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martin|first=John Bartlow|authorlink=John Bartlow Martin|title=Jimmy Hoffa's Hot: A Crest special|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUUYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=October 27, 2014|year=1959|publisher=[[Fawcett Publications]]|page=28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505155709/https://books.google.com/books?id=tUUYAAAAIAAJ|archive-date=May 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> His mother was of Irish ancestry.<ref name=mom>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/09/books/chapters/out-of-the-jungle.html|title=Out of the Jungle|publisher=nytimes.com|date=September 9, 2001|access-date=December 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211171134/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/09/books/chapters/out-of-the-jungle.html|archive-date=December 11, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The family moved to [[Detroit]] in 1924, where Hoffa was raised and lived the rest of his life. Hoffa left school at age 14 and began working full-time manual labor jobs to help support his family.\n\nHoffa married Josephine Poszywak, an 18-year-old Detroit laundry worker of [[Poland|Polish]] heritage, in [[Bowling Green, Ohio|Bowling Green]], [[Ohio]], on September 24, 1936; the couple had met during a non-unionized laundry workers' [[strike action]] six months earlier.<ref>Sloane, pp. 25\u201326</ref><ref name=jo/> The couple had two children: a daughter, [[Barbara Ann Crancer]], and a son, [[James P. Hoffa]]. The Hoffas paid $6,800 in 1939 for a modest home in northwest Detroit.<ref>Moldea, first edition, p. 25; Sloane, p. 54</ref> The family later owned a simple summer lakefront cottage in [[Orion Township, Michigan|Orion Township]], [[Michigan]], north of Detroit.<ref>Sloane, p. 54</ref>\n\n==Early union activity==\n\nHoffa began union organizational work at the grassroots level through his employment as a teenager with a grocery chain, a job which paid substandard wages and offered poor working conditions with minimal job security. The workers were displeased with this situation and tried to organize a [[Trade union|union]] to better their lot. Although Hoffa was young, his courage and approachability in this role impressed fellow workers, and he rose to a leadership position. By 1932, after refusing to work for an abusive shift foreman, Hoffa left the grocery chain, in part because of his union activities. He was then invited to become an organizer with Local 299 of the Teamsters in Detroit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoffa|first=James R|title=Hoffa. The Real Story as told to Oscar Fraley|year=1975|publisher=Stein and Day|location=[[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]|page=35}}</ref>\n\n==Growth of the Teamsters==\n\nThe Teamsters union, founded in 1903, had 75,000 members in 1933. As a result of Hoffa's work with other union leaders to consolidate local union [[truck driver|trucker]] groups into regional sections, and then into a national body\u2014work that Hoffa ultimately completed over a period of two decades\u2014membership grew to 170,000 members by 1936. Three years later, there were 420,000. The number grew steadily during [[World War II]] and through the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]] to top a million members by 1951.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hoffa and the Teamsters: A Study of Union Power|author=Ralph James and Estelle James|date=1965|publisher=Van Nostrand|pages=13\u201315}}</ref>\n\nThe Teamsters organized truck drivers and warehousemen, first throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], then nationwide. Hoffa played a major role in the union's skillful use of \"quickie strikes\", [[solidarity action|secondary boycotts]], and other means of leveraging union strength at one company, to then move to organize workers, and finally to win contract demands at other companies. This process, which took several years starting in the early 1930s, eventually brought the Teamsters to a position of being one of the most powerful unions in the United States.<ref name=\"Arthur1991\">{{cite book|title=Hoffa|author=Arthur A. Sloane|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Press|date=1991}}</ref>\n\nTrucking unions in that era were heavily influenced by, and in many cases controlled by elements of, [[organized crime]]. For Hoffa to unify and expand trucking unions, he had to make accommodations and arrangements with many gangsters, beginning in the Detroit area. Organized crime influence on the IBT would expand as the union itself grew.<ref>Moldea, first edition, 1978</ref>\n\n==Hoffa's rise to power==\n\nHoffa worked to defend the Teamsters unions from raids by other unions, including the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], and extended the Teamsters' influence in the Midwestern states from the late 1930s to the late 1940s. Although he never actually worked as a truck driver, he became president of Local 299 in December 1946.<ref>Moldea, first edition, p. 44.</ref> He then rose to lead the combined group of Detroit-area locals shortly afterwards, and advanced to become head of the Michigan Teamsters groups sometime later. During this time, Hoffa obtained a deferment from military service in World War II by successfully making a case for his union leadership skills being of more value to the nation, by keeping freight running smoothly to assist the war effort.\n\nAt the 1952 IBT convention in [[Los Angeles]], Hoffa was selected as national vice-president by incoming president [[Dave Beck]], successor to [[Daniel J. Tobin]], who had been president since 1907. Hoffa had quelled an internal revolt against Tobin by securing Central States regional support for Beck at the convention. In exchange, Beck made Hoffa a vice-president.<ref>Sloane; Moldea, first edition, 1978, pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\nThe IBT moved its headquarters from [[Indianapolis]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], taking over a large office building in the capital in 1955. IBT staff was also enlarged during this period, with many lawyers hired to assist with contract negotiations. Following his 1952 election as vice-president, Hoffa began spending more of his time away from Detroit, either in Washington or traveling around the country for his expanded responsibilities.<ref name=\"gwu\">[http://library.gwu.edu/ead/lac0005.xml Guide to James R.

In 1985, his hit single \"[[Elle a les yeux revolver...]]\" reached number four on the French Singles chart and marked the beginning of his successful singing career. He stars in the television series ''[[Crossing Lines]]'' as Louis Daniel, head of an [[International Criminal Court]] police team that investigates crimes that 'cross' European borders.\n\n==Singing career==\nMarc Lavoine is a French singer born near [[Paris]]. He was labeled a heart throb at the beginning of his career and remains popular. He released his first album, ''Le Parking des Anges'', in 1985 with his song \"Elle a les yeux revolver...\" as a favorite among teens. In 1987, Lavoine released his second album ''Fabriqu\u00e9''. His single, \"Qu'est-ce que t'es belle\", was a duet with [[Les Rita Mitsouko]] leader [[Catherine Ringer]]. His third album ''Les Amours Du Dimanche'' was released in 1989, which sold 300,000 copies.\n\nIn 1992, the singles \"Paris\", also the title track of his fourth album, and \"L'Amour de trente secondes\" gained success. In 1993, Lavoine released his fifth album ''Faux R\u00eaveur''. Lavoine's sixth album ''Lavoine-Matic'', released in 1996, included the single \"C'est \u00e7a la France\", which is a song of tolerance and was awarded Best Video from the Victoire de la Musique. In 1999, his seventh album ''Septi\u00e8me Ciel'' was released, with the first single as \"Les Tournesols\"\n\nLavoine's eighth album, which did not have a title, was released in 2001.

In 2003, he released the single \"Dis-moi que l'amour\" and a live album entitled ''Olympia Deux Mille Trois''. Lavoine's ninth album ''L'Heure d'\u00e9t\u00e9'', included singles \"Je me sens si seul\", \"Toi mon amour\" and \"J'esp\u00e8re\", a duet with Belgian singer of Vietnamese descent [[Quynh Anh]].
