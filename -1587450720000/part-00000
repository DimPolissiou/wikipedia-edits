It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Ranrestar\">{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Rrloageappabh\">{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].\n\nExtensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,390&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\n[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa.

This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (''belg'') rains occur from February to April and the big (''meher'') rains from mid-June to mid-September. The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&nbsp;\u00b0C and often surpassing 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]].

Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic.

Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.

It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Ranrestar\">{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Rrloageappabh\">{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].\n\nExtensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,390&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\n[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa.

This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (''belg'') rains occur from February to April and the big (''meher'') rains from mid-June to mid-September. The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&nbsp;\u00b0C and often surpassing 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]].

Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic.

Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.

Led by General [[Sam Houston]], the [[Texian Army]] engaged and defeated General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s [[United Mexican States (1824\u20131864)|Mexican]] army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. A detailed, first-hand account of the battle was written by General Houston from Headquarters of the Texian Army, San Jacinto, on April 25, 1836.<ref>General Samuel Houston, Texian Officials, HQ of the Army, April 25, 1836 reproduced in the Daily National Intelligencer, Jun 11, 1836, Vol. XXIV, Issue 7280, p.2, Washington, DC</ref> Numerous secondary analyses and interpretations have followed.\n\n[[General Santa Anna]], the President of [[Mexico]], and General [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] both escaped during the battle. Santa Anna was captured the next day on April 22 and Cos on April 24, 1836. After being held about three weeks as a prisoner of war, Santa Anna signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the [[Republic of Texas]] to become an independent country. These treaties did not necessarily recognize Texas as a sovereign nation, but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City. In other words, Texas was de facto independent.  Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans' rallying cries from events of the war, \"Remember the [[Alamo]]!\" and \"Remember [[Goliad massacre|Goliad]]!\" became etched into Texan history and legend.\n\n==Background: December 1832 \u2013 March 1836==\n{{Main|Texas Revolution}}\n\n===The Mexican constitution is overturned===\nGeneral [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] was a proponent of governmental [[federalism]] when he helped oust Mexican president [[Anastasio Bustamante]] in December 1832.  Upon his election as president in April 1833,<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), p. 28</ref> Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office.<ref>Poyo (1996), pp. 42\u201343, \"Under the Mexican Flag\" (Andr\u00e9s Tijerina)</ref> His abrogation of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1824|Constitution of 1824]], correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico's state of ''[[Coahuila y Tejas]]'' (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian empresario [[Stephen F. Austin]] wrote to the B\u00e9xar ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (city council) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.<ref>Henderson (2008), pp. 86\u201387</ref><ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nColonel [[Juan Almonte]] was appointed Director of Colonization in Texas,<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 49, 57</ref> ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment.<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 38\u201339</ref> He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 42\u201344, 208\u2013283</ref>\n\n===Cos is appointed military governor of Texas===\nIn consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835.<ref name=\"Davis 2004, p. 143\">Davis (2004), p. 143.</ref><ref name=\"Todish et al. 1998, p. 121\">Todish ''et al.''

It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as \"pirates\", to be put to death if captured. In adding \"since they are not subjects of any nation at war with the republic nor do they militate under any recognized flag,\" Tornel avoided declaring war on the United States.<ref>Calore (2014), p. 56</ref><ref>Todish  ''et al.''

Led by General [[Sam Houston]], the [[Texian Army]] engaged and defeated General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s [[United Mexican States (1824\u20131864)|Mexican]] army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. A detailed, first-hand account of the battle was written by General Houston from Headquarters of the Texian Army, San Jacinto, on April 25, 1836.<ref>General Samuel Houston, Texian Officials, HQ of the Army, April 25, 1836 reproduced in the Daily National Intelligencer, Jun 11, 1836, Vol. XXIV, Issue 7280, p.2, Washington, DC</ref> Numerous secondary analyses and interpretations have followed.\n\n[[General Santa Anna]], the President of [[Mexico]], and General [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] both escaped during the battle. Santa Anna was captured the next day on April 22 and Cos on April 24, 1836. After being held about three weeks as a prisoner of war, Santa Anna signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the [[Republic of Texas]] to become an independent country. These treaties did not necessarily recognize Texas as a sovereign nation, but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City. In other words, Texas was de facto independent.  Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans' rallying cries from events of the war, \"[[Remember the Alamo|Remember the Alamo!]]\" and \"[[Goliad massacre|Remember Goliad!]]\" became etched into Texan history and legend.\n\n==Background: December 1832 \u2013 March 1836==\n{{Main|Texas Revolution}}\n\n===The Mexican constitution is overturned===\nGeneral [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] was a proponent of governmental [[federalism]] when he helped oust Mexican president [[Anastasio Bustamante]] in December 1832.  Upon his election as president in April 1833,<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), p. 28</ref> Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office.<ref>Poyo (1996), pp. 42\u201343, \"Under the Mexican Flag\" (Andr\u00e9s Tijerina)</ref> His abrogation of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1824|Constitution of 1824]], correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico's state of ''[[Coahuila y Tejas]]'' (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian empresario [[Stephen F. Austin]] wrote to the B\u00e9xar ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' (city council) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.<ref>Henderson (2008), pp. 86\u201387</ref><ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 30\u201331</ref>\n\nColonel [[Juan Almonte]] was appointed Director of Colonization in Texas,<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 49, 57</ref> ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment.<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 38\u201339</ref> He delivered promises of self-governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.<ref>Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 42\u201344, 208\u2013283</ref>\n\n===Cos is appointed military governor of Texas===\nIn consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General [[Mart\u00edn Perfecto de Cos]] as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835.<ref name=\"Davis 2004, p. 143\">Davis (2004), p. 143.</ref><ref name=\"Todish et al. 1998, p. 121\">Todish ''et al.''

It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as \"pirates\", to be put to death if captured. In adding \"since they are not subjects of any nation at war with the republic nor do they militate under any recognized flag,\" Tornel avoided declaring war on the United States.<ref>Calore (2014), p. 56</ref><ref>Todish  ''et al.''

After receiving word that the acting president, [[Miguel Barrag\u00e1n]], had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position.

On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], the other went to Harrisburg.

It would have been viewed as disloyalty to the crown to turn down this request, carrying much social stigma, making it difficult for Kidd to say no. The request preceded the voyage which established Kidd's reputation as a pirate and marked his image in history and [[folklore]].\n\nFour-fifths of the cost for the venture was paid for by noble lords, who were among the most powerful men in England: the [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Earl of Orford]], the Baron of Romney, the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]], and [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|Sir John Somers]]. Kidd was presented with a [[letter of marque]], signed personally by King [[William III of England]]. This letter reserved 10% of the loot for the Crown, and Henry Gilbert's ''The Book of Pirates'' suggests that the King may have fronted some of the money for the voyage himself. Kidd and his acquaintance Colonel [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] orchestrated the whole plan; they sought additional funding from a merchant named [[Blackham baronets|Sir Richard Blackham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/content/secret-agreement-between-pirate-hunters-1696 |title=A secret agreement between pirate hunters, 1696 |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]]}}</ref> Kidd also had to sell his ship ''Antigua'' to raise funds.\n\nThe new ship, ''[[Adventure Galley]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title =Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts\" \"The Real Captain Kidd| author =Frank R. Stockton| publisher =The Baldwin Online Children's Literature Project| url =http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=stockton&book=buccaneers&story=kidd| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref> was well suited to the task of catching pirates, weighing over 284 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]] and equipped with 34 [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|cannon]], oars, and 150 men. The oars were a key advantage, as they enabled ''Adventure Galley'' to manoeuvre in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. Kidd took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those whom he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.\n\n{{quote|As the Adventure Galley sailed down the [[Thames]], Kidd unaccountably failed to salute a Navy yacht at Greenwich, as custom dictated. The Navy yacht then fired a shot to make him show respect, and Kidd's crew responded with an astounding display of impudence \u2013 by turning and slapping their backsides in [disdain].<ref>Botting (1978) p.106</ref>}}\n\nBecause of Kidd's refusal to salute, the Navy vessel's captain retaliated by [[impressment|pressing]] much of Kidd's crew into [[Royal Navy|naval service]], despite rampant protests. Thus short-handed, Kidd sailed for New York City, capturing a French vessel en route (which was legal under the terms of his commission). To make up for the lack of officers, Kidd picked up replacement crew in New York, the vast majority of whom were known and hardened criminals, some undoubtedly former pirates.\n\nAmong Kidd's officers was his [[quartermaster]] [[Hendrick van der Heul]]. The quartermaster was considered \"second in command\" to the captain in pirate culture of this era. It is not clear, however, if van der Heul exercised this degree of responsibility because Kidd was nominally a privateer. Van der Heul is also noteworthy because he may have been African or of African descent. A contemporary source describes him as a \"small black Man\". If van der Heul was indeed of African ancestry, this fact would make him the highest-ranking black pirate so far identified. Van der Heul went on to become a [[master's mate]] on a merchant vessel and was never convicted of piracy.\n\n===Hunting for pirates===\nIn September 1696, Kidd [[Weigh anchor|weighed anchor]] and set course for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. A third of his crew died on the [[Comoros]] due to an outbreak of [[cholera]], the brand-new ship developed many leaks, and he failed to find the pirates whom he expected to encounter off [[Madagascar]].\n\nAs it became obvious that his ambitious enterprise was failing, Kidd became desperate to cover its costs. But, once again, he failed to attack several ships when given a chance, including a Dutchman and a New York privateer. Some of the crew deserted Kidd the next time that ''Adventure Galley'' anchored offshore, and those who decided to stay on made constant open threats of [[mutiny]].\n\n[[File:Pyle pirate relaxing2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd and his ship, ''Adventure Galley'', in [[New York Harbor]]]]\n[[File:Pyle pirates burying2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd burying treasure]]\nKidd killed one of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. Kidd's gunner William Moore was on deck sharpening a [[chisel]] when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, \"If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more.\" Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]] and died the following day.<ref>Cordingly (1995), p.183</ref>\n\nSeventeenth-century English [[admiralty law]] allowed captains great leeway in using violence against their crew, but outright murder was not permitted. Yet Kidd seemed unconcerned, later explaining to his surgeon that he had \"good friends in England, that will bring me off for that\".\n\n===Accusations of piracy===\nActs of savagery on Kidd's part were reported by escaped prisoners, who told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and \"drubbed\" (thrashed) with a drawn [[cutlass]]. On one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship ''Mary'' and tortured several of its crew members while Kidd and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in Kidd's cabin. When Kidd found out what had happened, he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nKidd was declared a pirate very early in his voyage by a Royal Navy officer, to whom he had promised \"thirty men or so\".<ref name=\"Hamilton, 1961 p\"/> Kidd sailed away during the night to preserve his crew, rather than subject them to Royal Navy [[impressment]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 30 January 1698, Kidd raised French colours and took his greatest prize, the 400-ton ''[[Quedagh Merchant]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Pirates of the High Seas \u2013 Capt.

The captain of ''Quedagh Merchant'' was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him the protection of the French Crown. After realising the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, Kidd tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but they refused, claiming that their prey was perfectly legal, as Kidd was commissioned to take French ships, and that an Armenian ship counted as French if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, Kidd relented and kept the prize. When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to \"pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices\" for the \"notorious piracies\" they had committed.<ref>Hamilton, (1961)</ref>\n\nKidd kept the French sea passes of the ''Quedagh Merchant'', as well as the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British admiralty and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep ''Quedagh Merchant'' and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman ''Adventure Prize'', he set sail for [[Madagascar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 1 April 1698, Kidd reached Madagascar. After meeting privately with trader [[Tempest Rogers]] (who would later be accused of trading and selling Kidd's looted East India goods),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Office|first1=Great Britain Public Record|title=Calendar of State Papers: Colonial Series ...|date=1908|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=486\u2013487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBQFAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> he found the first pirate of his voyage, [[Robert Culliford]] (the same man who had stolen Kidd's ship years before) and his crew aboard ''Mocha Frigate''. Two contradictory accounts exist of how Kidd reacted to his encounter with Culliford. According to ''The General History of the Pirates'', published more than 25 years after the event by an author whose identity remains in dispute, Kidd made peaceful overtures to Culliford: he \"drank their Captain's health\", swearing that \"he was in every respect their Brother\", and gave Culliford \"a Present of an Anchor and some Guns\".<ref>Charles Johnson (1728). ''The History of the Pyrates'', p. 75.</ref> This account appears to be based on the testimony of Kidd's crewmen Joseph Palmer and Robert Bradinham at his trial. The other version was presented by Richard Zacks in his 2002 book ''The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd''. According to Zacks, Kidd was unaware that Culliford had only about 20 crew with him, and felt ill-manned and ill-equipped to take ''Mocha Frigate'' until his two prize ships and crews arrived, so he decided not to molest Culliford until these reinforcements came. After ''Adventure Prize'' and ''Rouparelle'' came in, Kidd ordered his crew to attack Culliford's ''Mocha Frigate''. However, his crew, despite their previous eagerness to seize any available prize, refused to attack Culliford and threatened instead to shoot Kidd. Zacks does not refer to any source for his version of events.<ref>Zacks, p. 185-86.</ref>\n\nBoth accounts agree that most of Kidd's men now abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with ''Adventure Galley''. Deciding to return home, Kidd left the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'' behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become worm-eaten and leaky. Before burning the ship, he was able to salvage every last scrap of metal, such as hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the ''Adventure Prize''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Some of his crew later returned to America on their own as passengers aboard [[Giles Shelley]]'s ship ''Nassau''.<ref name=\"Jameson - Privateering and Piracy\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=John Franklin|title=Privateering and Piracy in the Colonial Period by J.

There is speculation that he probably would have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the [[Admiralty court|High Court of Admiralty]] in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous [[Newgate Prison]], and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nKidd had two lawyers to assist in his defence.<ref>Zacks, p. 364.</ref> He was shocked to learn at his trial that he was charged with murder. He was found guilty on all charges (murder and five counts of piracy) and sentenced to death. He was hanged in a public execution on 23 May 1701, at [[Execution Dock]], [[Wapping]], in London.<ref name=EB1911/> He was hanged two times. On the first attempt, the hangman's rope broke and Kidd survived.

Far from rewarding his loyalty, they participated in the effort to convict him by depriving him of the money and information which might have provided him with some legal defence. In particular, the two sets of French passes he had kept were missing at his trial. These passes (and others dated 1700) resurfaced in the early twentieth century, misfiled with other government papers in a London building.<ref>{{cite book| author = Ralph Delahaye Paine| title = The Book of Buried Treasure: Being a True History of the Gold, Jewels, and Plate of Pirates, Galleons, Etc., which are Sought for to this Day| url = https://books.google.com/?id=XW0iYCM4q7QC&pg=PA124| year = 1911| publisher = Heinemann| page = 124 }}</ref> These passes call the extent of Kidd's guilt into question.

The game's theme is about outcasts/outlaws, as well as rebellion against the established order/society, and portrays several individuals (mostly from fiction) that fit this theme, such as [[Arsene Lupin]], [[Pope Joan]] and [[Ishikawa Goemon]].\n\nCaptain Kidd appears in ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]''.\n\nThe 1957 children's book ''Captain Kidd's Cat'' by [[Robert Lawson (author)|Robert Lawson]] is a largely fictionalized account of Kidd's last voyage, trial and execution, told from the point of view of his loyal ship's cat. The book portrays Kidd as an innocent privateer who was framed by corrupt officials as a scapegoat for their own crimes.\n\nThe song \"Ballad of William Kidd\" by the heavy metal band [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] is based on Kidd's life, particularly the events surrounding his trial and execution.\n\nA version of \"Ballad of William Kidd\" is sung by Commander Klaes Ashford in Seasons 3 and 4 of \"The Expanse\"\n\n\"The Ballad of William Kidd\" is performed by [[Blackbeard's Tea Party]], making reference to his life throughout the song.\n\n''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'' portrays a highly fictionalized version of Captain Kidd as a pirate in the Pacific with more of an American accent than a Scottish one who comes across the [[Doraemon]] and his friends that were caught in a time distortion. The combined group finds an island with secret treasure and is being used by a business from the future for his own benefit. Eventually, the businessman is captured by the Time Patrol and Kidd continues his voyage.\n\nThe character of Ogin in the anime [[Girls und Panzer]] models herself heavily on Kidd, particularly with regard to her personality and leadership style. She is the commander of a British [[Mark IV tank]] in \"Das Finale\".\n \nThe band [[Scissorfight]] had a song called \"The Gibbeted Captain Kidd\" on their 1998 album ''[[Balls Deep (album)|Balls Deep]]''.\n\nIn the manga and anime series ''[[One Piece]]'', there is a character named Eustass \"Captain\" Kid, whose name and epithet are inspired by the real-life Captain Kidd.\n\nFour missions in [[Assassin's Creed III]] involve finding map pieces that Captain Kidd had given to four of his crew members for safekeeping. Finding all four pieces would reveal the location of Kidd's treasure, which in the Assassin's Creed series is a Piece of Eden that gives the player the ability to repel bullets.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Joseph Bradish]], a pirate who sailed in Kidd's company<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7NLrJnuzHQC&pg=PA80|title=Under the Black Flag: Exploits of the Most Notorious Pirates|last=Seitz|first=Don Carlos|date=1 March 2002|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=9780486421315|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[George Dew]], buccaneer, pirate, and privateer who briefly sailed alongside Kidd in 1691 near the [[Piscataqua River]].<ref name=\"Marley\">{{cite book|last1=Marley|first1=David|title=Pirates of the Americas|date=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara CA|isbn=9781598842012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bU6ML_VnXTwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=30 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Captain Kidd's Cannon]]\n* [[Gardiners Island]]\n* [[Oak Island]]\n* ''[[Treasure Island]]''\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book| author = Botting, Douglas | year = 1978 | title = The Pirates | location =Boston, MA| publisher = Little Brown & Company | isbn = 0316848948 | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0316848948 | access-date = 7 January 2017 }}\n* {{cite book| author = Cordingly, David | year = 1995 | title = Under The Black Flag : The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates | publisher = Harcourt Brace & Company | access-date =  }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* {{cite book| author = Hamilton, Cochran | year = 1961 | title = Pirates of the Spanish Main | edition = 1st | series = American Heritage Junior Library  | location = New York | publisher = American Heritage | isbn = 0060213469 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3iIYAAAAYAAJ | access-date = 7 January 2017 }}{{full citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n===Books===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Campbell (1853).

It would have been viewed as disloyalty to the crown to turn down this request, carrying much social stigma, making it difficult for Kidd to say no. The request preceded the voyage which established Kidd's reputation as a pirate and marked his image in history and [[folklore]].\n\nFour-fifths of the cost for the venture was paid for by noble lords, who were among the most powerful men in England: the [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Earl of Orford]], the Baron of Romney, the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]], and [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|Sir John Somers]]. Kidd was presented with a [[letter of marque]], signed personally by King [[William III of England]]. This letter reserved 10% of the loot for the Crown, and Henry Gilbert's ''The Book of Pirates'' suggests that the King may have fronted some of the money for the voyage himself. Kidd and his acquaintance Colonel [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] orchestrated the whole plan; they sought additional funding from a merchant named [[Blackham baronets|Sir Richard Blackham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/content/secret-agreement-between-pirate-hunters-1696 |title=A secret agreement between pirate hunters, 1696 |publisher=[[Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History]]}}</ref> Kidd also had to sell his ship ''Antigua'' to raise funds.\n\nThe new ship, ''[[Adventure Galley]]'',<ref>{{cite web| title =Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts\" \"The Real Captain Kidd| author =Frank R.

The oars were a key advantage, as they enabled ''Adventure Galley'' to manoeuvre in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. Kidd took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those whom he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.\n\n{{quote|As the Adventure Galley sailed down the [[Thames]], Kidd unaccountably failed to salute a Navy yacht at Greenwich, as custom dictated. The Navy yacht then fired a shot to make him show respect, and Kidd's crew responded with an astounding display of impudence \u2013 by turning and slapping their backsides in [disdain].<ref>Botting (1978) p.106</ref>}}\n\nBecause of Kidd's refusal to salute, the Navy vessel's captain retaliated by [[impressment|pressing]] much of Kidd's crew into [[Royal Navy|naval service]], despite rampant protests. Thus short-handed, Kidd sailed for New York City, capturing a French vessel en route (which was legal under the terms of his commission). To make up for the lack of officers, Kidd picked up replacement crew in New York, the vast majority of whom were known and hardened criminals, some undoubtedly former pirates.\n\nAmong Kidd's officers was his [[quartermaster]] [[Hendrick van der Heul]]. The quartermaster was considered \"second in command\" to the captain in pirate culture of this era. It is not clear, however, if van der Heul exercised this degree of responsibility because Kidd was nominally a privateer. Van der Heul is also noteworthy because he may have been African or of African descent. A contemporary source describes him as a \"small black Man\". If van der Heul was indeed of African ancestry, this fact would make him the highest-ranking black pirate so far identified. Van der Heul went on to become a [[master's mate]] on a merchant vessel and was never convicted of piracy.\n\n===Hunting for pirates===\nIn September 1696, Kidd [[Weigh anchor|weighed anchor]] and set course for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. A third of his crew died on the [[Comoros]] due to an outbreak of [[cholera]], the brand-new ship developed many leaks, and he failed to find the pirates whom he expected to encounter off [[Madagascar]].\n\nAs it became obvious that his ambitious enterprise was failing, Kidd became desperate to cover its costs. But, once again, he failed to attack several ships when given a chance, including a Dutchman and a New York privateer. Some of the crew deserted Kidd the next time that ''Adventure Galley'' anchored offshore, and those who decided to stay on made constant open threats of [[mutiny]].\n\n[[File:Pyle pirate relaxing2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd and his ship, ''Adventure Galley'', in [[New York Harbor]]]]\n[[File:Pyle pirates burying2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd burying treasure]]\nKidd killed one of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. Kidd's gunner William Moore was on deck sharpening a [[chisel]] when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, \"If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more.\" Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]] and died the following day.<ref>Cordingly (1995), p.183</ref>\n\nSeventeenth-century English [[admiralty law]] allowed captains great leeway in using violence against their crew, but outright murder was not permitted. Yet Kidd seemed unconcerned, later explaining to his surgeon that he had \"good friends in England, that will bring me off for that\".\n\n===Accusations of piracy===\nActs of savagery on Kidd's part were reported by escaped prisoners, who told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and \"drubbed\" (thrashed) with a drawn [[cutlass]]. On one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship ''Mary'' and tortured several of its crew members while Kidd and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in Kidd's cabin. When Kidd found out what had happened, he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nKidd was declared a pirate very early in his voyage by a Royal Navy officer, to whom he had promised \"thirty men or so\".<ref name=\"Hamilton, 1961 p\"/> Kidd sailed away during the night to preserve his crew, rather than subject them to Royal Navy [[impressment]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 30 January 1698, Kidd raised French colours and took his greatest prize, the 400-ton ''[[Quedagh Merchant]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Pirates of the High Seas \u2013 Capt.

The captain of ''Quedagh Merchant'' was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him the protection of the French Crown. After realising the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, Kidd tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but they refused, claiming that their prey was perfectly legal, as Kidd was commissioned to take French ships, and that an Armenian ship counted as French if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, Kidd relented and kept the prize. When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to \"pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices\" for the \"notorious piracies\" they had committed.<ref>Hamilton, (1961)</ref>\n\nKidd kept the French sea passes of the ''Quedagh Merchant'', as well as the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British admiralty and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep ''Quedagh Merchant'' and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman ''Adventure Prize'', he set sail for [[Madagascar]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 1 April 1698, Kidd reached Madagascar. After meeting privately with trader [[Tempest Rogers]] (who would later be accused of trading and selling Kidd's looted East India goods),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Office|first1=Great Britain Public Record|title=Calendar of State Papers: Colonial Series ...|date=1908|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=486\u2013487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBQFAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> he found the first pirate of his voyage, [[Robert Culliford]] (the same man who had stolen Kidd's ship years before) and his crew aboard ''Mocha Frigate''. Two contradictory accounts exist of how Kidd reacted to his encounter with Culliford. According to ''The General History of the Pirates'', published more than 25 years after the event by an author whose identity remains in dispute, Kidd made peaceful overtures to Culliford: he \"drank their Captain's health\", swearing that \"he was in every respect their Brother\", and gave Culliford \"a Present of an Anchor and some Guns\".<ref>Charles Johnson (1728). ''The History of the Pyrates'', p. 75.</ref> This account appears to be based on the testimony of Kidd's crewmen Joseph Palmer and Robert Bradinham at his trial. The other version was presented by Richard Zacks in his 2002 book ''The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd''. According to Zacks, Kidd was unaware that Culliford had only about 20 crew with him, and felt ill-manned and ill-equipped to take ''Mocha Frigate'' until his two prize ships and crews arrived, so he decided not to molest Culliford until these reinforcements came. After ''Adventure Prize'' and ''Rouparelle'' came in, Kidd ordered his crew to attack Culliford's ''Mocha Frigate''. However, his crew, despite their previous eagerness to seize any available prize, refused to attack Culliford and threatened instead to shoot Kidd. Zacks does not refer to any source for his version of events.<ref>Zacks, p. 185-86.</ref>\n\nBoth accounts agree that most of Kidd's men now abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with ''Adventure Galley''. Deciding to return home, Kidd left the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'' behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become worm-eaten and leaky. Before burning the ship, he was able to salvage every last scrap of metal, such as hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the ''Adventure Prize''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Some of his crew later returned to America on their own as passengers aboard [[Giles Shelley]]'s ship ''Nassau''.<ref name=\"Jameson - Privateering and Piracy\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=John Franklin|title=Privateering and Piracy in the Colonial Period by J.

There is speculation that he probably would have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the [[Admiralty court|High Court of Admiralty]] in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous [[Newgate Prison]], and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nKidd had two lawyers to assist in his defence.<ref>Zacks, p. 364.</ref> He was shocked to learn at his trial that he was charged with murder.

On the first attempt, the hangman's rope broke and Kidd survived.

Far from rewarding his loyalty, they participated in the effort to convict him by depriving him of the money and information which might have provided him with some legal defence.

The game's theme is about outcasts/outlaws, as well as rebellion against the established order/society, and portrays several individuals (mostly from fiction) that fit this theme, such as [[Arsene Lupin]], [[Pope Joan]] and [[Ishikawa Goemon]].\n\nCaptain Kidd appears in ''[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]''.\n\nThe 1957 children's book ''Captain Kidd's Cat'' by [[Robert Lawson (author)|Robert Lawson]] is a largely fictionalized account of Kidd's last voyage, trial and execution, told from the point of view of his loyal ship's cat. The book portrays Kidd as an innocent privateer who was framed by corrupt officials as a scapegoat for their own crimes.\n\nThe song \"Ballad of William Kidd\" by the heavy metal band [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]] is based on Kidd's life, particularly the events surrounding his trial and execution.\n\nA version of \"Ballad of William Kidd\" is sung by Commander Klaes Ashford in Seasons 3 and 4 of \"The Expanse\"\n\n''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'' portrays a highly fictionalized version of Captain Kidd as a pirate in the Pacific with more of an American accent than a Scottish one who comes across the [[Doraemon]] and his friends that were caught in a time distortion. The combined group finds an island with secret treasure and is being used by a business from the future for his own benefit. Eventually, the businessman is captured by the Time Patrol and Kidd continues his voyage.\n\nThe character of Ogin in the anime [[Girls und Panzer]] models herself heavily on Kidd, particularly with regard to her personality and leadership style. She is the commander of a British [[Mark IV tank]] in \"Das Finale\".\n \nThe band [[Scissorfight]] had a song called \"The Gibbeted Captain Kidd\" on their 1998 album ''[[Balls Deep (album)|Balls Deep]]''.\n\nIn the manga and anime series ''[[One Piece]]'', there is a character named Eustass \"Captain\" Kid, whose name and epithet are inspired by the real-life Captain Kidd.\n\nFour missions in [[Assassin's Creed III]] involve finding map pieces that Captain Kidd had given to four of his crew members for safekeeping.

To limit costs the U.S. Navy envisioned a modified P-3 with increased payload and updated avionics. This aircraft became known as the \"P-3G\" of which 125 should be procured over a period of five years up to 2001. However, the U.S. Navy was unwilling to select Lockheed's P-3G without any competition and issued the final \"Request for Proposals (RFP)\" in January 1987. For the airplane named the P-7A \"LRAACA\" (Long-Range Air ASW-Capable Aircraft), Lockheed's competitors were:\n\n* Boeing  - proposal using a modified 757<ref>{{cite magazine |work=Boeing Frontiers |title=More of 'what might have been' |url=https://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2005/september/i_history.html |volume=4 |number=5 |publication-date=September 2005 |given=Erik |surname=Simonsen}}</ref>\n* McDonnell Douglas - proposal using a modified [[MD-90]]<ref>{{cite magazine |issn=0015-3710 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1988/1988%20-%201740.PDF |work=[[Flight International]] |publication-date=July 2, 1988 |title=Lockheed woos Germany over LRAACA |page=38 |volume=134 |number=4120}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1988, the U.S. Navy announced that Lockheed won the competition,<ref name=\"LockheedWins\">{{cite magazine |issn=0015-3710 |work=[[Flight International]] |title=Lockheed wins LRAACA |publication-date=October 22, 1988 |page=3 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1988/1988%20-%203045.PDF |given=John |surname=Bailey |location=Los Angeles, California, USA |volume=134 |number=4136}}</ref> as the company's proposal was significantly cheaper than that of the competitors. The U.S. Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) recommended a full-scale development of the LRAACA on 4 January 1989. The costs were planned to be about $600 million, with a maximum cost limit of $750 million. However, in November 1989, Lockheed announced a cost overrun of $300 million due to the tight schedule and design problems. On 20 July 1990, the U.S. Navy stopped the P-7A program contract for default, \"citing Lockheed's inability to make adequate progress toward completion of all contract phases\".<ref name=\"fas.org\"/> The program was finally cancelled by the DAB in late 1990.\n\n==Design==\nThe P-7 was designed as an enlarged version of the original P-3C. The fuselage, of similar cross-section to that of the P-3, was lengthened by 2.40&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft), and the wingspan by 2.10&nbsp;m (7&nbsp;ft). The wing center section was increased in length, which moved the engines farther away from the fuselage to reduce noise levels in the cabin. The tailplane was increased by about 25% in area, but shortened in height compared to that of the P-3. The  P-7A was to be powered by four [[General Electric T407|General Electric T407-GE-400]] turboprops with 5-blade propellers.\n\nInitial plans included the Update IV electronics equipment of the P-3C. The cockpit was to be fitted with eight [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays and a stowable [[Head-up display|HUD]] for weapons delivery.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=LRAACA |archive-date=November 4, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104212403/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1980s/1989/jf89.pdf |work=Naval Aviation News |publication-date=January\u2013February 1989 |pages=20\u201321 |url-status=live |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/naval-aviation-news/back-issues/1980/1989/januaryfebruary.html |format=PDF |volume=71 |number=2 |issn=0028-1417}}</ref>  Other equipment included search radar, [[Magnetic anomaly detector|MAD]], [[Flare (countermeasure)|decoy flare launchers]], electro-optical detector, [[radar warning receiver]]s, [[Infrared countermeasures|IR suppression]] on the engine exhausts and laser deflection screens on the windows.

Development had not progressed very much before the program was cancelled in July 1990<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/21/business/disputed-lockheed-contract-is-canceled-by-navy.html|title=Disputed Lockheed Contract Is Canceled by Navy|last=Stevenson|first=Richard W.|date=1990-07-21|work=The New York Times|page=30|access-date=2018-02-22|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> as a [[cost reduction|cost-cutting]] measure following the end of the [[Cold War]].{{cn|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Development==\nIn the mid-1980s, the U.S. Navy made plans to replace the large number of Lockheed P-3 aircraft which would reach the end of their useful service lives during the 1990s. To limit costs the U.S. Navy envisioned a modified P-3 with increased payload and updated avionics. This aircraft became known as the \"P-3G\" of which 125 should be procured over a period of five years up to 2001. However, the U.S. Navy was unwilling to select Lockheed's P-3G without any competition and issued the final \"Request for Proposals (RFP)\" in January 1987. For the airplane named the P-7A \"LRAACA\" (Long-Range Air ASW-Capable Aircraft), Lockheed's competitors were:\n\n* Boeing  - proposal using a modified 757<ref>{{cite magazine |work=Boeing Frontiers |title=More of 'what might have been' |url=https://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2005/september/i_history.html |volume=4 |number=5 |publication-date=September 2005 |given=Erik |surname=Simonsen}}</ref>\n* McDonnell Douglas - proposal using a modified [[MD-90]]<ref>{{cite magazine |issn=0015-3710 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1988/1988%20-%201740.PDF |work=[[Flight International]] |publication-date=July 2, 1988 |title=Lockheed woos Germany over LRAACA |page=38 |volume=134 |number=4120}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1988, the U.S. Navy announced that Lockheed won the competition,<ref name=\"LockheedWins\">{{cite magazine |issn=0015-3710 |work=[[Flight International]] |title=Lockheed wins LRAACA |publication-date=October 22, 1988 |page=3 |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1988/1988%20-%203045.PDF |given=John |surname=Bailey |location=Los Angeles, California, USA |volume=134 |number=4136}}</ref> as the company's proposal was significantly cheaper than that of the competitors. The U.S. Defense Acquisition Board (DAB) recommended a full-scale development of the LRAACA on 4 January 1989. The costs were planned to be about $600 million, with a maximum cost limit of $750 million. However, in November 1989, Lockheed announced a cost overrun of $300 million due to the tight schedule and design problems. On 20 July 1990, the U.S. Navy stopped the P-7A program contract for default, \"citing Lockheed's inability to make adequate progress toward completion of all contract phases\".<ref name=\"fas.org\"/> The program was finally cancelled by the DAB in late 1990.\n\n==Design==\nThe P-7 was designed as an enlarged version of the original P-3C. The fuselage, of similar cross-section to that of the P-3, was lengthened by 2.40&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft), and the wingspan by 2.10&nbsp;m (7&nbsp;ft). The wing center section was increased in length, which moved the engines farther away from the fuselage to reduce noise levels in the cabin. The tailplane was increased by about 25% in area, but shortened in height compared to that of the P-3. The  P-7A was to be powered by four [[General Electric T407|General Electric T407-GE-400]] turboprops with 5-blade propellers.\n\nInitial plans included the Update IV electronics equipment of the P-3C. The cockpit was to be fitted with eight [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays and a stowable [[Head-up display|HUD]] for weapons delivery.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=LRAACA |archive-date=November 4, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041104212403/http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1980s/1989/jf89.pdf |work=Naval Aviation News |publication-date=January\u2013February 1989 |pages=20\u201321 |url-status=live |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation-history/naval-aviation-news/back-issues/1980/1989/januaryfebruary.html |format=PDF |volume=71 |number=2 |issn=0028-1417}}</ref>  Other equipment included search radar, [[Magnetic anomaly detector|MAD]], [[Flare (countermeasure)|decoy flare launchers]], electro-optical detector, [[radar warning receiver]]s, [[Infrared countermeasures|IR suppression]] on the engine exhausts and laser deflection screens on the windows.

The song was written to poke fun at the fact that many people had a hard time understanding Nirvana singer [[Kurt Cobain]]'s lyrics in the original song. After being unable to contact Nirvana by conventional means, Yankovic called Cobain while the band was on the set of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where Cobain quickly gave permission to record the parody.\n\nRecording the song was a change for Yankovic and his band. Usually, the group were forced to record several overdubs. \"Smells Like Nirvana\", however, was relatively straightforward in its musical composition. To promote the single, Yankovic created an associated video for the song that parodied the \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" video. The parody video closely mirrored the original; Yankovic even went so far as to hire several of the same actors and use the same set.\n\n\"Smells Like Nirvana\" was met with critical praise and helped to re-energize Yankovic's career. Cobain considered the parody as a sign that they had \"made it\" as a band. The song is one of Yankovic's most successful singles and was his second top 40 hit in the United States, reaching number 35 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the U.S. [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]]. The song's video was nominated for a 1992 [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video]].\n\n==Background==\nPrior to writing \"Smells Like Nirvana\", Yankovic's music career had suffered from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and [[UHF \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff|the associated soundtrack]]. Yankovic called that \"the beginning of three years where it was kind of hard for me to recover\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> He started work on a new studio album around 1990.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a [[Michael Jackson]] song, which had proven successful twice before with \"[[Eat It]]\" and \"[[Fat (song)|Fat]]\". He had composed a parody of Jackson's \"[[Black or White]]\", titled \"Snack All Night\", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song was intended to be a political statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that \"Snack All Night\" was not one of his better works.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing anything until an idea presented itself.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nThe band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] started to become a name in the music scene at the time, creating \"big, seismic shifts in pop culture\" according to Yankovic.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic felt that the band's 1991 album ''[[Nevermind]]'', which featured \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", was \"really great\", but feared that at its release the band was not popular enough to warrant a parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> By early 1992, ''Nevermind'' had reached platinum certification and led the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], which led Yankovic to start working on a parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic noted that much of the publicity around ''Nevermind'' dealt with the inability to comprehend the songs' lyrics, both in their phrasing and the manner in which they were sung by the lead vocalist Kurt Cobain. Yankovic decided to use this as the basis for his parody. Yankovic noted, \"I try not to go the obvious route all the time, but sometimes the most obvious is actually the best.\"<ref name=\"esq interview\"/> Yankovic had initial difficulty getting permission for the parody, as his manager claimed he was unable to get through to the group numerous times.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> When Yankovic learned that Nirvana would be performing on the January 11, 1992 show of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', he called his ''UHF'' co-star, [[Victoria Jackson]], at the time a regular cast member of the show. Jackson managed to give the phone to Cobain so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, though initially he inquired if the song would be about food, a common theme in many of Yankovic's songs.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/><ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes| title = Permanent Record: Al in the Box| titlelink = Permanent Record: Al in the Box| others = [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]| year = 1994| first = Barret| last = Hansen| authorlink = Dr. Demento| type = liner| publisher = [[Scotti Brothers Records]]| location = [[California]], [[United States|USA]]}}</ref> Yankovic explained that the song would be about Cobain's incomprehensible lyrics, to which Cobain replied, according to Yankovic, \"Oh, sure, of course, that's funny.\"<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/>\n\n==Recording and lyrics==\n{| style=\"font-size:80%\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" color=\"black\" width=130px\n| {{Listen|filename=Smells Like Nirvana (Sample).ogg|title=\"Smells LIke Nirvana\" (sample)|description=\"Smells Like Nirvana\", from Yankovic's 1992 album ''Off the Deep End''.

For several months after Cobain's death, Yankovic would first perform a somber tribute to Cobain prior to playing the song itself. Shortly after Cobain's death, Yankovic was scheduled to play a show in [[Seattle]], where Nirvana first became famous. Due to this connection, Yankovic was hesitant to perform the spoof, as he worried about how the audience might react to the parody. However, Yankovic was urged by journalists to go through with the performance, as they said that the song would be \"cathartic\" for the area. Ultimately, the performance \"went over extremely well\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic continues to play \"Smells Like Nirvana\" live, stating that \"Kurt was a fan of the song\" and \"he would have wanted it that way.\"<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[That '90s Show]]\", set primarily in flashback to the 1990s, [[Homer Simpson]] is shown creating one of the first [[grunge]] bands while trying to cope with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s infidelity; the band, called \"Sadgasm\", becomes highly popular. At one point, Homer writes a new song called \"Shave Me\"\u2014itself a loose parody of Nirvana's real single \"[[Rape Me]]\". Homer's song is then parodied as \"Brainfreeze\" in both song and video by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who voices himself. Homer takes Yankovic's parody as a sign that his band has become successful, but his depressed state after breaking up with Marge leaves him unable to enjoy the song's humor; he gloomily bemoans, \"He who is tired of Weird Al, is tired of life\". The sequence of events was written to parallel much of the history of \"Smells Like Nirvana\", including Kurt Cobain's reaction to the parody. Yankovic has since started using this clip in concerts before performing \"Smells Like Nirvana\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/><ref name=\"tvsquad\">{{cite web|author=Keller, Richard|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/01/27/the-simpsons-that-90s-show/|title=The Simpsons: That 90's Show|accessdate=January 18, 2008|work=[[AOLTV]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post|Huffpost TV]]}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:WeirdAlSmellsLikeNirvana.jpg|thumb|upright|right|\"Weird Al\" Yankovic performing \"Smells Like Nirvana\" in concert, dressed like Kurt Cobain.]]\nDuring live performances, Yankovic dons clothing similar to what Cobain wore in the video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\".

it was released both as a single and as part of Yankovic's ''[[Off the Deep End]]'' album in April 1992. \"Smells Like Nirvana\" was written during a three-year career low for Yankovic after the financial failure of his film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'', but captured the quickly-rising popularity of [[grunge]] and Nirvana's success. The song was written to poke fun at the fact that many people had a hard time understanding Nirvana singer [[Kurt Cobain]]'s lyrics in the original song. After being unable to contact Nirvana by conventional means, Yankovic called Cobain while the band was on the set of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where Cobain quickly gave permission to record the parody.\n\nRecording the song was a change for Yankovic and his band. Usually, the group were forced to record several overdubs. \"Smells Like Nirvana\", however, was relatively straightforward in its musical composition. To promote the single, Yankovic created an associated video for the song that parodied the \"Smells like Teen Spirit\" video. The parody video closely mirrored the original; Yankovic even went so far as to hire several of the same actors and use the same set.\n\n\"Smells Like Nirvana\" was met with critical praise and helped to re-energize Yankovic's career. Cobain considered the parody as a sign that they had \"made it\" as a band. The song is one of Yankovic's most successful singles and was his second top 40 hit in the United States, reaching number 35 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the U.S. [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]]. The song's video was nominated for a 1992 [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video]].\n\n==Background==\nPrior to writing \"Smells Like Nirvana\", Yankovic's music career had suffered from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' and [[UHF \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff|the associated soundtrack]]. Yankovic called that \"the beginning of three years where it was kind of hard for me to recover\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> He started work on a new studio album around 1990.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a [[Michael Jackson]] song, which had proven successful twice before with \"[[Eat It]]\" and \"[[Fat (song)|Fat]]\". He had composed a parody of Jackson's \"[[Black or White]]\", titled \"Snack All Night\", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song was intended to be a political statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that \"Snack All Night\" was not one of his better works.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing anything until an idea presented itself.<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nThe band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] started to become a name in the music scene at the time, creating \"big, seismic shifts in pop culture\" according to Yankovic.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic felt that the band's 1991 album ''[[Nevermind]]'', which featured \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\", was \"really great\", but feared that at its release the band was not popular enough to warrant a parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> By early 1992, ''Nevermind'' had reached platinum certification and led the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], which led Yankovic to start working on a parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic noted that much of the publicity around ''Nevermind'' dealt with the inability to comprehend the songs' lyrics, both in their phrasing and the manner in which they were sung by the lead vocalist Kurt Cobain. Yankovic decided to use this as the basis for his parody. Yankovic noted, \"I try not to go the obvious route all the time, but sometimes the most obvious is actually the best.\"<ref name=\"esq interview\"/> Yankovic had initial difficulty getting permission for the parody, as his manager claimed he was unable to get through to the group numerous times.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> When Yankovic learned that Nirvana would be performing on the January 11, 1992 show of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', he called his ''UHF'' co-star, [[Victoria Jackson]], at the time a regular cast member of the show. Jackson managed to give the phone to Cobain so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, though initially he inquired if the song would be about food, a common theme in many of Yankovic's songs.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/><ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite AV media notes| title = Permanent Record: Al in the Box| titlelink = Permanent Record: Al in the Box| others = [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]| year = 1994| first = Barret| last = Hansen| authorlink = Dr. Demento| type = liner| publisher = [[Scotti Brothers Records]]| location = [[California]], [[United States|USA]]}}</ref> Yankovic explained that the song would be about Cobain's incomprehensible lyrics, to which Cobain replied, according to Yankovic, \"Oh, sure, of course, that's funny.\"<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/>\n\n==Recording and lyrics==\n{| style=\"font-size:80%\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" color=\"black\" width=130px\n| {{Listen|filename=Smells Like Nirvana (Sample).ogg|title=\"Smells LIke Nirvana\" (sample)|description=\"Smells Like Nirvana\", from Yankovic's 1992 album ''Off the Deep End''.

It's by no means steady.\"<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Compared to previous parodies, where upwards of 20-some instruments had to be mixed together, the simpler composition of \"Teen Spirit\" made it much easier for the band to complete the song.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/>\n\nYankovic later noted that recording the song's vocals was particularly difficult, because he was singing \"for eight to 12 hours a day\", which caused strain on his vocal cords.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> For the verse where Yankovic mumbles the lyrics to the song, he placed several [[cookies]] in his mouth to achieve the garbled effect.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> During the parody's musical interlude, Yankovic [[Gargling|gargled]] water to the tune of the original's guitar solo.<ref name=solo>{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Richard|title=Weird Al in Parody Paradise; He's Hit a Nirvana With His Latest and He's Bringing It Here|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1012597.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610050506/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1012597.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=October 12, 2012|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]|date=June 26, 1992}} {{subscription required}}</ref> The solo also features [[kazoo]]s and a [[tuba]], with the latter being played by [[Tommy Johnson (tubist)|Tommy Johnson]].<ref name=players>{{cite web|title=Players|url=http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/players/|publisher=WeirdAl.com|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}</ref><ref name=billkazoo>{{cite magazine|last=Trust|first=Gary|title=Ask Billboard: When Kazoos (And Other Unusual Instruments) Ruled Radio|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/467717/ask-billboard-when-kazoos-and-other-unusual-instruments-ruled|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]].com|accessdate=October 12, 2012|date=August 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLyrically, \"Smells Like Nirvana\" pokes fun at the original song's difficult-to-understand words.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> The opening verse begins \"What is this song/All about?/Can't figure any lyrics out\".<ref name=\"ew\">{{Cite web | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310693,00.html | title = From Bad to Verse | first = Melissa | last = Rowlins | date = June 2, 1992 | accessdate = October 11, 2012 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher= [[Time, Inc.|Time, Inc]] }}</ref> At one point, Yankovic purposely garbles the lyrics: \"It's hard to ''bargle nawdle zouss''{{sic}}/With all these marbles in my mouth\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> He admitted in an interview that he woke up \"in the middle of the night\" and wrote down the phrase \"bargle nawdle zouss\", thinking that it would \"be important someday.\"<ref name=solo/>\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]], directed by Yankovic's manager Jay Levey, is a near shot-for-shot parody of the original video for \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit#Music video|Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", which depicts the band playing at a high school concert while it descends into riot. Yankovic is present on guitar and vocals as [[Kurt Cobain]], with [[Steve Jay]] on bass as [[Krist Novoselic]], and [[Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]] on drums as [[Dave Grohl]]. All three wear clothing and long-haired wigs to imitate the look of Nirvana in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Yankovic's video uses many of the same props, actors and camera angles; in particular, the video was shot in the same [[Culver City, California]] sound stage as Nirvana's video, several of the cheerleaders and audience members were from the original video, and [[Tony De La Rosa]] reprises his role as the janitor.<ref name=\"chosen rejects\">St. Thomas, p. 104</ref><ref>George-Warren et al., p. 1092</ref> Levey stated that they were able to recreate much of the same setting with help of the producers of the original Nirvana video once they were aware that the song had Cobain's blessing.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic had a brief conversation with [[Samuel Bayer]], the original director of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" in preparation for the video shoot.

For several months after Cobain's death, Yankovic would first perform a somber tribute to Cobain prior to playing the song itself. Shortly after Cobain's death, Yankovic was scheduled to play a show in [[Seattle]], where Nirvana first became famous. Due to this connection, Yankovic was hesitant to perform the spoof, as he worried about how the audience might react to the parody. However, Yankovic was urged by journalists to go through with the performance, as they said that the song would be \"cathartic\" for the area. Ultimately, the performance \"went over extremely well\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> Yankovic continues to play \"Smells Like Nirvana\" live, stating that \"Kurt was a fan of the song\" and \"he would have wanted it that way.\"<ref name=\"booklet\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[That '90s Show]]\", set primarily in flashback to the 1990s, [[Homer Simpson]] is shown creating one of the first [[grunge]] bands while trying to cope with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s infidelity; the band, called \"Sadgasm\", becomes highly popular. At one point, Homer writes a new song called \"Shave Me\"\u2014itself a loose parody of Nirvana's real single \"[[Rape Me]]\". Homer's song is then parodied as \"Brainfreeze\" in both song and video by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who voices himself. Homer takes Yankovic's parody as a sign that his band has become successful, but his depressed state after breaking up with Marge leaves him unable to enjoy the song's humor; he gloomily bemoans, \"He who is tired of Weird Al, is tired of life\". The sequence of events was written to parallel much of the history of \"Smells Like Nirvana\", including Kurt Cobain's reaction to the parody.<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/><ref name=\"tvsquad\">{{cite web|author=Keller, Richard|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/01/27/the-simpsons-that-90s-show/|title=The Simpsons: That 90's Show|accessdate=January 18, 2008|work=[[AOLTV]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post|Huffpost TV]]}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:WeirdAlSmellsLikeNirvana.jpg|thumb|upright|right|\"Weird Al\" Yankovic performing \"Smells Like Nirvana\" in concert, dressed like Kurt Cobain.]]\nDuring live performances, Yankovic dons clothing similar to what Cobain wore in the video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". This includes an electric left-handed guitar, a shirt similar to Cobain's, and a blonde wig. The costuming for the performance is critical; Schwartz explained that \"if anything's missing, Al won't do it\".<ref name=\"spin 20th\"/> The rest of Al's band also participates.
