The race was held every year from 1984 through 2007 first as a [[Champ Car|CART]] series race, then as part of [[Champ Car World Series]]. After a ten-year absence, the race returned to the IndyCar Series for the [[2018 IndyCar Series|2018 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=IndyCar racing will return to Portland International Raceway on Labor Day weekend 2018|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/index.ssf/2017/10/indycar_racing_returns_to_port.html|first=Molly|last=Blue|work=[[The Oregonian]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nPortland is best-remembered as being the site of two of the closest finishes on a [[Road racing|road course]] in [[American Championship car racing|Indy car racing]] history. In 1986, [[Michael Andretti]] lost fuel pressure on the final turn of the final lap, which allowed his father [[Mario Andretti|Mario]] to catch up and beat him to the finish line by 0.070 seconds. At the time, it was the closest finish of any race in Indy car history. In 1997, in a three-wide finish, [[Mark Blundell]] beat second place [[Gil de Ferran]] by 0.027 seconds, and beat third place [[Raul Boesel]] by 0.055 seconds. For a road course race, it was the all-time closest finish in CART series history, as well as the closest three-car finish in series history. \n\nFor nearly its entire existence, the title sponsor of the race was [[G.I. Joe's|G.I. Joe's sporting goods and auto parts]] store, and the event was held during or around the [[Portland Rose Festival]]. Numerous times, the race was held on [[Father's Day (United States)|Father's Day]]. Beginning in 2018, the race was held in September on [[Labor Day]] weekend, promoted by [[Kim Green|Green]] [[Kevin Savoree|Savoree]] Racing Promotions.\n\n==Race winners==\n===IndyCar Series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Date\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Driver\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Chassis\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Engine\n! colspan=\"2\"|Race Distance\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Race Time\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Average Speed<br>(mph)\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Report\n|-\n!

Rain fell most of the day, making for a slick track, resulting in several spins and numerous off-course excursions. Late in the race, [[Gil de Ferran]] led with [[Christian Fittipaldi]] close behind in second, but the race was approaching the two-hour time limit. With the track slowly starting to dry, some teams elected gamble and change to [[Racing slick|slick tires]]. [[Paul Tracy]], [[Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin]], [[Alex Zanardi]], and others all came out on slicks and proceeded to spin off course. On lap 68 [[Mark Blundell]] also switched to slicks, and he too attempted to chase down the leaders. The race was set to end early at the completion of lap 78. With two laps to go, Blundell had caught up to de Ferran and Fittipaldi, but was carefully trying to maneuver around traffic and stay on course. Blundell passed Fittipaldi for second in turn ten. Meanwhile, [[Raul Boesel]] was closing in on the leaders as well. Gil de Ferran took the white flag with Mark Blundell charging behind him.

Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexation]] of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], but repealed in the rest of France after 1871.

Moreover, the city has been the residence of people such as writer [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], [[Cardinal Mazarin]], political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], French patriot and American Revolutionary War hero Marquis [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette]], and Luxembourg-born German-French statesman [[Robert Schuman]].\n\n==Law and government==\n\n===Local law===\n{{Main|Local law in Alsace-Moselle}}\nThe Local Law ({{Lang-fr|droit local}}) applied in Metz is a legal system that operates in parallel with [[Law of France|French law]]. Created in 1919, it preserves the French laws applied in France before 1870 and maintained by the Germans during the [[Alsace-Lorraine|annexation]] of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], but repealed in the rest of France after 1871. It also maintains German laws enacted by the [[German Empire]] between 1871 and 1918, specific provisions adopted by the local authorities, and French laws that have been enacted after 1919 to be applicable only in [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. This specific local legislation encompasses different areas including religion, social work and finance.\n\nThe most striking of the legal differences between France and [[Alsace-Lorraine]] is the absence in Alsace-Lorraine of strict [[secularism]], even though a constitutional right of [[freedom of religion]] is guaranteed by the French government. Alsace-Lorraine is still governed by a pre-[[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law]] established by the [[Concordat of 1801]], which provides for the public subsidy of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]], and [[Calvinist Church|Calvinist]] churches and the [[Judaism|Jewish]] religion.\n\n===Administration===\n[[File:Place darmes (3658773965).jpg|thumb|The city hall on the Place d'Armes.]]\nLike every commune of the present [[French Fifth Republic|French Republic]], Metz is managed by a mayor ({{Lang-fr|maire}}) and a municipal council ({{Lang-fr|conseil municipal}}), democratically elected by [[two-round system|two-round]] [[proportional voting]] for six years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070633&idArticle=LEGIARTI000024040149&dateTexte=20120630|title=Official French general code of territorial collectivities, French Republic|date= |accessdate=30 June 2012|language=fr}}</ref> The mayor is assisted by 54 municipal councillors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/elus_photos.php|title=Official Metz municipality website, List of Metz municipal councilors.|accessdate=24 July 2012|language=fr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512092500/http://metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/elus_photos.php|archivedate=12 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the municipal council is held on the last Thursday of every month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/conseil/index.php|title=Official Metz municipality website, agenda and proc\u00e8s-verbal of the Municipal Council of Metz.|accessdate=24 July 2012|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115034602/http://metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/conseil/index.php|archive-date=15 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Since March 2009, records of municipal council meetings are available as audio files in French.</ref> Since 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mairie-metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/lesmaires.php|title=List of mayors of Metz since 1790.|accessdate=27 December 2012|language=fr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214195639/http://www.mairie-metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/cyber_mairie/organigramme/lesmaires.php|archivedate=14 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> the mayor of Metz has been [[Socialist Party (France)|socialist]] Dominique Gros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/maire.php|title=Official Metz municipality website, Resume of Dominique Gros.|accessdate=30 June 2012|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115033932/http://metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/maire.php|archive-date=15 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe city belongs to the Metz Metropole union of cities, which includes the 40 cities of the Metz [[urban agglomeration]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metzmetropole.fr/site/institution_territoire_carte.php|title=Official Metz Metropole website, list of cities webpage|accessdate=1 July 2012|language=fr|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715002100/http://www.metzmetropole.fr/site/institution_territoire_carte.php|archivedate=15 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Metz is the [[prefecture]] of the [[Moselle]] based in the former [[Intendant]] Palace.<ref name=\"politic50\"/> In addition, Metz is the seat of the parliament of the [[Grand Est]] [[R\u00e9gion in France|region]], hosted in the former [[Saint Clement of Metz|Saint-Clement]] Abbey.\n\n===City administrative divisions===\n{{Main|Neighbourhoods of Metz}}\nThe city of Metz is divided into 14 administrative divisions:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/mairie_quartiers/index.php|title=Official website of Metz municipality.|format=PHP|accessdate=29 June 2012|language=fr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512105419/http://metz.fr/metz2/municipalite/mairie_quartiers/index.php|archive-date=12 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

Along with this expansion, several graduate schools took the opportunity to establish campuses in the park. At first, facilities were grouped around the lake Symphony, like [[Sup\u00e9lec]] in 1985 and [[Georgia Tech Lorraine]] in 1990.<ref>http://lorraine.gatech.edu/about</ref> In 1996, the engineering school [[Arts et M\u00e9tiers ParisTech]] (ENSAM) built a research and learning center next to the golf course.<ref>http://tout-metz.com/quartiers/technopole-metz</ref> This opened the way to the development of a new area, where the Franco-German university (ISFATES) and the ENIM moved in 2010. These graduate schools often cooperate with the University of Lorraine.
