Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase.

In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports.

Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived.

The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender.

On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. \n\nD'Orves died the same day at 1600. Suffren re-appointed his captains to the ships of the squadon: Captain de Lapalli\u00e8re{{refn|Sometimes spelt \"la Palli\u00e8re\"<ref name=cunat104 />|group=Note}} took command of ''Orient'' and Cillart that of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re''; Captain [[Justin Bonaventure Morard de Galles|Morard de Galles]], of ''Pourvoyeuse'', and Lieutenant de Ruyter, in temporary command of ''Petit Annibal'', exchanged their positions; Beaulieu went on ''Bellone'';<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref>  Tromelin (the Younger) took on ''Subtile''; and Galifet took ''Sylphide''.

In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports.

After consulting [[Hyder Ali]], he decided not to land his troops in Pondich\u00e9ry, and rather to head for [[Parangipettai|Porto Nove]], where he arrived on 23 February. <ref name=hennequin299>Hennequin, p.299</ref> Hyder Ali despatched [[Andr\u00e9 Piveron de Morlat]], the French ambassador, to act as an intermediary between Suffren and himself, along with two of his officiers. Suffren negotiated an agreement that French troops would retain their own command; that a 4,000-man cavalry and 6,000-man infantry force would reinforce them; and that they be paid 24 [[Lakh]] rupee a year.<ref name=hennequin302>Hennequin, p.302</ref> Suffren landed his troops at Porto Nove, and departed on 23 March to search for the British fleet.\n\nOn 10 April, the two fleet came into view, and they spent two days in manoeuvers, trying to gain an advantage on the other. On 12, the [[Battle of Providien]] broke out, leaving both squadrons damaged.

Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived. Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the [[Battle of Trincomalee]].<ref name=Hennequin314>Hennequin, p.314</ref> The French line fought desorganised, especially after ''Vengeur'' caught fire and have to distance herself from other ships. The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports.

The castle has never been used for military purposes{{dubious|date=November 2012}} and its remains survive to this day. D'Oyly set up a monastic community in the castle consisting of a chapel and living quarters for monks (''St George in the Castle''). The community never grew large but it earned its place in history as one of Britain's oldest places of formal education.

Oxford's status as a [[Liberty (division)|liberty]] obtained from this period until the 19th century.<ref name=boundaries /> A grandson of King John established Rewley Abbey for the [[Cistercian]] Order; and friars of various orders ([[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Franciscan]]s, [[Carmelite]]s, [[Augustinian]]s and [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarians]]) all had houses of varying importance at Oxford. Parliaments were often held in the city during the 13th century.

Of the hundreds of [[aularian]] houses that sprang up across the city, only [[St Edmund Hall]] (c. 1225) remains. What put an end to the halls was the emergence of colleges. [[Colleges of the University of Oxford#History|Oxford's earliest colleges]] were [[University College, Oxford|University College]] (1249), [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] (1263) and [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] (1264). These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]].

These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]].

By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris Motors and [[Pressed Steel Fisher]] plants. Oxford was now a city of two halves: the university city to the west of [[Magdalen Bridge]] and the car town to the east. This led to the witticism that \"Oxford is the left bank of Cowley\". Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the decline of [[British Leyland]], but is now producing the successful [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] for [[BMW]] on a smaller site.

The principal production site for [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] cars, owned by [[BMW]] since 2000, is in the Oxford suburb of [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]]. The plant, which survived the threat of closure in the early 1990s, also produced cars under the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Rover Group|Rover]] brands following the demise of the Morris brand in 1984, although the last Morris-badged car was produced there in 1982.\n\n===Publishing===\n[[Oxford University Press]], a department of the University of Oxford, is based in the city, although it no longer operates its own paper mill and printing house. The city is also home to the UK operations of [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Elsevier]] and several smaller publishing houses.\n\n===Science and technology===\nThe presence of the university has given rise to many science and technology based businesses, including [[Oxford Instruments]], [[Research Machines]] and [[Sophos]]. The university established [[Isis Innovation]] in 1987 to promote technology transfer. The [[Oxford Science Park]] was established in 1990, and the [[Begbroke Science Park]], owned by the university, lies north of the city.\n\nOxford increasingly has a reputation for being a centre of digital innovation, as epitomized by Digital Oxford.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Home \u2013 Digital Oxford|url = http://digitaloxford.com/|website = Digital Oxford|accessdate = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150509055659/http://digitaloxford.com/|archive-date = 9 May 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Several startups including Passle,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Passle \u2013 become a thought leader|url = http://passle.net|website = Passle: Don't have time to blog?|accessdate = 3 June 2015}}</ref> Brainomix,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Brainomix|url = https://www.brainomix.com/|website = Brainomix|accessdate = 5 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150708091626/https://www.brainomix.com/|archive-date = 8 July 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> [[Labstep]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Labstep|url = https://angel.co/labstep|website = angel.co|accessdate = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603230831/https://angel.co/labstep|archive-date = 3 June 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> and more, are based in Oxford.\n\n===Education===\nThe presence of the university has also led to Oxford becoming a centre for the education industry.

Several of the colleges had private breweries, one of which, at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], survived until 1889.
