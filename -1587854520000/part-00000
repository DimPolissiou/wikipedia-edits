He studied law and theology at the ''Real Universidad de San Felipe'', graduating in 1789. Originally he wanted to become a priest, but later changed his mind, and decided to take over the family hacienda in Calera de Tango. He married [[Teresa Larra\u00edn|Mar\u00eda Teresa de Larra\u00edn y Guzm\u00e1n Peralta]] on September 13, 1808. During all the rest of his life he dedicated himself to the commerce and the management of his lands.\n\n==Political career==\nDuring the first days of the revolt of Chile against Spanish domination in 1810 he was a member of the municipal corporation of Santiago, and joined the revolutionary cause with enthusiasm. He began his political career in 1812, when he was elected deputy to the first congress. When, in 1813, General [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] marched to meet the invasion of Brigadier [[Antonio Pareja]], the senate appointed a temporary government, and Eyzaguirre was elected a member of the [[Junta de Gobierno]] established in March, 1813, along with [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Infante]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Cienfuegos]], and which lasted until March 7, 1814.\n\nHe took an active part in founding the national academy and many schools, and in promulgating the liberty of the press; and during this administration the first republican paper was printed at Santiago. After the [[Battle of Rancagua]], in October 1814, he, with other patriots, was imprisoned on the Island of [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands|Juan Fernandez]], and all his property was confiscated. He returned after the [[Battle of Chacabuco]], (February 12, 1817) that restored the exiles to their families.\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], Eyzaguirre retired to private life and devoted himself to his commercial interests. During this time he organized the famous [[Calcutta Company]], for direct trade between [[Valpara\u00edso]] and the East Indies, and thus was the first that caused the Chilean flag to float in Asiatic seas.\n\nOn January 28, 1823, he again became a member, together with [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Infante y Rojas]] and [[Fernando Err\u00e1zuriz Aldunate]], of the ruling [[Government Junta of Chile (1823)|Government Junta]] that took over from the resigned [[Presidents of Chile|Supreme Director]] Bernardo O'Higgins, and lasted until April 4, 1823, when [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]] assumed as the new [[Presidents of Chile|Supreme Director]].\n\nOn July 8, 1826 [[Manuel Blanco Encalada]] was elected [[Presidents of Chile|President]], while he was elected [[Vice President of Chile|Vice President]]. They took office on August 14, 1826. Upon the resignation of president [[Manuel Blanco Encalada|Blanco Encalada]], he assumed the office of president on September 11, 1826.\n\n== Administration ==\n[[File:Agustin Eyzaguirre portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|left|As president (1826)]]\nHis short government was marked by the financial difficulties that had caused the resignation of his predecessor. He found the treasury broke, with absolutely no sources of revenue since the complete administrative breakdown of the country prevented the government from collecting any taxes. There was no money to pay administrative personnel, and what was worse for the political situation of the time, the army was unpaid also.\n\nImmediately upon his assuming office he had to deal first with some incidents in [[Chill\u00e1n]], and then with an insurrection in the island of [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]] that was trying to break away from the control of the central government and return to the protection of Spain. The rebellion was very brutally suppressed, and 20 people were executed. The problems between the president and Congress that had marked the rule of his predecessor, continued. The federal laws started to cause friction between the new provinces, and the famous highwaymen the Pincheira family, started a new campaign.\n\nAnother problem was the bankruptcy of \"Portales, Cea y C\u00eda\", the company in charge of the tobacco monopoly (and more importantly of the foreign debt service.) This bankruptcy became a big scandal, since the conservative opposition pointed out that the cause was the lack of legal security in a broken down country, while the government countermanded with the fact that the State would have to resume the payment of the foreign debt, when it was already bankrupt itself.\n\nIn the midst of this political bickering, colonel [[Enrique Campino]], with the support of the radical federalist group, organized a military coup with the Santiago garrison, dissolving Congress and imprisoning some conservative ministers, chief among them [[Diego Portales]] and [[Manuel Jos\u00e9 Gandarillas]]. Finally the government managed to control the situation and imprison colonel Campino, but president Eyzaguirre had had enough. On January 25, 1827, he presented his resignation to Congress, which accepted it, and proceeded to name [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]] as Presidente and [[Francisco Antonio Pinto]] as [[Vice President of Chile]].\n\n== Cabinet ==\n{{Infobox Chile Cabinet Historical\n|align=center\n|Name=Eyzaguirre\n|President=Agust\u00edn Eyzaguirre\n|President start=11 September 1826\n|President end=25 January 1827\n|Government Foreign Affairs=[[Ventura Blanco Encalada]]\n|Government Foreign Affairs start=8 March 1826\n|Government Foreign Affairs end=20 October 1826\n|Government Foreign Affairs 2=[[Manuel Jos\u00e9 Gandarillas]]\n|Government Foreign Affairs start 2=20 October 1826\n|Government Foreign Affairs end 2=25 January 1827\n|Finance=[[Agust\u00edn Vial|Agust\u00edn Vial Santelices]]\n|Finance start=12 September 1826\n|Finance end=20 October 1826\n|Finance 2=[[Melchor de Santiago Concha]]\n|Finance start 2=20 October 1826\n|Finance end 2=22 October 1826\n|War Navy=[[Tom\u00e1s Obejero]]\n|War Navy start=21 June 1826\n|War Navy end=26 September 1826\n|War Navy 2=General [[Luis de la Cruz]]\n|War Navy start 2=26 September 1826\n|War Navy end 2=8 March 1827\n}}\n\n==Later life==\nAfter this episode, Eyzaguirre retired from politics, and remained dedicated only to his hacienda until his death.

{"title_page": "Jonas Kocher", "text_new": "{{short description|Swiss musician and composer}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2016}}\n\n'''Jonas Kocher''' is a musician and composer born in [[Nyon]] ([[Switzerland]]) in 1977. He is based in [[Biel/Bienne]] ([[Switzerland]]) since the late 1990s. \n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name = \n| background = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| image = Acc jk 4.jpg\n| l\u00e9gende = Jonas Kocher 2014\n| caption = \n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1977|08|22}}\n| birth_place = [[Nyon]], Switzerland\n| genre = [[Free improvisation]], [[experimental music]]\n| occupation = Musician, composer\n| instrument = Accordion\n| website = {{url|jonaskocher.net}}\n}}\n\n== Biography ==\nComposer and [[accordionist]], Jonas Kocher followed his musical studies at the University of the Arts in [[Bern]] between 1996 and 2004 with Teodoro Anzellotti, Pierre Sublet and [[Georges Aperghis]]. He soon developed a keen interest in experimental practices in sound and performance, which led him to explore musical theater as a performer in productions by [[:de:Ruedi H\u00e4usermann|Ruedy H\u00e4usermann]] and [[:de:Daniel Ott|Daniel Ott]] and electronic music in the BlindeKinder duo. Since 2003 he has been creating his own pieces of composed theatre, various sound performances and he also dedicates himself to composition and free improvisation. Starting from 2006 and for a few years, he has worked closely with Association Rue du Nord ([[Lausanne]]).\n\nSince 2008, he has performed as accordionist with regular partners such as [[:de:Jacques Demierre|Jacques Demierre]], [[:de:Axel D\u00f6rner|Axel D\u00f6rner]], [[:de: Joke Lanz|Joke Lanz]], Christian Wolfarth, Gaudenz Badrutt, [[:fr:Michel Doneda|Michel Doneda]], Chris Heenan, [[:de: Christof Kurzmann|Christof Kurzmann]], [[:pl:Alfredo Costa Monteiro|Alfredo Costa Monteiro]] (in the accordion trio 300 basses with [[:de:Luca Venitucci|Luca Venitucci]]), [[Leonel Kaplan]], [[:de:Hans Koch (Holzbl\u00e4ser)|Hans Koch]], [[Burkhard Beins]], [[Radu Malfatti]], [[Ilan Manouach]], [[:de:Andy Guhl|Andy Guhl]] and many others. His musical activity has led him to perform throughout Europe and in Russia, Japan and the USA and to collaborate with dancers and visual artists.\n\nAs interpreter, he encourages collaborations with musicians and composers such as Christian Kesten, Stefan Thut, [[Antoine Chessex]], Chiyoko Szlavnics or [[Radu Malfatti]]. If his practice of improvisation seems to contrast with his parallel interest in composition and sound performance, it is only because the creative dimension of these areas is not taken into account in its entirety; this is an area where Jonas Kocher sees a field of privileged artistic experimentation and where listening, sound and space are constantly explored.\n\nAs a composer, he has produced works that range between composed theatre, installations and concert pieces. He has composed occasionally for [[Radio drama|audio drama]], dance and theater.

He is based in [[Biel/Bienne]] ([[Switzerland]]) since the late 1990s. \n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name = \n| background = non_vocal_instrumentalist\n| image = Acc jk 4.jpg\n| l\u00e9gende = Jonas Kocher 2014\n| caption = \n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1977|08|22}}\n| birth_place = [[Nyon]], Switzerland\n| genre = [[Free improvisation]], [[experimental music]]\n| occupation = Musician, composer\n| instrument = Accordion\n| website = {{url|jonaskocher.net}}\n}}\n\n== Biography ==\nComposer and [[accordionist]], Jonas Kocher followed his musical studies at the University of the Arts in [[Bern]] between 1996 and 2004 with Teodoro Anzellotti, Pierre Sublet and [[Georges Aperghis]]. He soon developed a keen interest in experimental practices in sound and performance, which led him to explore musical theater as a performer in productions by [[:de:Ruedi H\u00e4usermann|Ruedy H\u00e4usermann]] and [[:de:Daniel Ott|Daniel Ott]] and electronic music in the BlindeKinder duo. Since 2003 he has been creating his own pieces of composed theatre, various sound performances and he also dedicates himself to composition and free improvisation. Starting from 2006 and for a few years, he has worked closely with Association Rue du Nord ([[Lausanne]]).\n\nSince 2008, he has performed as accordionist with regular partners such as [[:de:Jacques Demierre|Jacques Demierre]], [[:de:Axel D\u00f6rner|Axel D\u00f6rner]], [[:de: Joke Lanz|Joke Lanz]], Christian Wolfarth, Gaudenz Badrutt, [[:fr:Michel Doneda|Michel Doneda]], Chris Heenan, [[:de: Christof Kurzmann|Christof Kurzmann]], [[:pl:Alfredo Costa Monteiro|Alfredo Costa Monteiro]] (in the accordion trio 300 basses with [[:de:Luca Venitucci|Luca Venitucci]]), [[Leonel Kaplan]], [[:de:Hans Koch (Holzbl\u00e4ser)|Hans Koch]], [[Burkhard Beins]], [[Radu Malfatti]], [[Ilan Manouach]], [[:de:Andy Guhl|Andy Guhl]] and many others. His musical activity has led him to perform throughout Europe and in Russia, Japan and the USA and to collaborate with dancers and visual artists.\n\nAs interpreter, he encourages collaborations with musicians and composers such as Christian Kesten, Stefan Thut, [[Antoine Chessex]], Chiyoko Szlavnics or [[Radu Malfatti]]. If his practice of improvisation seems to contrast with his parallel interest in composition and sound performance, it is only because the creative dimension of these areas is not taken into account in its entirety; this is an area where Jonas Kocher sees a field of privileged artistic experimentation and where listening, sound and space are constantly explored.\n\nAs a composer, he has produced works that range between composed theatre, installations and concert pieces. He has composed occasionally for [[Radio drama|audio drama]], dance and theater. Jonas Kocher is active as an organizer of concerts in Switzerland and elsewhere and he is running BRUIT, a platform dedicated to experimental sound practices.\n\nIn 2005 he received the Art award of the city of [[Nyon]] and in 2010 the prize of recognition of the music committee of the [[Canton of Bern]]e. His works have been performed at the Biennale Bern 2010, Musikfestival Bern 2017 and 2018, Umlaut festival Berlin, the Jardins Musicaux festival of Cernier, the Forge London, the Zagreb Biennale, SMC Lausanne, Thessaloniki Art Biennale, etc.\n\n== Works ==\n* 2019: ''Perspectives and echoes'', for 6 players (percussion, live electronics and four instruments)\n* 2018: ''Avec Bataille'', performance for 7 participants with headphones and one improvising musician\n* 2018: ''HOME (M\u00fcnstergasse 37)'', in situ sound performance for 4 musicians and 2 actors\n* 2017: ''Irrlicht'', for loudspeakers and four performers in a resonant space\n* 2017: ''Rough'', for 10 musicians\n* 2015: ''h\u00e1los'', for harp solo\n* 2015: ''Intervention No. 2 [pasquart]'', in situ sound performance\n* 2015: ''Intervention No. 1 [cave12]'', in situ sound performance\n* 2013: ''Hornussen'', in situ sound performance\n* 2013: ''Nichi Nichi Kore Ko Nichi'', sound performance\n* 2012: ''Commedia'', for piano, clarinet, violin, vcello and pre-recorded sounds\n* 2011: ''Agitations (Adagio)'', for small symphony orchestra (young interpreters) and pre-recorded sounds\n* 2010: ''Frictions'', musical theater\n* 2010: ''Promenade \u00e0 travers une \u0153uvre'', in situ sound performance\n* 2010: ''Grrrrr!!'', for string quartet (young interpreters)\n* 2009: ''Serge'', for ensemble\n* 2008: ''3 ombres'', for ensemble (three compositions intended to be played with Pierrot Lunaire of A.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.

The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned. \n\nBy the early 1970s, Sun Life began to slowly divest itself of most of the company's assets but retained its electricity distribution system which by now was operating as ''Cornwall Electric''.  Its railway freight operations were sold to [[Canadian National Railway|Canada National Railway]], and its passenger service was contracted out to ''A.J.

Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors. They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to hold a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2019|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707033751/https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|archive-date=2019-07-07|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.
