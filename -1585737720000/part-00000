Frederick studied at the universities of [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]] and [[University of T\u00fcbingen|T\u00fcbingen]].\n\nIn March 1610 he visited his aunt [[Anne of Denmark]] in England, staying at [[St James Palace]] with [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] and took a tour of the South West, visiting Oxford, Gloucester, Bath, and Bristol where news of the assassination of [[Henry IV of France]]. [[David Murray (poet)|Sir David Murray]], a gentleman of the household of Prince Henry, managed part of the tour, using \u00a31,000 for expenses.

After Prince Henry's death in 1612 the duke was sent a suit of gilt armour.<ref>William Brenchley Rye, ''England as Seen by Foreigners in the Days of Elizabeth & James the First'' (London, 1865), pp. 59, 224-5.</ref>\n\nHe became ruling duke after the death of his father in 1613. In 1615, Frederick became involved in a war with the City of [[Brunswick (city)|Brunswick]], which was reluctant to recognize his overlordship.\n\nBetween 1616 and 1622, he was de facto deposed by his mother, [[Elizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Brunswick|Elizabeth]], with the help of her brother, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]], because of his [[alcoholism]]; government business was led by [[Anton von Streithorst]], who nearly ruined the state by minting coins from cheap metals and thus causing [[inflation]]. Because of the bad situation of the state, Christian had Frederick take control of the government again. With the help of the states' nobility, he managed to regain control; the members of the Streithorst government fled the state.\n\nBecause of Frederick's indecision and weakness, Brunswick was heavily ransacked during the [[Thirty Years' War]] \u2014 both by the Catholic forces of [[Johan t'Serclaes, Count of Tilly|Tilly]] and [[Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim|Pappenheim]] and by the Protestant forces of Christian of Denmark and [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]]. The duke lost most of his territory during this time.

Frederick studied at the universities of [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]] and [[University of T\u00fcbingen|T\u00fcbingen]].\n\nIn March 1610 he visited his aunt [[Anne of Denmark]] in England, staying at [[St James Palace]] with [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] and took a tour of the South West, visiting Oxford, Gloucester, Bath, and Bristol where news of the assasination of [[Henry IV of France]].

In 1615, Frederick became involved in a war with the City of [[Brunswick (city)|Brunswick]], which was reluctant to recognize his overlordship.\n\nBetween 1616 and 1622, he was de facto deposed by his mother, [[Elizabeth of Denmark, Duchess of Brunswick|Elizabeth]], with the help of her brother, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]], because of his [[alcoholism]]; government business was led by [[Anton von Streithorst]], who nearly ruined the state by minting coins from cheap metals and thus causing [[inflation]]. Because of the bad situation of the state, Christian had Frederick take control of the government again. With the help of the states' nobility, he managed to regain control; the members of the Streithorst government fled the state.\n\nBecause of Frederick's indecision and weakness, Brunswick was heavily ransacked during the [[Thirty Years' War]] \u2014 both by the Catholic forces of [[Johan t'Serclaes, Count of Tilly|Tilly]] and [[Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim|Pappenheim]] and by the Protestant forces of Christian of Denmark and [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]].

In the early 16th century abuses (such as selling [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church) occasioned much discontent, and a general desire for reform emerged.  In 1517 the Reformation began with the publication of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]] detailing 95 assertions which Luther believed showed corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church.  The Reformation demonstrated Luther's disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy used and abused power, and with the very idea of a papacy. In 1521 the [[Diet of Worms]] outlawed Luther, but the Reformation spread rapidly.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The German Reformation'' (2014)</ref>  Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the basis of the modern German language. A curious fact is that Luther spoke a dialect which had minor importance in the German language of that time. After the publication of his Bible translation, his dialect evolved into what is now standard modern German.\n\nWith the [[Protestation at Speyer|protestation]] of the Lutheran princes at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Second Diet of Speyer|Speyer]] (1529) and rejection of the Lutheran \"Augsburg Confession\" at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1530), a separate Lutheran church emerged.<ref name=\":2\">Robert Kolb, ''Confessing the faith: reformers define the Church, 1530\u20131580'' (Concordia Publishing House, 1991)</ref>\n\nFrom 1545 the [[Catholic Reformation|Counter-Reformation]] began in Germany.

O'Connell, ''Counter-reformation, 1559\u20131610'' (1974)</ref> The Holy Roman Empire became religiously diverse; for the most part, the states of northern and central Germany became Protestant (chiefly Lutheran, but also Calvinist/Reformed) while the states of southern Germany and the [[Rhineland]] largely remained Catholic. In 1547 the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] defeated the [[Schmalkaldic League]], an alliance of Protestant rulers.  The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith. But the treaty also stipulated that the religion of a state was to be that of its ruler (''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'').<ref>Lewis W.

There was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to [[Lutheranism#Church fellowship|unify]] the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardised liturgy, organisation, and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralised royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union]] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognised as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"[[Old Lutherans]]\" in Prussia and Silesia who followed the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground.  Tens of thousands migrated [[German Australian|to South Australia]] and the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]]. Finally, in 1845 the new king, [[Frederick William IV]], offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form separate [[Free church#Germany|free church]] associations with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark,  ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 412\u201319</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985\u20131004.

Opposing the rationalism of the late 18th century, there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion.  Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 419\u201321</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837\u201338 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands.  However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 498\u2013509</ref>\n\n=== Kulturkampf and the German Empire (1871\u20131918) ===\n{{main|Kulturkampf}}\n[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|275px|''Between Berlin and Rome'', Bismarck (left) confronts Pope Pius IX, 1875]]\n[[File:Verbreitung der Konfessionen im deutschen Reich.jpg|thumb|275px|The religious situation in the German Empire about 1895.

He launched a [[Kulturkampf]] (\"culture war\") against the power of the pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in Prussia.

In the early 16th century abuses (such as selling [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church) occasioned much discontent, and a general desire for reform emerged.  In 1517 the Reformation began with the publication of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]] detailing 95 assertions which Luther believed showed corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church.  The Reformation demonstrated Luther's disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy used and abused power, and with the very idea of a papacy. In 1521 the [[Diet of Worms]] outlawed Luther, but the Reformation spread rapidly.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The German Reformation'' (2014)</ref>  Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the basis of the modern German language. A curious fact is that Luther spoke a dialect which had minor importance in the German language of that time. After the publication of his Bible translation, his dialect evolved into what is now standard modern German.\n\nWith the [[Protestation at Speyer|protestation]] of the Lutheran princes at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Second Diet of Speyer|Speyer]] (1529) and rejection of the Lutheran \"Augsburg Confession\" at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1530), a separate Lutheran church emerged.<ref name=\":2\">Robert Kolb, ''Confessing the faith: reformers define the Church, 1530-1580'' (Concordia Publishing House, 1991)</ref>\n\nFrom 1545 the [[Catholic Reformation|Counter-Reformation]] began in Germany. Much of its impetus came from the newly founded (in 1540) [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]]. It restored Catholicism to many areas, including Bavaria.<ref>Marvin R. O'Connell, ''Counter-reformation, 1559-1610'' (1974)</ref> The Holy Roman Empire became religiously diverse; for the most part, the states of northern and central Germany became Protestant (chiefly Lutheran, but also Calvinist/Reformed) while the states of southern Germany and the [[Rhineland]] largely remained Catholic. In 1547 the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] defeated the [[Schmalkaldic League]], an alliance of Protestant rulers.  The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith.

There was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to [[Lutheranism#Church fellowship|unify]] the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardised liturgy, organisation, and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralised royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union]] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognised as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"[[Old Lutherans]]\" in Prussia and Silesia who followed the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground.  Tens of thousands migrated [[German Australian|to South Australia]] and the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]]. Finally, in 1845 the new king, [[Frederick William IV]], offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form separate [[Free church#Germany|free church]] associations with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark,  ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 412-19</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985-1004.

Opposing the rationalism of the late 18th century, there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion.  Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 419-21</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837-38 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands.  However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648-1840'' (1964) pp 498-509</ref>\n\n=== Kulturkampf and the German Empire (1871\u20131918) ===\n{{main|Kulturkampf}}\n[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|275px|''Between Berlin and Rome'', Bismarck (left) confronts Pope Pius IX, 1875]]\n[[File:Verbreitung der Konfessionen im deutschen Reich.jpg|thumb|275px|The religious situation in the German Empire about 1895.

He launched a [[Kulturkampf]] (\"culture war\") against the power of the pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in Prussia. This gained strong support from German liberals, who saw the Catholic Church as the bastion of reaction and their greatest enemy.  The Catholic element, in turn, saw the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberals]], who often happened to be Protestant, as its worst enemy and formed the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]].<ref>Douglas W.

After 1871, there was a systematic purge of Catholics; in the powerful interior ministry, which handled all police affairs, the only Catholic was a messenger boy. Jews were likewise heavily discriminated against.<ref>John C.G. Roehl, \"Higher civil servants in Germany, 1890-1900\" in James J.

Nearly all Catholic bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant facing the increasingly heavy penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck's government.  Historian Anthony Steinhoff reports the casualty totals:\n\n<blockquote>As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile. ...Finally, between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies.<ref>Anthony J.

The predominantly secularised states, such as [[Hamburg]] or the East German states, used to be Lutheran or [[United and uniting churches|United Protestant]] strongholds.

Romantic comedies are considered a subgenre of the chick flick.  However, romantic comedies are typically respected more than chick flicks because they are designed to appeal to men and women.\n\nFemale [[MSN.com]] commentator Kim Morgan has written,\n{{quote|[C]inema just wouldn't be the same without movies for and about women.

It has its roots in the \"[[Woman's film|women's pictures]]\" of the early twentieth century, which portrays the woman as a victim and housewife, and later the ''[[film noir]]'' of the 1940s and early 1950s, which portrays the threat of sexualized women.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Chick Flicks: Contemporary Women at the Movies|last = Ferriss|first = Suzanne and Mallory Young|publisher = Routledge|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 14}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal |title= The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory?

These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as [[abortion]] and personal alienation being included.<ref name=suck/>\n\nSeveral chick flicks have been patterned after the story of [[Cinderella]] and other [[fairy tale]]s (e.g. ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[Ever After]]'', and ''[[Pretty Woman]]''), or even Shakespeare in the case of ''[[She's the Man]]'' and ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''. In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'') and literary classics (e.g. ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.\n\nAfter the blockbuster success of the [[2008 in film|2008]] [[Drama film|drama]]/[[romance film]] ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, \"[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick\" and that \"[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long\". He also said, \"they have no trouble finding money for the things they're passionate about.\" According to [[Fandango.com]], more than 75% of ''Twilight''{{'s}} opening-weekend audience was female.<ref name=\"twilight\" />\n\n==Criticism of the term ==\nThe term ''chick flick'' has generated several negative responses from the modern [[Feminist movement|feminist]] community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of ''The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?'', Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are \"an attempt to lump together an entire gender\u2019s interests into one genre.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nWhile the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Stereotypes And The Logic Of Social Relations|last = Rimashevskaia|first = Natal'ia|date = 2008|journal = Russian Social Science Review|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 35\u201348|doi = 10.1080/10611428.2008.11065289|pmid = }}</ref> There is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that [[gender stereotypes]] further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their \"human and intellectual potential.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nMore criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society's perception of women. Some say that chick flicks are [[Microaggressions|micro-aggressions]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = SAGE Reference - Encyclopedia of Human Services and Diversity |url= http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-human-services-and-diversity|doi = 10.4135/9781483346663|isbn= 9781452287485|first = Linwood|last = Cousins|year= 2014}}</ref> Micro-aggressions are actions or exchanges that degrade a person based on his or her membership in a \"race, gender, age, and ability.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Critique of the genre ==\nDespite the genre's popular successes, some film critics take issue with the content most chick flicks have in common. Although the subcategories represent different plot lines, all five{{Which|date=January 2019}} have several characteristics in common. Many chick flicks can have the \"ironic, self-deprecating tone\" which film theorist Hilary Radner associates with chick lit.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Radner\n| first1 = Hilary\n| title =

''Structural Integrity, Historical Reversion, and the Post-9/11 Chick Flick'', Diane Negra focuses on several romantic comedies, deemed to be chick flicks, set in [[New York City]] after the

Krishna Reddy]] and [[Jainendra Jain (screenwriter)|Jainendra Jain]] and produced by [[Boney Kapoor]]. The film stars [[Sridevi]], [[Anil Kapoor]] and [[Urmila Matondkar]] in lead roles. [[Kader Khan]], [[Farida Jalal]], [[Johnny Lever]], [[Paresh Rawal]], [[Upasana Singh]] and [[Saeed Jaffrey]] are featured in supporting roles; while [[Poonam Dhillon]] makes a special appearance. The film was a remake of the 1994 [[Telugu cinema|Telugu film]] ''[[Subhalagnam]]''. In the film, lured by wealth, poor housewife Kajal asks her husband, Raj, an honest engineer, to marry Janhvi, the rich niece of his boss. Little does she know about the problems that await her. After an active career of 30 years, ''Judaai'' marked Sridevi's final film appearance before she took a fifteen-year sabbatical from film acting.\n\nUpon release, the film was a major commercial success grossing \u20b925.77 crores against its \u20b96.30 crores budget. Critically, the film received mixed reviews with criticism towards its simple and clich\u00e9d plot and execution, but was widely praised for the performances of the lead actresses.\n\n== Plot ==\nWhen Kajal ([[Sridevi]]) marries Raj ([[Anil Kapoor]]), an Engineer by profession, she and her dad ([[Kader Khan]]), automatically assume that he is rich, wealthy, and corrupt. Her father  is very happy that his daughter does not have any in-laws, and that she'll get to rule the roost in her new house. But that is not the case. Raj does not have an air-conditioner, a car, not even a refrigerator. This infuriates Kajal, and in her mind she creates a separate world, where she is rich, wealthy, has several cars, and lives lavishly in a big bungalow. Even the birth of two children (a young son and a little daughter) and several years of marriage do not change her. An example of this occurs when Kajal meets her old friend Nisha ([[Poonam Dhillon]]), who Kajal feeds a pack of lies that her husband is a business magnate, her family owns several cars and lives in a big bungalow, but Nisha, who is actually wealthy, offers to give her a lift. Kajal lies about where she lives and is exposed when the bungalow she points out as her own turns out to be Nisha's. She tells Kajal not to take her life or her husband for granted and that no matter how little you have, your house is your home. When Jahnvi ([[Urmila Matondkar]]), Raj's boss Sahni's ([[Saeed Jaffrey]]) niece, comes from overseas, she meets Raaj at the airport and assumes he is the car driver. After she is rude to him, he leaves her stranded on the road with her luggage, not caring what his boss would say. Jahnvi reaches the office well in time and praises Raj's attitude, but when she learns that he's an engineer working for her uncle's construction company, she apologizes to him. Sahni introduces Jahnvi to Vikram Khanna, a handsome young guy, who is his business partner. Vikram observes Jahnvi and likes the young, naturally vivacious girl. One day, Vikram and Jahnvi go to see Jahnvi's guest house, at the new property. Sahni gets worried as the weather is getting bad; and they have not returned to the office. As Raj is about to leave, Sahni asks him to check on them and bring Jahnvi back, while Vikram has been drinking and casually discusses the prospect of marriage. But Jahnvi rejects his advances. Vikram grabs her but Jahnvi slaps him. Angered by the slap, Vikram throws her on the bed and tries to rape her. But Raj arrives in the nick of time and saves Jahnvi. Vikram threatens him with the loss of his job, but he doesn't care. Jahnvi remembers how earlier, Raj had rejected a job and an apartment offer from a rival company due to Mr. Sahni's help. She starts liking Raj from that moment and falls in love with him thereafter. When she learns that he is a married man, she is adamant about marrying Raj.\n\nShe first meets Kajal by accident, at a shop where they are both going to buy a cassette player for Raj. Not knowing Kajal is Raj's wife, she offers Kajal the money to buy a more expensive set if she can buy the smaller cassette (which is also the last one in the shop). Kajal agrees and the family listens to the tape Jahnvi had given, where she confesses her love. In an attempt to marry Raj, Jahnvi meets the greedy Kajal inside the city's Ganesh temple, she offers two crore rupees in exchange for marriage to Raj. Then Kajal, seeing this as her opportunity to gain wealth and an easy life, she suddenly accepts her proposal.\n\nKajal forces Raj into the agreement and gets a reluctant Raj and Jahnvi married and divorces Raj herself, to comply with the Hindu Marriage Act; thinking that she and Jahnvi will happily live together and share Raj.\n\nShe then uses the money she got in the bargain to buy a huge mansion and cars. The bungalow she buys ends up being that of Nisha. She briefly returns to her old home to collect a picture of her husband. Kajal then proceeds to taunt her that she has fulfilled her dreams, whereas Nisha's dreams are now shattered having lost everything. Nisha reminds Kajal that she sold her house and possessions to pay for the treatment of her ill husband, whereas Kajal has sold her husband for riches; and that to some extent, Kajal is all the poorer for that. Kajal moulds herself into a socialite and this leads to Kajal neglecting her family. Raj initially feels rejected by Kajal and does not get close to Jahnvi, feeling objectified at the thought of being bought and sold between his two wives. But the children and Raj find companionship with Jahnvi, who showers them with love and affection. She changes herself and becomes a typical middle class type Indian housewife. She gets up early, does pooja and then cooks tasty food for her family. She does not mind tiring herself all day learning new dishes and rituals as she finds solace in this quiet, peaceful life.\n\nShe even travels happily in crowded buses and autos so as to make Raaj and the kids feel secure and happy around her. She abandons all the luxury and comforts she grew up with. The children call Jahnvi \"Maa\", something that Kajal would previously reprimand her children for calling her; insisting that they call her \"Mummy\" as this sounded high society.\n\nNow Kajal realizes how far she has drifted from her family. She forgets her wedding anniversary and throws a birthday party for her daughter's birthday, not realizing that Raj has never been attracted to a lavish lifestyle and thus further pushing him away from her and towards Jahnvi. After frequent reminders from her mother, Kajal tries to make amends. When nothing works, Kajal shocks her husband when she slaps Jahnvi and accuses her of stealing her husband and tries to make Jahnvi leave. Kajal offers Jahnvi all her money back in exchange for Raj again, only to be told by Raj that she is the poorest relation despite having all the riches she ever dreamed of. On advice of her friend, Kajal seeks legal advice which also states that the only way she can legally marry Raj if  he and Jahnvi divorce&nbsp;\u2013 an impossible task. She then forcibly tries to throw Jahnvi out of the house, but to no avail, as Raj decides to leave with Jahnvi claiming that in the present circumstances, this is the fairest thing to do. The kids decide to stay with Janhvi and their father&nbsp;\u2013 heartbroken as they learn that their father was sold, prompting the son to ask Kajal about the prospect of them being sold to another family at an agreed price.\n\nKajal on the other hand, distraught by her family abandoning her, donates all her riches, in order to pay her dues. When she learns that Raj and the kids are leaving for the US, she runs to the airport for one final visit. She finds them ready to depart. But at the last minute, Jahnvi turns to Raj and tells them that she is leaving for the US alone, but she is not literally alone. She is expecting Raj's child. Jahnvi accepts that although Kajal sold her husband, it was her who offered to buy him and thus she too should pay her dues. So, the movie ends with Kajal getting her family back, learning of the importance of family over money and Jahnvi leaving for New York forever.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Anil Kapoor]]...

Situated on [[Cape Breton Island]]'s east coast, it belongs administratively to the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]]. Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British, was incorporated as a city in 1904, and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional municipality.\n\nSydney served as the Cape Breton Island colony's capital, until 1820, when the colony merged with Nova Scotia and the capital moved to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].\n\nA rapid population expansion occurred just after the turn of the 20th century, when Sydney was home to one of North America's main steel mills. During both the First and Second World Wars, it was a major staging area for England-bound [[Order of battle for Convoy SC 7|convoys]]. The post-war period witnessed a major decline in the number of people employed at the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] (DOSCO) steel mill, and the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments had to [[nationalization|nationalize]] it in 1967 to save the region's biggest employer, forming the new crown corporation called the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]] (SYSCO).{{sfnp|Lebel|1967-10-18|pp=1,2}} The city's population has steadily decreased since the early 1970s due to the plant's fortunes, and SYSCO was finally closed in 2001. Today, the main industries are in customer support call centres and tourism. Together with [[Sydney Mines]], [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]], [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], and [[Glace Bay]], Sydney forms the [[Industrial Cape Breton]] region.\n\n==History==\n===Early history 1700s to 1899===\nPrior to a permanent settlement being established, there was significant activity along the shore. \nDuring the [[American Revolution]], on 1 November 1776, [[John Paul Jones]] \u2013 the father of the [[United States Navy|American Navy]] \u2013 set sail in command of ''Alfred'' to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the coal mines in eastern Cape Breton. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of the ''Mellish'', a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for [[John Burgoyne]]'s troops in Canada. A few years into the war there was also [[Action of 21 July 1781|a naval engagement]] between French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River (1781), Cape Breton.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=82}}  The French were recoaling their ships and defeated a British convoy. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.\n\nSydney was founded after the war by Colonel [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]], and named in honour of [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney]],{{sfnp|Brown|1922|p=140}}{{sfnp|Public Archives of Nova Scotia|1967|p=657}} who was serving as the [[Home Secretary]] in the British cabinet.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=64}}  Lord Sydney appointed Col. DesBarres lieutenant-governor of the new colony of [[Cape Breton Island]].{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=65}}  In November 1784 the 600-ton ship ''Blenheim'' landed a group that consisted primarily of English citizens and disbanded soldiers. A group of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] (which included [[David Mathews]], the former Mayor of [[New York City]] under the British), fleeing the aftermath of the [[American Revolution]], were added to the immigrants upon their arrival in the neighbouring colony of [[Nova Scotia]].  DesBarres arrived at Sydney on 7 January 1785.  He held the first meeting of his executive council on 21 February 1785, where he was proclaimed lieutenant-governor in a formal manner and the first minutes of the new colony were taken.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=66}}  The site DesBarres chose for the new settlement was along the Southwest Arm of Sydney Harbour,{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=66}} a drowned valley of the [[Sydney River]], which forms part of [[Spanish Bay (Nova Scotia)|Spanish Bay]]. Between 1784 and 1820, Sydney was the capital of the British colony of Cape Breton Island.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=92}} The colony was disbanded and merged with neighbouring Nova Scotia as part of the British government's desire to develop the abundant [[coal]] fields surrounding Sydney Harbour; the leases being held by the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]].{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=161}}  In 1826, the leases were transferred to the General Mining Association{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=162}} and industrial development around Sydney began to take shape.\n\n===Steel city 1900\u20131945===\nBy the early 20th century Sydney became home to one of the world's largest steel plants, fed by the numerous coal mines in the area under the ownership of the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] (DOSCO). Sydney's economy was a significant part of Industrial Cape Breton with its steel plant and harbour and railway connections adjoining the coal mining towns of [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]], [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], [[Sydney Mines]] and [[Reserve Mines]]. The economic boom brought about by industrialization saw the community incorporate as a city in 1903. The growth continued until the 1930s, with the [[Great Depression]] causing a slow down in production and growth. World War Two brought prosperity again for the plant, and the coal mines.\n[[File:Sydney Harbour aerial view.jpg|left|thumb|320px|Sydney Harbour aerial view looking towards the north-east.]]\nSydney Harbour played an important role during [[World War II]] once a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] base, {{HMCS|Protector}}, was established to stage supply [[convoy]]s bound for Europe. These convoys tended to be slower and had the prefix SC for Slow Convoy.{{sfnp|Caplan|1976|pp=27\u201440}} [[Convoy SC 7]] typified the dangers inherent with the [[Nazi]] [[U-boats]] off the coast of Cape Breton and Newfoundland during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], when 20 of the 35 merchant cargo vessels were sunk on their journey to England. Sydney Harbour was one of the hotspots of the [[Battle of the St. Lawrence]]. Two notable shipping attacks occurred during this battle: the sinking of the train ferry {{SS|Caribou}} in October 1942 on its way from North Sydney to [[Channel-Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]], Newfoundland;{{sfnp|Sarty|2012|pp=194, 209\u2014210, 213}} and the sinking of the Sydney-based HMCS ''Shawinigan''<!-- Currently there is no article for this particular ship, please do not wikilink it as it will point to the current vessel bearing that name. --> on 24 November 1944 in the Cabot Strait, near Cape North, on Cape Breton Island.{{sfnp|Sarty|2012|pp=284\u2014287}} Sydney's coal shipping and steel manufacturing made a significant contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, however federal Minister of Industry, [[C. D. Howe]] favoured Central Canada's steel industry given its proximity to a larger workforce and less exposure to coastal attack.\n\n===Post-war years 1950\u20132014===\nBy the late 1960s the coal and steel industries had fallen on hard times.{{sfnp|Star Staff|1967-11-23|p=1}} Friday, 13 October 1967, became known as \"Black Friday,\" so named after [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]], the plant's owners, announced they were closing it in April 1968.{{sfnp|Doyle|2011|p=220}} Both the provincial and federal government were involved in negotiating with the steel plant's owners, when Cape Breton's citizens held the largest protest in the city's history on 19 November 1967: \"The Parade of Concern.\"{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Around 20,000 people marched about a mile from the plant's gates to a horse racetrack to show their support for the steel plant.{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Newly appointed Nova Scotia premier [[George Isaac Smith|G.I. Smith]] and federal Health Minister, and Cape Breton MP, [[Allan MacEachen|Allan J. MacEachen]] spoke to the crowd and assured them that their respective governments were going to help.{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Four days later the Smith government announced that they were taking over the plant starting in 1968.{{sfnp|Special to the Star|1967-11-23|p=1}}\n\nBoth the steel and coal industries continued under government ownership for the rest of the 20th century. By the early 1990s, both industries were in trouble again, and were permanently closed by the end of 2001.\nForced to diversify its economy after the closures of the steel plant and coal industries, Sydney has examined a variety of economic development possibilities including tourism and culture, light manufacturing and information technology. Cleaning up the former steel plant, and the toxic [[Sydney Tar Ponds]] it left behind in Muggah's Creek, were a source of controversy due to its health effects on residents, although it has provided some employment since SYSCO closed.<ref>Walker, T.

Elevation ranges from [[sea level]] to {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.\n\nThe majority of properties within the former city limits have been impacted by development and an extensive urban road network.

By contrast, in most continental climates in the Northern Hemisphere, January is the coldest month, July the warmest.\n\nIn other respects, too, Sydney's climate varies significantly from that of other areas with humid continental climates. The most significant variations are that Sydney experiences unusually cool summers, and relatively windy, wet and stormy winters, relative to other humid-continental areas such as in the interior of North America. Annual temperatures are instead rather similar to areas around the [[Baltic Sea]] in north-eastern Europe at much higher latitudes, although Sydney's seasonal lag is stronger. Although Sydney has some maritime influence, similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic have significantly milder climates in all seasons except summer. Sydney is in the direct path of fall and winter storms (in the U.S., called nor'easters) migrating from the U.S. Northeastern and New England states; these storms can attain tremendous intensity by the time they approach Sydney, with high winds, heavy snow, ice and/or rain events common, primarily from October to March.  Summer thunderstorms are rare in Sydney, because nearby bodies of cool water sharply inhibit the combination of heat and humidity that fuels summer-season thunderstorms elsewhere (for example, the United States' central and southeastern states, and east-central and northern China). In recent years, possibly due to a warming climate, this has changed. In 2013 and 2016 Sydney was under a tornado watch as a result of unusually powerful thunderstorms. On August 8, 2014, a funnel cloud appeared near the Sydney Airport although no tornado warning or tornado watch was issued and the funnel did not actually touch down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/wild-weather-prompts-tornado-watch-in-cape-breton-1.3018730|title=Wild weather prompts tornado watch in Cape Breton {{!}} CTV News Atlantic|website=atlantic.ctvnews.ca|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capebretonpost.com/news/local/tornado-warning-has-ended-5027/|title=Tornado warning has ended {{!}} Cape Breton Post|website=www.capebretonpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1228180-stormy-weather-hits-nova-scotia|title=Stormy weather hits Nova Scotia|last=|first=|date=August 8, 2014|website=Herald News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811052900/http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1228180-stormy-weather-hits-nova-scotia|archive-date=August 11, 2014|url-status=|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile occasional thunderstorms and other rains can occur in summer, June through August are Sydney's driest months on average. Sydney's average annual precipitation cycle reflects these realities; the year's driest month, on average, is July; its wettest month, on average, is December. Average annual precipitation in Sydney is over 1500mm, virtually the highest found anywhere in Canada outside coastal British Columbia.  Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 300&nbsp;cm per winter season.  However, winter-season storms are variable, and can bring changing precipitation types, commonly from ice/snow to rain and possibly back to ice/snow.  As such, actual snow accumulation is variable.  A winter storm can bring accumulating snow, followed by heavy rain, then a brief return to snow or ice, resulting in no or minimal additional snow accumulation.  Overall, Sydney's climate is moderately cold and strikingly variable, wet, stormy and windy from fall to early spring (October to March), and more stable and drier in summer (June to August).\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = [[Sydney/J.A.

Harbour, a common sight during the summer months.]]\nSydney suffered an economic decline for several decades in the later part of the 20th century as local [[coal]] and [[steel]] industries underwent significant changes. The closure of the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]]'s steel mill and the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]]'s coal mines in 2000\u20132001 have resulted in attempts by the municipal, provincial and federal governments to diversify the area economy.\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, Sydney faces a significant challenge in the cleanup of the [[Sydney Tar Ponds]], a tidal estuary contaminated with a variety of coal-based wastes from coke ovens that supplied the steel industry. After extensive public consultation and technical study, a $400 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] cleanup plan jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments awaits further environmental assessment.\n\nIn one part of Whitney Pier, residents of Frederick St. discovered contamination within several homes and in surrounding soil, including a toxic orange substance oozing into local basements. Testing of the substance lasted over a year and many were outraged by delays, although some residents were subsequently relocated to a safer residential area nearby.\n\nHigh unemployment and lack of opportunities have resulted in many educated young people leaving the community for jobs in other parts of Canada and the US. Demographic changes, including an aging population and decrease in the birth rate have begun to affect the area's economic outlook. Specifically, many residents have opted to seek work in [[Alberta]] and [[Ontario]].\n\nSydney's economy was buoyed by the 2011 announcement of funding for the Sydney Harbour dredging project, which was completed in 2012. The dredge, which is expected to lead to commercialization of the port, is purported to create hundreds of jobs in the area, and position Sydney as a world-class harbour facility. Other important investments that have helped position Sydney as an eastern hub of Nova Scotia include the twinning of [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] and the creation of the Centre for Sustainability in the Environment at nearby [[Cape Breton University]], which draws hundreds of international students each year.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Sydney Fiddle.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The \"Largest Ceilidh Fiddle in the World\". Located at the Sydney waterfront.]]\nCape Breton Island has become home to a significant tourism industry, with Sydney (as the island's largest urban centre) being a prime beneficiary. Until the early 2000s when its economy was tied to the steel industry, Sydney had been overlooked as a tourist destination, with the more centrally located scenic village of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] being a preferred location for tourists transiting the [[Cabot Trail]]. However, Sydney has witnessed a revival as a result of significant government investment in [[cruise ship]] facilities and a waterfront revitalization plan which has seen a boardwalk and marinas constructed, and the world's largest fiddle. This funding is part of the post-industrial adjustment package offered by the federal and provincial governments.\n\nSydney's tourism draw is increasingly linked to its cultural asset as being the urban heart of Cape Breton Island. Its population is a diverse mixture of nationalities which contributes to various Scottish, Acadian, African Canadian and eastern European cultural events being held throughout the year. Sydney's accommodation sector is centrally located to attractions in [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]] (home of the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]]), [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] (home of the Glace Bay Miners Museum), [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] (home of the Alexander Graham Bell Museum), as well as popular touring destinations such as the Cabot Trail, [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]], and [[Bras d'Or Lake]].\n\n==Transportation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\nSydney is served by [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] which connects to [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]] and encircles the former city limits to its eastern terminus.

Situated on [[Cape Breton Island]]'s east coast, it belongs administratively to the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]]. Sydney was founded in 1785 by the British, was incorporated as a city in 1904, and dissolved on 1 August 1995, when it was amalgamated into the regional municipality.\n\nSydney served as the Cape Breton Island colony's capital, until 1820, when the colony merged with Nova Scotia and the capital moved to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].\n\nA rapid population expansion occurred just after the turn of the 20th century, when Sydney was home to one of North America's main steel mills. During both the First and Second World Wars, it was a major staging area for England-bound [[Order of battle for Convoy SC 7|convoys]]. The post-war period witnessed a major decline in the number of people employed at the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] (DOSCO) steel mill, and the Nova Scotia and Canadian governments had to [[nationalization|nationalize]] it in 1967 to save the region's biggest employer, forming the new crown corporation called the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]] (SYSCO).{{sfnp|Lebel|1967-10-18|pp=1,2}} The city's population has steadily decreased since the early 1970s due to the plant's fortunes, and SYSCO was finally closed in 2001. Today, the main industries are in customer support call centres and tourism. Together with [[Sydney Mines]], [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]], [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], and [[Glace Bay]], Sydney forms the [[Industrial Cape Breton]] region.\n\n==History==\n===Early history 1700s to 1899===\nPrior to a permanent settlement being established, there was significant activity along the shore. \nDuring the [[American Revolution]], on 1 November 1776, [[John Paul Jones]] - the father of the [[United States Navy|American Navy]] - set sail in command of ''Alfred'' to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the coal mines in eastern Cape Breton. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of the ''Mellish'', a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for [[John Burgoyne]]'s troops in Canada. A few years into the war there was also [[Action of 21 July 1781|a naval engagement]] between French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River (1781), Cape Breton.{{sfnp|Akins|1895|p=82}}  The French were recoaling their ships and defeated a British convoy. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.\n\nSydney was founded after the war by Colonel [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]], and named in honour of [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney]],{{sfnp|Brown|1922|p=140}}{{sfnp|Public Archives of Nova Scotia|1967|p=657}} who was serving as the [[Home Secretary]] in the British cabinet.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=64}}  Lord Sydney appointed Col. DesBarres lieutenant-governor of the new colony of [[Cape Breton Island]].{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=65}}  In November 1784 the 600-ton ship ''Blenheim'' landed a group that consisted primarily of English citizens and disbanded soldiers. A group of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] from the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] (which included [[David Mathews]], the former Mayor of [[New York City]] under the British), fleeing the aftermath of the [[American Revolution]], were added to the immigrants upon their arrival in the neighbouring colony of [[Nova Scotia]].  DesBarres arrived at Sydney on 7 January 1785.  He held the first meeting of his executive council on 21 February 1785, where he was proclaimed lieutenant-governor in a formal manner and the first minutes of the new colony were taken.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=66}}  The site DesBarres chose for the new settlement was along the Southwest Arm of Sydney Harbour,{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=66}} a drowned valley of the [[Sydney River]], which forms part of [[Spanish Bay (Nova Scotia)|Spanish Bay]]. Between 1784 and 1820, Sydney was the capital of the British colony of Cape Breton Island.{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=92}} The colony was disbanded and merged with neighbouring Nova Scotia as part of the British government's desire to develop the abundant [[coal]] fields surrounding Sydney Harbour; the leases being held by the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]].{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=161}}  In 1826, the leases were transferred to the General Mining Association{{sfnp|Morgan|2008|p=162}} and industrial development around Sydney began to take shape.\n\n===Steel city 1900\u20131945===\nBy the early 20th century Sydney became home to one of the world's largest steel plants, fed by the numerous coal mines in the area under the ownership of the [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] (DOSCO). Sydney's economy was a significant part of Industrial Cape Breton with its steel plant and harbour and railway connections adjoining the coal mining towns of [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]], [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], [[Sydney Mines]] and [[Reserve Mines]]. The economic boom brought about by industrialization saw the community incorporate as a city in 1903. The growth continued until the 1930s, with the [[Great Depression]] causing a slow down in production and growth. World War Two brought prosperity again for the plant, and the coal mines.\n[[File:Sydney Harbour aerial view.jpg|left|thumb|320px|Sydney Harbour aerial view looking towards the north-east.]]\nSydney Harbour played an important role during [[World War II]] once a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] base, {{HMCS|Protector}}, was established to stage supply [[convoy]]s bound for Europe. These convoys tended to be slower and had the prefix SC for Slow Convoy.{{sfnp|Caplan|1976|pp=27\u201440}} [[Convoy SC 7]] typified the dangers inherent with the [[Nazi]] [[U-boats]] off the coast of Cape Breton and Newfoundland during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], when 20 of the 35 merchant cargo vessels were sunk on their journey to England. Sydney Harbour was one of the hotspots of the [[Battle of the St. Lawrence]]. Two notable shipping attacks occurred during this battle: the sinking of the train ferry {{SS|Caribou}} in October 1942 on its way from North Sydney to [[Channel-Port aux Basques|Port aux Basques]], Newfoundland;{{sfnp|Sarty|2012|pp=194, 209\u2014210, 213}} and the sinking of the Sydney-based HMCS ''Shawinigan''<!-- Currently there is no article for this particular ship, please do not wikilink it as it will point to the current vessel bearing that name. --> on 24 November 1944 in the Cabot Strait, near Cape North, on Cape Breton Island.{{sfnp|Sarty|2012|pp=284\u2014287}} Sydney's coal shipping and steel manufacturing made a significant contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, however federal Minister of Industry, [[C. D. Howe]] favoured Central Canada's steel industry given its proximity to a larger workforce and less exposure to coastal attack.\n\n===Post-war years 1950\u20132014===\nBy the late 1960s the coal and steel industries had fallen on hard times.{{sfnp|Star Staff|1967-11-23|p=1}} Friday, 13 October 1967, became known as \"Black Friday,\" so named after [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]], the plant's owners, announced they were closing it in April 1968.{{sfnp|Doyle|2011|p=220}} Both the provincial and federal government were involved in negotiating with the steel plant's owners, when Cape Breton's citizens held the largest protest in the city's history on 19 November 1967: \"The Parade of Concern.\"{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Around 20,000 people marched about a mile from the plant's gates to a horse racetrack to show their support for the steel plant.{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Newly appointed Nova Scotia premier [[George Isaac Smith|G.I. Smith]] and federal Health Minister, and Cape Breton MP, [[Allan MacEachen|Allan J. MacEachen]] spoke to the crowd and assured them that their respective governments were going to help.{{sfnp|CP Special|1967-11-20|p=5}} Four days later the Smith government announced that they were taking over the plant starting in 1968.{{sfnp|Special to the Star|1967-11-23|p=1}}\n\nBoth the steel and coal industries continued under government ownership for the rest of the 20th century. By the early 1990s, both industries were in trouble again, and were permanently closed by the end of 2001.\nForced to diversify its economy after the closures of the steel plant and coal industries, Sydney has examined a variety of economic development possibilities including tourism and culture, light manufacturing and information technology. Cleaning up the former steel plant, and the toxic [[Sydney Tar Ponds]] it left behind in Muggah's Creek, were a source of controversy due to its health effects on residents, although it has provided some employment since SYSCO closed.<ref>Walker, T.

Elevation ranges from [[sea level]] to {{convert|66|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.\n\nThe majority of properties within the former city limits have been impacted by development and an extensive urban road network.  The central business district is located on a peninsula extending into South Arm formed by Sydney River on the west side and Muggah Creek on the east side.  The largest park within the former city limits is Open Hearth Park.\n\nDistinctive neighbourhoods include Whitney Pier in the north east end next to the former steel plant site,  Ashby in the east end, Hardwood Hill in the south end and the \"North End\" located on the peninsula which contains the Holy Angels convent and the Sydney Garrison known as Victoria Park, headquarters of the Cape Breton Highlanders reserve infantry regiment. The former city completely encircles the [[Membertou First Nation]] (First Nations Reserve 28A and 28B).\n\n===Climate===\nSydney experiences a cool summer, and windy, wet and stormy winter, version of a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb'') that is significantly moderated by the community's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.{{sfnp|Deibel|2012}} The highest temperature ever recorded in Sydney was {{convert|36.7|C|0}} on 18 August 1935.<ref name=\"August 1935\">{{Cite web| work = Canadian Climate Data\n  | title = August 1935\n  | publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n  | date= September 22, 2015\n  | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1870-01-01%7C1941-03-31&mlyRange=1870-01-01%7C1941-12-01&StationID=6485&Prov=NS&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=1&searchMethod=contains&Month=8&Day=4&txtStationName=sydney&timeframe=2&Year=1935\n  | accessdate = March 2, 2016}}</ref> The lowest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-31.7|C|0}} on 31 January 1873, 29 January 1877 and 15 February 1916.<ref name=\"January 1873\">{{Cite web| work = Canadian Climate Data\n  | title = January 1873\n  | publisher = Environment Canada\n  | date= September 22, 2015\n  | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1870-01-01%7C1941-03-31&mlyRange=1870-01-01%7C1941-12-01&StationID=6485&Prov=NS&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=1&searchMethod=contains&txtStationName=sydney&timeframe=2&Year=1873&Month=1#\n  | accessdate = March 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"January 1877\">{{Cite web| work = Canadian Climate Data\n  | title = January 1877\n  | publisher = Environment Canada\n  | date= September 26, 2016\n  | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1870-01-01%7C1941-03-31&mlyRange=1870-01-01%7C1941-12-01&StationID=6485&Prov=NS&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=1&searchMethod=contains&txtStationName=sydney+&timeframe=2&Year=1877&Month=1&Day=1\n  | accessdate = March 2, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"February 1916\">{{Cite web| work = Canadian Climate Data\n  | title = February 1916\n  | publisher = Environment Canada\n  | date= September 22, 2015\n  | url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1870-01-01%7C1941-03-31&mlyRange=1870-01-01%7C1941-12-01&StationID=6485&Prov=NS&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=1&searchMethod=contains&txtStationName=sydney&timeframe=2&Year=1916&Month=2#\n  | accessdate = March 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDue to the relatively strong influence from large bodies of water, Sydney experiences strong [[seasonal lag]], meaning February is the year's coldest month on average, and August is the year's warmest month on average.  By contrast, in most continental climates in the Northern Hemisphere, January is the coldest month, July the warmest.\n\nIn other respects, too, Sydney's climate varies significantly from that of other areas with humid continental climates. The most significant variations are that Sydney experiences unusually cool summers, and relatively windy, wet and stormy winters, relative to other humid-continental areas such as in the interior of North America. Annual temperatures are instead rather similar to areas around the [[Baltic Sea]] in north-eastern Europe at much higher latitudes, although Sydney's seasonal lag is stronger. Although Sydney has some maritime influence, similar latitudes on the other side of the Atlantic have significantly milder climates in all seasons except summer. Sydney is in the direct path of fall and winter storms (in the U.S., called nor'easters) migrating from the U.S. Northeastern and New England states; these storms can attain tremendous intensity by the time they approach Sydney, with high winds, heavy snow, ice and/or rain events common, primarily from October to March.  Summer thunderstorms are rare in Sydney, because nearby bodies of cool water sharply inhibit the combination of heat and humidity that fuels summer-season thunderstorms elsewhere (for example, the United States' central and southeastern states, and east-central and northern China). In recent years, possibly due to a warming climate, this has changed. In 2013 and 2016 Sydney was under a tornado watch as a result of unusually powerful thunderstorms. On August 8, 2014, a funnel cloud appeared near the Sydney Airport although no tornado warning or tornado watch was issued and the funnel did not actually touch down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/wild-weather-prompts-tornado-watch-in-cape-breton-1.3018730|title=Wild weather prompts tornado watch in Cape Breton {{!}} CTV News Atlantic|website=atlantic.ctvnews.ca|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capebretonpost.com/news/local/tornado-warning-has-ended-5027/|title=Tornado warning has ended {{!}} Cape Breton Post|website=www.capebretonpost.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1228180-stormy-weather-hits-nova-scotia|title=Stormy weather hits Nova Scotia|last=|first=|date=August 8, 2014|website=Herald News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811052900/http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1228180-stormy-weather-hits-nova-scotia|archive-date=August 11, 2014|url-status=|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile occasional thunderstorms and other rains can occur in summer, June through August are Sydney's driest months on average. Sydney's average annual precipitation cycle reflects these realities; the year's driest month, on average, is July; its wettest month, on average, is December. Average annual precipitation in Sydney is over 1500mm, virtually the highest found anywhere in Canada outside coastal British Columbia.  Snowfall is heavy, averaging nearly 300&nbsp;cm per winter season.  However, winter-season storms are variable, and can bring changing precipitation types, commonly from ice/snow to rain and possibly back to ice/snow.  As such, actual snow accumulation is variable.  A winter storm can bring accumulating snow, followed by heavy rain, then a brief return to snow or ice, resulting in no or minimal additional snow accumulation.  Overall, Sydney's climate is moderately cold and strikingly variable, wet, stormy and windy from fall to early spring (October to March), and more stable and drier in summer (June to August).\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = [[Sydney/J.A.

Harbour, a common sight during the summer months.]]\nSydney suffered an economic decline for several decades in the later part of the 20th century as local [[coal]] and [[steel]] industries underwent significant changes. The closure of the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]]'s steel mill and the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]]'s coal mines in 2000-2001 have resulted in attempts by the municipal, provincial and federal governments to diversify the area economy.\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, Sydney faces a significant challenge in the cleanup of the [[Sydney Tar Ponds]], a tidal estuary contaminated with a variety of coal-based wastes from coke ovens that supplied the steel industry. After extensive public consultation and technical study, a $400 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] cleanup plan jointly funded by the federal and provincial governments awaits further environmental assessment.\n\nIn one part of Whitney Pier, residents of Frederick St. discovered contamination within several homes and in surrounding soil, including a toxic orange substance oozing into local basements. Testing of the substance lasted over a year and many were outraged by delays, although some residents were subsequently relocated to a safer residential area nearby.\n\nHigh unemployment and lack of opportunities have resulted in many educated young people leaving the community for jobs in other parts of Canada and the US. Demographic changes, including an aging population and decrease in the birth rate have begun to affect the area's economic outlook. Specifically, many residents have opted to seek work in [[Alberta]] and [[Ontario]].\n\nSydney's economy was buoyed by the 2011 announcement of funding for the Sydney Harbour dredging project, which was completed in 2012. The dredge, which is expected to lead to commercialization of the port, is purported to create hundreds of jobs in the area, and position Sydney as a world-class harbour facility. Other important investments that have helped position Sydney as an eastern hub of Nova Scotia include the twinning of [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] and the creation of the Centre for Sustainability in the Environment at nearby [[Cape Breton University]], which draws hundreds of international students each year.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:Sydney Fiddle.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The \"Largest Ceilidh Fiddle in the World\". Located at the Sydney waterfront.]]\nCape Breton Island has become home to a significant tourism industry, with Sydney (as the island's largest urban centre) being a prime beneficiary. Until the early 2000s when its economy was tied to the steel industry, Sydney had been overlooked as a tourist destination, with the more centrally located scenic village of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] being a preferred location for tourists transiting the [[Cabot Trail]]. However, Sydney has witnessed a revival as a result of significant government investment in [[cruise ship]] facilities and a waterfront revitalization plan which has seen a boardwalk and marinas constructed, and the world's largest fiddle. This funding is part of the post-industrial adjustment package offered by the federal and provincial governments.\n\nSydney's tourism draw is increasingly linked to its cultural asset as being the urban heart of Cape Breton Island. Its population is a diverse mixture of nationalities which contributes to various Scottish, Acadian, African Canadian and eastern European cultural events being held throughout the year. Sydney's accommodation sector is centrally located to attractions in [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]] (home of the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]]), [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] (home of the Glace Bay Miners Museum), [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] (home of the Alexander Graham Bell Museum), as well as popular touring destinations such as the Cabot Trail, [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]], and [[Bras d'Or Lake]].\n\n==Transportation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2012}}\nSydney is served by [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] which connects to [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]] and encircles the former city limits to its eastern terminus.  [[Nova Scotia Trunk 4|Trunk 4]] forms an important secondary road in Sydney running along the Sydney River, connecting to [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]].  [[Nova Scotia Trunk 22|Trunk 22]], connecting to [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]], and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 28|Trunk 28]], connecting [[Whitney Pier]] through to [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]], form minor secondary roads.\n\n===Public transportation===\n[[Transit Cape Breton]] is owned and operated by the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] and provides bus services in the eastern part of the municipality, which includes Sydney.\n\nTransit Cape Breton also operates \"Handi-Trans\" for passengers whose disabilities restrict them from using regular bus services.\n\nTransit fares are $1.25 per zone travelled, or $1.00 for seniors 55 & up and children 5-12. Depending on the number of zones travelled, the cost of riding the bus can range from $1.00 to $5.00.<ref>[http://www.cbrm.ns.ca/transit.html]</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nSydney is home to two private freight railway companies.  The [[Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway]] makes Sydney its eastern terminus and provides rail connections to [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] in [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]] via [[Port Hawkesbury]].  The [[Sydney Coal Railway]] connects a bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier with the [[Lingan Generating Station]] in [[Lingan, Nova Scotia|Lingan]].  Daily passenger rail service was provided by [[Via Rail|Via Rail Canada]] until budget cuts on January 15, 1990.  A weekly tourist train, the ''[[Bras d'Or (passenger train)|Bras d'Or]]'' was operated by Via Rail Canada from 2000 to 2004 until being discontinued.\n\n===Sea===\nSydney's port facilities include the privately owned bulk coal unloading pier in Whitney Pier as well as the publicly owned Sydney Marine Terminal at the northern edge of the central business district.  A recently opened cruise ship pavilion welcomes several dozen [[cruise ship]]s every year, with the majority visiting in late summer or early fall to take in [[fall foliage]] tours.  Other port facilities on Sydney Harbour are located outside the former city limits in [[Point Edward, Nova Scotia|Point Edward]] (Sydport) and [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]] ([[Marine Atlantic]] ferry terminal).\n\n===Airport===\nThe [[Sydney/J.A. Douglas McCurdy Airport|J.A. Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport]] is located several kilometres outside the former city limits in the neighbouring community of Reserve Mines. The number of flights each day vary by season. Presently [[Jazz (airline)|Air Canada Express]] operates 3 flights daily<ref name=\"Flights\">{{cite web |title=Flights |url=http://www.sydneyairport.ca/sydair/flights |website=JA Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport |publisher=Sydney Airport Authority |accessdate=24 January 2020 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with direct service to [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport|Halifax]] and [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto]]<ref name=\"Toronto\">{{cite web |title=Air Canada Early Morning Direct Service to Toronto Starts Dec 15th |url=http://www.sydneyairport.ca/content/air-canada-early-morning-direct-service-toronto-starts-dec-15th |website=JA Douglas McCurdy Sydney Airport |publisher=Sydney Airport Authority |accessdate=24 January 2020 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> using [[Dash-8]] and [[Embraer 175]] aircraft.
