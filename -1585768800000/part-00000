From 1990 to 2000, Marana was the fourth fastest-growing place among all cities and towns in Arizona of any size.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==History==\nArchaeologists have found evidence of about 4,200 years of continuous human settlement in the vicinity of Marana and the middle [[Santa Cruz Valley]].  Many important archaeological sites have been found near Marana.  \n*[[Las Capas]], a large, early agricultural site, is related to the nearby Costello-King site near present-day Ina Road and the [[Interstate 10]] interchange.  It was occupied from 4,200 to 2,500 years ago.  It is the site of the oldest-known cemetery in the [[American Southwest]] and the oldest-known canals in North America. The oldest tobacco pipes in the world were found here.\n*[[Los Morteros]], a [[Hohokam]] ballcourt village ruin, is located on the Santa Cruz floodplain near the Point of the Mountain at the northern end of the [[Tucson Mountains]]. Los Morteros has also been identified as the probable location of the Llano del Azotado campsite used by the [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] expedition in 1775, which was chronicled. The location is near the present-day Arizona Portland Cement Plant in the Town of Marana.\n*[[Linda Vista Hill]], dating between 1200 and 1350 A.D., is a [[Trincheras]] culture site in the Tucson Mountains. The people inhabited mountain slopes overlooking arable land along streams.  The hillside site has more than 150 terraces and 75 pit-houses excavated into the terraces. A massive, adobe-walled compound is located on the hill summit.\n*[[Marana Mound]], dating between 1150 and 1300 A.D., is the remnant of a large [[platform mound]] that was the center of the Hohokam community. The people lived between the Santa Cruz River and the [[Tortolita Mountains]]. The mound is surrounded by an adobe compound wall. Multiple rooms were constructed against the wall and were associated with 30-35 nearby residential compounds. Multiple house features have been found both inside and outside the compounds, as well as wall segments, and trash mounds.  The whole complex covers an area of approximately one square mile.\n*In 1775, [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], Captain of the Presidio of Tubac, led an expedition north along the Santa Cruz River to found the city of San Francisco. His group of about 200 included 30 soldiers and their families and a number of escorts. They brought more than 1,000 head of livestock. Their campsite was developed in the 20th century as the CalPortland Cement Plant near Marana. A {{convert|15|mi|km|adj=on}} segment of the route which the expedition took through Marana is designated as part of the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail]].\n*[[Pointer Mountain Station]], of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] [[stagecoach]] line used from 1858, was found during the study of Los Morteros, within the limits of the nearby Puerta del Norte trailer court.<ref>[http://www.marana.com/documentview.aspx?DID=115 Marana History Pamphlet (673 KB)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927011826/http://www.marana.com/documentview.aspx?DID=115 |date=2011-09-27 }} from [http://www.marana.com Marana, Arizona city website] accessed 7/3/2011.</ref>\n\nSpanish colonists began to inhabit this area in the 17th and 18th centuries. Over time they intermarried with Native American and a class of [[mestizo]] settlers also developed. From the early years, mining and ranching were the chief economic activities. The area became part of the independent Mexican Empire established in 1821 (soon replaced by the Republic of Mexico). \n\n===US territory===\nMore than two decades later, the United States acquired this territory as part of the [[Gadsden Purchase]]; it was not part of the [[Mexican Cession]] following the defeat in the Mexican-American War, ending in 1848.  \n\n===20th-century pioneers===\nAccording to historian David Leighton, Charles B. Anway was the first member of the Anway family in the Tucson area; from the eastern United States, he came because the dry mountain air was thought to be beneficial for people suffering from [[tuberculosis]], as he was. Antibiotics were not yet in general use to treat this disease, which had a high mortality rate and no known cure. In 1919, his brother William and his two children Louis and Ila arrived in town, but they decided to settle in an area northwest of Tucson called [[Postvale, Arizona]]. \n\nIn 1920, the longtime widower William Anway married Orpha Ralston. She had been a member for many years in the Postvale Co-operative Women's Club. This group lobbied to have the local post office renamed from Postvale to Marana; in time, the town was also named as Marana.<ref>[http://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-pioneering-avra-valley-farmer-created-anway-road/article_9cda8d1c-dce2-50c0-bd6d-963f51b551a3.html David Leighton, \"Street Smarts: Pioneering Avra Valley farmer created Anway Road\"], ''Arizona Daily Star,'' March 5, 2017</ref>\n\n\nMarana did not become developed primarily as an agricultural center, until after World War I. It has produced commodity crops of cotton, wheat, barley, alfalfa and pecans.\n\nDuring World War II, the Army built facilities here to support the military effort. Before the Air Force was established, the Army built and operated the Marana Airfield (1942-'45). It became the largest pilot-training center in the world, training some 10,000 flyers. \n\nIn the postwar years, five [[Titan missile]] sites were constructed in the area as part of a complex of [[ballistic missile]] installations built around Tucson. This was during the [[Cold War]] when tensions were high with the Soviet Union. \n\nIn March 1977, the Town incorporated about {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} and in August of that year, the 1,500 residents elected their first town council. In early 1979, the town began to grow through a targeted annexation policy. It now measures a little more than {{convert|120|sqmi|km2}} with a population of over 43,000.\n\n===Annexation===\nThe southern portion of Marana has grown considerably since the early 1990s, with the addition of businesses and some housing, much of it due to annexation of existing unincorporated areas. In 1992, the Marana Town Council voted to annex an area of unincorporated Pima County that was located to the southeast of the town limits. The area selected was a narrow corridor of land along Interstate 10,  to the east along Ina Road, and south along Thornydale Road. These areas were mainly developed as high-density commercial businesses and shopping centers, including large retailers or \"big box\" stores such as Super [[KMart]] (now closed), [[Costco Wholesale]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Home Depot]]. Marana chose these areas to annex to increase its revenue from sales taxes.<ref>[http://www.tekwriteservices.com/docs/brochure_for_marana_az.pdf<!-- Bot generated title --> Tekwriteservices.com] {{Cite web |url=http://www.tekwriteservices.com/docs/brochure_for_marana_az.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716203048/http://www.tekwriteservices.com/docs/brochure_for_marana_az.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tw/09-21-95/skinny.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> Tucsonweekly.com]</ref>  The large residential areas behind these commercial areas, which required support for residents, such as schools and roads, were not annexed.<ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/public/packages/incorporation/tor8-27.htm PLWeb Document Display<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212094553/http://www.azstarnet.com/public/packages/incorporation/tor8-27.htm |date=2005-02-12 }}.</ref><ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/public/packages/booming_northwest/7685.htm Annexations by northwest towns pinching Tucson<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050904154358/http://www.azstarnet.com/public/packages/booming_northwest/7685.htm |date=2005-09-04 }}.</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city of Tucson filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for the County of Pima (''City of Tucson v Town of Marana'') claiming that Marana illegally annexed the unincorporated areas in violation of existing state laws. However, on April 4, 1994, Judge Lina Rodriguez ruled in favor of Marana, allowing the annexation to stand.<ref>\"Marana's Thornydale-area annexation is upheld,\" ''Arizona Daily Star'' (April 4, 1994)</ref> Following this suit, the Arizona State annexation laws were changed, forbidding municipalities from annexing small strips of land without taking large surrounding parcels as well.

The town has a history of farming and ranching. The [[Tucson Mountains]] and the western half of [[Saguaro National Park]] are located to the south. [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] is approximately 90 minutes north  via Interstate 10.\n\n==Climate==\nMarana has a hot semi-arid climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] BSh). This is characterized by hot summers and relatively mild winters. The area averages only 12.19 inches (310 mm) of annual rainfall. During the dry and sunny winter months, daytime highs usually reach between 60\u00b0F and 70\u00b0F (16\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C), with temperatures cooling to well below 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C), and sometimes below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) during the night. Temperatures below the [[freezing]] mark are not uncommon during this period. In the summer, high temperatures range between 95\u00b0F and 105\u00b0F (35\u00b0C and 41\u00b0C), with nights cooling down to around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). The occasional [[heat wave]] can cause temperatures to soar above 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) for multiple days during the hot summer months. [[Rain]] is much more frequent during the summer due to the [[North American Monsoon]], and is sometimes accompanied by high winds and thunderstorms.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Marana, AZ\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  87\n|Feb record high F =  90\n|Mar record high F =  97\n|Apr record high F = 104\n|May record high F = 108\n|Jun record high F = 115\n|Jul record high F = 114\n|Aug record high F = 113\n|Sep record high F = 109\n|Oct record high F = 106\n|Nov record high F =  95\n|Dec record high F =  88\n|year record high F =115\n|Jan high F =  66\n|Feb high F =  69\n|Mar high F =  75\n|Apr high F =  83\n|May high F =  92\n|Jun high F = 101\n|Jul high F = 101\n|Aug high F = 99\n|Sep high F = 96\n|Oct high F =  86\n|Nov high F =  75\n|Dec high F =  66\n|year high F =\n|Jan low F = 39\n|Feb low F = 42\n|Mar low F = 46\n|Apr low F = 52\n|May low F = 61\n|Jun low F = 69\n|Jul low F = 74\n|Aug low F = 72\n|Sep low F = 68\n|Oct low F = 57\n|Nov low F = 46\n|Dec low F = 39\n|year low F =\n|Jan record low F =  15\n|Feb record low F =  19\n|Mar record low F =  26\n|Apr record low F =  27\n|May record low F =  42\n|Jun record low F =  51\n|Jul record low F =  51\n|Aug record low F =  46\n|Sep record low F =  46\n|Oct record low F =  35\n|Nov record low F =  26\n|Dec record low F =  21\n|year record low F = \n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 1.01\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.03\n|Mar precipitation inch = 0.93\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.34\n|May precipitation inch = 0.24\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.17\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.10\n|Aug precipitation inch = 2.47\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.33\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.86\n|Nov precipitation inch = 0.58\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1.13\n|year precipitation inch = 12.19\n|source 1 = The Weather Channel<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/USAZ0129:1:US|title= Monthly Averages for Marana, AZ | publisher=Weather.com |year=2018 |accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref>\n|date=August 2018\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 1154\n|1980= 1674\n|1990= 2187\n|2000= 13556\n|2010= 34961\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=47007\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 34,961 people, 11,759 households, and 8,871 families residing in the town.

Held in late February, the event included the world's top 64 professional golfers. [[Henrik Stenson]] won the inaugural event, and [[Tiger Woods]] won in 2008. [[Geoff Ogilvy]] won the 2009 event. [[Ian Poulter]] won the 2010 event and [[Luke Donald]] took the 2011 title. The tournament remained in Marana through 2014. (In September 2014, Cadillac was announced as the new title sponsor for 2015, and the event was moved to San Francisco's [[TPC Harding Park]] golf course.)\n*[[Pinal Airpark]] ([[Evergreen International Aviation]]) is located just north of Marana in [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal County]].  Many commercial [[airline]]s send their airplanes to this site for storage. It was well known in the 1970s and 1980s as an air base for the [[CIA]].  The airport was said to be a [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] [[Aerial firefighting|air tanker]] base, but when a series of [[forest fire]]s broke out in the mountains surrounding Tucson in the early 1970s, Airpark officials had to admit that these places were not Forest Service tankers. Locals had asked for them to put out the fires.  Airpark officials said these were actually [[paramilitary]] cargo planes.

Census|2010 census]], the population of the town is 34,961. From 1990 to 2000, Marana was the fourth fastest-growing place among all cities and towns in Arizona of any size.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==History==\nArchaeologists have found evidence of about 4,200 years of continuous human settlement in the vicinity of Marana and the middle [[Santa Cruz Valley]].  Many important archaeological sites have been found near Marana.  \n*[[Las Capas]], a large, early agricultural site, is related to the nearby Costello-King site near present-day Ina Road and the [[Interstate 10]] interchange.  It was occupied from 4,200 to 2,500 years ago.  It is the site of the oldest-known cemetery in the [[American Southwest]] and the oldest-known canals in North America. The oldest tobacco pipes in the world were found here.\n*[[Los Morteros]], a [[Hohokam]] ballcourt village ruin, is located on the Santa Cruz floodplain near the Point of the Mountain at the northern end of the [[Tucson Mountains]]. Los Morteros has also been identified as the probable location of the Llano del Azotado campsite used by the [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] expedition in 1775, which was chronicled. The location is near the present-day Arizona Portland Cement Plant in the Town of Marana.\n*[[Linda Vista Hill]], dating between 1200 and 1350 A.D., is a [[Trincheras]] culture site in the Tucson Mountains. The people inhabited mountain slopes overlooking arable land along streams.  The hillside site has more than 150 terraces and 75 pit-houses excavated into the terraces. A massive, adobe-walled compound is located on the hill summit.\n*[[Marana Mound]], dating between 1150 and 1300 A.D., is the remnant of a large [[platform mound]] that was the center of the Hohokam community. The people lived between the Santa Cruz River and the [[Tortolita Mountains]]. The mound is surrounded by an adobe compound wall. Multiple rooms were constructed against the wall and were associated with 30-35 nearby residential compounds. Multiple house features have been found both inside and outside the compounds, as well as wall segments, and trash mounds.  The whole complex covers an area of approximately one square mile.\n*In 1775, [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], Captain of the Presidio of Tubac, led an expedition north along the Santa Cruz River to found the city of San Francisco. His group of about 200 included 30 soldiers and their families and a number of escorts. They brought more than 1,000 head of livestock. Their campsite was developed in the 20th century as the CalPortland Cement Plant near Marana. A {{convert|15|mi|km|adj=on}} segment of the route which the expedition took through Marana is designated as part of the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail]].\n*[[Pointer Mountain Station]], of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] [[stagecoach]] line used from 1858, was found during the study of Los Morteros, within the limits of the nearby Puerta del Norte trailer court.<ref>[http://www.marana.com/documentview.aspx?DID=115 Marana History Pamphlet (673 KB)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927011826/http://www.marana.com/documentview.aspx?DID=115 |date=2011-09-27 }} from [http://www.marana.com Marana, Arizona city website] accessed 7/3/2011.</ref>\n\nSpanish colonists began to inhabit this area in the 17th and 18th centuries. Over time they intermarried with Native American and a class of [[mestizo]] settlers also developed. From the early years, mining and ranching were the chief economic activities. The area became part of the independent Mexican Empire established in 1821 (soon replaced by the Republic of Mexico). \n\n===US territory===\nMore than two decades later, the United States acquired this territory as part of the [[Gadsden Purchase]]; it was not part of the [[Mexican Cession]] following the defeat in the Mexican-American War, ending in 1848.  \n\n===20th-century pioneers===\nAccording to historian David Leighton, Charles B. Anway was the first member of the Anway family in the Tucson area; from the eastern United States, he came because the dry mountain air was thought to be beneficial for people suffering from [[tuberculosis]], as he was. Antibiotics were not yet in general use to treat this disease, which had a high mortality rate and no known cure. In 1919, his brother William and his two children Louis and Ila arrived in town, but they decided to settle in an area northwest of Tucson called [[Postvale, Arizona]]. \n\nIn 1920, the longtime widower William Anway married Orpha Ralston. She had been a member for many years in the Postvale Co-operative Women's Club. This group lobbied to have the local post office renamed from Postvale to Marana; in time, the town was also named as Marana.<ref>[http://tucson.com/news/local/street-smarts-pioneering-avra-valley-farmer-created-anway-road/article_9cda8d1c-dce2-50c0-bd6d-963f51b551a3.html David Leighton, \"Street Smarts: Pioneering Avra Valley farmer created Anway Road\"], ''Arizona Daily Star,'' March 5, 2017</ref>\n\n\nMarana did not become developed primarily as an agricultural center, until after World War I. It has produced commodity crops of cotton, wheat, barley, alfalfa and pecans.\n\nDuring World War II, the Army built facilities here to support the military effort. Before the Air Force was established, the Army built and operated the Marana Airfield (1942-'45). It became the largest pilot-training center in the world, training some 10,000 flyers. \n\nIn the postwar years, five [[Titan missile]] sites were constructed in the area as part of a complex of [[ballistic missile]] installations built around Tucson. This was during the [[Cold War]] when tensions were high with the Soviet Union. \n\nIn March 1977, the Town incorporated about {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} and in August of that year, the 1,500 residents elected their first town council. In early 1979, the town began to grow through a targeted annexation policy. It now measures a little more than {{convert|120|sqmi|km2}} with a population of over 43,000.\n\n===Annexation===\nThe southern portion of Marana has grown considerably since the early 1990s, with the addition of businesses and some housing, much of it due to annexation of existing unincorporated areas. In 1992, the Marana Town Council voted to annex an area of unincorporated Pima County that was located to the southeast of the town limits. The area selected was a narrow corridor of land along Interstate 10,  to the east along Ina Road, and south along Thornydale Road. These areas were mainly developed as high-density commercial businesses and shopping centers, including large retailers or \"big box\" stores such as Super [[KMart]] (now closed), [[Costco Wholesale]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], and [[Home Depot]]. Marana chose these areas to annex to increase its revenue from sales taxes.<ref>[http://www.tekwriteservices.com/docs/brochure_for_marana_az.pdf<!-- Bot generated title --> Tekwriteservices.com] {{Cite web |url=http://www.tekwriteservices.com/docs/brochure_for_marana_az.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716203048/http://www.tekwriteservices.com/docs/brochure_for_marana_az.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tw/09-21-95/skinny.htm<!-- Bot generated title --> Tucsonweekly.com]</ref>  The large residential areas behind these commercial areas, which required support for residents, such as schools and roads, were not annexed.<ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/public/packages/incorporation/tor8-27.htm PLWeb Document Display<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212094553/http://www.azstarnet.com/public/packages/incorporation/tor8-27.htm |date=2005-02-12 }}.</ref><ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/public/packages/booming_northwest/7685.htm Annexations by northwest towns pinching Tucson<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050904154358/http://www.azstarnet.com/public/packages/booming_northwest/7685.htm |date=2005-09-04 }}.</ref>\n\nAs a result, the city of Tucson filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for the County of Pima (''City of Tucson v Town of Marana'') claiming that Marana illegally annexed the unincorporated areas in violation of existing state laws. However, on April 4, 1994, Judge Lina Rodriguez ruled in favor of Marana, allowing the annexation to stand.<ref>\"Marana's Thornydale-area annexation is upheld,\" ''Arizona Daily Star'' (April 4, 1994)</ref> Following this suit, the Arizona State annexation laws were changed, forbidding municipalities from annexing small strips of land without taking large surrounding parcels as well.

The town has a history of farming and ranching. The [[Tucson Mountains]] and the western half of [[Saguaro National Park]] are located to the south. [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] is approximately 90 minutes north  via Interstate 10.\n\n==Climate==\nMarana has a hot semi-arid climate ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] BSh). This is characterized by hot summers and relatively mild winters. The area averages only 12.19 inches (310 mm) of annual rainfall. During the dry and sunny winter months, daytime highs usually reach between 60\u00b0F and 70\u00b0F (16\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C), with temperatures cooling to well below 50\u00b0F (10\u00b0C), and sometimes below 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) during the night. Temperatures below the [[freezing]] mark are not uncommon during this period. In the summer, high temperatures range between 95\u00b0F and 105\u00b0F (35\u00b0C and 41\u00b0C), with nights cooling down to around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). The occasional [[heat wave]] can cause temperatures to soar above 110\u00b0F (43\u00b0C) for multiple days during the hot summer months. [[Rain]] is much more frequent during the summer due to the [[North American Monsoon]], and is sometimes accompanied by high winds and thunderstorms.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Marana, AZ\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  87\n|Feb record high F =  90\n|Mar record high F =  97\n|Apr record high F = 104\n|May record high F = 108\n|Jun record high F = 115\n|Jul record high F = 114\n|Aug record high F = 113\n|Sep record high F = 109\n|Oct record high F = 106\n|Nov record high F =  95\n|Dec record high F =  88\n|year record high F =115\n|Jan high F =  66\n|Feb high F =  69\n|Mar high F =  75\n|Apr high F =  83\n|May high F =  92\n|Jun high F = 101\n|Jul high F = 101\n|Aug high F = 99\n|Sep high F = 96\n|Oct high F =  86\n|Nov high F =  75\n|Dec high F =  66\n|year high F =\n|Jan low F = 39\n|Feb low F = 42\n|Mar low F = 46\n|Apr low F = 52\n|May low F = 61\n|Jun low F = 69\n|Jul low F = 74\n|Aug low F = 72\n|Sep low F = 68\n|Oct low F = 57\n|Nov low F = 46\n|Dec low F = 39\n|year low F =\n|Jan record low F =  15\n|Feb record low F =  19\n|Mar record low F =  26\n|Apr record low F =  27\n|May record low F =  42\n|Jun record low F =  51\n|Jul record low F =  51\n|Aug record low F =  46\n|Sep record low F =  46\n|Oct record low F =  35\n|Nov record low F =  26\n|Dec record low F =  21\n|year record low F = \n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 1.01\n|Feb precipitation inch = 1.03\n|Mar precipitation inch = 0.93\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.34\n|May precipitation inch = 0.24\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.17\n|Jul precipitation inch = 2.10\n|Aug precipitation inch = 2.47\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.33\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.86\n|Nov precipitation inch = 0.58\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1.13\n|year precipitation inch = 12.19\n|source 1 = The Weather Channel<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://weather.com/weather/monthly/l/USAZ0129:1:US|title= Monthly Averages for Marana, AZ | publisher=Weather.com |year=2018 |accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref>\n|date=August 2018\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1970= 1154\n|1980= 1674\n|1990= 2187\n|2000= 13556\n|2010= 34961\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=47007\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]] of 2010, there were 34,961 people, 11,759 households, and 8,871 families residing in the town.

Held in late February, the event included the world's top 64 professional golfers. [[Henrik Stenson]] won the inaugural event, and [[Tiger Woods]] won in 2008. [[Geoff Ogilvy]] won the 2009 event. [[Ian Poulter]] won the 2010 event and [[Luke Donald]] took the 2011 title. The tournament remained in Marana through 2014. (In September 2014, Cadillac was announced as the new title sponsor for 2015, and the event was moved to San Francisco's [[TPC Harding Park]] golf course.)\n*[[Pinal Airpark]] ([[Evergreen International Aviation]]) is located just north of Marana in [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal County]].  Many commercial [[airline]]s send their airplanes to this site for storage. It was well known in the 1970s and 1980s as an air base for the [[CIA]].  The airport was said to be a [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] [[Aerial firefighting|air tanker]] base, but when a series of [[forest fire]]s broke out in the mountains surrounding Tucson in the early 1970s, Airpark officials had to admit that these places were not Forest Service tankers. Locals had asked for them to put out the fires.  Airpark officials said these were actually [[paramilitary]] cargo planes. Access to the Airpark is stringently monitored.\n*[[Marana Regional Airport]] was purchased by the town from Pima County in 1999. It does not serve commercial airlines. Residents use the [[Tucson International Airport]] for commercial flights to other cities and areas. \n\n[[File:Marana AZ.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Sunset over Marana</center>]]\n\n==Education==\nMarana has a public school system consisting of 16 schools, which are coordinated by the [[Marana Unified School District]].  [[Flowing Wells Unified School District]] coordinates the education in the municipality's extreme southeastern section. Additionally, the portion of the town within Pinal County is served by [[Red Rock Elementary School District|Red Rock Elementary]] and [[Santa Cruz Valley Unified High School District|Santa Cruz Valley Unified High]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Marana, Arizona}}\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline|Marana, Arizona}}\n*[http://www.marana.com/ Town of Marana] - official site\n*[http://www.maranaweeklynews.com ''Marana News''] - local newspaper\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120326131754/http://riverviewcommunications.com/Documents/Marana%20Heritage%20Project%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Booklet.pdf \"Pioneering People on a Corridor of Change: Marana\u2019s Cultural Heritage\"], 26 March 2012\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111019074135/http://www.pima.gov/cmo/admin/Reports/ConservationReport/PDF/Chapters/Cultural/Los%20Morteros.pdf Cultural and Historic Resource Acquisitions, Los Morteros] accessed from [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527091346/http://pima.gov/ Pima County website]\n{{Clear}}\n{{Cities of Pima County, Arizona}}\n{{Butterfield3}}\n{{Authority Control}}\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1977]]\n[[Category:Towns in Pima County, Arizona]]\n[[Category:Populated places in the Sonoran Desert]]\n[[Category:Towns in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Butterfield Overland Mail in New Mexico Territory]]\n[[Category:1977 establishments in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Stagecoach stops in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Lam-ang", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed GNIS ID, remove file prefix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marana,_Arizona"}

Born into a family of political and civic activists in the parish of [[Saint Lucy, Barbados|Saint Lucy]], he became a WWII aviator, combat veteran, lawyer, politician, gourmet cook and author. \n\n==Errol Walton Barrow's early life==\n\nErrol Walton Barrow was born January 21<sup>st</sup> 1920 in St. Lucy Barbados, the fourth of five children born to the Rev. Reginald Grant Barrow (1889\u20131980) and his wife Ruth Albertha (nee O'Neal) (1884-1939). Ruth was the daughter of a prosperous blacksmith whose success allowed him to purchase the plantation at St. Lucy where Errol was later born.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The life and times of Errol Barrow|last=Morgan|first=Peter|publisher=Caribbean Communications Inc.|year=1994|isbn=|location=Bridgetown, Barbados|pages=12, 13}}</ref>\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nReverend Barrow, an Anglican priest, had been appointed headmaster of the Alleyne school after his sermons as curate of St Lucy parish church brought him into conflict with the island\u2019s ruling class and church hierarchy. His removal from the pulpit did not succeed in curtailing his advocacy and agitation on behalf of poor black laborers on the island. In 1919 after he challenged the financial misappropriations of the white planters who oversaw the school\u2019s endowment, the church summarily transferred him to the island of St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands leaving his wife alone to give birth to their second son at her family home, before she could join her husband with their four infant children.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://barbadostoday.bb/2020/01/03/the-story-of-rev-reginald-grant-barrow/|title=The Story of Rev. Reginald Grant Barrow|date=2020-01-04|website=Barbados Today|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\nAs Parish Priest at Holy Cross Episcopal Church, Rev. Barrow\u2019s brand of what was later termed \u2018liberation theology\u2019, was no better received by church authorities there than it had been in Barbados. By late 1920 he was forced out of Holy Cross and he founded St. Luke AME, the first African Methodist Episcopal Church in the USVI. Although he found a home for his values in the AME church, his theological freedom made him all the more dangerous in the eyes of the island\u2019s authorities and in 1922 he was deported by order of the Governor as an \u201cundesirable\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRev. Barrow eventually made his way to New York and became a Bishop in the AME church. Unfortunately, he never reunited with his wife and it was thus that Errol Barrow spent the first six years of his life in St Croix and began his education at the Danish Preparatory School there. He would not see his father again until years later.\n\nRuth Barrow returned to Barbados to raise her five children with the help of her extended family, living with their grandmother Catherine O\u2019Neal in Bridgetown. Her older brother Dr. [[Charles Duncan O'Neal|Charles Duncan O\u2019Neal]] was a prominent physician and activist (later a National Hero of Barbados) who founded the Democratic League and Workingmen\u2019s Association, the first socialist organization in Barbados.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=|title=Errol Walton Barrow|last=Vanderpool|first=Tony|date=7 June 1987|work=The Sunday Advocate|access-date=|url-status=live|location=Barbados|edition=Special|page=27}}</ref> Under his fatherly influence, Dr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s philosophies formed the core of the young Errol\u2019s political and social beliefs. Among Errol\u2019s playmates at his grandmother\u2019s house on Crumpton street was his cousin [[Hugh Springer]], later Sir Hugh, Governor General of Barbados and the third member of the family to be named a National Hero.\n\nIn Barbados Errol first attended Wesley Hall Boys School before winning a scholarship to [[Combermere School]], which he attended for one year before being admitted to [https://harrisoncollege.org/ Harrison\u2019s college], then the most prestigious boys school on the island. It was during his schoolboy days that Barrow acquired the nickname \u201cDipper\u2019 ostensibly for his awkward cricket batting style.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a moniker that would follow him as an affectionate brand well into his political career. After graduating from Harrison Barrow spent a year working as a legal clerk while studying to earn a scholarship to Codrington College, the school from which his father had emerged as its youngest ever graduate in 1919.<ref name=\":1\" /> His mother died in 1939  and he won the Island Scholarship in 1940, but by December of that year he had chosen a different path.\n\n== World War II and The Aftermath ==\nIn December of 1940, Errol Barrow, along with eleven other of his countrymen who became known as 'The Second Barbadian Contingent', enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]] to serve during [[World War II]].<ref name=\":4\">[http://www.caribbeanaircrew-ww2.com/?p=394 BARROW \u2013 Errol Walton] Caribbean aircrew in the RAF during WW2.</ref><ref>[https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/pilots-of-the-caribbean/heroes-and-sheroes/stateman-flying-officer-errol-walton-barrow.aspx Statesman Flying Officer Errol Walton Barrow], Royal (British) Air Force Museum.</ref> His sister Dame [[Nita Barrow]] recounted the event in her eulogy to him at his funeral. <blockquote>\"I as the big sister packed his clothes ready for his move to the College.

I've joined the Royal Air Force.' \"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>After joining the RAF Volunteer Reserve in London as an Aircraftmen 2 (AC2), Barrow underwent initial training for light bomber crews at RAF Benson. He was then stationed at RAF Marham and trained as a wireless operator. By January 1942 he had been promoted to AC1 and thereafter undertook an eighteen-month navigator training course in Canada. Barrow was awarded his Air Navigator wings and promoted to Sergeant on November 25, 1943.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bajanthings.com/flying-officer-errol-walton-barrow-navigator-raf-world-war-ii-and-prime-minister-of-barbados/|title=Errol Barrow PM of Barbados & RAF Navigator WWII|date=2019-03-12|website=BajanThings|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\nAt this point Barrow was united with the men whose lives would become mutually dependent on each other if they were to survive the war: RAF pilot Andrew Leslie Cole and RAAF Wireless/Air gunners Leo Leslie J Schultz and Robert Allen Stewart and RAF Navigator and Bomber Errol Walton Barrow spent four months training for operational missions in Nova Scotia, graduating on April 7th 1944. The newly formed crew returned to England and joined 88 squadron on September 20, 1944, flying Douglass Boston (DB-7) light bombers.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOver the next six months, Barrow flew 53 operational bombing missions over the European theatre, including support for ground forces during the Battle of the Bulge. At wars end he was appointed as personal navigator to the Commander in Chief of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|British Zone]] of occupied Germany, Air Chief Marshall Sir [[William Sholto Douglas]]. During that period Barrow rose to the rank of [[Flying Officer]]. Douglas, who later became chairman of British European Airways, remained close to Barrow and made him Godfather to his only child.\n\nHis final RAF posting saw him seconded to the Colonial Office, where he oversaw the education and vocational training initiatives for ex-servicemen from all of the colonial territories.<ref name=\":2\" /> Notably of the twelve men who left Barbados of part of the Second Contingent, six were killed during the war.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn September of 1947 he was given special permission by the University of London to study at the [[London School of Economics]] and study Law at the [[Inns of Court]] concurrently, taking degrees in 1950 and1949 respectively. During that time, Barrow also served as Chairman of the Council of Colonial Students where his contemporaries included [[Forbes Burnham]], [[Michael Manley]], [[Pierre Trudeau]], and [[Lee Kwan Yew]]  all destined to become political leaders in their home countries.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Political Career ==\nBarrow returned to Barbados in 1950 and was elected to the [[Parliament of Barbados|Barbados Parliament]] in 1951 as a member of the [[Barbados Labour Party]] (BLP) representing the parish of St. George. Feeling the fever of anti-colonialism he had inculcated during his student days in London, he quickly became dissatisfied by general failure of the incremental approach to change advocated by the party stalwarts and their continued support of imperialist powers. By 1952 he began to openly challenge his party\u2019s policies and by 1955 made a declaration in Parliament stating \u201cI no longer want to be associated with them politically or otherwise\u201d <ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Fathering a nation : Barbados and the legacy of Errol Walton Barrow|others=Hewitt, Guy|isbn=978-1-910553-63-3|location=Hertford|oclc=999629424|year = 2016}}</ref> <sup>:72</sup>\n\nIn April 1955 Barrow and twenty-one other like-minded politicians and activists adopted the Constitution of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] as a progressive alternative to the BLP. In the 1956 general election, the DLP field sixteen candidates of whom twelve were defeated including the incumbent Barrow in his St. George constituency.<ref name=\":5\" /> <sup>:75</sup>\n\nBarrow returned to parliament in the by-election of 1958 representing the parish of St. John and was elected Chairman of the DLP in1959. In December of 1961, the party won the general election with Barrow as its leader. He then served as Premier of Barbados from 1961 until 1966 when, after leading the country to independence from Great Britain, he became the island\u2019s first Prime Minister. He served continuously in that capacity as well as stints as Minister of Finance, and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the next ten years.\n\nDuring his tenure, the DLP government accelerated industrial development, expanded the tourist industry to reduce the island's economic dependence on sugar, introduced National Health Insurance and Social Security, and implemented free secondary school education.\n\nBarrow was a dedicated proponent of regional integration, spearheading the foundation of the [[Caribbean Free Trade Association]] (CARIFTA) in 1965. Eight years later CARIFTA evolved into the Caribbean Community ([[CARICOM]]), when Barrow, together with Forbes Burnham of [[Guyana]], Dr. [[Eric Williams]] of [[Trinidad & Tobago]] and Michael Manley of [[Jamaica]] enacted the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] to bolster political and economic relations between the English-speaking Caribbean territories.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/06/03/barbados-prime-minister-barrow-dies/95c5b5e3-44a4-4c11-a207-117ebf1d7136/ BARBADOS PRIME MINISTER BARROW DIES], June 3, 1987, The Washington Post</ref>\n\nAfter another [[1971 Barbados legislative election|landslide victory]] in 1971, the DLP returned to the electorate in 1976 for a mandate after two years of bitter controversy over constitutional amendments put forth by the government. Barrow, who had invited public comment on the amendments verbally lashed out at those who had been critical of what he viewed as a minor procedural change in the appointment of judges. A general economic downturn that affected most countries in the hemisphere contributed to a shift in public sentiment resulting in the party's [[1976 Barbados legislative election|election]] defeat.\n\nAs an indomitable advocate of Caribbean sovereignty he fiercely opposed interference in Caribbean affairs. As opposition leader in 1983 he spoke out forcefully against the United States [[invasion of Grenada]] and he was scathing in his criticism of other Caribbean leaders who kow-towed to [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] in the hope of getting economic handouts:\n\n:\"Mr. Seaga (Prime Minister of Jamaica, [[Edward Seaga]]) thinks that the solution to Jamaica's problems is to get [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] to play Santa Claus. I do not believe in Santa Claus.\"\n\nIn May 1986, after 10 years in opposition, Barrow was re-elected as Prime Minister in a [[1986 Barbados legislative election|landslide victory]] in which the DLP won 24 of 27 seats in the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]. The campaign was notable for an address he gave at a political rally some two weeks before the election which came to be known as the \"Mirror Image\" speech. In it, Barrow rhetorically asked Barbadians what kind of a future they saw for themselves when they looked in the mirror; contrasting a life of menial labour as an \u00e9migr\u00e9 in the developed world, or staying and building a strong and independent Barbados to rival other small states like [[Singapore]].\n\nHis re-election served as a catalyst for resurgent nationalism in the region, which by and large had subordinated itself to U.S. aid policy in the early 1980s. Barrow wasted no time in distancing himself from the \"mendicant mentality\" of his predecessors [[John Michael Geoffrey Manningham Adams|J. M. G. Adams]] and [[Bernard St. John]]. In his first press conference as Prime Minister he referred to Reagan as \"that cowboy in the White House\". In a British interview, he characterized the President of the United States as \"a zombie; he's programmed, a very dangerous person\".\n\nHe chastised Washington for its treatment of not only the Caribbean states, but also of Canada and the United Kingdom, which he described as Barbados' closest allies. His political opponents deemed his attacks on Reagan as \"tactically stupid\", but for most Barbadians, his outspokenness meant that \"The Skipper\" was back.\n\nA year after his re-election, Prime Minister Errol Barrow collapsed and died at his home on 1 June 1987. By an act of Parliament in 1998, Barrow was named as one of the ten [[Barbadian National Heroes|National Heroes of Barbados]].<ref name=\"Parl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php |title=Parliament's History |author=Parliament of Barbados |year=2009 |publisher=Barbadosparliament.com |accessdate=15 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523083154/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php |archivedate=23 May 2007 |df=dmy |author-link=Parliament of Barbados }}</ref>\n\n== Personal Life ==\nErrol Barrow was a son of the Rev.

Born into a family of political and civic activists in the parish of [[Saint Lucy, Barbados|Saint Lucy]], he became a WWII aviator, combat veteran, lawyer, politician, gourmet cook and author. \n\n==Errol Walton Barrow's Early Life==\n\nErrol Walton Barrow was born January 21<sup>st</sup> 1920 in St. Lucy Barbados, the fourth of five children born to the Rev. Reginald Grant Barrow (1889\u20131980) and his wife Ruth Albertha (nee O'Neal) (1884-1939). Ruth was the daughter of a prosperous blacksmith whose success allowed him to purchase the plantation at St. Lucy where Errol was later born.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The life and times of Errol Barrow|last=Morgan|first=Peter|publisher=Caribbean Communications Inc.|year=1994|isbn=|location=Bridgetown, Barbados|pages=12, 13}}</ref>\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nReverend Barrow, an Anglican priest, had been appointed headmaster of the Alleyne school after his sermons as curate of St Lucy parish church brought him into conflict with the island\u2019s ruling class and church hierarchy. His removal from the pulpit did not succeed in curtailing his advocacy and agitation on behalf of poor black laborers on the island. In 1919 after he challenged the financial misappropriations of the white planters who oversaw the school\u2019s endowment, the church summarily transferred him to the island of St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands leaving his wife alone to give birth to their second son at her family home, before she could join her husband with their four infant children.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://barbadostoday.bb/2020/01/03/the-story-of-rev-reginald-grant-barrow/|title=The Story of Rev. Reginald Grant Barrow|date=2020-01-04|website=Barbados Today|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\nAs Parish Priest at Holy Cross Episcopal Church, Rev. Barrow\u2019s brand of what was later termed \u2018liberation theology\u2019, was no better received by church authorities there than it had been in Barbados. By late 1920 he was forced out of Holy Cross and he founded St. Luke AME, the first African Methodist Episcopal Church in the USVI. Although he found a home for his values in the AME church, his theological freedom made him all the more dangerous in the eyes of the island\u2019s authorities and in 1922 he was deported by order of the Governor as an \u201cundesirable\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRev. Barrow eventually made his way to New York and became a Bishop in the AME church. Unfortunately, he never reunited with his wife and it was thus that Errol Barrow spent the first six years of his life in St Croix and began his education at the Danish Preparatory School there. He would not see his father again until years later.\n\nRuth Barrow returned to Barbados to raise her five children with the help of her extended family, living with their grandmother Catherine O\u2019Neal in Bridgetown. Her older brother Dr. [[Charles Duncan O'Neal|Charles Duncan O\u2019Neal]] was a prominent physician and activist (later a National Hero of Barbados) who founded the Democratic League and Workingmen\u2019s Association, the first socialist organization in Barbados.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=|title=Errol Walton Barrow|last=Vanderpool|first=Tony|date=7 June 1987|work=The Sunday Advocate|access-date=|url-status=live|location=Barbados|edition=Special|page=27}}</ref> Under his fatherly influence, Dr. O\u2019Neal\u2019s philosophies formed the core of the young Errol\u2019s political and social beliefs. Among Errol\u2019s playmates at his grandmother\u2019s house on Crumpton street was his cousin [[Hugh Springer]], later Sir Hugh, Governor General of Barbados and the third member of the family to be named a National Hero.\n\nIn Barbados Errol first attended Wesley Hall Boys School before winning a scholarship to [[Combermere School]], which he attended for one year before being admitted to [https://harrisoncollege.org/ Harrison\u2019s college], then the most prestigious boys school on the island. It was during his schoolboy days that Barrow acquired the nickname \u201cDipper\u2019 ostensibly for his awkward cricket batting style.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a moniker that would follow him as an affectionate brand well into his political career. After graduating from Harrison Barrow spent a year working as a legal clerk while studying to earn a scholarship to Codrington College, the school from which his father had emerged as it\u2019s youngest ever graduate in 1919<ref name=\":1\" />. His mother died in 1939  and he won the Island Scholarship in 1940, but by December of that year he had chosen a different path.\n\n== World War II and The Aftermath ==\nIn December of 1940 Errol Barrow, along with eleven other of his countrymen who became known as 'The Second Barbadian Contingent', enlisted in the [[Royal Air Force]] to serve during [[World War II]].<ref name=\":4\">[http://www.caribbeanaircrew-ww2.com/?p=394 BARROW \u2013 Errol Walton] Caribbean aircrew in the RAF during WW2.</ref><ref>[https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/research/online-exhibitions/pilots-of-the-caribbean/heroes-and-sheroes/stateman-flying-officer-errol-walton-barrow.aspx Statesman Flying Officer Errol Walton Barrow], Royal (British) Air Force Museum.</ref> His sister Dame [[Nita Barrow]] recounted the event in her eulogy to him at his funeral. <blockquote>\"I as the big sister packed his clothes ready for his move to the College. Then as he was about to leave a couple of days later, he calmly announced that he would not be going to College. 'I'm going to England. I've joined the Royal Air Force.' \"<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>After joining the RAF Volunteer Reserve in London as an Aircraftmen 2 (AC2), Barrow underwent initial training for light bomber crews at RAF Benson. He was then stationed at RAF Marham and trained as a wireless operator. By January 1942 he had been promoted to AC1 and thereafter undertook an eighteen-month navigator training course in Canada. Barrow was awarded his Air Navigator wings and promoted to Sergeant on November 25th 1943.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bajanthings.com/flying-officer-errol-walton-barrow-navigator-raf-world-war-ii-and-prime-minister-of-barbados/|title=Errol Barrow PM of Barbados & RAF Navigator WWII|date=2019-03-12|website=BajanThings|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>\n\nAt this point Barrow was united with the men whose lives would become mutually dependent on each other if they were to survive the war: RAF pilot Andrew Leslie Cole and RAAF Wireless/Air gunners Leo Leslie J Schultz and Robert Allen Stewart and RAF Navigator and Bomber Errol Walton Barrow spent four months training for operational missions in Nova Scotia, graduating on April 7th 1944. The newly formed crew returned to England and joined 88 squadron on September 20th 1944, flying Douglass Boston (DB-7) light bombers.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOver the next six months Barrow flew 53 operational bombing missions over the European theatre, including support for ground forces during the Battle of the Bulge. At wars end he was appointed as personal navigator to the Commander in Chief of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|British Zone]] of occupied Germany, Air Chief Marshall Sir [[William Sholto Douglas]]. During that period Barrow rose to the rank of [[Flying Officer]]. Douglas, who later became chairman of British European Airways, remained close to Barrow and made him Godfather to his only child.\n\nHis final RAF posting saw him seconded to the Colonial Office, where he oversaw the education and vocational training initiatives for ex-servicemen from all of the colonial territories.<ref name=\":2\" /> Notably of the twelve men who left Barbados of part of the Second Contingent, six were killed during the war.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn September of 1947 he was given special permission by the University of London to study at the [[London School of Economics]] and study Law at the [[Inns of Court]] concurrently, taking degrees in 1950 and1949 respectively. During that time, Barrow also served as Chairman of the Council of Colonial Students where his contemporaries included [[Forbes Burnham]], [[Michael Manley]], [[Pierre Trudeau]], and [[Lee Kwan Yew]]  all destined to become political leaders in their home countries.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Political Career ==\nBarrow returned to Barbados in 1950 and was elected to the [[Parliament of Barbados|Barbados Parliament]] in 1951 as a member of the [[Barbados Labour Party]] (BLP) representing the parish of St. George. Feeling the fever of anti-colonialism he had inculcated during his student days in London, he quickly became dissatisfied by general failure of the incremental approach to change advocated by the party stalwarts and their continued support of imperialist powers. By 1952 he began to openly challenge his party\u2019s policies and by 1955 made a declaration in Parliament stating \u201cI no longer want to be associated with them politically or otherwise\u201d <ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Fathering a nation : Barbados and the legacy of Errol Walton Barrow|others=Hewitt, Guy|isbn=978-1-910553-63-3|location=Hertford|oclc=999629424|year = 2016}}</ref> <sup>:72</sup>\n\nIn April 1955 Barrow and twenty-one other like-minded politicians and activists adopted the Constitution of the [[Democratic Labour Party (Barbados)|Democratic Labour Party]] as a progressive alternative to the BLP. In the 1956 general election, the DLP field sixteen candidates of whom twelve were defeated including the incumbent Barrow in his St. George constituency.<ref name=\":5\" /> <sup>:75</sup>\n\nBarrow returned to parliament in the by-election of 1958 representing the parish of St. John and was elected Chairman of the DLP in1959. In December of 1961 the party won the general election with Barrow as its leader. He then served as Premier of Barbados from 1961 until 1966 when, after leading the country to independence from Great Britain, he became the island\u2019s first Prime Minister. He served continuously in that capacity as well as stints as Minister of Finance, and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the next ten years.\n\nDuring his tenure the DLP government accelerated industrial development, expanded the tourist industry to reduce the island's economic dependence on sugar, introduced National Health Insurance and Social Security, and implemented free secondary school education.\n\nBarrow was a dedicated proponent of regional integration, spearheading the foundation of the [[Caribbean Free Trade Association]] (CARIFTA) in 1965. Eight years later CARIFTA evolved into the Caribbean Community ([[CARICOM]]), when Barrow, together with Forbes Burnham of [[Guyana]], Dr. [[Eric Williams]] of [[Trinidad & Tobago]] and Michael Manley of [[Jamaica]] enacted the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] to bolster political and economic relations between the English-speaking Caribbean territories.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1987/06/03/barbados-prime-minister-barrow-dies/95c5b5e3-44a4-4c11-a207-117ebf1d7136/ BARBADOS PRIME MINISTER BARROW DIES], June 3, 1987, The Washington Post</ref>\n\nAfter another [[1971 Barbados legislative election|landslide victory]] in 1971, the DLP returned to the electorate in 1976 for a mandate after two years of bitter controversy over constitutional amendments put forth by the government. Barrow, who had invited public comment on the amendments verbally lashed out at those who had been critical of what he viewed as a minor procedural change in the appointment of judges. A general economic downturn which affected most countries in the hemisphere contributed to a shift in public sentiment resulting in the party's [[1976 Barbados legislative election|election]] defeat.\n\nAs an indomitable advocate of Caribbean sovereignty he fiercely opposed interference in Caribbean affairs. As opposition leader in 1983 he spoke out forcefully against the United States [[invasion of Grenada]] and he was scathing in his criticism of other Caribbean leaders who kow-towed to [[Federal government of the United States|Washington]] in the hope of getting economic handouts:\n\n:\"Mr. Seaga (Prime Minister of Jamaica, [[Edward Seaga]]) thinks that the solution to Jamaica's problems is to get [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] to play Santa Claus. I do not believe in Santa Claus.\"\n\nIn May 1986, after 10 years in opposition, Barrow was re-elected as Prime Minister in a [[1986 Barbados legislative election|landslide victory]] in which the DLP won 24 of 27 seats in the [[Barbados House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]. The campaign was notable for an address he gave at a political rally some two weeks before the election which came to be known as the \"Mirror Image\" speech. In it, Barrow rhetorically asked Barbadians what kind of a future they saw for themselves when they looked in the mirror; contrasting a life of menial labour as an \u00e9migr\u00e9 in the developed world, or staying and building a strong and independent Barbados to rival other small states like [[Singapore]].\n\nHis re-election served as a catalyst for resurgent nationalism in the region, which by and large had subordinated itself to U.S. aid policy in the early 1980s. Barrow wasted no time in distancing himself from the \"mendicant mentality\" of his predecessors [[John Michael Geoffrey Manningham Adams|J. M. G. Adams]] and [[Bernard St. John]]. In his first press conference as Prime Minister he referred to Reagan as \"that cowboy in the White House\". In a British interview he characterized the  President of the United States as \"a zombie; he's programmed, a very dangerous person\".\n\nHe chastised Washington for its treatment of not only the Caribbean states, but also of Canada and the United Kingdom, which he described as Barbados' closest allies. His political opponents deemed his attacks on Reagan as \"tactically stupid\", but for most Barbadians his outspokenness meant that \"The Skipper\" was back.\n\nA year after his re-election, Prime Minister Errol Barrow collapsed and died at his home on 1 June 1987. By an act of Parliament in 1998, Barrow was named as one of the ten [[Barbadian National Heroes|National Heroes of Barbados]].<ref name=\"Parl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php |title=Parliament's History |author=Parliament of Barbados |year=2009 |publisher=Barbadosparliament.com |accessdate=15 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523083154/http://www.barbadosparliament.com/history.php |archivedate=23 May 2007 |df=dmy |author-link=Parliament of Barbados }}</ref>\n\n== Personal Life ==\nErrol Barrow was a son of the Rev.

A tributary of the [[River Lea]], it rises to the south-west of [[Sandon, Hertfordshire|Sandon]] in the hills northeast of [[Stevenage]] and joins the Lea at [[Hartham Common]] in [[Hertford]].\n\n==Watermills==\nIn medieval times there were a number of [[watermill]]s along the course of the Beane. A few of the buildings and [[mill race]]s survive.\n* Sele Mill, Hertford, is perhaps the site with the most historical interest. It was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref>[http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle_print.aspx?uid=1268844&showMap=1&showText=1 SELE HOUSE including front railings (1268844)]. [[Historic England]]</ref> Its main claim to fame is that in the 15th century the facility was converted for use as a [[paper mill]] and was, as far as is known, the earliest paper mill in England. It is not clear when paper production began there, although 1488 has been suggested,<ref name=\"OP\">{{cite web | url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/30561 | title=Sele Mill | publisher=Open Plaques | accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref> but it was certainly underway in the 1490s. Paper from Sele Mill, supplied by [[John Tate (papermaker)|John Tate]], was used in publications from that decade, and the mill was visited by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in 1498 and 1499.  Despite this sign of royal favour, paper production did not continue there for long, and appears to have ceased by the time the paper maker [[John Tate (paper maker)|John Tate]] made his will in 1507.<ref>Richard L. Hills, \u2018Tate, John (c.1448\u20131507/8)\u2019, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58376, accessed 24 June 2015]. Subscription or UK public library membership required.</ref>\n* Walkern Mill, which was rebuilt in the 19th century, is a [[grade II listed]] building.<ref name=\"BLB\"></ref>\n\n==Abstraction==\nThe Beane valley remains mainly rural in character.  However, Hertfordshire's population increased substantially in the second half of the twentieth century, and the consequent demand for water has affected rivers such as the Beane and the [[River Mimram|Mimram]].  In the case of the Beane, a licence was given to abstract water near [[Aston, Hertfordshire|Aston]] for Stevenage's water supply.

A tributary of the [[River Lea]], it rises to the south-west of [[Sandon, Hertfordshire|Sandon]] in the hills northeast of [[Stevenage]] and joins the Lea at [[Hartham Common]] in [[Hertford]].\n\n==Watermills==\nIn medieval times there were a number of [[watermill]]s along the course of the Beane. A few of the buildings and [[mill race]]s survive.\n* Sele Mill, Hertford, is perhaps the site with the most historical interest. It was mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref>[http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle_print.aspx?uid=1268844&showMap=1&showText=1 SELE HOUSE including front railings (1268844)]. [[Historic England]]</ref> Its main claim to fame is that in the 15th century the facility was converted for use as a [[paper mill]] and was, as far as is known, the earliest paper mill in England. It is not clear when paper production began there, although 1488 has been suggested,<ref name=\"OP\">{{cite web | url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/30561 | title=Sele Mill | publisher=Open Plaques | accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref> but it was certainly underway in the 1490s. Paper from Sele Mill, supplied by [[John Tate (papermaker)|John Tate]], was used in publications from that decade, and the mill was visited by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in 1498 and 1499.  Despite this sign of royal favour, paper production did not continue there for long, and appears to have ceased by the time the paper maker [[John Tate (paper maker)|John Tate]] made his will in 1507.<ref>Richard L. Hills, \u2018Tate, John (c.1448\u20131507/8)\u2019, [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58376, accessed 24 June 2015].

However, Hertfordshire's population increased substantially in the second half of the twentieth century, and the consequent demand for water has affected rivers such as the Beane and the [[River Mimram|Mimram]].  In the case of the Beane, a licence was given to abstract water near [[Aston, Hertfordshire|Aston]] for Stevenage's water supply. The river has since been adversely affected by over-exploitation of the chalk [[aquifer]] in its upper reaches. \n\nThe photo shows a dry section south of [[Walkern]] where from the 1990s until about 2014 there was only seasonal flow.

He became [[heir apparent]] to the three kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1612 on the death of his elder brother [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the [[Spanish Habsburg]] princess [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]] culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later he married the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princess [[Henrietta Maria of France]].\n\nAfter his succession in 1625, Charles quarrelled with the [[Parliament of England]], which sought to curb his [[royal prerogative]]. Charles believed in the [[divine right of kings]], and was determined to govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical [[absolute monarch]]. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a [[Roman Catholic]], generated the antipathy and mistrust of [[Reformed]] groups such as the English [[Puritan]]s and Scottish [[Covenanter]]s, who thought his views were too Catholic. He supported [[high church]] [[Anglican]] ecclesiastics, such as [[Richard Montagu]] and [[William Laud]], and failed to aid [[Protestant]] forces successfully during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. His attempts to force the [[Church of Scotland]] to adopt high Anglican practices led to the [[Bishops' Wars]], strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments, and helped precipitate his own downfall.\n\nFrom 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the [[English Civil War]]. After his defeat in 1645, he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a [[constitutional monarchy]], and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the [[Isle of Wight]], Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648 [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[New Model Army]] had consolidated its control over England. Charles was [[High Court of Justice for the trial of King Charles I|tried]], convicted, and [[Execution of Charles I|executed]] for [[high treason]] in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and the [[Commonwealth of England]] was established as a [[republic]]. The monarchy would be [[English Restoration|restored]] to Charles's son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], in 1660.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Anne of Denmark; King Charles I when Prince of Wales; King James I of England and VI of Scotland by Simon De Passe (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving by [[Simon de Passe]] of Charles and his parents, King James and Queen Anne, c. 1612]]\n\nThe second son of King [[James VI of Scotland]] and [[Anne of Denmark]], Charles was born in [[Dunfermline Palace]], [[Fife]], on 19 November 1600.<ref>{{harvnb|Cust|2005|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Weir|1996|p=252}}.</ref> At a [[Protestant]] ceremony in the [[Chapel Royal]] of [[Holyrood Palace]] in [[Edinburgh]] on 23 December 1600, he was baptised by [[David Lindsay (d. 1613)|David Lindsay]], [[Bishop of Ross (Scotland)|Bishop of Ross]], and created [[Duke of Albany]], the traditional title of the second son of the King of Scotland, with the [[subsidiary title]]s of [[Earl of Ormond (Scottish)|Marquess of Ormond]], [[Earl of Ross]] and Lord Ardmannoch.{{sfn|Gregg|1981|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nJames VI was the first cousin twice removed of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], and when she died childless in March 1603, he became [[King of England]] as James&nbsp;I.

in Great Britain throughout Charles's lifetime. However, years are assumed to start on 1 January rather than [[Lady Day|25 March]], which was the English New Year until 1752.}} was [[King of England]], [[King of Scotland]], and [[King of Ireland]] from 27 March 1625 until [[Execution of Charles I|his execution]] in 1649.\n\nCharles was born into the [[House of Stuart]] as the second son of [[King James VI of Scotland]], but after his father inherited the English throne in 1603 (as James I), he moved to England, where he spent much of the rest of his life. He became [[heir apparent]] to the three kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1612 on the death of his elder brother [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the [[Spanish Habsburg]] princess [[Maria Anna of Spain|Maria Anna]] culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later he married the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princess [[Henrietta Maria of France]].\n\nAfter his succession in 1625, Charles quarrelled with the [[Parliament of England]], which sought to curb his [[royal prerogative]]. Charles believed in the [[divine right of kings]], and was determined to govern according to his own conscience. Many of his subjects opposed his policies, in particular the levying of taxes without parliamentary consent, and perceived his actions as those of a tyrannical [[absolute monarch]]. His religious policies, coupled with his marriage to a [[Roman Catholic]], generated the antipathy and mistrust of [[Reformed]] groups such as the English [[Puritan]]s and Scottish [[Covenanter]]s, who thought his views were too Catholic. He supported [[high church]] [[Anglican]] ecclesiastics, such as [[Richard Montagu]] and [[William Laud]], and failed to aid [[Protestant]] forces successfully during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. His attempts to force the [[Church of Scotland]] to adopt high Anglican practices led to the [[Bishops' Wars]], strengthened the position of the English and Scottish parliaments, and helped precipitate his own downfall.\n\nFrom 1642, Charles fought the armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the [[English Civil War]]. After his defeat in 1645, he surrendered to a Scottish force that eventually handed him over to the English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a [[constitutional monarchy]], and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the [[Isle of Wight]], Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, but by the end of 1648 [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s [[New Model Army]] had consolidated its control over England. Charles was [[High Court of Justice for the trial of King Charles I|tried]], convicted, and [[Execution of Charles I|executed]] for [[high treason]] in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and the [[Commonwealth of England]] was established as a [[republic]]. The monarchy would be [[English Restoration|restored]] to Charles's son, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], in 1660.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Anne of Denmark; King Charles I when Prince of Wales; King James I of England and VI of Scotland by Simon De Passe (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving by [[Simon de Passe]] of Charles and his parents, King James and Queen Anne, c. 1612]]\n\nThe second son of King [[James VI of Scotland]] and [[Anne of Denmark]], Charles was born in [[Dunfermline Palace]], [[Fife]], on 19 November 1600.<ref>{{harvnb|Cust|2005|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Weir|1996|p=252}}.</ref> At a [[Protestant]] ceremony in the [[Chapel Royal]] of [[Holyrood Palace]] in [[Edinburgh]] on 23 December 1600, he was baptised by [[David Lindsay (d. 1613)|David Lindsay]], [[Bishop of Ross (Scotland)|Bishop of Ross]], and created [[Duke of Albany]], the traditional title of the second son of the King of Scotland, with the [[subsidiary title]]s of [[Earl of Ormond (Scottish)|Marquess of Ormond]], [[Earl of Ross]] and Lord Ardmannoch.{{sfn|Gregg|1981|pp=4\u20135}}\n\nJames VI was the first cousin twice removed of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]], and when she died childless in March 1603, he became [[King of England]] as James&nbsp;I.

In August 1619, the Bohemian [[Diet (assembly)|diet]] chose as their monarch Frederick&nbsp;V, who was leader of the [[Protestant Union]], while Ferdinand was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[imperial election of 1619|imperial election]]. Frederick's acceptance of the Bohemian crown in defiance of the emperor marked the beginning of the turmoil that would develop into the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The conflict, originally confined to Bohemia, spiralled into a wider European war, which the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] and public quickly grew to see as a polarised continental struggle between Catholics and Protestants.<ref>{{harvnb|Hibbert|1968|p=49}}; {{harvnb|Howat|1974|pp=26\u201328}}.</ref> In 1620, Charles's brother-in-law, Frederick V, was defeated at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] near [[Prague]] and his hereditary lands in the [[Electoral Palatinate]] were [[Palatinate campaign|invaded by a Habsburg force]] from the [[Spanish Netherlands]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gregg|1981|p=63}}; {{harvnb|Howat|1974|pp=27\u201328}}; {{harvnb|Kenyon|1978|p=79}}.</ref> James, however, had been seeking marriage between the new Prince of Wales and Ferdinand's niece, Habsburg princess [[Maria Anna of Spain]], and began to see the [[Spanish match]] as a possible diplomatic means of achieving peace in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Cust|2005|p=5}}; {{harvnb|Hibbert|1968|pp=49\u201350}}.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for James, negotiation with Spain proved generally unpopular, both with the public and with James's court.{{sfn|Coward|2003|p=152}} The English Parliament was actively hostile towards Spain and Catholicism, and thus, when called by James in 1621, the members hoped for an enforcement of [[recusancy]] laws, a naval campaign against Spain, and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales.<ref>{{harvnb|Gregg|1981|pp=67\u201368}}; {{harvnb|Hibbert|1968|pp=49\u201350}}.</ref> James's [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Francis Bacon]], was impeached before the [[House of Lords]] for corruption.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=31}} The [[impeachment]] was the first since 1459 without the king's official sanction in the form of a [[bill of attainder]].

She first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #96 (December 1975) and was created by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]]. She works as a geneticist and is an expert in mutant affairs. She is most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]] and has been a member of the [[Muir Island X-Men]] team and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. \n\n[[Olivia Williams]] played Dr. Moira MacTaggert in the 2006 feature film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.

She was the longest running human associate of the X-Men and was [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]'s colleague, confidante, and also once his fianc\u00e9e, having met and fallen in love with him while they were postgraduates at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #117</ref> She ended their engagement for unknown reasons and returned to Scotland. She was married to her old flame, the late politician Joseph MacTaggert which caused delays with her former engagement to Xavier. Joe proved to be an abusive husband; Moira separated from him after he beat her into a week long coma and, as it is implied, raped her, leaving her pregnant. She kept her son's existence a secret, and when Joe refused her a divorce she allowed people to believe she was widowed.\n\nShe eventually created a Mutant Research Center on [[Muir Island]], off the coast of [[Scotland]]. Moira was forced to contain and imprison her son Kevin, later called [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], when he developed reality warping abilities and severe psychosis. One of Moira's goals was to understand human/mutant genetics, in order to cure her son. However, it is suggested that she intentionally married Joseph and gave birth to Kevin in order to produce a mutant with reality-bending abilities.\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|First appearance from ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #96.<br>Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]\nMoira's connection to the X-Men began long before the team formed. The silent partner in the founding of [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] and co-creator of [[Cerebro]], Moira assisted Xavier in helping the young [[Jean Grey]] recover after the traumatic triggering of her mutant abilities.\n\nMoira was a kind woman who took to helping humans and mutants alike. She rescued a young Rahne Sinclair ([[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]) from an angry mob, and adopted the girl. She even attempted to treat Xavier's son, a mutant known as [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] who suffered from [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]]. When a confused, traumatized [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] first arrived from the future, he washed up in Scotland unable to speak English, and it was Moira who stood up for him against an angry mob. Taking him back to Muir Island, he scanned her mind and learned English in the process, as well as the truth about her son, and promised to keep her secrets. She taught him literature and the customs of the time and introduced him to Xavier. They became close friends ever since, being the first kind person Cable met in the present timeline, her later death devastating him enough to leave the X-Men. When [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] was reduced to infancy, he was entrusted to Moira's care on Muir Island, where she altered his genetic code in an attempt to keep him from reverting to villainy.\n\n===Involvement with the X-Men===\nMoira appeared at Xavier's call to act as \"housekeeper\" for the team while they were on missions (a position that required her to demonstrate her proficiency with an [[M16 rifle]] against a demon within hours of her arrival). Though each of the X-Men formed some sort of relationship with the \"Widow\" MacTaggert, Moira and Sean Cassidy ([[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]) hit it off immediately, forming an on-and-off relationship that would last for the remainder of her life. Proteus' escape and eventual destruction at the hands of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and the X-Men left Moira in a position of ethical compromise again: though Banshee stopped her from cloning her son, she saved his genetic structure on disk to allow herself the future option of bringing him back.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #128</ref><ref>''Classic X-Men'' #36, \"Outside-In\".</ref>\n\nAfter finding out that her foster daughter, Rahne, was a mutant, Moira was the catalyst for change. She talked a discouraged Xavier into opening his school to the next generation of [[New Mutants]], with Rahne becoming an initial member. She was also an integral part of the support for the X-Men and the New Mutants, providing medical aid including cloning Xavier after the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] attacks, transferring his mind into a new body and restoring his ability to walk after a Brood embryo nearly killed him.\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 3.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Muir Islanders ([[Muir Island]] X-Men) on the cover of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #254. Art by [[Marc Silvestri]].]]\nWith the apparent death of the X-Men, Moira and Banshee formed an alternate team based from Muir, and carried on as the leader of the team without him when his duties with the X-Men called him away.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #254</ref> Her behavior became unpredictable, her temper impressive, and her decisions harsh and unforgiving as she displayed behavior that made all who knew her suspicious. On Muir, she began to pit her charges against each other in an arena in merciless battles, supposedly allowing her the opportunity to study mutants in action.\n\nMoira and her islanders were involved in the return of Proteus due to the influence of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]]. This was a four-part story in 1991, that ran through that year's annuals for the New Warriors, X-Force, New Mutants and X-Factor. The [[Shadow King]], the corrupting entity behind the island, allowed the Islanders to act heroically in defense of innocent lives.\n\nEventually, the entire population of Muir Island was identified as being possessed by and mentally corrupted by Shadow King, pitting the Islanders against the combined forces of the X-Men and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] before Xavier freed them from his control.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 4.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Moira confronted by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #2. Art by [[Jim Lee]].]]\nMoira's alteration of Magneto did not go unnoticed indefinitely. Enraged when he discovered Moira had tampered with his [[free will]], Magneto took Moira captive and forced her to perform the procedure on half of the X-Men, turning them against their teammates.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #2</ref> While Moira's alterations worked, it was revealed that, due to mutants' powers requiring their body chemistry to operate in a specific manner, use of a mutant's powers would cause them to automatically resist the 'programming' and reverse the effects of the procedure, so anything Magneto had done was of his own free will. While hostage on Asteroid M, Moira witnessed [[Fabian Cortez]] draining Magneto of his powers and manipulating him into placing him as his right hand. Though Cortez fled, it was an observation that would eventually put Moira back in the hands of the Acolytes. Back on Earth, Moira was unable to accept her betrayal of her surrogate family and her own infallibility, and fled the X-Mansion, with Banshee in pursuit.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #6</ref>\n\n===Excalibur and the Legacy Virus===\nWhen a mysterious virus began attacking the genetically engineered [[Genegineer|mutate]] population of [[Genosha]], Moira volunteered her services as a geneticist and was forced to watch as the former slaves were decimated by disease. Returning to the X-Mansion, Moira found [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] suffering from the same illness, later identified as the [[Legacy Virus]]. Moving back to Muir Island after the girl\u2019s death, Moira became the key figure in working for a cure to the disease (during this time, she also worked on curing Wolfsbane's artificial bond with [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]).\n\nThe European superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] took up residence on Muir Island after assisting Moira.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #71</ref> She had been attacked by agents of [[Mister Sinister]] who was seeking the genetic information on her son. Moira became an official member of the group, acting as their medic, team mother, and morale officer. An information leak revealed her to be the only human infected by the Legacy Virus\u2014a bizarre turn of events possibly caused by her long exposure to the infected on Genosha, her autopsy of Illyana, or some susceptibility because she gave birth to a mutant.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #80</ref> It was later established that Moira is in fact a mutant. Despite these events, she maintained a strong outlook on life, helping to maintain discipline, reduce tension, and increase the team's effectiveness throughout Europe. She convinced the team to stay behind when [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] emerged, telling them they might be needed if other heroes fell.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #101</ref>\n\nConferring with the X-Men's [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] did not result in appreciable progress. Locking herself in quarantine in a final attempt to cure the virus without endangering any of her teammates, Moira found her attempts foiled by her foster daughter, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Douglock]]. Wolfsbane originally leapt through the closing doors of the laboratory as the quarantine took effect. She soon found herself a willing assistant to her foster mother's work. Douglock later caused much unintentional damage, his judgement clouded by personal feelings for Wolfsbane.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #115</ref><ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #120</ref> Moira takes time off from her research to attend the bachelorette party and the wedding for her friends Meggan and Brian Braddock.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #124-125 (September\u2013October 1998)</ref>\n[[Image:Mactaggert 5.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Final moments in ''[[X-Men|X-Men (vol. 2)]]'' #108.<br>Art by [[Leinil Francis Yu]]]]\n\nMoira did eventually find a cure for the disease, when the terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] manipulated her research to force the virus to target only humans. Mystique, partly assisted by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], then destroyed Muir Island, de-powered Wolfsbane with the power nullifier once developed by Forge, and brutally injured Moira.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #388</ref><ref>''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' #16</ref> [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] attempted to save Moira's life. Despite Rogue's powers temporarily granting her medical knowledge, she was unable to do so. Moira clung to life long enough to mentally transfer the information to Xavier in one final embrace between the former lovers. Xavier nearly went with her into death, but Jean Grey and Cable intervened on the astral plane, talking him down. She appeared to died in the X-Men's jet, far above the Atlantic Ocean, and was later buried in Scotland.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #108</ref> A psychic representation of Moira was seen as an active portion of Xavier's consciousness as he worked on rebuilding Genosha.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> \n\nMoira is next seen in the afterlife, in which she, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], [[Gwen Stacy]], and [[Dead Girl (comics)|Dead Girl]] assist [[Doctor Strange]] in battling a being known as the Pitiful One. Moira finds herself more interested in the book club she formed with Mockingbird and Gwen Stacy then in battling evil.<ref>''X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl'' (#1-5, Marvel, 2006, {{ISBN|0-7851-2031-9}})</ref>\n\n===''X-Men: Deadly Genesis''===\nAfter the events of M-Day and upon the reawakening of Vulcan, significant portions of Moira's history with Xavier and the Original X-Men are called into light. While in the rubble of Muir Island, Banshee sees Moira but she completely ignores him and leads him to an old stockroom, where Sean finds old, important notes from the Professor which reveals that during the early years of Xavier's Academy, Moira founded and ran a secondary facility not far from the Xavier School, in which she had her own students; youths whom she took out of bad situations and adopted as her wards, training them in their abilities without the highly militant regimen of Charles' X-Men.\n\nWhen [[Krakoa]] captured the original X-Men, it was Moira's students whom Charles went to first\u2014not the second team of Wolverine, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Banshee, Colossus, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] as it was originally believed\u2014putting them through the psionic equivalent of [[recruit training|boot camp]] and allowing them to believe they were being trained over months as X-Men. Charles took them from Moira's care immediately.\n\nMoira's students\u2014[[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] (Gabriel Summers, the [[Third Summers brother|lost brother]] of X-Men [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Havok), [[Petra (comics)|Petra]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Sway (comics)|Sway]]\u2014were apparently all killed, and Xavier suppressed even the memory of them from his own students, to keep them from going back to save them. Only Moira's project tapes, one made directly after the event before Xavier could suppress the memories, and an abandoned research center remain as clues.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1-6</ref>\n\n===Chaos War===\nDuring the \"[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]\" storyline, Moira MacTaggert is brought back from the afterlife, alongside the fallen X-Men members, John Proudstar, Banshee, three Madrox dupes, Sophie and Esme Cuckoo, after what happened to the death realms.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #1</ref> After escaping from Carrion Crow, the group discovers that Moira has been possessed by [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s ghost.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #2</ref>\n\n===''House of X'' ===\nIn 2019's ''[[House of X]]'', it is revealed that Moira is actually a mutant who possesses the power of reincarnation, starting her life again in the past after her death, possessing her full memories of her prior lives. She is also revealed to be alive, having faked her death at the hands of the Brotherhood by using a Shi'ar Golem which impersonated and died in her place which indicates that it was Moira's replica that was seen in the afterlife and was brought back to life, during the Chaos War.\n\n====The Lives of Moira MacTaggert====\n'''Life 1'''\nMoira Kinross was born to powerful Scots nobleman Lord Kinross and when she turned 13, her mutant ability manifested, but due to her passive power, there were no signs indicating that she had become a mutant other than a strong, temporary fever. Living a simple life, Moira meets Charles Xavier, but he passes through without them forming a bond. She later marries a man named Kenneth Cowan and has three children: twin boys Callum and Dean, and a girl named Abigail. Kenneth dies when Moira is 68 years old, and she passes away from [[congestive heart failure]] at age 74.\n\n'''Life 2'''\nHer second life began in utero, having already become fully sentient and possessing a perfect recollection of her prior life when she turned 13, which is when her powers first manifest. This allowed Moira to appear intellectually gifted, and she was pushed in the direction of academia. She didn't fight her parents' intentions, since she intended to understand her true nature. After she verified that she wasn\u2019t suffering from psychosis or a disorder, and having lived through one life with Kenneth and learning all his faults, she makes a point not to fall in love with him when they met. She enrolls at Oxford at age 16, becomes a biology professor at 20, founds the Muir Research Institute at 31 and at 44 she finally deduced she was a mutant after seeing Charles Xavier coming out as one on television. She boards a plane to the United States of America in order to meet him, however, the plane crashes before reaching its destination, killing Moira.\n\n'''Life 3'''\nMoira made a point of finding Xavier earlier in her third life. She meets Charles Xavier when they were both at Oxford University, however she becomes turned off by his arrogance and a thinly veiled god complex. So she instead devotes her life to finding a cure for mutation, which she compared to cancer. Moira founds again the Muir Research Institute, and at 36 she identifies the X-gene. Just when it appears Moira had rid herself of her reincarnation powers, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants attack the Muir Research Institute. Able to see the future, Destiny alone is able to sense Moira's mutant status and see the effects her reincarnations are having on the timeline. Destiny orders Moira to stop wasting her gift by working against her own kind, and instead help prevent a seemingly inevitable future where mankind's machines wipe out the mutant race. Destiny also tells Moira of her future, revealing that Moira will ultimately live either ten or eleven lives, depending on the choices she makes in the tenth cycle. Destiny also reveals that if Moira dies before her powers manifest at 13, she won't reincarnate. With that, Destiny warns Moira that she'll continue to hunt her in each new life if she doesn't work for the betterment of mutantkind. By Destiny's request, Moira is then killed by being slowly burned alive by Pyro so she would always remember what this slow and painful death feels like.\n\n'''Life 4'''\nIn her fourth life, reconsidering the positive nature of mutants and Xavier himself, Moira throws herself into studying the human-mutant dilemma. She meets Xavier and goes on to fall in love with and marry him, with the couple establishing the Xavier School for Gifted Children. She, Xavier and the X-Men fight for the mutant cause for years, but at age 55, Moira is killed by Sentinels. That ultimately means Destiny's vision was right as she warned Moira that humans would always try to exterminate mutants.\n\n'''Life 5'''\nNow choosing aggression as a response to the violent tendencies of humanity, Moira runs away from home at 13, to encounter Xavier a full decade earlier than when they're supposed to meet. Not wasting any time, Moira opens her mind to Xavier so he can see how his dream fails in her past lives. The mind-reading radicalizes him, forcing the duo to form the mutant nation of Faraway instead of a school. It seemed mutants were finally safe from humanity. Yet, Boliver Trask's adaptive-learning Sentinels still make their way there, and Moira is initially injured in an attack when she was 43 and dies a year later during a genocide.\n\n'''Life 6'''\nIn her sixth life, Moira discovers the true threat to mutants are not Sentinels or Humanity, but ironically, Time itself. It turns out that while mutants are the natural evolution response to Humans, they will not be the next evolutionary step for Them, and they never will be because Humans will render evolution obsolete by changing its environment around its needs, rather than adapting to that same environment. Humans will use technology to extend their life and when they reach an evolutionary stagnation, they will overtime integrate themselves with it, creating in the process a genetically engineered new species, the pinnacle of humanity without natural evolution, the Post-Humans (''Homo novissima''), blue-hued human-machine hybrids that will rule the Earth and bring mutants nearly to extinction, one thousand years in the future. The last surviving mutants are kept captive in preserve areas, as a diversionary tactic to keep them from interfering with the process of breeding something far beyond human or mutant. Moira and Wolverine are among them because they were able to survive on each other's blood. One of the Post-Humans, the Librarian, comes to them and reveal how they'll achieve Godhood. Due to the Post-Humans techo-organic nature, it allows them to be more readily absorbed by the Phalanx in a process known as Ascension and join the physical form of the Phalanx, and the hive mind of the Dominion system to artificially force their evolution into higher beings once again, gaining in the process control over time and space. The Librarian intends to send Moira and Wolverine to another planet to prevent Moira from dying and use her knowledge against them in her resurrection. However, the Librarian underestimated Wolverine who manages to kill him and afterwards, with Moira's consent, kills her too.\n\n'''Life 7'''\nWith the knowledge that the Trask Family is responsible for creating the Sentinels and learning how Humanity will use it to overtake mutantkind, Moira spends her seventh life eradicating the Trask bloodline. Bolivar, Donald, Gwyneth and Simon Trask are systematically murdered over the span of a decade, with Moira even taking out their children for good measure. But when she thought she had successfully eliminated the potential for Sentinel creation, Moira lost all hope when she sadly discovered Sentinels were still being created. She finally understood that Mutantkind\u2019s fall is the \"Inevitable Truth\" as the Artificial Intelligence is unavoidable since it's a discovery and not a creation. This realization radicalized her as Sentinels killed her again.\n\n'''Life 8'''\nAbandoning Xavier's peaceful dream to foster a safe future for mutants, Moira seeks out Magneto instead. Presenting Magneto with tales of her past lives and his future failures, Moira convinced him to join her. Together they conquered America, establishing the House of M and initiated the War of M. However during the war, Moira witness Magneto being defeated and killed by the combined might of Earth's humans and mutants heroes in the likes of the Fantastic Four, Avengers and X-Men. Moira is imprisoned and later killed in a failed prison escape.\n\n'''Life 9'''\nThough eventually a failure, the life-defining decision Moira made to turn to Magneto, did validate her radical approach to beat humanity through force. Magneto was simply not enough. To that end, in her ninth life, Moira woke Apocalypse from his slumber early. Forming a powerful union that leads to the creation of the X-Men, they destroy their two strongest opponents, Xavier and Magneto, gather their Four Horsemen and launch the Apocalypse War. The war provokes a reaction from humanity in the form of the Man-Machine Supremacy, an alliance between humans and machines which culminates with Nimrod becoming online for the first time. One hundred years later, most mutants have been driven out of the solar system as the war still rages. Apocalypse's forces split into two teams, as one group attacks the Temple of Concordance, while another group heads into Nimrod's vast archives to extract vital information about its origins. Once the info is gathered, Apocalypse sends Wolverine away and stays behind to take on Nimrod once it realized that the archives were being raided. Wolverine's destination is revealed to be a container that holds Moira MacTaggert in stasis for over 16 years. With the data embedded into Moira through a techno-organic interface designed by Apocalypse himself, she now knows how and when Nimrod was first brought online, but for that information to actually be useful, Logan kills her.\n\n'''Life 10'''\nMoira\u2019s tenth life occurs in the current iteration of the Marvel Universe. When she meets Xavier, she allowed him to read her mind to learn everything her lives had entailed. Since then she's been using the information from her previous lives to work with Xavier and Magneto to save mutants from humans and machines. As the years passed, it's revealed through her journals that Moira deliberately used her genetic expertise to find mates for herself and Professor X that, in combination with their own mutant genes, would potentially spawn mutants with reality-warping powers (Proteus and Legion), because she knew someone with that power would be needed in the future to enable the mutant resurrection protocol. She notes how her influence indirectly, imprinted the idea for a mutant stronghold in Magneto's mind, after Xavier used his powers to show Magneto the lives of Moira. This is why he created so many of his own, from Asteroid M to Avalon and Genosha. She reluctantly allowed Xavier to read her mind over and over again, and worries that, while he is still being unacceptably hopeful and idealistic, he is becoming too dependent on her interpretation of past-life events. She also fears that his psyche will fracture which will eventually lead to the creation of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] when Charles used his telepathic powers to shut down Erik\u2019s mind completely. Given her knowledge of Sinister's treachery on her previous lifes, Moira laments to learn that without her knowledge or consent, Xavier and Magneto tried to recruit him nevertheless, realizing in the process that Sinister has turned himself into a chimera mutant, decades ahead of schedule compared to the other timelines, that chimera being the mutant clone of himself infused with Thunderbird's DNA. Eventually, Moira had realized she had spent too much time in the spotlight working overtly with Xavier and needed to return to the shadows, in order to do so, she and Xavier used the advanced technology from the Shi'ar to do some preliminary testing for their theory that a mutant could be restored from back-up, creating in the process a Shi'ar golem, a living husk whose empty body was then imprinted with Moira's mental scan, recorded and re-uploaded by Charles Xavier but apparently without all the knowledge lying inside of her.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref> Moira then replaced herself with the decoy at some point allowing her to continued working from the shadows with Xavier. The decoy would eventually be killed during the attack of the Brotherhood. Moira also notes that though Xavier kept fighting her influence, even using on two occasions the Cerebro unit to remove from his mind the knowledge of their plan, but following his demise at Cyclops' hands and his eventual return to the living, he had apparently  become a man with a very different purpose, instead of his peaceful dream of coexistence between man and mutant which he believed at one point, Xavier now envisions a world where a mutant nation must be created as a seat from which mutants will rise as the dominant species on the planet. Moira has since taken residence in \"No-Place\" a blackout zone within the newly sovereign, living island nation of [[List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters:_K#Krakoa|Krakoa]] with Xavier and Magneto, the only people aware of her being alive and her actual role in this grand plan, and has become apparently very paranoid in her isolation, as she is deeply afraid of the notion of Destiny being revived to placate Mystique, or of any precognitive mutant in general because she fears what would happen if the other mutants discovered that they really are doomed.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFor decades, Dr. Moira MacTaggert was depicted as a baseline human with the normal human strength of a woman of her age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise. However, in the 2019 storyline, \"House of X\", Moira was revealed to actually be a mutant with the ability to reincarnate herself upon death, reverting back to the moment of her initial conception with all the memories she experienced in her previous lifetimes from as early as in utero.<ref name=\"PoX2\">{{cite comic|title=House of X|volume=1|issue=#2|writer=[[Jonathan Hickman]]|artist=Pepe Larraz|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August 7, 2019}}</ref> This allows her to manipulate the course of history by changing her own actions and thereby affecting people and circumstances that result from her presence. Her lifetimes have armed her with significant experience, including expertise in the fields of anthropology and genetics, firearms mastery, and leading various mutant survival movements until their eventual downfall.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\nAccording to Destiny, Moira's reincarnation cycle is finite. When she encountered Destiny during her third life, she was informed that she had \"10, maybe 11\" lives in total, noting that if Moira were to die before her mutant power manifested at the age of 13, the reincarnation cycle would end.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\nHer x-gene is also undetectable during her life, providing the ultimate camouflage to mutant sensors and detectors which will see her as a baseline human. Telepathic intrusions on her mind will only see the memories of her current lifetime, however, telepaths can see all her lives' memories as long as she allows it.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the 1995-1996 \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, Moira is the wife of [[Bolivar Trask]], and head of the London-based Human High Council. As resistance to Apocalypse's reign, Moira and her husband designed the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] and armed the human resistance with an impressive weapons array. Their main focus was a plan to destroy Apocalypse's forces in their North American positions, even though this would mean the deaths of many innocent civilians that had not yet escaped the country. The tyrant however, backfires by activating his Sea Walls, slaughtering the Council and those within the Sea Walls reach.\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Moira is the step-mother of Legion (stating that his father had been killed in a bombing in Israel) and therefore one of the few humans allowed to live on Fortress X. She also posed as the AI X, so she could use communication worms and sensors to communicate with and monitor the residents of Fortress X. It was later discovered that she was actually one of the multiple personalities of Legion, created as a \"Psychic Anti-body\" in order to protect Legion from Doctor Nemesis' actions on David's mind, as he and the X-Club were processing the deletion of the personas in order to stabilize David's psyche. Her power is so immense that when she was discovered by Xavier, she was able to defeat him and established the Age of X reality, where mutants were besieged into the Fortress X, everyday attacked by the waves of soldiers of the Human Coalition and used the personalities inside David's mind along with the mutants of Utopia to fill this new world where David would be happy and seen as a hero, as part of the Force Warriors, the protectors of the Fortress, who erected force walls around the citadel every day. Even memories were rewritten, and a background was created. The telepaths and a few others mutants who were able to retain knowledge about the true universe were kept in the X-Brig, considered as mutants too dangerous for the community, but their imprisonment was because they might use their powers to reveal the truth. \nWhen her victims slowly understood that this reality wasn't their one, she manipulated both Danielle Moonstar and her Moonstar Cadre in order to make them to stop any further discovery. Eventually her depiction was revealed and Legion absorb her. Later she offers to make a better world for David, but he declines her offer. During the Lost Legion story Moira's powers were the main target of another personality of Legion and at the end she was seen inside David's mind cursing Xavier.\n\n===Cross-Time Caper===\nReichminister of Genetics Moira MacTaggert, who hails from a reality in which Earth is dominated by Nazis,<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #6 (1989)</ref> is featured in ''Excalibur'' #10 and 11 when she is brought into [[Earth-616]] by the actions of a confused [[Widget (comics)|Widget]]. Making the trip with her is her personal bodyguard, a [[Nazi]] [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and Moira's personal train, powered by an alternate [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]]. It was also hinted that this Moira was behind the Super Team Lightning Force (a Nazi version of Excalibur). Moira's violent actions ultimately result in Excalibur team being sent on a long and arduous cross-dimensional trip.\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Moira MacTaggert was declared a criminal for attempting to cure her son [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Kevin]] of the mutant gene and his psychosis. King [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s mutant supremacy saw this as an act against mutantkind, and [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] were dispatched to destroy Muir Island and capture Moira. Though Moira escaped, Kevin was also freed, sending him on a gruesome killing spree that was attributed to Moira as failed experiments, as she chases him across the globe. When the reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] caught Proteus's attention, Moira emerged from hiding to warn them about her son, who was intrigued by their presence and desired to ruin the realities they attempted to fix. When he attacks the team, Moira shot him, exposing him to the metal that was his deadly allergy and only weakness, forcing him to find a new body. Unsurprisingly, he chose to possess his mother, and rather than allow her son to possess her and use her against them, Moira commits suicide.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #70-71</ref>\n\n===New Exiles===\nOn the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]] face a squad of alternate 'core X-Men' who are loyal to Lilandra. These X-Men include an alternate version of Moira MacTaggert who is not married on this world or is going by her maiden name, Kinross. Moira's codename is Hypernova and her powers are energy blasts. It is not known whether she is a mutant on this world or has gained powers through another method.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]]'' #15 (2008)</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Moira MacTaggert is the ex-wife of [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]], and their son David MacTaggert is [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Proteus|Proteus]]. This version of Moira needs two crutches in order to move around. Moira runs a school/hospital for sick mutants, and assists in the Xavier Institute from behind the scenes. She does this even though Charles left her to join [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s dream of a mutant society, abandoning her to raise their mentally ill child on her own. When Proteus escapes and begins [[body hopping]], Moira calls in the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] for assistance. After murdering hundreds, Proteus is seemingly crushed to death under a car.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #15-19 (2002)</ref>\n\nLater, the X-Men learn that Moira has been funding her hospital by producing and selling \"[[Banshee (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Banshee]]\", a lethal and addictive Mutant Growth Hormone<ref>Ult X v1 94</ref> which amplifies mutant powers, made from the genetic material of [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|Wolverine]]. When Wolverine attempts to destroy her Banshee supply, Moira attacks him with the previously unknown mutant ability to emit a [[Banshee (comics)|deafening sonic cry]]. Wolverine quickly defeats Moira and leaves her to die in the exploding hospital, but she is later shown to have somehow survived when [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] finds her emerging from the smoldering ruins. Her ensuing conversation with him implies that she is now in league with Quicksilver.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Moira appears in episodes of ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Lally Cadeau]].<ref name=\"comicbook\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/08/05/x-men-moira-mactaggert-who-powers-of-x/|title=X-Men: Who is Moira MacTaggert?|last=MAgnett|first=Chase|website=ComicBook|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806151610/https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/08/05/x-men-moira-mactaggert-who-powers-of-x/|archivedate=August 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> She first appeared in the episode \"The Cure\", where supposedly knew a doctor with a cure for mutants. The next episodes were \"The Phoenix Saga\", where she was worried about Professor Xavier's control over his mind. In the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" she was working to help Jean Grey be freed from the Phoenix. Then, the next appearance was in \"Proteus\", in which she revealed to Xavier that Proteus was her son. Here she seems to fill the function of Gabrielle Haller, an old lover of Charles and mother of his son, the powerful but disturbed psychic boy [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]]. Her next appearance was \"The Phalanx Covenant, Part 2\", when she was infected by [[Phalanx]]. Her last appearance was in \"Graduation Day\", when she and Beast debated on how to contact [[Lilandra Neramani]] to help Professor X.\n* In ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]'', the character '''Yui Sasaki''' (voiced by [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]] in the Japanese version and by [[Gwendoline Yeo]] in the English) is introduced as that version's Moira, as she slightly bears resemblance to her. Like Moira, Yui is a geneticist and has a relationship with Professor X when she still owns the Sasaki Institute in Japan. But unknown to Charles, she is the mother his son with her name [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Takeo Sasaki]]. Under the misguided idea of trying to help suppress mutant powers, she entered a partnership with the U-men; they would harvest mutants DNA for a cure for mutancy. In exchange, she gave them a mutant detection device uninhibited by her own Cerebro-jammer. Yui's plans start falling apart, when her serum starts accelerating mutations instead of suppressing them. This leads both the X-Men and the Inner Circle to Japan. Unknown to her, Mastermind was posing as her lab assistant, and was working on trying to brainwash Takeo. Thanks to Armor and Professor X's help, they let Takeo pass away in peace.\n\n===Films===\n* Moira is played by [[Olivia Williams]] in brief appearances in the feature film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.<ref name=\"slashfilm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/rose-byrne-x-men-apocalypse/|title=Rose Byrne Returns for 'X-Men: Apocalypse'|last=Fischer|first=Russ|website=[[/Film]]|date=February 2, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610203727/http://www.slashfilm.com/rose-byrne-x-men-apocalypse/|archivedate=June 10, 2019|url-status=}}</ref> She appears on a video talking about the ethics of using mutant powers, such as transferring the mind of a dying man into the body of a patient with no higher brain function. She is later seen seated next to [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] at the memorial service for Xavier. [[Post-credits scene|After the film's ending credits]], she appears again attending to the brain-dead patient, who suddenly speaks to her in Xavier's voice.\n* [[Rose Byrne]] plays Moira in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.<ref name=\"slashfilm\" /><ref name=\"EW\" /> She is a [[CIA]] agent working to uncover the mysterious [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. This version is depicted as an American instead of being Scottish. During her investigation at Las Vegas, Nevada, she manages to stumble across one of the Club's meetings by stripping down to her [[lingerie|underwear]] to blend in with the [[stripper]]s in which she discovers the club members are mutants as they intimidate a military officer. After the incident, she seeks help from recently graduated professor Charles Xavier, due to his affinity for research in the subject of genetic mutation. Moira eventually learns that Charles and his foster sister [[Mystique (comics)|Raven]] are mutants themselves with Xavier demonstrating his mind-reading while Raven reveals her shape-shifting. She later becomes the liaison to the team and assists the newly formed X-Men in preventing the Club's head [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] from starting a [[nuclear holocaust]] between the Soviet Union and the United States during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. At the climax, she is indirectly responsible for Xavier's paralysis as she fires the bullet which Magneto accidentally deflects into Xavier's spine. In his rage, Magneto almost kills Moira by strangling her with her dog tags until Xavier makes him realize he caused his friend's injury. At the film's end, Xavier erases her memory of the events with Shaw and Magneto while kissing her. This was in order to keep the school for mutants that he has opened during the crisis a secret.\n* Byrne reprises her role in the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/01/30/x-men-apocalypse-rose-byrne-returning-moira-mactaggert-exclusive/|title='X-Men: Apocalypse': Rose Byrne Returning As Moira MacTaggert -- Exclusive|last=Franich|first=Darren|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 30, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329112903/https://ew.com/article/2015/01/30/x-men-apocalypse-rose-byrne-returning-moira-mactaggert-exclusive/|archivedate=March 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Still having a large interest in mutant activity, she investigates a cult in Egypt that was formed upon the existence of mutants being revealed to the public, and ends up inadvertently and unknowingly causing Apocalypse to awaken from his sleep. Charles decides to visit her and take her to the X-Mansion to find out more information and because he misses her. It is here where she tells Charles she has [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|a son]], although she is divorced from the boy's father. While at the X-Mansion, the team are attacked by Apocalypse and his new Horsemen, and Moira becomes drawn into the conflict, acting as the pilot to the team's aircraft when they go to confront Apocalypse. At the end of the story, Charles restores Moira's memories back to her and restarts his relationship with her. In a deleted scene, MacTaggert arrests General Stryker and his men for their earlier attack on her and the other Mutants. He protest against his arrest by claiming that the mutants are a danger, but she refuses to believe him.

Moira was one of the major supporting characters in Claremont's Uncanny X-Men run. She worked as a geneticist and was an expert in mutant affairs. She was romantically involved with [[Professor X]].

She was the longest running human associate of the X-Men and was [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]]'s colleague, confidante, and also once his fianc\u00e9e, having met and fallen in love with him while they were postgraduates at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #117</ref> She ended their engagement for unknown reasons and returned to Scotland. She was married to her old flame, the late politician Joseph MacTaggert which caused delays with her former engagement to Xavier. Joe proved to be an abusive husband; Moira separated from him after he beat her into a week long coma and, as it is implied, raped her, leaving her pregnant. She kept her son's existence a secret, and when Joe refused her a divorce she allowed people to believe she was widowed.\n\nShe eventually created a Mutant Research Center on [[Muir Island]], off the coast of [[Scotland]]. Moira was forced to contain and imprison her son Kevin, later called [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], when he developed reality warping abilities and severe psychosis. One of Moira's goals was to understand human/mutant genetics, in order to cure her son. However, it is suggested that she intentionally married Joseph and gave birth to Kevin in order to produce a mutant with reality-bending abilities.\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 2.jpg|thumb|160px|left|First appearance from ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #96.<br>Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]\nMoira's connection to the X-Men began long before the team formed. The silent partner in the founding of [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] and co-creator of [[Cerebro]], Moira assisted Xavier in helping the young [[Jean Grey]] recover after the traumatic triggering of her mutant abilities.\n\nMoira was a kind woman who took to helping humans and mutants alike. She rescued a young Rahne Sinclair ([[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]]) from an angry mob, and adopted the girl. She even attempted to treat Xavier's son, a mutant known as [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] who suffered from [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]]. When a confused, traumatized [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] first arrived from the future, he washed up in Scotland unable to speak English, and it was Moira who stood up for him against an angry mob. Taking him back to Muir Island, he scanned her mind and learned English in the process, as well as the truth about her son, and promised to keep her secrets. She taught him literature and the customs of the time and introduced him to Xavier. They became close friends ever since, being the first kind person Cable met in the present timeline, her later death devastating him enough to leave the X-Men. When [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] was reduced to infancy, he was entrusted to Moira's care on Muir Island, where she altered his genetic code in an attempt to keep him from reverting to villainy.\n\n===Involvement with the X-Men===\nMoira appeared at Xavier's call to act as \"housekeeper\" for the team while they were on missions (a position that required her to demonstrate her proficiency with an [[M16 rifle]] against a demon within hours of her arrival). Though each of the X-Men formed some sort of relationship with the \"Widow\" MacTaggert, Moira and Sean Cassidy ([[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]]) hit it off immediately, forming an on-and-off relationship that would last for the remainder of her life. Proteus' escape and eventual destruction at the hands of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and the X-Men left Moira in a position of ethical compromise again: though Banshee stopped her from cloning her son, she saved his genetic structure on disk to allow herself the future option of bringing him back.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #128</ref><ref>''Classic X-Men'' #36, \"Outside-In\".</ref>\n\nAfter finding out that her foster daughter, Rahne, was a mutant, Moira was the catalyst for change. She talked a discouraged Xavier into opening his school to the next generation of [[New Mutants]], with Rahne becoming an initial member. She was also an integral part of the support for the X-Men and the New Mutants, providing medical aid including cloning Xavier after the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] attacks, transferring his mind into a new body and restoring his ability to walk after a Brood embryo nearly killed him.\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 3.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Muir Islanders ([[Muir Island]] X-Men) on the cover of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #254.

On Muir, she began to pit her charges against each other in an arena in merciless battles, supposedly allowing her the opportunity to study mutants in action.\n\nMoira and her islanders were involved in the return of Proteus due to the influence of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]]. This was a four-part story in 1991, that ran through that year's annuals for the New Warriors, X-Force, New Mutants and X-Factor. The [[Shadow King]], the corrupting entity behind the island, allowed the Islanders to act heroically in defense of innocent lives.\n\nEventually, the entire population of Muir Island was identified as being possessed by and mentally corrupted by Shadow King, pitting the Islanders against the combined forces of the X-Men and [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] before Xavier freed them from his control.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #280</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mactaggert 4.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Moira confronted by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] in ''[[X-Men]]'' #2.

Enraged when he discovered Moira had tampered with his [[free will]], Magneto took Moira captive and forced her to perform the procedure on half of the X-Men, turning them against their teammates.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #2</ref> While Moira's alterations worked, it was revealed that, due to mutants' powers requiring their body chemistry to operate in a specific manner, use of a mutant's powers would cause them to automatically resist the 'programming' and reverse the effects of the procedure, so anything Magneto had done was of his own free will. While hostage on Asteroid M, Moira witnessed [[Fabian Cortez]] draining Magneto of his powers and manipulating him into placing him as his right hand. Though Cortez fled, it was an observation that would eventually put Moira back in the hands of the Acolytes. Back on Earth, Moira was unable to accept her betrayal of her surrogate family and her own infallibility, and fled the X-Mansion, with Banshee in pursuit.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #6</ref>\n\n===Excalibur and the Legacy Virus===\nWhen a mysterious virus began attacking the genetically engineered [[Genegineer|mutate]] population of [[Genosha]], Moira volunteered her services as a geneticist and was forced to watch as the former slaves were decimated by disease. Returning to the X-Mansion, Moira found [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]] suffering from the same illness, later identified as the [[Legacy Virus]]. Moving back to Muir Island after the girl\u2019s death, Moira became the key figure in working for a cure to the disease (during this time, she also worked on curing Wolfsbane's artificial bond with [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]).\n\nThe European superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] took up residence on Muir Island after assisting Moira.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #71</ref> She had been attacked by agents of [[Mister Sinister]] who was seeking the genetic information on her son. Moira became an official member of the group, acting as their medic, team mother, and morale officer. An information leak revealed her to be the only human infected by the Legacy Virus\u2014a bizarre turn of events possibly caused by her long exposure to the infected on Genosha, her autopsy of Illyana, or some susceptibility because she gave birth to a mutant.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #80</ref> It was later established that Moira is in fact a mutant. Despite these events, she maintained a strong outlook on life, helping to maintain discipline, reduce tension, and increase the team's effectiveness throughout Europe. She convinced the team to stay behind when [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] emerged, telling them they might be needed if other heroes fell.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #101</ref>\n\nConferring with the X-Men's [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] did not result in appreciable progress. Locking herself in quarantine in a final attempt to cure the virus without endangering any of her teammates, Moira found her attempts foiled by her foster daughter, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], and [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Douglock]]. Wolfsbane originally leapt through the closing doors of the laboratory as the quarantine took effect. She soon found herself a willing assistant to her foster mother's work. Douglock later caused much unintentional damage, his judgement clouded by personal feelings for Wolfsbane.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #115</ref><ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #120</ref> Moira takes time off from her research to attend the bachelorette party and the wedding for her friends Meggan and Brian Braddock.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #124-125 (September\u2013October 1998)</ref>\n[[Image:Mactaggert 5.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Final moments in ''[[X-Men|X-Men (vol. 2)]]'' #108.<br>Art by [[Leinil Francis Yu]]]]\n\nMoira did eventually find a cure for the disease, when the terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] manipulated her research to force the virus to target only humans. Mystique, partly assisted by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], then destroyed Muir Island, de-powered Wolfsbane with the power nullifier once developed by Forge, and brutally injured Moira.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #388</ref><ref>''Bishop: The Last X-Man'' #16</ref> [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] attempted to save Moira's life. Despite Rogue's powers temporarily granting her medical knowledge, she was unable to do so. Moira clung to life long enough to mentally transfer the information to Xavier in one final embrace between the former lovers. Xavier nearly went with her into death, but Jean Grey and Cable intervened on the astral plane, talking him down. She appeared to died in the X-Men's jet, far above the Atlantic Ocean, and was later buried in Scotland.<ref>[[X-Men|''X-Men'' (vol. 2)]] #108</ref> A psychic representation of Moira was seen as an active portion of Xavier's consciousness as he worked on rebuilding Genosha.<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' (vol. 3) #1</ref> \n\nMoira is next seen in the afterlife, in which she, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], [[Gwen Stacy]], and [[Dead Girl (comics)|Dead Girl]] assist [[Doctor Strange]] in battling a being known as the Pitiful One.

While in the rubble of Muir Island, Banshee sees Moira but she completely ignores him and leads him to an old stockroom, where Sean finds old, important notes from the Professor which reveals that during the early years of Xavier's Academy, Moira founded and ran a secondary facility not far from the Xavier School, in which she had her own students; youths whom she took out of bad situations and adopted as her wards, training them in their abilities without the highly militant regimen of Charles' X-Men.\n\nWhen [[Krakoa]] captured the original X-Men, it was Moira's students whom Charles went to first\u2014not the second team of Wolverine, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Banshee, Colossus, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Thunderbird (John Proudstar)|Thunderbird]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] as it was originally believed\u2014putting them through the psionic equivalent of [[recruit training|boot camp]] and allowing them to believe they were being trained over months as X-Men. Charles took them from Moira's care immediately.\n\nMoira's students\u2014[[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] (Gabriel Summers, the [[Third Summers brother|lost brother]] of X-Men [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and Havok), [[Petra (comics)|Petra]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], and [[Sway (comics)|Sway]]\u2014were apparently all killed, and Xavier suppressed even the memory of them from his own students, to keep them from going back to save them. Only Moira's project tapes, one made directly after the event before Xavier could suppress the memories, and an abandoned research center remain as clues.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' #1-6</ref>\n\n===Chaos War===\nDuring the \"[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]\" storyline, Moira MacTaggert is brought back from the afterlife, alongside the fallen X-Men members, John Proudstar, Banshee, three Madrox dupes, Sophie and Esme Cuckoo, after what happened to the death realms.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #1</ref> After escaping from Carrion Crow, the group discovers that Moira has been possessed by [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s ghost.<ref>''Chaos War: X-Men'' #2</ref>\n\n===''House of X'' ===\nIn 2019's ''[[House of X]]'', it is revealed that Moira is actually a mutant who possesses the power of reincarnation, starting her life again in the past after her death, possessing her full memories of her prior lives. She is also revealed to be alive, having faked her death at the hands of the Brotherhood by using a Shi'ar Golem which impersonated and died in her place which indicates that it was Moira's replica that was seen in the afterlife and was brought back to life, during the Chaos War.\n\n====The Lives of Moira MacTaggert====\n'''Life 1'''\nMoira Kinross was born to powerful Scots nobleman Lord Kinross and when she turned 13, her mutant ability manifested, but due to her passive power, there were no signs indicating that she had become a mutant other than a strong, temporary fever. Living a simple life, Moira meets Charles Xavier, but he passes through without them forming a bond. She later marries a man named Kenneth Cowan and has three children: twin boys Callum and Dean, and a girl named Abigail. Kenneth dies when Moira is 68 years old, and she passes away from [[congestive heart failure]] at age 74.\n\n'''Life 2'''\nHer second life began in utero, having already become fully sentient and possessing a perfect recollection of her prior life when she turned 13, which is when her powers first manifest. This allowed Moira to appear intellectually gifted, and she was pushed in the direction of academia. She didn't fight her parents' intentions, since she intended to understand her true nature. After she verified that she wasn\u2019t suffering from psychosis or a disorder, and having lived through one life with Kenneth and learning all his faults, she makes a point not to fall in love with him when they met. She enrolls at Oxford at age 16, becomes a biology professor at 20, founds the Muir Research Institute at 31 and at 44 she finally deduced she was a mutant after seeing Charles Xavier coming out as one on television. She boards a plane to the United States of America in order to meet him, however, the plane crashes before reaching its destination, killing Moira.\n\n'''Life 3'''\nMoira made a point of finding Xavier earlier in her third life. She meets Charles Xavier when they were both at Oxford University, however she becomes turned off by his arrogance and a thinly veiled god complex. So she instead devotes her life to finding a cure for mutation, which she compared to cancer. Moira founds again the Muir Research Institute, and at 36 she identifies the X-gene. Just when it appears Moira had rid herself of her reincarnation powers, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants attack the Muir Research Institute. Able to see the future, Destiny alone is able to sense Moira's mutant status and see the effects her reincarnations are having on the timeline. Destiny orders Moira to stop wasting her gift by working against her own kind, and instead help prevent a seemingly inevitable future where mankind's machines wipe out the mutant race. Destiny also tells Moira of her future, revealing that Moira will ultimately live either ten or eleven lives, depending on the choices she makes in the tenth cycle. Destiny also reveals that if Moira dies before her powers manifest at 13, she won't reincarnate. With that, Destiny warns Moira that she'll continue to hunt her in each new life if she doesn't work for the betterment of mutantkind. By Destiny's request, Moira is then killed by being slowly burned alive by Pyro so she would always remember what this slow and painful death feels like.\n\n'''Life 4'''\nIn her fourth life, reconsidering the positive nature of mutants and Xavier himself, Moira throws herself into studying the human-mutant dilemma. She meets Xavier and goes on to fall in love with and marry him, with the couple establishing the Xavier School for Gifted Children. She, Xavier and the X-Men fight for the mutant cause for years, but at age 55, Moira is killed by Sentinels. That ultimately means Destiny's vision was right as she warned Moira that humans would always try to exterminate mutants.\n\n'''Life 5'''\nNow choosing aggression as a response to the violent tendencies of humanity, Moira runs away from home at 13, to encounter Xavier a full decade earlier than when they're supposed to meet. Not wasting any time, Moira opens her mind to Xavier so he can see how his dream fails in her past lives. The mind-reading radicalizes him, forcing the duo to form the mutant nation of Faraway instead of a school. It seemed mutants were finally safe from humanity. Yet, Boliver Trask's adaptive-learning Sentinels still make their way there, and Moira is initially injured in an attack when she was 43 and dies a year later during a genocide.\n\n'''Life 6'''\nIn her sixth life, Moira discovers the true threat to mutants are not Sentinels or Humanity, but ironically, Time itself. It turns out that while mutants are the natural evolution response to Humans, they will not be the next evolutionary step for Them, and they never will be because Humans will render evolution obsolete by changing its environment around its needs, rather than adapting to that same environment. Humans will use technology to extend their life and when they reach an evolutionary stagnation, they will overtime integrate themselves with it, creating in the process a genetically engineered new species, the pinnacle of humanity without natural evolution, the Post-Humans (''Homo novissima''), blue-hued human-machine hybrids that will rule the Earth and bring mutants nearly to extinction, one thousand years in the future. The last surviving mutants are kept captive in preserve areas, as a diversionary tactic to keep them from interfering with the process of breeding something far beyond human or mutant. Moira and Wolverine are among them because they were able to survive on each other's blood. One of the Post-Humans, the Librarian, comes to them and reveal how they'll achieve Godhood. Due to the Post-Humans techo-organic nature, it allows them to be more readily absorbed by the Phalanx in a process known as Ascension and join the physical form of the Phalanx, and the hive mind of the Dominion system to artificially force their evolution into higher beings once again, gaining in the process control over time and space. The Librarian intends to send Moira and Wolverine to another planet to prevent Moira from dying and use her knowledge against them in her resurrection. However, the Librarian underestimated Wolverine who manages to kill him and afterwards, with Moira's consent, kills her too.\n\n'''Life 7'''\nWith the knowledge that the Trask Family is responsible for creating the Sentinels and learning how Humanity will use it to overtake mutantkind, Moira spends her seventh life eradicating the Trask bloodline. Bolivar, Donald, Gwyneth and Simon Trask are systematically murdered over the span of a decade, with Moira even taking out their children for good measure. But when she thought she had successfully eliminated the potential for Sentinel creation, Moira lost all hope when she sadly discovered Sentinels were still being created. She finally understood that Mutantkind\u2019s fall is the \"Inevitable Truth\" as the Artificial Intelligence is unavoidable since it's a discovery and not a creation. This realization radicalized her as Sentinels killed her again.\n\n'''Life 8'''\nAbandoning Xavier's peaceful dream to foster a safe future for mutants, Moira seeks out Magneto instead. Presenting Magneto with tales of her past lives and his future failures, Moira convinced him to join her. Together they conquered America, establishing the House of M and initiated the War of M. However during the war, Moira witness Magneto being defeated and killed by the combined might of Earth's humans and mutants heroes in the likes of the Fantastic Four, Avengers and X-Men. Moira is imprisoned and later killed in a failed prison escape.\n\n'''Life 9'''\nThough eventually a failure, the life-defining decision Moira made to turn to Magneto, did validate her radical approach to beat humanity through force. Magneto was simply not enough. To that end, in her ninth life, Moira woke Apocalypse from his slumber early. Forming a powerful union that leads to the creation of the X-Men, they destroy their two strongest opponents, Xavier and Magneto, gather their Four Horsemen and launch the Apocalypse War. The war provokes a reaction from humanity in the form of the Man-Machine Supremacy, an alliance between humans and machines which culminates with Nimrod becoming online for the first time. One hundred years later, most mutants have been driven out of the solar system as the war still rages. Apocalypse's forces split into two teams, as one group attacks the Temple of Concordance, while another group heads into Nimrod's vast archives to extract vital information about its origins. Once the info is gathered, Apocalypse sends Wolverine away and stays behind to take on Nimrod once it realized that the archives were being raided. Wolverine's destination is revealed to be a container that holds Moira MacTaggert in stasis for over 16 years. With the data embedded into Moira through a techno-organic interface designed by Apocalypse himself, she now knows how and when Nimrod was first brought online, but for that information to actually be useful, Logan kills her.\n\n'''Life 10'''\nMoira\u2019s tenth life occurs in the current iteration of the Marvel Universe. When she meets Xavier, she allowed him to read her mind to learn everything her lives had entailed. Since then she's been using the information from her previous lives to work with Xavier and Magneto to save mutants from humans and machines. As the years passed, it's revealed through her journals that Moira deliberately used her genetic expertise to find mates for herself and Professor X that, in combination with their own mutant genes, would potentially spawn mutants with reality-warping powers (Proteus and Legion), because she knew someone with that power would be needed in the future to enable the mutant resurrection protocol. She notes how her influence indirectly, imprinted the idea for a mutant stronghold in Magneto's mind, after Xavier used his powers to show Magneto the lives of Moira. This is why he created so many of his own, from Asteroid M to Avalon and Genosha. She reluctantly allowed Xavier to read her mind over and over again, and worries that, while he is still being unacceptably hopeful and idealistic, he is becoming too dependent on her interpretation of past-life events. She also fears that his psyche will fracture which will eventually lead to the creation of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] when Charles used his telepathic powers to shut down Erik\u2019s mind completely. Given her knowledge of Sinister's treachery on her previous lifes, Moira laments to learn that without her knowledge or consent, Xavier and Magneto tried to recruit him nevertheless, realizing in the process that Sinister has turned himself into a chimera mutant, decades ahead of schedule compared to the other timelines, that chimera being the mutant clone of himself infused with Thunderbird's DNA. Eventually, Moira had realized she had spent too much time in the spotlight working overtly with Xavier and needed to return to the shadows, in order to do so, she and Xavier used the advanced technology from the Shi'ar to do some preliminary testing for their theory that a mutant could be restored from back-up, creating in the process a Shi'ar golem, a living husk whose empty body was then imprinted with Moira's mental scan, recorded and re-uploaded by Charles Xavier but apparently without all the knowledge lying inside of her.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref> Moira then replaced herself with the decoy at some point allowing her to continued working from the shadows with Xavier. The decoy would eventually be killed during the attack of the Brotherhood. Moira also notes that though Xavier kept fighting her influence, even using on two occasions the Cerebro unit to remove from his mind the knowledge of their plan, but following his demise at Cyclops' hands and his eventual return to the living, he had apparently  become a man with a very different purpose, instead of his peaceful dream of coexistence between man and mutant which he believed at one point, Xavier now envisions a world where a mutant nation must be created as a seat from which mutants will rise as the dominant species on the planet. Moira has since taken residence in \"No-Place\" a blackout zone within the newly sovereign, living island nation of [[List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters:_K#Krakoa|Krakoa]] with Xavier and Magneto, the only people aware of her being alive and her actual role in this grand plan, and has become apparently very paranoid in her isolation, as she is deeply afraid of the notion of Destiny being revived to placate Mystique, or of any precognitive mutant in general because she fears what would happen if the other mutants discovered that they really are doomed.<ref>''Powers of X'' #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFor decades, Dr. Moira MacTaggert was depicted as a baseline human with the normal human strength of a woman of her age, height, and build who engages in moderate regular exercise. However, in the 2019 storyline, \"House of X\", Moira was revealed to actually be a mutant with the ability to reincarnate herself upon death, reverting back to the moment of her initial conception with all the memories she experienced in her previous lifetimes from as early as in utero.<ref name=\"PoX2\">{{cite comic|title=House of X|volume=1|issue=#2|writer=[[Jonathan Hickman]]|artist=Pepe Larraz|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=August 7, 2019}}</ref> This allows her to manipulate the course of history by changing her own actions and thereby affecting people and circumstances that result from her presence. Her lifetimes have armed her with significant experience, including expertise in the fields of anthropology and genetics, firearms mastery, and leading various mutant survival movements until their eventual downfall.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\nAccording to Destiny, Moira's reincarnation cycle is finite. When she encountered Destiny during her third life, she was informed that she had \"10, maybe 11\" lives in total, noting that if Moira were to die before her mutant power manifested at the age of 13, the reincarnation cycle would end.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\nHer x-gene is also undetectable during her life, providing the ultimate camouflage to mutant sensors and detectors which will see her as a baseline human. Telepathic intrusions on her mind will only see the memories of her current lifetime, however, telepaths can see all her lives' memories as long as she allows it.<ref name=\"PoX2\" />\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the 1995-1996 \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, Moira is the wife of [[Bolivar Trask]], and head of the London-based Human High Council. As resistance to Apocalypse's reign, Moira and her husband designed the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] and armed the human resistance with an impressive weapons array. Their main focus was a plan to destroy Apocalypse's forces in their North American positions, even though this would mean the deaths of many innocent civilians that had not yet escaped the country. The tyrant however, backfires by activating his Sea Walls, slaughtering the Council and those within the Sea Walls reach.\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Moira is the step-mother of Legion (stating that his father had been killed in a bombing in Israel) and therefore one of the few humans allowed to live on Fortress X. She also posed as the AI X, so she could use communication worms and sensors to communicate with and monitor the residents of Fortress X. It was later discovered that she was actually one of the multiple personalities of Legion, created as a \"Psychic Anti-body\" in order to protect Legion from Doctor Nemesis' actions on David's mind, as he and the X-Club were processing the deletion of the personas in order to stabilize David's psyche. Her power is so immense that when she was discovered by Xavier, she was able to defeat him and established the Age of X reality, where mutants were besieged into the Fortress X, everyday attacked by the waves of soldiers of the Human Coalition and used the personalities inside David's mind along with the mutants of Utopia to fill this new world where David would be happy and seen as a hero, as part of the Force Warriors, the protectors of the Fortress, who erected force walls around the citadel every day. Even memories were rewritten, and a background was created. The telepaths and a few others mutants who were able to retain knowledge about the true universe were kept in the X-Brig, considered as mutants too dangerous for the community, but their imprisonment was because they might use their powers to reveal the truth. \nWhen her victims slowly understood that this reality wasn't their one, she manipulated both Danielle Moonstar and her Moonstar Cadre in order to make them to stop any further discovery. Eventually her depiction was revealed and Legion absorb her. Later she offers to make a better world for David, but he declines her offer. During the Lost Legion story Moira's powers were the main target of another personality of Legion and at the end she was seen inside David's mind cursing Xavier.\n\n===Cross-Time Caper===\nReichminister of Genetics Moira MacTaggert, who hails from a reality in which Earth is dominated by Nazis,<ref>''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #6 (1989)</ref> is featured in ''Excalibur'' #10 and 11 when she is brought into [[Earth-616]] by the actions of a confused [[Widget (comics)|Widget]]. Making the trip with her is her personal bodyguard, a [[Nazi]] [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and Moira's personal train, powered by an alternate [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]]. It was also hinted that this Moira was behind the Super Team Lightning Force (a Nazi version of Excalibur). Moira's violent actions ultimately result in Excalibur team being sent on a long and arduous cross-dimensional trip.\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Moira MacTaggert was declared a criminal for attempting to cure her son [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Kevin]] of the mutant gene and his psychosis. King [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s mutant supremacy saw this as an act against mutantkind, and [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] were dispatched to destroy Muir Island and capture Moira. Though Moira escaped, Kevin was also freed, sending him on a gruesome killing spree that was attributed to Moira as failed experiments, as she chases him across the globe. When the reality-hopping [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] caught Proteus's attention, Moira emerged from hiding to warn them about her son, who was intrigued by their presence and desired to ruin the realities they attempted to fix. When he attacks the team, Moira shot him, exposing him to the metal that was his deadly allergy and only weakness, forcing him to find a new body. Unsurprisingly, he chose to possess his mother, and rather than allow her son to possess her and use her against them, Moira commits suicide.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'' #70-71</ref>\n\n===New Exiles===\nOn the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon, the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]] face a squad of alternate 'core X-Men' who are loyal to Lilandra. These X-Men include an alternate version of Moira MacTaggert who is not married on this world or is going by her maiden name, Kinross. Moira's codename is Hypernova and her powers are energy blasts. It is not known whether she is a mutant on this world or has gained powers through another method.<ref>''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#New Exiles|New Exiles]]'' #15 (2008)</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Moira MacTaggert is the ex-wife of [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]], and their son David MacTaggert is [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Proteus|Proteus]]. This version of Moira needs two crutches in order to move around. Moira runs a school/hospital for sick mutants, and assists in the Xavier Institute from behind the scenes. She does this even though Charles left her to join [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]'s dream of a mutant society, abandoning her to raise their mentally ill child on her own. When Proteus escapes and begins [[body hopping]], Moira calls in the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] for assistance. After murdering hundreds, Proteus is seemingly crushed to death under a car.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #15-19 (2002)</ref>\n\nLater, the X-Men learn that Moira has been funding her hospital by producing and selling \"[[Banshee (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Banshee]]\", a lethal and addictive Mutant Growth Hormone<ref>Ult X v1 94</ref> which amplifies mutant powers, made from the genetic material of [[Alternative versions of Wolverine#Ultimate Marvel|Wolverine]]. When Wolverine attempts to destroy her Banshee supply, Moira attacks him with the previously unknown mutant ability to emit a [[Banshee (comics)|deafening sonic cry]]. Wolverine quickly defeats Moira and leaves her to die in the exploding hospital, but she is later shown to have somehow survived when [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] finds her emerging from the smoldering ruins. Her ensuing conversation with him implies that she is now in league with Quicksilver.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Moira appears in episodes of ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Lally Cadeau]].<ref name=\"comicbook\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/08/05/x-men-moira-mactaggert-who-powers-of-x/|title=X-Men: Who is Moira MacTaggert?|last=MAgnett|first=Chase|website=ComicBook|date=August 5, 2019|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806151610/https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/08/05/x-men-moira-mactaggert-who-powers-of-x/|archivedate=August 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> She first appeared in the episode \"The Cure\", where supposedly knew a doctor with a cure for mutants. The next episodes were \"The Phoenix Saga\", where she was worried about Professor Xavier's control over his mind. In the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" she was working to help Jean Grey be freed from the Phoenix. Then, the next appearance was in \"Proteus\", in which she revealed to Xavier that Proteus was her son. Here she seems to fill the function of Gabrielle Haller, an old lover of Charles and mother of his son, the powerful but disturbed psychic boy [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]]. Her next appearance was \"The Phalanx Covenant, Part 2\", when she was infected by [[Phalanx]]. Her last appearance was in \"Graduation Day\", when she and Beast debated on how to contact [[Lilandra Neramani]] to help Professor X.\n* In ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]'', the character '''Yui Sasaki''' (voiced by [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]] in the Japanese version and by [[Gwendoline Yeo]] in the English) is introduced as that version's Moira, as she slightly bears resemblance to her. Like Moira, Yui is a geneticist and has a relationship with Professor X when she still owns the Sasaki Institute in Japan. But unknown to Charles, she is the mother his son with her name [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Takeo Sasaki]]. Under the misguided idea of trying to help suppress mutant powers, she entered a partnership with the U-men; they would harvest mutants DNA for a cure for mutancy. In exchange, she gave them a mutant detection device uninhibited by her own Cerebro-jammer. Yui's plans start falling apart, when her serum starts accelerating mutations instead of suppressing them. This leads both the X-Men and the Inner Circle to Japan. Unknown to her, Mastermind was posing as her lab assistant, and was working on trying to brainwash Takeo. Thanks to Armor and Professor X's help, they let Takeo pass away in peace.\n\n===Films===\n* Moira is played by [[Olivia Williams]] in brief appearances in the feature film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''.<ref name=\"slashfilm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/rose-byrne-x-men-apocalypse/|title=Rose Byrne Returns for 'X-Men: Apocalypse'|last=Fischer|first=Russ|website=[[/Film]]|date=February 2, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610203727/http://www.slashfilm.com/rose-byrne-x-men-apocalypse/|archivedate=June 10, 2019|url-status=}}</ref> She appears on a video talking about the ethics of using mutant powers, such as transferring the mind of a dying man into the body of a patient with no higher brain function.

[[Post-credits scene|After the film's ending credits]], she appears again attending to the brain-dead patient, who suddenly speaks to her in Xavier's voice.\n* [[Rose Byrne]] plays Moira in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.<ref name=\"slashfilm\" /><ref name=\"EW\" /> She is a [[CIA]] agent working to uncover the mysterious [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. This version is depicted as an American instead of being Scottish. During her investigation at Las Vegas, Nevada, she manages to stumble across one of the Club's meetings by stripping down to her [[lingerie|underwear]] to blend in with the [[stripper]]s in which she discovers the club members are mutants as they intimidate a military officer. After the incident, she seeks help from recently graduated professor Charles Xavier, due to his affinity for research in the subject of genetic mutation. Moira eventually learns that Charles and his foster sister [[Mystique (comics)|Raven]] are mutants themselves with Xavier demonstrating his mind-reading while Raven reveals her shape-shifting. She later becomes the liaison to the team and assists the newly formed X-Men in preventing the Club's head [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] from starting a [[nuclear holocaust]] between the Soviet Union and the United States during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. At the climax, she is indirectly responsible for Xavier's paralysis as she fires the bullet which Magneto accidentally deflects into Xavier's spine. In his rage, Magneto almost kills Moira by strangling her with her dog tags until Xavier makes him realize he caused his friend's injury. At the film's end, Xavier erases her memory of the events with Shaw and Magneto while kissing her. This was in order to keep the school for mutants that he has opened during the crisis a secret.\n* Byrne reprises her role in the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]''.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/01/30/x-men-apocalypse-rose-byrne-returning-moira-mactaggert-exclusive/|title='X-Men: Apocalypse': Rose Byrne Returning As Moira MacTaggert -- Exclusive|last=Franich|first=Darren|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=January 30, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329112903/https://ew.com/article/2015/01/30/x-men-apocalypse-rose-byrne-returning-moira-mactaggert-exclusive/|archivedate=March 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Still having a large interest in mutant activity, she investigates a cult in Egypt that was formed upon the existence of mutants being revealed to the public, and ends up inadvertently and unknowingly causing Apocalypse to awaken from his sleep.
