Other than that there is little [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] difference between slugs and snails. There are however important differences in habitats and behavior.\n\nA shell-less animal is much more maneuverable and compressible, so even quite large land slugs can take advantage of habitats or retreats with very little space, retreats that would be inaccessible to a similar-sized snail. Slugs squeeze themselves into confined spaces such as under loose bark on trees or under stone slabs, logs or wooden boards lying on the ground. In such retreats they are in less danger from either predators or desiccation. Those are often suitable places for laying their eggs.\n\nSlugs as a group are far from [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]; scientifically speaking \"slug\" is a term of convenience with little taxonomic significance. The reduction or loss of the shell has evolved many times independently within several very different lineages of gastropods. The various taxa of land and sea gastropods with slug morphology occur within numerous higher taxonomic groups of shelled species; such independent slug taxa are not in general closely related to one another.\n\n==Human relevance==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Snail-wiki-120-Zachi-Evenor.jpg|thumb|''Cornu aspersum'' \u2013 garden snail]]\nLand snails are known as an agricultural and garden pest but some species are an edible delicacy and occasionally household [[pet]]s.\n\n===In agriculture===\nThere are a variety of snail-control measures that gardeners and farmers use in an attempt to reduce damage to valuable plants. Traditional pesticides are still used, as are many less toxic control options such as concentrated [[garlic]] or [[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]] solutions. [[Copper]] metal is also a snail repellent, and thus a copper band around the trunk of a tree will prevent snails from climbing up and reaching the foliage and fruit. A layer of a dry, finely ground, and scratchy substance such as [[diatomaceous earth]] can also deter snails.<ref>Sanders, April. [http://homeguides.sfgate.com/egg-shells-stop-snails-eating-plants-87576.html \"Do Egg Shells Help Stop Snails From Eating Plants?\"] Home Guides | [[SF Gate]]. Accessed 01 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe [[decollate snail]] (''Rumina decollata'') will capture and eat garden snails, and because of this it has sometimes been introduced as a [[biological pest control]] agent. However, this is not without problems, as the decollate snail is just as likely to attack and devour other gastropods that may represent a valuable part of the native fauna of the region.\n\n===As food===\n{{Main article|Heliciculture}}\n\n[[File:Cooked snails.JPG|thumb|right|[[Escargot|French cooked snails]]]]\nIn [[French cuisine]], edible snails are served for instance in ''[[Escargot]] \u00e0 la [[Burgundy|Bourguignonne]]''. The practice of rearing snails for food is known as [[heliciculture]]. For purposes of cultivation, the snails are kept in a dark place in a wired cage with dry straw or dry wood. [[Coppiced]] wine-grape vines are often used for this purpose. During the rainy period, the snails come out of [[Land_snail#Hibernation_and_estivation|hibernation]] and release most of their mucus onto the dry wood/straw. The snails are then prepared for cooking. Their texture when cooked is slightly chewy and tender. \n\nAs well as being relished as gourmet food, several species of land snails provide an easily harvested source of [[Protein_(nutrient)|protein]] to many people in poor communities around the world. Many land snails are valuable because they can feed on a wide range of agricultural wastes, such as shed leaves in [[banana plantations]]. In some countries, [[Giant African land snail|giant African land snails]] are produced commercially for food.\n\nLand snails, freshwater snails and sea snails are all eaten in many  countries. In certain parts of the world, snails are fried as for example, in [[Indonesia]], they are fried as [[satay]], a dish known as ''[[sate kakul]]''. The eggs of certain snail species are eaten in a fashion similar to the way [[caviar]] is eaten.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], snails are traditionally cooked in an oven with rice or fried in a pan with vegetable oil and red paprika powder. Before they are used for those dishes, however, they are thoroughly boiled in hot water (for up to 90 minutes) and manually extracted from their shells. The two species most commonly used for food in the country are ''[[Helix lucorum]]'' and ''[[Helix pomatia]]''.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Famine food====\nSnails and slug species that are not normally eaten in certain areas have occasionally been used as [[famine food]] in historical times.

Other than that there is little [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] difference between slugs and snails. There are however important differences in habitats and behavior.\n\nA shell-less animal is much more maneuverable and compressible, so even quite large land slugs can take advantage of habitats or retreats with very little space, retreats that would be inaccessible to a similar-sized snail. Slugs squeeze themselves into confined spaces such as under loose bark on trees or under stone slabs, logs or wooden boards lying on the ground. In such retreats they are in less danger from either predators or desiccation. Those are often suitable places for laying their eggs.\n\nSlugs as a group are far from [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]; scientifically speaking \"slug\" is a term of convenience with little taxonomic significance. The reduction or loss of the shell has evolved many times independently within several very different lineages of gastropods. The various taxa of land and sea gastropods with slug morphology occur within numerous higher taxonomic groups of shelled species; such independent slug taxa are not in general closely related to one another.\n\n==Human relevance==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Snail-wiki-120-Zachi-Evenor.jpg|thumb|''Cornu aspersum'' \u2013 garden snail]]\nLand snails are known as an agricultural and garden pest but some species are an edible delicacy and occasionally household [[pet]]s.\n\n===In agriculture===\nThere are a variety of snail-control measures that gardeners and farmers use in an attempt to reduce damage to valuable plants. Traditional pesticides are still used, as are many less toxic control options such as concentrated [[garlic]] or [[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]] solutions. [[Copper]] metal is also a snail repellent, and thus a copper band around the trunk of a tree will prevent snails from climbing up and reaching the foliage and fruit. A layer of a dry, finely ground, and scratchy substance such as [[diatomaceous earth]] can also deter snails.<ref>Sanders, April. [http://homeguides.sfgate.com/egg-shells-stop-snails-eating-plants-87576.html \"Do Egg Shells Help Stop Snails From Eating Plants?\"] Home Guides | [[SF Gate]]. Accessed 01 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe [[decollate snail]] (''Rumina decollata'') will capture and eat garden snails, and because of this it has sometimes been introduced as a [[biological pest control]] agent. However, this is not without problems, as the decollate snail is just as likely to attack and devour other gastropods that may represent a valuable part of the native fauna of the region.\n\n===As food===\n{{Main article|Heliciculture}}\n\n[[File:Cooked snails.JPG|thumb|right|[[Escargot|French cooked snails]]]]\nIn [[French cuisine]], edible snails are served for instance in ''[[Escargot]] \u00e0 la [[Burgundy|Bourguignonne]]''. The practice of rearing snails for food is known as [[heliciculture]]. For purposes of cultivation, the snails are kept in a dark place in a wired cage with dry straw or dry wood. [[Coppiced]] wine-grape vines are often used for this purpose. During the rainy period, the snails come out of [[Land_snail#Hibernation_and_estivation|hibernation]] and release most of their mucus onto the dry wood/straw. The snails are then prepared for cooking. Their texture when cooked is slightly chewy and tender. \n\nAs well as being relished as gourmet food, several species of land snails provide an easily harvested source of [[Protein_(nutrient)|protein]] to many people in poor communities around the world. Many land snails are valuable because they can feed on a wide range of agricultural wastes, such as shed leaves in [[banana plantations]]. In some countries, [[Giant African land snail|giant African land snails]] are produced commercially for food.\n\nLand snails, freshwater snails and sea snails are all eaten in many  countries. In certain parts of the world, snails are fried as for example, in [[Indonesia]], they are fried as [[satay]], a dish known as ''[[sate kakul]]''. The eggs of certain snail species are eaten in a fashion similar to the way [[caviar]] is eaten.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], snails are traditionally cooked in an oven with rice or fried in a pan with vegetable oil and red paprika powder. Before they are used for those dishes, however, they are thoroughly boiled in hot water (for up to 90 minutes) and manually extracted from their shells. The two species most commonly used for food in the country are ''[[Helix lucorum]]'' and ''[[Helix pomatia]]''.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Famine food====\nSnails and slug species that are not normally eaten in certain areas have occasionally been used as [[famine food]] in historical times.

Mary is very much content in her marriage and believes her husband to be as well. When he returns Mary notices he is uncharacteristically aloof, and assumes he is tired from work. After having more to drink than usual, Patrick reveals to Mary what is making him act strangely. Although it is not explicitly said, one can infer that Patrick asked for a divorce as he states she \"will be looked after\".\n\nSeemingly in a trance, Mary fetches a large leg of lamb from the deep-freezer in the cellar to cook for their dinner. Patrick, his back to Mary, angrily calls to her not to make him any dinner, as he is going out. While he is looking out of the window, quite suddenly, as if she is acting without thinking, Mary strikes Patrick in the back of the head with the frozen lamb leg  killing him instantly.\n\nMary realizes Patrick is dead and begins, rather coldly and practically, to ponder what must happen now. There is the baby to consider, she knows what the law does with a murderer, she will not risk the child sharing her fate. She owes it to the child to escape discovery if she can. She prepares the leg of lamb she used as a weapon and places it in the oven to somewhat destroy the evidence. Then she considers an alibi. After practising a cheerful mask and some innocuous remarks to make in conversation, she visits the grocer and chats blandly with him about what to make for Patrick's dinner. Upon her return to the house and to the room where her husband lies dead on the floor, she acts surprised and meaningfully cries. She then calls the police.\n\nWhen the police (who are all friends of her husband) arrive, they ask Mary questions and look at the scene. Considering Mary above suspicion, the police conclude Patrick was killed by an intruder with a large blunt object, likely made of metal. After they make a fruitless search around the house and surrounding area, Mary is reminded the leg is just about done and offers it to the policemen. She points out they have already been working through and past the dinner hour, and that the meat will otherwise go to waste; they hesitate but accept. During the meal, as Mary sits nearby but does not join them, the policemen discuss the murder weapon's possible location. One officer, his mouth full of meat, says it is \"probably right under our very noses\". Mary, overhearing them, begins to giggle.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n=== ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' ===\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Lamb to the Slaughter\n| series       = Alfred Hitchcock Presents\n| image        = \n| image_size   = \n| alt          = \n| caption      =  Crime in unexpected divorce.\n| season       = 3\n| episode      = 28\n| director     = Alfred Hitchcock\n| writer       = Roald Dahl\n| teleplay     = Roald Dahl\n| story        = Roald Dahl\n| producer     = [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]]\n| music        = [[Charles Gounod]]\n| photographer = John L.

Patrick declares that he is leaving Mary, played by [[Barbara Bel Geddes]], for another woman. The adaptation otherwise follows the original story, with [[Harold J. Stone]] as the police detective in charge of the investigation. At the end of the program, Hitchcock explains that Mary Maloney finally was caught after trying to bump off her second husband in the same manner because \"he was the forgetful type and had forgotten to plug in the freezer\", making the meat \"as soft as jelly\".\n\n=== ''Tales of the Unexpected'' ===\nIn 1979, the story was adapted by [[Robin Chapman]] for Roald Dahl's British television series ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', with [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] as Mary and [[Brian Blessed]] as the police detective in charge of the investigation of her husband's murder. This episode ends slightly differently from the original story: Having finished the leg of lamb, the four police officers get up and leave the kitchen. The last of them stops and turns back, looking intently at the leg bone resting on the serving platter. He then scrapes the contents of the platter into the kitchen bin.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{imdb title|0508189}} (''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'')\n* {{imdb title|0717455}} (''Tales of the Unexpected'')\n\n{{Roald Dahl}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lamb To The Slaughter}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Roald Dahl]]\n[[Category:1953 short stories]]\n[[Category:1958 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Harper's Magazine]]\n[[Category:Mariticide in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alfred Hitchcock]]\n", "name_user": "24.188.134.178", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePlot summary)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_to_the_Slaughter"}

In 2002, [[Salon.com]] published an article by Simpson, which described [[David Beckham]] as \"the biggest metrosexual in Britain\" and offered this updated definition:\n\n{{quote|The typical metrosexual is a young man with money to spend, living in or within easy reach of a metropolis \u2013 because that's where all the best shops, clubs, gyms and hairdressers are.

Perhaps the most widely used was \"retrosexual\", which in its anti- or pre-metrosexual sense was also first used by Simpson.<ref name=wordspy>{{cite web|last1=McFedries|first1=Paul|title=retrosexual|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/retrosexual.asp|website=wordspy.com|publisher=Wordspy|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> However, in later years the term was used by some to describe men who subscribed to what they affected to be the grooming and dress standards of a previous era, such as the handsome, impeccably turned-out fictional character of [[Donald Draper]] in the television series ''[[Mad Men]]'', itself set in an idealised version of the early 1960s New York advertising world.<ref name=\"DM Thomas\">{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=David|title=The return of real men: ladies, get ready to meet Mr Retrosexual|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1022932/The-return-real-men-Ladies-ready-meet-Mr-Retrosexual.html|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=Daily Mail|date=30 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"WWD Lipke\">{{cite news|last1=Lipke|first1=David|last2=Thomas|first2=Brenner|title=Men's Trend: The Retrosexual Revolution|url=http://www.wwd.com/menswear-news/lifestyle/mens-trend-the-retrosexual-revolution-3124969|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=Women's Wear Daily|date=21 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother example was the short-lived \"\u00fcbersexual\", which was coined by [[marketing]] executives and authors of ''The Future of Men'', and was perhaps inspired by Simpson's use of the term \"uber-metrosexual\" to describe David Beckham.<ref name=\"3am Simpson\">{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Mark|title=Metrodaddy v.

Marketers, in contrast, insisted that the metrosexual was always \"straight\" \u2013 they even tried to pretend that he was not vain.<ref name=\"3am Simpson\"/> However, they failed to convince the public, hence, says Simpson, their attempt to create the uber-straight ubersexual.\n\n===Narcissism===\n[[Narcissism]], according to Simpson, plays a crucial role in the metrosexual concept. In the book ''Male Impersonators'', he explains why understanding narcissism is vital to understanding modern masculinity. He cites [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s  ''[[On Narcissism]]'', which analyzes the psychological aspect of narcissism and explains narcissistic [[love]] as follows:<ref>{{cite book|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=The major works of Sigmund Freud|location=Chicago|publisher=William Benton|year=1952}}</ref>\n{{quote|A person may love: (1) According to the narcissistic type: (a) What he is himself, (b) What he once was, (c) What he would like to be, (d) Someone who once was part of himself. | Sigmund Freud | The major works of Sigmund Freud}}\n\nIn 2002, this idea was further explored in the book ''Media Sport Stars: Masculinities and Moralities'', (Routledge) when Gary Whannel described Beckham's: \"narcissistic self-absorption\", seeing it as a break from the prevailing masculine codes.<ref name=\"Metrosexual_Coad_p187\">{{cite book|last1=Coad|first1=David|title=The Metrosexual: Gender, Sexuality and Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Me-AXTjvh_8C&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186&dq=metrosexual+just+a+modern+dandy&source=bl&ots=edtnJ8F6BZ&sig=pB0d2EBOFOto8fQiHxVKYVh68ks&hl=en&sa=X&ei=S9HYU43HCqzB7Abp0oHoBg&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=metrosexual%20just%20a%20modern%20dandy&f=false|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press, Albany|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780791474099|page=187|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Female metrosexuality===\n\nFemale metrosexuality is a concept that Simpson explored with American writer Caroline Hagood.<ref>[[Huffington Post]] [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-hagood/metrosexuality-and-the-ci_b_535333.html Mark Simpson and Caroline Hagood on Wo-Metrosexuality and the City] April 13, 2010</ref>  They employed the female characters from the [[HBO]] series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' in order to illustrate examples of ''wo-metrosexuality'', a term Hagood coined to refer to the feminine form of metrosexuality. The piece implied that, although this phenomenon would not necessarily empower women, the fact that the metrosexual lifestyle de-emphasizes traditional male and female [[gender role]]s could help women out in the long run. However, it is debatable whether the characters made famous by \"Sex and the City\"  truly de-emphasized female gender roles, given that the series focused a high amount of attention on stereotypically feminine interests like clothing, appearance, and romantic entanglements.\n\n==Changing masculinity==\n[[File:William Rast fashion show for New York Fashion Week.jpg|thumb|upright|Men's fashion industry and consumer culture is closely related to the concept of the metrosexual man.]]\nTraditional masculine norms, as described in psychologist [[Ronald F. Levant]]'s ''Masculinity Reconstructed'' are: \"avoidance of femininity; restricted emotions; sex disconnected from intimacy; pursuit of achievement and status; self-reliance; strength; aggression and [[homophobia]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Levant |first1=Ronald F. |last2=Kopecky |first2=Gini |title=Masculinity Reconstructed: Changing the Rules of Manhood\u2014At Work, in Relationships, and in Family Life |url=https://archive.org/details/masculinityrecon00leva |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |isbn=978-0452275416}}</ref>\n\nVarious studies, including market research by [[Euro RSCG]], have suggested that the pursuit of achievement and status is not as important to men as it used to be; and neither is, to a degree, the restriction of emotions or the disconnection of sex from intimacy. Another norm change supported by research is that men \"no longer find sexual freedom universally enthralling\". Lillian Alzheimer noted less avoidance of femininity and the \"emergence of a segment of men who have embraced customs and attitudes once deemed the province of women\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Alzheimer |first=Lillian |title=Metrosexuals: The Future of Men? |publisher=Euro RSCG |date=22 June 2003 |accessdate=15 December 2003 |url=http://www.eurorscg.com/press/press_204.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803074837/http://www.eurorscg.com/press/press_204.htm |archivedate=3 August 2003 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nMen's fashion magazines \u2013 such as ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[Men's Vogue]]'', and the defunct ''[[Cargo (magazine)|Cargo]]'' \u2013 targeted what one ''Details'' editor called \"men who moisturize and read a lot of magazines\".<ref name=\"Ad Age Fine\">{{cite news|last1=Fine|first1=Jon|title=Counter couture: men's fashion titles on rise even as ad pages fall|url=http://adage.com/article/ad-age-china/counter-couture-men-s-fashion-titles-rise-ad-pages-fall/102212/|accessdate=31 July 2014|publisher=Ad Age|date=28 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nChanges in culture and attitudes toward masculinity, visible in the media through television shows such as ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and ''[[Will & Grace]]'', have changed these traditional masculine norms. Metrosexuals only made their appearance after [[cultural]] changes in the environment and changes in views on masculinity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Simpson said in his article \"Metrosexual? That rings a bell...\" that \"Gay men provided the early prototype for metrosexuality. Decidedly single, definitely [[Urban culture|urban]], dreadfully uncertain of their identity (hence the emphasis on pride and the susceptibility to the latest label) and socially [[emasculate]]d, gay men pioneered the business of accessorising\u2014and combining\u2014masculinity and desirability.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Mark|title=Metrosexual?

(3155147413).jpg|thumb|left|By 2004, men were buying 69 percent of their own apparel, according to retail analyst Marshal Cohen]]\nBut such probing analyses into various shoppers' psyches may have ignored other significant factors affecting men's shopping habits, foremost among them women's shopping habits. As the retail analyst Marshal Cohen explained in a 2005 article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' entitled, \"Gay or Straight? Hard to Tell\", the fact that women buy less of men's clothing than they used to has, more than any other factor, propelled men into stores to shop for themselves. \"In 1985 only 25 percent of all men's apparel was bought by men, he said; 75 percent was bought by women for men. By 1998 men were buying 52 percent of apparel; in 2004 that number grew to 69 percent and shows no sign of slowing.\" One result of this shift was the revelation that men cared more about how they look than the women shopping for them had.<ref name=\"Colman\"/>\n\nHowever, despite changes in masculinity, research has suggested men still feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising. Martin and Gnoth  (2009) found that feminine men preferred feminine models in private, but stated a preference for the traditional masculine models when their collective self was salient. In other words, feminine men endorsed traditional masculine models when they were concerned about being classified by other men as feminine. The authors suggested this result reflected the social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculine norms.<ref>{{cite news |title=Is the Marlboro Man the Only Alternative?

As Simpson put it:<ref>{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Mark|title=Meet the metrosexual|publisher=Salon.com; later MarkSimpson.com|date=22 June 2002|url=http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrosexual_beckham.html|access-date=21 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114207/http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrosexual_beckham.html|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | text=\"For some time now, old-fashioned (re)productive, repressed, unmoisturized heterosexuality has been given the pink slip by [[consumer capitalism]].

Fashion designer [[Tom Ford]] drew parallels when he described David Beckham as a: \"total modern dandy\".

In the Nineties, he's everywhere and he's going shopping.}}\nHowever, it was not until the early 2000s when Simpson returned to the subject that the term became globally popular. In 2002, [[Salon.com]] published an article by Simpson, which described [[David Beckham]] as \"the biggest metrosexual in Britain\" and offered this updated definition:\n\n{{quote|The typical metrosexual is a young man with money to spend, living in or within easy reach of a metropolis \u2013 because that's where all the best shops, clubs, gyms and hairdressers are.

Perhaps the most widely used was \"retrosexual\", which in its anti- or pre-metrosexual sense was also first used by Simpson.<ref name=wordspy>{{cite web|last1=McFedries|first1=Paul|title=retrosexual|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/retrosexual.asp|website=wordspy.com|publisher=Wordspy|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref> However, in later years the term was used by some to describe men who subscribed to what they affected to be the grooming and dress standards of a previous era, such as the handsome, impeccably turned-out fictional character of [[Donald Draper]] in the television series ''[[Mad Men]]'', itself set in an idealised version of the early 1960s New York advertising world.<ref name=\"DM Thomas\">{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=David|title=The return of real men: ladies, get ready to meet Mr Retrosexual|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1022932/The-return-real-men-Ladies-ready-meet-Mr-Retrosexual.html|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=Daily Mail|date=30 March 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"WWD Lipke\">{{cite news|last1=Lipke|first1=David|last2=Thomas|first2=Brenner|title=Men's Trend: The Retrosexual Revolution|url=http://www.wwd.com/menswear-news/lifestyle/mens-trend-the-retrosexual-revolution-3124969|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=Women's Wear Daily|date=21 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother example was the short-lived \"\u00fcbersexual\", which was coined by [[marketing]] executives and authors of ''The Future of Men'', and was perhaps inspired by Simpson's use of the term \"uber-metrosexual\" to describe David Beckham.<ref name=\"3am Simpson\">{{cite news|last1=Simpson|first1=Mark|title=Metrodaddy v.

Marketers, in contrast, insisted that the metrosexual was always \"straight\" \u2013 they even tried to pretend that he was not vain.<ref name=\"3am Simpson\"/> However, they failed to convince the public, hence, says Simpson, their attempt to create the uber-straight ubersexual.\n\n===Narcissism===\n[[Narcissism]], according to Simpson, plays a crucial role in the metrosexual concept. In the book ''Male Impersonators'', he explains why understanding narcissism is vital to understanding modern masculinity. He cites [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s  ''[[On Narcissism]]'', which analyzes the psychological aspect of narcissism and explains narcissistic [[love]] as follows:<ref>{{cite book|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|title=The major works of Sigmund Freud|location=Chicago|publisher=William Benton|year=1952}}</ref>\n{{quote|A person may love: (1) According to the narcissistic type: (a) What he is himself, (b) What he once was, (c) What he would like to be, (d) Someone who once was part of himself. | Sigmund Freud | The major works of Sigmund Freud}}\n\nIn 2002, this idea was further explored in the book ''Media Sport Stars: Masculinities and Moralities'', (Routledge) when Gary Whannel described Beckham's: \"narcissistic self-absorption\", seeing it as a break from the prevailing masculine codes.<ref name=\"Metrosexual_Coad_p187\">{{cite book|last1=Coad|first1=David|title=The Metrosexual: Gender, Sexuality and Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Me-AXTjvh_8C&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186&dq=metrosexual+just+a+modern+dandy&source=bl&ots=edtnJ8F6BZ&sig=pB0d2EBOFOto8fQiHxVKYVh68ks&hl=en&sa=X&ei=S9HYU43HCqzB7Abp0oHoBg&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=metrosexual%20just%20a%20modern%20dandy&f=false|date=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press, Albany|location=Albany, NY|isbn=9780791474099|page=187|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Female metrosexuality===\n\nFemale metrosexuality is a concept that Simpson explored with American writer Caroline Hagood.<ref>[[Huffington Post]] [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-hagood/metrosexuality-and-the-ci_b_535333.html Mark Simpson and Caroline Hagood on Wo-Metrosexuality and the City] April 13, 2010</ref>  They employed the female characters from the [[HBO]] series ''[[Sex and the City]]'' in order to illustrate examples of ''wo-metrosexuality'', a term Hagood coined to refer to the feminine form of metrosexuality. The piece implied that, although this phenomenon would not necessarily empower women, the fact that the metrosexual lifestyle de-emphasizes traditional male and female [[gender role]]s could help women out in the long run. However, it is debatable whether the characters made famous by \"Sex and the City\"  truly de-emphasized female gender roles, given that the series focused a high amount of attention on stereotypically feminine interests like clothing, appearance, and romantic entanglements.\n\n==Changing masculinity==\n[[File:William Rast fashion show for New York Fashion Week.jpg|thumb|upright|Men's fashion industry and consumer culture is closely related to the concept of the metrosexual man.]]\nTraditional masculine norms, as described in psychologist [[Ronald F. Levant]]'s ''Masculinity Reconstructed'' are: \"avoidance of femininity; restricted emotions; sex disconnected from intimacy; pursuit of achievement and status; self-reliance; strength; aggression and [[homophobia]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Levant |first1=Ronald F. |last2=Kopecky |first2=Gini |title=Masculinity Reconstructed: Changing the Rules of Manhood\u2014At Work, in Relationships, and in Family Life |url=https://archive.org/details/masculinityrecon00leva |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Dutton |year=1995 |isbn=978-0452275416}}</ref>\n\nVarious studies, including market research by [[Euro RSCG]], have suggested that the pursuit of achievement and status is not as important to men as it used to be; and neither is, to a degree, the restriction of emotions or the disconnection of sex from intimacy. Another norm change supported by research is that men \"no longer find sexual freedom universally enthralling\". Lillian Alzheimer noted less avoidance of femininity and the \"emergence of a segment of men who have embraced customs and attitudes once deemed the province of women\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Alzheimer |first=Lillian |title=Metrosexuals: The Future of Men? |publisher=Euro RSCG |date=22 June 2003 |accessdate=15 December 2003 |url=http://www.eurorscg.com/press/press_204.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803074837/http://www.eurorscg.com/press/press_204.htm |archivedate=3 August 2003 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nMen's fashion magazines \u2013 such as ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'', ''[[Men's Vogue]]'', and the defunct ''[[Cargo (magazine)|Cargo]]'' \u2013 targeted what one ''Details'' editor called \"men who moisturize and read a lot of magazines\".<ref name=\"Ad Age Fine\">{{cite news|last1=Fine|first1=Jon|title=Counter couture: men's fashion titles on rise even as ad pages fall|url=http://adage.com/article/ad-age-china/counter-couture-men-s-fashion-titles-rise-ad-pages-fall/102212/|accessdate=31 July 2014|publisher=Ad Age|date=28 February 2005}}</ref>\n\nChanges in culture and attitudes toward masculinity, visible in the media through television shows such as ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and ''[[Will & Grace]]'', have changed these traditional masculine norms. Metrosexuals only made their appearance after [[cultural]] changes in the environment and changes in views on masculinity.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Simpson said in his article \"Metrosexual? That rings a bell...\" that \"Gay men provided the early prototype for metrosexuality. Decidedly single, definitely [[Urban culture|urban]], dreadfully uncertain of their identity (hence the emphasis on pride and the susceptibility to the latest label) and socially [[emasculate]]d, gay men pioneered the business of accessorising\u2014and combining\u2014masculinity and desirability.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Mark|title=Metrosexual?

(3155147413).jpg|thumb|left|By 2004, men were buying 69 percent of their own apparel, according to retail analyst Marshal Cohen]]\nBut such probing analyses into various shoppers' psyches may have ignored other significant factors affecting men's shopping habits, foremost among them women's shopping habits. As the retail analyst Marshal Cohen explained in a 2005 article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' entitled, \"Gay or Straight? Hard to Tell\", the fact that women buy less of men's clothing than they used to has, more than any other factor, propelled men into stores to shop for themselves. \"In 1985 only 25 percent of all men's apparel was bought by men, he said; 75 percent was bought by women for men. By 1998 men were buying 52 percent of apparel; in 2004 that number grew to 69 percent and shows no sign of slowing.\" One result of this shift was the revelation that men cared more about how they look than the women shopping for them had.<ref name=\"Colman\"/>\n\nHowever, despite changes in masculinity, research has suggested men still feel social pressure to endorse traditional masculine male models in advertising. Martin and Gnoth  (2009) found that feminine men preferred feminine models in private, but stated a preference for the traditional masculine models when their collective self was salient. In other words, feminine men endorsed traditional masculine models when they were concerned about being classified by other men as feminine. The authors suggested this result reflected the social pressure on men to endorse traditional masculine norms.<ref>{{cite news |title=Is the Marlboro Man the Only Alternative?

As Simpson put it:<ref>{{cite web|last=Simpson|first=Mark|title=Meet the metrosexual|publisher=Salon.com; later MarkSimpson.com|date=22 June 2002|url=http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrosexual_beckham.html|access-date=21 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114207/http://www.marksimpson.com/pages/journalism/metrosexual_beckham.html|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | text=\"For some time now, old-fashioned (re)productive, repressed, unmoisturized heterosexuality has been given the pink slip by [[consumer capitalism]].

Fashion designer [[Tom Ford]] drew parallels when he described David Beckham as a: \"total modern dandy\".

Through [[L\u00fathien]], daughter of Melian the Maia, he and his brother Elros were also descended from the [[angel]]ic [[Maia (Middle-earth)|Maiar]]. Elrond, along with his parents, his brother, and his children, were granted a choice between Elven or human fates by the godlike [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]]. Elrond chose to live as an [[Immortality|immortal]] Elf, while his twin Elros chose the mortality of [[Man (Middle-earth)|Men]].\n\n==Biography==\nAs documented in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Elrond was born in the [[First Age]] at the refuge of the [[Mouths of Sirion]] in [[Beleriand]]. Not long afterwards the havens were destroyed by the [[sons of F\u00ebanor]], who captured Elrond and his brother Elros.

When Beleriand was destroyed at the end of the First Age, Elrond went to Lindon with the household of [[Gil-galad]], the last High King of the [[Noldor]].<ref group=T>Tolkien, [[The Silmarillion]], p. 306, p. 314, pp. 343-344</ref>\n\nDuring the War of the Elves and Sauron in the [[Second Age]], Gil-galad sent Elrond to the defence of Eregion against [[Sauron]]. Sauron destroyed Eregion and surrounded Elrond's army, but [[Durin#Durin III|Durin]] and Amroth attacked Sauron's rearguard, causing the Dark Lord to turn and drive them back to [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]]. Elrond was able to retreat north to a secluded valley, where he established the refuge of [[Imladris]], later called Rivendell.\n\n===Lord of Rivendell===\nElrond founded Rivendell in the second age  and was its lord for thousands of years, including the events of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\nNear the end of the Second Age, the Last Alliance of Elves and Men was formed, and the army departed from Imladris to [[Mordor]], led by [[Elendil]] and Gil-galad, who were both killed in the Siege of Barad-d\u00fbr. Elrond served as Gil-galad's herald, and Elrond and [[C\u00edrdan]] were entrusted with the two Elven Rings that Gil-galad held.  Elrond and C\u00edrdan were the only ones to stand with Gil-galad when he fell.\n\nIn {{ME-date|TA|109}}, Elrond married Celebr\u00edan, daughter of Celeborn and [[Galadriel]].<ref group=T>''The Lord of the Rings'', Appendix B.

After [[Aragorn]]'s father Arathorn was killed a few years after Aragorn's birth, Elrond raised Aragorn in his own household and became a surrogate father to him. Aware of his daughter Arwen's feelings for Aragorn, Elrond would permit their marriage only if Aragorn could unite Arnor and [[Gondor]] as High King.\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Elrond gave shelter to [[Thorin Oakenshield]] and his [[List of The Hobbit characters#Thorin's company|company]], after which Elrond and [[Bilbo Baggins]] became friends.

He then travelled to [[Minas Tirith]] for the marriage of Arwen and Aragorn, now King of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor. Three years later, at the approximate age of 6,520, Elrond left Middle-earth to go over [[Belegaer|the Sea]] with the [[Ring-bearer]]s, never to return.

After Gandalf confirms that Sauron has returned and had taken up residence in [[Dol Guldur]], Elrond joins the other White Council members to fight off the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] and Sauron in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''.\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' Elrond holds Men in lesser regard after witnessing Isildur's failure to destroy the One Ring. Unlike the book, he is more skeptical of Aragorn both in terms of his ability to lead the Men of the West and the courtship of his daughter. As shown in the flashback scene in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', he forces Aragorn to end his engagement to Arwen so that she could leave to the Undying Lands, though she eventually makes the decision to stay with Aragorn in Middle-Earth. Later, he sends a \"surprisingly well-drilled army\"<ref name=\"Shippey 2005 p418\"/> to the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], an act the Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] writes was made to fit a 21st Century view of politico-military expectations.<ref name=\"Shippey 2005 p418\">{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=2005 |edition=Third |origyear=1982 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0261102750 |pages=418\u2013419}}</ref> Also, instead of presenting the reforged [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil|And\u00faril]] to Aragorn at the beginning of the quest, he only does so after arriving at [[Dunharrow]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. Elrond's sons Elladan and Elrohir and the [[Grey Company]] of the [[Rangers of the North]] led by [[Halbarad]] are absent from the film, so Elrond is the one to advise Aragorn to take the Paths of the Dead. Elrond is present at Aragorn's coronation and Arwen's wedding in Minas Tirith and departs Middle-Earth with other Ring-bearers at the end of the film.\n\nWeaving reprised his role as both Elrond and the narrator in video games ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'' (2009). In the storyline campaign of ''The Battle for Middle-earth II'' Elrond, after planning the war in the North and sending the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring, forms an alliance with the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] to repel Sauron's forces, defending Rivendell from goblin assaults. He leads the first strike in the final battle at [[Dol Guldur]], joined by other Elves and Dwarves, enabling him to defeat Sauron's remaining forces.\n\nIn the 2002 [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|video game adaptation of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'']] Elrond is voiced by [[Jim Piddock]], who later reprised the role for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'' (2011).  Elrond is one of the major characters in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' (2007). Residing in the Last Homely House in Rivendell, he is frequently consulted by players seeking council in battling threats to the lands of [[Eriador]]. In the 2003 [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|video game adaptation of ''The Hobbit'']] Elrond only appears for a few seconds in a non-interactive cutscene.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{Half-elven family tree}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist|group=T|28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction}}\n\n{{Hobbit}}\n{{Lotr}}\n\n[[Category:Middle-earth Half-elven]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings characters]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth rulers]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1937]]\n[[Category:Ring-bearers]]\n\n[[de:Figuren in Tolkiens Welt#Elrond]]\n[[simple:Middle-earth characters#Elrond]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional elf from Tolkien's legendarium}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Elrond\n| series      = [[J.

Young.\n\n[[File:elrond11.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hugo Weaving]] as Elrond in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]\n\nIn [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' trilogy]] directed by [[Peter Jackson]], Elrond is portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Froggatt |first1=Emma |title=Hugo Weaving's top 10 on-screen moments \u2013 in pictures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2015/jul/31/hugo-weavings-top-10-on-screen-moments-in-pictures |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=31 July 2015}}</ref> In ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' after Elrond reads the moon runes on Thror's map, a White Council session is held in Rivendell, where [[Gandalf]] expresses his worries to Elrond and Galadriel, but [[Saruman]] dismisses the concerns as unfounded. After Gandalf confirms that Sauron has returned and had taken up residence in [[Dol Guldur]], Elrond joins the other White Council members to fight off the [[Nazg\u00fbl]] and Sauron in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''.\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' Elrond holds Men in lesser regard after witnessing Isildur's failure to destroy the One Ring. Unlike the book, he is more skeptical of Aragorn both in terms of his ability to lead the Men of the West and the courtship of his daughter. As shown in the flashback scene in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'', he forces Aragorn to end his engagement to Arwen so that she could leave to the Undying Lands, though she eventually makes the decision to stay with Aragorn in Middle-Earth. Later, he sends a \"surprisingly well-drilled army\"<ref name=\"Shippey 2005 p418\"/> to the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], an act the Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] writes was made to fit a 21st Century view of politico-military expectations.<ref name=\"Shippey 2005 p418\">{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=2005 |edition=Third |origyear=1982 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0261102750 |pages=418\u2013419}}</ref> Also, instead of presenting the reforged [[List of Middle-earth weapons and armour#Narsil|And\u00faril]] to Aragorn at the beginning of the quest, he only does so after arriving at [[Dunharrow]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. Elrond's sons Elladan and Elrohir and the [[Grey Company]] of the [[Rangers of the North]] led by [[Halbarad]] are absent from the film, so Elrond is the one to advise Aragorn to take the Paths of the Dead. Elrond is present at Aragorn's coronation and Arwen's wedding in Minas Tirith and departs Middle-Earth with other Ring-bearers at the end of the film.\n\nWeaving reprised his role as both Elrond and the narrator in video games ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'' (2006) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'' (2009). In the storyline campaign of ''The Battle for Middle-earth II'' Elrond, after planning the war in the North and sending the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring, forms an alliance with the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] to repel Sauron's forces, defending Rivendell from goblin assaults. He leads the first strike in the final battle at [[Dol Guldur]], joined by other Elves and Dwarves, enabling him to defeat Sauron's remaining forces.\n\nIn the 2002 [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|video game adaptation of ''The Fellowship of the Ring'']] Elrond is voiced by [[Jim Piddock]], who later reprised the role for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'' (2011).  Elrond is one of the major characters in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' (2007). Residing in the Last Homely House in Rivendell, he is frequently consulted by players seeking council in battling threats to the lands of [[Eriador]]. In the 2003 [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|video game adaptation of ''The Hobbit'']] Elrond only appears for a few seconds in a non-interactive cutscene.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{Half-elven family tree}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n::''This list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.''\n{{reflist|group=T|28em}}\n\n===Secondary===\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction}}\n\n{{Hobbit}}\n{{Lotr}}\n\n[[Category:Middle-earth Half-elven]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings characters]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth rulers]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1937]]\n[[Category:Ring-bearers]]\n\n[[de:Figuren in Tolkiens Welt#Elrond]]\n[[simple:Middle-earth characters#Elrond]]\n", "name_user": "2001:56a:f67a:2700:e588:6885:f133:9f9d", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elrond"}

Naxos of America, Inc.]]''.\n\nOn December 20, 2016, the Court ruled that no such common law copyright exists in New York for public performances of a sound recording, and that Flo & Eddie could not claim royalties.<ref name=lawsuit>{{Cite news|last=Klepper|first=David|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RECORDING_COPYRIGHT_RULING?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-12-20-16-50-38|title=OWNERS OF 1967 HIT SONG 'HAPPY TOGETHER' LOSE COPYRIGHT CASE|publisher=Associated Press|date=December 20, 2016|accessdate=December 20, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221093429/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_RECORDING_COPYRIGHT_RULING?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2016-12-20-16-50-38|archivedate=December 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [{{Allmusic|class=song|id=t738498|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com Happy Together]\n* [http://www.theturtles.com The Turtles Official website]\n* [http://www.howardkaylan.com Singer Howard Kaylan's website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20141227192301/http://www.burgendeutschland.com/BG/bonner-gordon.htm Bonner-Gordon songs website]\n\n{{The Turtles}}\n{{Captain & Tennille}}\n{{T.

He was created by series developer [[Frank Darabont]] and portrayed by [[IronE Singleton]]. The character was first introduced in the [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|first season]] as a member of the group that series protagonist [[Rick Grimes]] encounters in Atlanta. T-Dog was portrayed as a well- stupid intentioned and kindhearted man towards his fellow survivors, although he struggles to prove his worth in the group. The character eventually adapts to the group and becomes one of Rick's right-hand men.\n\nT-Dog is an original character in the television series and has no counterpart in the graphic novels. Singleton made several recurring appearances as the character in the show's first through [[The Walking Dead (season 3)|third]] seasons. The character was ultimately met with a mixed reception, with the criticisms of professional reviewers claiming that T-Dog lacked character development and dialogue (particularly in the show's second season), while praise was directed towards his increased dialogue in the third season, and the heroic nature of his death.\n\n==Character biography==\nLittle background is given about T-Dog prior to the walker epidemic, but in the episode \"[[Say the Word (The Walking Dead)|Say the Word]]\" [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]] states that T-Dog helped a local church, driving its van and helping the elderly members of its congregation.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nTheodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas is a muscular and well-intentioned man, yet somewhat clumsy. In the episode \"[[Guts (The Walking Dead)|Guts]]\", T-Dog is one of a number of survivors who have come to [[Atlanta]] to scavenge for supplies. On the roof of the department store in which they have holed up, [[Merle Dixon]], a virulent racist, attempts to assert his leadership over the group and beats T-Dog. [[Rick Grimes]] subdues Merle and handcuffs him to a pipe, leaving him under the watch of T-Dog while the rest of the group look for a way out. Rick and [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]] obtain a box truck, which Rick drives to one of the store's cargo doors. In the rush to escape, T-Dog accidentally drops the key to the handcuffs down a drainpipe, leaving Merle trapped on the roof. T-Dog tries to apologize to Merle but Merle insists that T-Dog did it on purpose. T-Dog does, however, in an attempt to keep walkers from killing him, padlock a heavy chain to the roof access door. The entire group (other than Merle) is able to escape the city in the box truck. In the episode \"[[Tell It to the Frogs]]\", T-Dog and the group return to the camp, where Merle's brother [[Daryl Dixon|Daryl]] becomes enraged to hear that his brother was abandoned. Rick, Glenn, and T-Dog return to Atlanta to save Merle at Daryl's insistence, but find that Merle is gone, leaving his amputated hand behind. In the episode \"[[Vatos]]\", the four of them search for Merle and the bag of guns that Rick dropped, and Glenn is captured by another group of survivors, along with the bag of guns. Rick, Daryl, and T-Dog confront the other group, and after recovering Glenn they return to camp on the outskirts of Atlanta. That evening, at dinner, the camp is overrun by a horde of zombies. In the episode \"[[Wildfire (The Walking Dead)|Wildfire]]\", T-Dog helps the group clean up after the attack, and the group agrees to seek shelter at the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]]. In the episode \"[[TS-19]]\", the group reaches the CDC facility and are allowed in by the only remaining scientist, Edwin Jenner. Jenner eventually reveals that the building will soon self-destruct; when it explodes, T-Dog barely manages to escape with the others.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nIn the season premiere \"[[What Lies Ahead]]\", T-Dog and the remaining survivors begin travelling to [[Fort Benning]] when they encounter a blockade of abandoned vehicles, and [[Dale Horvath|Dale]]'s RV breaks down. When a large herd of walkers approaches, T-Dog slices his arm on a car door, while some of the walkers chase after [[Sophia Peletier|Sophia]], who goes missing. In the episode \"[[Bloodletting (The Walking Dead)|Bloodletting]]\", he shows concern about being the only [[African-American]] member of the group and asks Dale to run away with him. Dale believes that T-Dog has contracted a blood infection from his wound, and Daryl later gives Dale some painkillers and [[doxycycline]] antibiotics that Merle had been carrying around. In the episode \"[[Save the Last One]]\", Glenn and T-Dog journey to [[Hershel Greene|Hershel]]'s farm, where T-Dog receives medical treatment for blood poisoning. In the episode \"[[Cherokee Rose (The Walking Dead)|Cherokee Rose]]\", the group is allowed to stay at the farm while they search for Sophia. T-Dog helps extract a walker from one of the farm's wells, but when the walker bursts open it contaminates the water, and T-Dog kills it with an axe. In the episode \"[[Chupacabra (The Walking Dead)|Chupacabra]]\", when Daryl returns to camp after searching for Sophia, Andrea spots him in the distance but confuses him for a walker and shoots him. T-Dog finds Daryl wounded, and discovers that he had found Sophia's doll. In the episode \"[[Secrets (The Walking Dead)|Secrets]]\", T-Dog helps give firearm training to some of the others at the farm. In the episode \"[[Pretty Much Dead Already]]\", [[Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)|Shane Walsh]] breaks open Hershel's barn, where he had been sheltering walkers who had been his family, friends, and neighbors, and T-Dog helps shoot the walkers as they come out of the barn. In the episode \"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\", T-Dog helps burn the walker bodies. In the episode \"[[Triggerfinger (The Walking Dead)|Triggerfinger]]\", T-Dog is seen with the group when Shane reveals that [[Lori Grimes|Lori]] is pregnant, and later when the group discusses what to do with [[Randall Culver|Randall]], who was captured some of the others after his group attacked them. In the episode \"[[Judge, Jury, Executioner]]\", T-Dog is seen attending the group debate over Randall's fate, and later witnesses Daryl mercy killing Dale after he had been ripped open by a walker. In the episode \"[[Better Angels (The Walking Dead)|Better Angels]]\", Hershel allows the group to stay at his farm indefinitely following Dale's death. T-Dog helps the group move into Hershel's home, and he later notices that Randall is no longer in the barn where he was being held. In the season finale \"[[Beside the Dying Fire]]\", walkers overrun the farm, and he escapes with a few other survivors. He is keen on moving on and escaping, but Lori convinces him to turn back to get Rick and the others.\n\n===Season 3===\nIn the season premiere \"[[Seed (The Walking Dead)|Seed]]\", after several months on the road. the group discovers a prison complex and they clear out all the walkers there so they can settle in and make it their new home. T-Dog joins some others on a scouting mission to other parts of the prison, where they encounter a group of five surviving inmates. In the episode \"[[Sick (The Walking Dead)|Sick]]\", Rick, Daryl, and T-Dog confront the prisoners, who claim rights to the prison because they were there first. Rick and his group argue that they cleared out the walkers, so they earned the prison. They initially compromise to share the prison, but when Tomas, one of the prisoners, tries to assassinate Rick, the group fights them; one inmate ([[Andrew (The Walking Dead)|Andrew]]) escapes, and only two are left alive, [[Oscar (The Walking Dead)|Oscar]] and [[Axel (The Walking Dead)|Axel]]. They surrender and Rick spares their lives but locks them in another cell block. In the episode \"[[Killer Within]]\", Oscar and Axel plead to be part of the group, but Rick declines. T-Dog tries to convince Rick and Daryl to let the two surviving prisoners join their group, but he is overruled. Later, a horde of walkers somehow invades the prison courtyard, and T-Dog is bitten on the shoulder by a walker while securing the gate, and is then killed while sacrificing his life to allow [[Carol Peletier|Carol]] to escape when they run out of ammunition. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the escaped Andrew let the walkers in.\n\n==Development and reception==\n[[File:IronE Singleton 2012.jpg|200px|thumb|left|T-Dog was portrayed by recurring cast member [[IronE Singleton]].]]\n[[IronE Singleton]], who played T-Dog, recalled: \"when I was first cast in the show, I was told that I would do two, maybe three episodes, but I ended up staying on the show for three seasons. How miraculous is that? So, I'm very thankful for that.\"<ref name=\"collider\">{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/irone-singleton-the-walking-dead-interview/209880/ |title=IronE Singleton Talks Latest Episode of THE WALKING DEAD in Spoiler-Filled Interview |author=Radish, Christina |date=November 10, 2012 |work=Collider |publisher=IndieClick Film Network |accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Singleton found it liberating as an actor to be cast in a role that was not based on a character in the comics, because \"you start with a clean slate. There's nothing more liberating about starting with something that is not written. You pretty much create the history of that character and that character's life story. Whatever you do, whatever you come up with, whatever you decide on, you can go with it and, if the director or the execs they like it, then you'll stick with it.\"<ref name=\"collider\"/> Singleton said that he didn't have any conversations with [[Robert Kirkman]], [[Frank Darabont]], or [[Glen Mazzara]] on how to develop his character, so \"T-Dog basically had my life story. He grew up in the projects, in the city, and he was fortunate enough to get to college through a football scholarship and, eventually, academic scholarships. He majored in speech communications, the same as I did. I also majored in theater, but I did not attach that to T-Dog because it probably would've made him a little more dramatic, and we're already dramatic enough on TV. Then, he graduated from college, but didn't make it to the pros. He came close, but ended up getting a regular blue collar/white collar type of job.\"<ref name=\"collider\"/>\n\nLeonard Pierce of ''[[The A.V.

Now they've lost this other key piece of their group. We really wanted to be coming out of this episode completely spent and unsure as to how to move forward. Losing T-Dog definitely helps that along. Plus: We definitely wanted to lose two people in this episode. We felt that having T-Dog die would make the audience think, \"Oh my gosh, this is a crazy episode.

Erik Kain from ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine found Lori's death especially difficult to watch, and was shocked by T-Dog's \"sudden\" death despite the fact that he \"was never as prominent a figure\" on the program. \"As hard as these deaths were to watch,\" Kain wrote, \"they also give me faith in the show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/11/04/the-walking-dead-review-because-i-could-not-stop-for-death/|title='The Walking Dead' Review: Because I Could Not Stop For Death|first=Erik|last=Kain|date=November 4, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes Publishing}}</ref> Even though he stated that T-Dog died \"a hero's death\", Michael Rapoport of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' concluded that Lori's \"gut-churning\" demise was the more memorable.<ref name=wsj>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/11/05/the-walking-dead-season-3-episode-4-killer-within-tv-recap/|title='The Walking Dead,' Season 3, Episode 4, 'Killer Within': TV Recap|first=Michael|last=Rapoport|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Les Hinton]]|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> Ted Pigeon of'' [[Slant Magazine]]'' felt that the episode's \"strong emotional undercurrents\" were \"a result of the sacrifice in both T-Dog's (IronE Singleton) final stand and Lori's decision to give birth despite the certainty that she won't survive the delivery\".<ref name=\"SlantMagazineReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2012/11/the-walking-dead-season-3-episode-4-killer-within/|title=The Walking Dead: Season 3, Episode 4, \"Killer Within\"|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=November 5, 2012|last=Pigeon|first=Ted |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} Nate Rawlings called T-Dog's death \"the most grusome{{sic}} human death in quite some time\", after noting that \"the only one willing to give the two inmates a chance was T-Dog.

Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' in his review felt the episode \"stumble[d]\" in how T-Dog and Lori were eliminated and in how the Woodbury storyline repeated what was already known.

He was created by series developer [[Frank Darabont]] and portrayed by [[IronE Singleton]]. The character was first introduced in the [[The Walking Dead (season 1)|first season]] as a member of the group that series protagonist [[Rick Grimes]] encounters in Atlanta. T-Dog was portrayed as a well-intentioned and kindhearted man towards his fellow survivors, although he struggles to prove his worth in the group. The character eventually adapts to the group and becomes one of Rick's right-hand men.\n\nT-Dog is an original character in the television series and has no counterpart in the graphic novels. Singleton made several recurring appearances as the character in the show's first through [[The Walking Dead (season 3)|third]] seasons. The character was ultimately met with a mixed reception, with the criticisms of professional reviewers claiming that T-Dog lacked character development and dialogue (particularly in the show's second season), while praise was directed towards his increased dialogue in the third season, and the heroic nature of his death.\n\n==Character biography==\nLittle background is given about T-Dog prior to the walker epidemic, but in the episode \"[[Say the Word (The Walking Dead)|Say the Word]]\" [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]] states that T-Dog helped a local church, driving its van and helping the elderly members of its congregation.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nTheodore \"T-Dog\" Douglas is a muscular and well-intentioned man, yet somewhat clumsy. In the episode \"[[Guts (The Walking Dead)|Guts]]\", T-Dog is one of a number of survivors who have come to [[Atlanta]] to scavenge for supplies. On the roof of the department store in which they have holed up, [[Merle Dixon]], a virulent racist, attempts to assert his leadership over the group and beats T-Dog. [[Rick Grimes]] subdues Merle and handcuffs him to a pipe, leaving him under the watch of T-Dog while the rest of the group look for a way out. Rick and [[Glenn Rhee|Glenn]] obtain a box truck, which Rick drives to one of the store's cargo doors. In the rush to escape, T-Dog accidentally drops the key to the handcuffs down a drainpipe, leaving Merle trapped on the roof. T-Dog tries to apologize to Merle but Merle insists that T-Dog did it on purpose. T-Dog does, however, in an attempt to keep walkers from killing him, padlock a heavy chain to the roof access door. The entire group (other than Merle) is able to escape the city in the box truck. In the episode \"[[Tell It to the Frogs]]\", T-Dog and the group return to the camp, where Merle's brother [[Daryl Dixon|Daryl]] becomes enraged to hear that his brother was abandoned. Rick, Glenn, and T-Dog return to Atlanta to save Merle at Daryl's insistence, but find that Merle is gone, leaving his amputated hand behind. In the episode \"[[Vatos]]\", the four of them search for Merle and the bag of guns that Rick dropped, and Glenn is captured by another group of survivors, along with the bag of guns. Rick, Daryl, and T-Dog confront the other group, and after recovering Glenn they return to camp on the outskirts of Atlanta. That evening, at dinner, the camp is overrun by a horde of zombies. In the episode \"[[Wildfire (The Walking Dead)|Wildfire]]\", T-Dog helps the group clean up after the attack, and the group agrees to seek shelter at the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]]. In the episode \"[[TS-19]]\", the group reaches the CDC facility and are allowed in by the only remaining scientist, Edwin Jenner. Jenner eventually reveals that the building will soon self-destruct; when it explodes, T-Dog barely manages to escape with the others.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nIn the season premiere \"[[What Lies Ahead]]\", T-Dog and the remaining survivors begin travelling to [[Fort Benning]] when they encounter a blockade of abandoned vehicles, and [[Dale Horvath|Dale]]'s RV breaks down. When a large herd of walkers approaches, T-Dog slices his arm on a car door, while some of the walkers chase after [[Sophia Peletier|Sophia]], who goes missing. In the episode \"[[Bloodletting (The Walking Dead)|Bloodletting]]\", he shows concern about being the only [[African-American]] member of the group and asks Dale to run away with him. Dale believes that T-Dog has contracted a blood infection from his wound, and Daryl later gives Dale some painkillers and [[doxycycline]] antibiotics that Merle had been carrying around. In the episode \"[[Save the Last One]]\", Glenn and T-Dog journey to [[Hershel Greene|Hershel]]'s farm, where T-Dog receives medical treatment for blood poisoning. In the episode \"[[Cherokee Rose (The Walking Dead)|Cherokee Rose]]\", the group is allowed to stay at the farm while they search for Sophia. T-Dog helps extract a walker from one of the farm's wells, but when the walker bursts open it contaminates the water, and T-Dog kills it with an axe. In the episode \"[[Chupacabra (The Walking Dead)|Chupacabra]]\", when Daryl returns to camp after searching for Sophia, Andrea spots him in the distance but confuses him for a walker and shoots him. T-Dog finds Daryl wounded, and discovers that he had found Sophia's doll. In the episode \"[[Secrets (The Walking Dead)|Secrets]]\", T-Dog helps give firearm training to some of the others at the farm. In the episode \"[[Pretty Much Dead Already]]\", [[Shane Walsh (The Walking Dead)|Shane Walsh]] breaks open Hershel's barn, where he had been sheltering walkers who had been his family, friends, and neighbors, and T-Dog helps shoot the walkers as they come out of the barn. In the episode \"[[Nebraska (The Walking Dead)|Nebraska]]\", T-Dog helps burn the walker bodies. In the episode \"[[Triggerfinger (The Walking Dead)|Triggerfinger]]\", T-Dog is seen with the group when Shane reveals that [[Lori Grimes|Lori]] is pregnant, and later when the group discusses what to do with [[Randall Culver|Randall]], who was captured some of the others after his group attacked them. In the episode \"[[Judge, Jury, Executioner]]\", T-Dog is seen attending the group debate over Randall's fate, and later witnesses Daryl mercy killing Dale after he had been ripped open by a walker. In the episode \"[[Better Angels (The Walking Dead)|Better Angels]]\", Hershel allows the group to stay at his farm indefinitely following Dale's death. T-Dog helps the group move into Hershel's home, and he later notices that Randall is no longer in the barn where he was being held. In the season finale \"[[Beside the Dying Fire]]\", walkers overrun the farm, and he escapes with a few other survivors. He is keen on moving on and escaping, but Lori convinces him to turn back to get Rick and the others.\n\n===Season 3===\nIn the season premiere \"[[Seed (The Walking Dead)|Seed]]\", after several months on the road. the group discovers a prison complex and they clear out all the walkers there so they can settle in and make it their new home. T-Dog joins some others on a scouting mission to other parts of the prison, where they encounter a group of five surviving inmates. In the episode \"[[Sick (The Walking Dead)|Sick]]\", Rick, Daryl, and T-Dog confront the prisoners, who claim rights to the prison because they were there first. Rick and his group argue that they cleared out the walkers, so they earned the prison. They initially compromise to share the prison, but when Tomas, one of the prisoners, tries to assassinate Rick, the group fights them; one inmate ([[Andrew (The Walking Dead)|Andrew]]) escapes, and only two are left alive, [[Oscar (The Walking Dead)|Oscar]] and [[Axel (The Walking Dead)|Axel]]. They surrender and Rick spares their lives but locks them in another cell block. In the episode \"[[Killer Within]]\", Oscar and Axel plead to be part of the group, but Rick declines. T-Dog tries to convince Rick and Daryl to let the two surviving prisoners join their group, but he is overruled. Later, a horde of walkers somehow invades the prison courtyard, and T-Dog is bitten on the shoulder by a walker while securing the gate, and is then killed while sacrificing his life to allow [[Carol Peletier|Carol]] to escape when they run out of ammunition. Later in the episode, it is revealed that the escaped Andrew let the walkers in.\n\n==Development and reception==\n[[File:IronE Singleton 2012.jpg|200px|thumb|left|T-Dog was portrayed by recurring cast member [[IronE Singleton]].]]\n[[IronE Singleton]], who played T-Dog, recalled: \"when I was first cast in the show, I was told that I would do two, maybe three episodes, but I ended up staying on the show for three seasons. How miraculous is that? So, I'm very thankful for that.\"<ref name=\"collider\">{{cite web |url=http://collider.com/irone-singleton-the-walking-dead-interview/209880/ |title=IronE Singleton Talks Latest Episode of THE WALKING DEAD in Spoiler-Filled Interview |author=Radish, Christina |date=November 10, 2012 |work=Collider |publisher=IndieClick Film Network |accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Singleton found it liberating as an actor to be cast in a role that was not based on a character in the comics, because \"you start with a clean slate. There's nothing more liberating about starting with something that is not written. You pretty much create the history of that character and that character's life story. Whatever you do, whatever you come up with, whatever you decide on, you can go with it and, if the director or the execs they like it, then you'll stick with it.\"<ref name=\"collider\"/> Singleton said that he didn't have any conversations with [[Robert Kirkman]], [[Frank Darabont]], or [[Glen Mazzara]] on how to develop his character, so \"T-Dog basically had my life story. He grew up in the projects, in the city, and he was fortunate enough to get to college through a football scholarship and, eventually, academic scholarships. He majored in speech communications, the same as I did. I also majored in theater, but I did not attach that to T-Dog because it probably would've made him a little more dramatic, and we're already dramatic enough on TV. Then, he graduated from college, but didn't make it to the pros. He came close, but ended up getting a regular blue collar/white collar type of job.\"<ref name=\"collider\"/>\n\nLeonard Pierce of ''[[The A.V.

T-Dog had become a central part of Rick's strike team, so to speak. So, to have him go out in such a heroic way also shows the audience just how important and essential he was. Now they've lost this other key piece of their group. We really wanted to be coming out of this episode completely spent and unsure as to how to move forward. Losing T-Dog definitely helps that along. Plus: We definitely wanted to lose two people in this episode. We felt that having T-Dog die would make the audience think, \"Oh my gosh, this is a crazy episode. We totally lost T-Dog!\" It makes the death of Lori that much more unexpected.\"<ref name=tv/> Singleton said about his character's \"heroic\" death: \"When I read [the script], I was thankful that he would go out as a hero. It made me feel really appreciated.\"<ref name=\"collider\"/>\n\nThe fate of T-Dog garnered favorable reviews from television commentators. Erik Kain from ''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]'' magazine found Lori's death especially difficult to watch, and was shocked by T-Dog's \"sudden\" death despite the fact that he \"was never as prominent a figure\" on the program. \"As hard as these deaths were to watch,\" Kain wrote, \"they also give me faith in the show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/11/04/the-walking-dead-review-because-i-could-not-stop-for-death/|title='The Walking Dead' Review: Because I Could Not Stop For Death|first=Erik|last=Kain|date=November 4, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes Publishing}}</ref> Even though he stated that T-Dog died \"a hero's death\", Michael Rapoport of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' concluded that Lori's \"gut-churning\" demise was the more memorable.<ref name=wsj>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/11/05/the-walking-dead-season-3-episode-4-killer-within-tv-recap/|title='The Walking Dead,' Season 3, Episode 4, 'Killer Within': TV Recap|first=Michael|last=Rapoport|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Les Hinton]]|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> Ted Pigeon of'' [[Slant Magazine]]'' felt that the episode's \"strong emotional undercurrents\" were \"a result of the sacrifice in both T-Dog's (IronE Singleton) final stand and Lori's decision to give birth despite the certainty that she won't survive the delivery\".<ref name=\"SlantMagazineReview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2012/11/the-walking-dead-season-3-episode-4-killer-within/|title=The Walking Dead: Season 3, Episode 4, \"Killer Within\"|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=November 5, 2012|last=Pigeon|first=Ted |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} Nate Rawlings called T-Dog's death \"the most grusome{{sic}} human death in quite some time\", after noting that \"the only one willing to give the two inmates a chance was T-Dog.

Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' in his review felt the episode \"stumble[d]\" in how T-Dog and Lori were eliminated and in how the Woodbury storyline repeated what was already known.
