The population was 1,152 at the 2010 census. The [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] are a federally recognized tribe and the [[Sixth Nation]] of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' or [[Iroquois Confederacy]] active before the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Tuscarora tribe had migrated in ancient times from the [[New York (state)|New York]] area to the South, where they were based in the Carolinas.  After an extended conflict with European settlers and other Native Americans at the beginning of the 18th century and defeat in the [[Tuscarora War]], most of the tribe migrated North, beginning in 1722.\n\nThey first located in the territory of the [[Oneida tribe]] in central New York. By the early 1800s, they declared their tribe fully relocated and said that remnant Tuscarora who stayed in the South would no longer be considered part of the tribe.  The Tuscarora and Oneida became allies of the American Continental cause during the [[American Revolution]], and of the United States during the [[War of 1812]].  During both wars, they suffered attacks by British armed forces and their First Nations allies in central [[New York (state)|New York]].  The [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] were given land from the [[Seneca tribe]] (territory which they had taken from the [[Neutral Nation]]) in 1797).  In 1803, the US government granted the Tuscarora a reservation in Niagara County.\n\nIn 1960, through the efforts of the powerful appointed official, [[Robert Moses]] of [[New York City]], [[New York State]] seized {{convert|550|acre|km2}} of the Tuscarora reservation to form a reservoir for the [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] operated by the [[New York Power Authority]]. New York needed {{convert|1350|acres|km2}} but only received {{convert|550|acre|km2}} and had to pay $1,500 per acre per a [[United States Supreme Court]] Decision.<ref>http://www.niagarafrontier.com/power.html#Moses Niagara Falls History of Power</ref> This led to a displacement of tribal members and a serious disruption to their economy.  After a lengthy court case and appeals, in 2003, the Power Authority agreed to compensate the tribe financially and return some unused land.\n\nThe reservation is a composite holding derived from (1) land given to the [[Seneca tribe]], Land donated by the [[Holland Land Company]], and (3) Trust territory held by the federal government.\n\nFormer [[University at Buffalo]] head football coach [[Frank Mount Pleasant]] was born here.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Indian reservation has a total area of 9.3&nbsp;mi\u00b2 (24.0&nbsp;km\u00b2), all land.  The reservation is located northeast of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

After an extended conflict with European settlers and other Native Americans at the beginning of the 18th century and defeat in the [[Tuscarora War]], most of the tribe migrated North, beginning in 1722.\n\nThey first located in the territory of the [[Oneida tribe]] in central New York. By the early 1800s, they declared their tribe fully relocated and said that remnant Tuscarora who stayed in the South would no longer be considered part of the tribe.  The Tuscarora and Oneida became allies of the American Continental cause during the [[American Revolution]], and of the United States during the [[War of 1812]].  During both wars, they suffered attacks by British armed forces and their First Nations allies in central [[New York (state)|New York]].

The film stars [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Frank Langella]], [[Jon Cypher]], [[Chelsea Field]], [[Billy Barty]], [[Courteney Cox]], [[Robert Duncan McNeill]], and [[Meg Foster]]. It is based on the [[Mattel]] [[Masters of the Universe|toy line of the same name]] and brings the story of two teenagers who meet the mighty warrior [[He-Man]], who arrived on Earth from planet [[Eternia]] and now goes on a mission to save the universe from the villainous [[Skeletor]], his evil nemesis.\n\n''Masters of the Universe'' was released theatrically in the United States on August 7, 1987. It was a critical and [[Box office bomb|commercial failure]], grossing $17 million worldwide against a budget of $22 million, but is now regarded as a classic [[cult film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/he-man-masters-of-the-universe-christopher-yost-writer-1201573946/|title='Thor: Ragnarok' Scribe to Pen 'Masters of the Universe' for Sony |last=Kroll|first=Justin|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2015-08-19|accessdate=2016-04-01|quote=spawned a movie... that subsequently became a cult hit}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Masters Of The Universe: 15 Shocking Things You Didn\u2019t Know About The Movie |first= Leon |last=Miller |date=2017-09-03 |url=https://screenrant.com/masters-of-the-universe-movie-shocking-trivia-facts-worst/ |quote=it\u2019s since gone on to become a cult classic |work= [[Screen Rant]] |accessdate=2017-09-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/04/believe-it-or-not-a-masters-of-the-universe-reboot-is-slated-for-a-2019-release/ |title=Believe it or not, a Masters of the Universe reboot is slated for a 2019 release |first=Randall |last=Colburnon |date=2017-04-28 |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |quote=the colossal flop turned campy cult classic that was 1987\u2019s ''Masters of the Universe'' |accessdate=2017-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nOn the planet [[Eternia]], at the center of the Universe, [[Skeletor]]'s army seizes [[Castle Grayskull]], scatters the remaining Eternian defenders, and captures the [[Sorceress of Castle Grayskull|Sorceress of Grayskull]], planning to add her power to his own by the next moonrise.\n\nSkeletor's archenemy, the warrior [[He-Man]], veteran soldier [[Man-At-Arms]], and his daughter [[Teela]] rescue Gwildor from Skeletor's forces. Gwildor, a Thenorian locksmith, reveals that Skeletor has acquired his invention: a \"Cosmic Key\" that can open a portal to anywhere by utilizing sound keys. The device was stolen by Skeletor's second-in-command, [[Evil-Lyn]], allowing Skeletor to breach Castle Grayskull.\n\nWith Gwildor's remaining prototype of the Key in hand, He-Man and his friends travel to the Castle. They attempt to free the Sorceress but are overwhelmed by Skeletor's army and forced to flee through Gwildor's hastily opened portal, transporting them to [[Earth]]. The Key is misplaced on their arrival and discovered by two [[California]] teenagers, orphaned high school girl Julie Winston and her boyfriend Kevin Corrigan. While experimenting with the device, they accidentally send a signal that allows Evil-Lyn to track it. She then sends her henchmen\u2014Saurod, Blade, [[Beast Man]], and Karg\u2014to recover it.\n\nKevin, an aspiring musician, mistakes the Key for a synthesizer and takes it to a music store run by his friend Charlie. Karg's team arrives and chases Julie until He-Man rescues her. Karg's team returns to Grayskull where, incensed by their failure, Skeletor kills Saurod and sends the others back to Earth, with a larger force under Evil-Lyn's command. Unable to find Julie, Kevin is taken to Julie's house by Lubic, a detective investigating the disturbance created by Karg's team. Suspecting the Key is stolen, Lubic confiscates it from Kevin and leaves. Immediately afterward, Evil-Lyn captures and interrogates Kevin for the Key's location with a mind-control collar, before pursuing Lubic.\n\nJulie and the Eternians release Kevin from the collar before they go after Lubic and the Key. They arrive at Charlie's store, but Skeletor's forces catch up with them and a pitched battle ensues. Evil-Lyn recovers the Key and summons Skeletor to Earth. Skeletor's forces capture the Eternians, and Julie is mortally wounded by Skeletor's lightning blast, which simultaneously erases the memory storage of Gwildor's Key. He-Man surrenders to save his comrades and is returned to Eternia as Skeletor's slave. Skeletor demands that He-Man kneel before him for all of Eternia to witness, before he is killed. He-Man refuses and is lashed by Blade's laser whip in an attempt to make him submit. He-Man is still standing when the moon rises, and Skeletor absorbs the powers of the universe. Declaring himself the Master of the Universe, Skeletor asserts his victory and continues to torture He-Man with energy blasts.\n\nBack on Earth, Gwildor repairs the Cosmic Key and Kevin re-creates the tones necessary to create a gateway to Eternia. The group, including Lubic who attempts to arrest them, are transported to Castle Grayskull, where they begin battling Skeletor's forces. Resenting that Skeletor absorbed the power of the Universe without sharing it with her, Evil-Lyn deserts him along with the other henchmen. Skeletor accidentally frees He-Man, who reclaims the Sword of Grayskull, and they battle until He-Man shatters Skeletor's staff, removing his new powers and restoring him to his normal state. He-Man offers mercy, but Skeletor draws a concealed sword and attempts to kill He-Man; He-Man knocks Skeletor into a vast pit below. The freed Sorceress heals Julie and a portal is opened to send the Earthlings home. Hailed as a hero for his bravery, Lubic decides to remain on Eternia.\n\nJulie awakens on the morning of her parents' deaths by plane crash. She prevents them from taking the ill-fated flight by taking their keys, and runs outside to find Kevin. Kevin confirms that their experiences were real, producing a souvenir from Eternia: a small blue sphere containing a scene of He-Man in front of Castle Grayskull with his sword raised above his head.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Skeletor's head emerges from the water at the bottom of the pit, saying \"I'll be back!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Frank Langella Deauville 2012.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Frank Langella]] in 2012.

The original draft included more time spent on Eternia and Snake Mountain, had Beast Man in a speaking role, and even revealed that He-Man's mother was originally from Earth, as per the character [[List of Masters of the Universe characters#Queen Marlena|Queen Marlena]] from the [[Filmation]] animated series ''[[He-Man and the Masters of the Universe]]'', thus linking the two planets.<ref>{{cite news|title= Masters Cast \u2013 Episode 3 |publisher= Masters Cast|date=|url= http://masterscast.com/podcasts/masterscast_ep003.mp3|accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> Describing her character, Foster said that Evil-Lyn is not villainous, \"she is just doing her job and she knows how to get results, even if it means being harsh.\" Langella agreed, calling Evil-Lyn a female more dedicated to Skeletor's cause than any man; she is obsessive around Skeletor because she is slightly lovelorn.{{Sfn|SFX|2013|p=84}} The filmmakers considered having Foster wear contact lenses to mask her naturally pale-blue eyes, but decided that her natural eyes fit the character better. However, they did augment Foster's chest, fitting cleavage into the character's costume. Foster wanted the character to have a large hairstyle, rather than the short style featured in the film.{{Sfn|SFX|2013|p=85}}\n\nWhen offered the role, Langella said that he \"didn\u2019t even blink\u2026I couldn't wait to play him.\" Langella cited his then-four-year-old son's love of Skeletor while running around his house yelling He-Man's battle cry \"I have the power!\" as the reason he chose to play He-Man's archenemy.<ref name=\"IFCLangella\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/fix/2012/08/frank-langella-skeletor-masters-of-the-universe |title=Frank Langella calls Skeletor \"One of my Very Favourite Parts\" | publisher=[[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] |work=ifc.com |date=August 7, 2012|accessdate=July 13, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510193652/http://www.ifc.com/fix/2012/08/frank-langella-skeletor-masters-of-the-universe|archivedate=May 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Jack Kirby inspiration===\nComic book writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] compared the film to [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[comic book]] [[metaseries]] ''[[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]]'', stating in ''[[Comic Shop News]]'' #497:\n\n{{bquote|The '''best''' [[New Gods]] movie, IMHO, is ''Masters of the Universe''. I even corresponded with the director, who told me this was his intent, and that he had tried to get [Jack] Kirby to do the production designs, but the studio nixed it.\n\nCheck it out. It requires some bending and an occasional sex change ([[Metron (comics)|Metron]] becomes an ugly dwarf, The [[Highfather]] becomes the Sorceress), but it's an amazingly close analog, otherwise. And [[Frank Langella]]'s Skeletor is a '''dandy''' Darkseid!}}\n\nDirector Gary Goddard clarified this in a letter appearing in ''[[John Byrne's Next Men]]'' #26, in which he stated:\n\n{{bquote|As the director of ''Masters of the Universe'', it was a pleasure to see that someone got it. Your comparison of the film to Kirby\u2019s ''[[New Gods]]'' was not far off. In fact, the storyline was greatly inspired by the classic ''[[Fantastic Four]]''/''[[Doctor Doom]]'' epics, ''The New Gods'' and a bit of ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' thrown in here and there. I intended the film to be a \"motion picture comic book,\" though it was a tough proposition to sell to the studio at the time. 'Comics are just for kids,' they thought. They would not allow me to hire Jack Kirby who I desperately wanted to be the conceptual artist for the picture\u2026\n\nI grew up with Kirby's comics (I've still got all my Marvels from the first issue of ''Fantastic Four'' and ''[[Spider-Man]]'' through the time Kirby left) and I had great pleasure meeting him when he first moved to California. Since that time I enjoyed the friendship of Jack and Roz and was lucky enough to spend many hours with Jack, hearing how he created this character and that one, why a villain has to be even more powerful than a hero, and on and on. Jack was a great communicator, and listening to him was always an education. You might be interested to know that I tried to dedicate ''Masters of Universe'' to Jack Kirby in the closing credits, but the studio took the credit out.}}\n\nBrian Cronin, author of the \"Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed\" column, concludes that \"the film itself was not intended to be literally a reworked Fourth World, although the intent WAS to make the film a tribute to Jack Kirby\u2014just a tribute to ALL of his work, not just the Fourth World.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/11/02/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-75/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #75 |publisher=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] of ''Masters of the Universe'' was composed by [[Bill Conti]]. It was recorded by several European orchestras, chiefly the Graunke Orchestra of Munich (the only one to be credited on the soundtrack album) and conducted by a number of conductors, chiefly Bruce Miller and [[Harry Rabinowitz]] (Rabinowitz received sole credit). Conti did not conduct his score because it could not be recorded in the United States as \"there was a musicians strike or something like that\u2026So it went to various places.\" He and the score mixer Dan Wallin assembled the score from the various recorded takes, because there were problems with the orchestral performances (\"We didn't have anything that went from beginning to end without a problem\").<ref>\"Bill Conti's Music of the Universe,\" pg. 8, liner notes, ''Masters of the Universe: Complete Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,'' La-La Land Records LLLCD 1071.</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack album was released on record, cassette, and compact disc by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] in 1987; it was subsequently issued in an expanded version by Edel.

Gwildor, a Thenorian locksmith, reveals that Skeletor has acquired his invention: a \"Cosmic Key\" that can open a portal to anywhere by utilizing sound keys. The device was stolen by Skeletor's second-in-command, [[Evil-Lyn]], allowing Skeletor to breach Castle Grayskull.\n\nWith Gwildor's remaining prototype of the Key in hand, He-Man and his friends travel to the Castle. They attempt to free the Sorceress but are overwhelmed by Skeletor's army and forced to flee through Gwildor's hastily opened portal, transporting them to [[Earth]]. The Key is misplaced on their arrival and discovered by two [[New Jersey]] teenagers, orphaned high school girl Julie Winston and her boyfriend Kevin Corrigan. While experimenting with the device, they accidentally send a signal that allows Evil-Lyn to track it. She then sends her henchmen\u2014Saurod, Blade, [[Beast Man]], and Karg\u2014to recover it.\n\nKevin, an aspiring musician, mistakes the Key for a synthesizer and takes it to a music store run by his friend Charlie. Karg's team arrives and chases Julie until He-Man rescues her. Karg's team returns to Grayskull where, incensed by their failure, Skeletor kills Saurod and sends the others back to Earth, with a larger force under Evil-Lyn's command. Unable to find Julie, Kevin is taken to Julie's house by Lubic, a detective investigating the disturbance created by Karg's team. Suspecting the Key is stolen, Lubic confiscates it from Kevin and leaves. Immediately afterward, Evil-Lyn captures and interrogates Kevin for the Key's location with a mind-control collar, before pursuing Lubic.\n\nJulie and the Eternians release Kevin from the collar before they go after Lubic and the Key. They arrive at Charlie's store, but Skeletor's forces catch up with them and a pitched battle ensues. Evil-Lyn recovers the Key and summons Skeletor to Earth. Skeletor's forces capture the Eternians, and Julie is mortally wounded by Skeletor's lightning blast, which simultaneously erases the memory storage of Gwildor's Key. He-Man surrenders to save his comrades and is returned to Eternia as Skeletor's slave. Skeletor demands that He-Man kneel before him for all of Eternia to witness, before he is killed. He-Man refuses and is lashed by Blade's laser whip in an attempt to make him submit. He-Man is still standing when the moon rises, and Skeletor absorbs the powers of the universe. Declaring himself the Master of the Universe, Skeletor asserts his victory and continues to torture He-Man with energy blasts.\n\nBack on Earth, Gwildor repairs the Cosmic Key and Kevin re-creates the tones necessary to create a gateway to Eternia. The group, including Lubic who attempts to arrest them, are transported to Castle Grayskull, where they begin battling Skeletor's forces. Resenting that Skeletor absorbed the power of the Universe without sharing it with her, Evil-Lyn deserts him along with the other henchmen. Skeletor accidentally frees He-Man, who reclaims the Sword of Grayskull, and they battle until He-Man shatters Skeletor's staff, removing his new powers and restoring him to his normal state. He-Man offers mercy, but Skeletor draws a concealed sword and attempts to kill He-Man; He-Man knocks Skeletor into a vast pit below. The freed Sorceress heals Julie and a portal is opened to send the Earthlings home. Hailed as a hero for his bravery, Lubic decides to remain on Eternia.\n\nJulie awakens on the morning of her parents' deaths by plane crash. She prevents them from taking the ill-fated flight by taking their keys, and runs outside to find Kevin. Kevin confirms that their experiences were real, producing a souvenir from Eternia: a small blue sphere containing a scene of He-Man in front of Castle Grayskull with his sword raised above his head.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Skeletor's head emerges from the water at the bottom of the pit, saying \"I'll be back!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Frank Langella Deauville 2012.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Frank Langella]] in 2012.

I even corresponded with the director, who told me this was his intent, and that he had tried to get [Jack] Kirby to do the production designs, but the studio nixed it.\n\nCheck it out. It requires some bending and an occasional sex change ([[Metron (comics)|Metron]] becomes an ugly dwarf, The [[Highfather]] becomes the Sorceress), but it's an amazingly close analog, otherwise. And [[Frank Langella]]'s Skeletor is a '''dandy''' Darkseid!}}\n\nDirector Gary Goddard clarified this in a letter appearing in ''[[John Byrne's Next Men]]'' #26, in which he stated:\n\n{{bquote|As the director of ''Masters of the Universe'', it was a pleasure to see that someone got it. Your comparison of the film to Kirby\u2019s ''[[New Gods]]'' was not far off. In fact, the storyline was greatly inspired by the classic ''[[Fantastic Four]]''/''[[Doctor Doom]]'' epics, ''The New Gods'' and a bit of ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' thrown in here and there. I intended the film to be a \"motion picture comic book,\" though it was a tough proposition to sell to the studio at the time. 'Comics are just for kids,' they thought. They would not allow me to hire Jack Kirby who I desperately wanted to be the conceptual artist for the picture\u2026\n\nI grew up with Kirby's comics (I've still got all my Marvels from the first issue of ''Fantastic Four'' and ''[[Spider-Man]]'' through the time Kirby left) and I had great pleasure meeting him when he first moved to California. Since that time I enjoyed the friendship of Jack and Roz and was lucky enough to spend many hours with Jack, hearing how he created this character and that one, why a villain has to be even more powerful than a hero, and on and on. Jack was a great communicator, and listening to him was always an education. You might be interested to know that I tried to dedicate ''Masters of Universe'' to Jack Kirby in the closing credits, but the studio took the credit out.}}\n\nBrian Cronin, author of the \"Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed\" column, concludes that \"the film itself was not intended to be literally a reworked Fourth World, although the intent WAS to make the film a tribute to Jack Kirby\u2014just a tribute to ALL of his work, not just the Fourth World.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/11/02/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-75/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #75 |publisher=Goodcomics.comicbookresources.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-28}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\nThe [[Film score|musical score]] of ''Masters of the Universe'' was composed by [[Bill Conti]].

Conti did not conduct his score because it could not be recorded in the United States as \"there was a musicians strike or something like that\u2026So it went to various places.\" He and the score mixer Dan Wallin assembled the score from the various recorded takes, because there were problems with the orchestral performances (\"We didn't have anything that went from beginning to end without a problem\").<ref>\"Bill Conti's Music of the Universe,\" pg. 8, liner notes, ''Masters of the Universe: Complete Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,'' La-La Land Records LLLCD 1071.</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack album was released on record, cassette, and compact disc by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] in 1987; it was subsequently issued in an expanded version by Edel.
