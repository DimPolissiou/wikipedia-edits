Signs designation \"Future I-295\" were put up along the route when the section between Interstate 95 and River Road was opened in July 2005. The first short section of this highway had opened earlier in June 2003, and it extended only from River Road to US&nbsp;401. Then, the only mentions of a highway number were on street signs at the entrance ramps that said I-295 (with an additional \"<small>FUTURE</small>\" on some). In May 2019 the FHWA officially added the currently open 14.1 miles  of NC 295 to the Interstate System, this follows up on approval by AASHTO in the fall of 2018.<ref> |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/interstate_highway_system/routefinder/table02.cfm |title=FHWA Interstate Route Log and Finder List, Table 2-Auxiliary Routes |date=May 6, 2019 |accessdate=July 27, 2019 </ref> For the foreseeable future though the highway will still be marked as NC 295.
