Prior to the opening of the airport, the island was only reachable by sea, making it one of the most remote populated places on earth, measured as travel time from major cities. Sea journeys used to take five days from [[Cape Town]], with departures once every three weeks.\n\nThe first consideration of an airport on St Helena was made in 1943 by the [[South African Air Force]], which undertook a survey on [[Prosperous Bay Plain]] from October 1943 until January 1944, but concluded that, while technically feasible, an airport was not a practical proposition.<ref name=\"consultation_annex_a\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202192044/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2011 |title=DFID Consultation Document \u2013 Annex A \u2013 Summary of cost/benefit analysis and financial costs |publisher=DFID |date=16 April 2009 |page=12 }}</ref>\nFrom the 1960s, there was an idea{{by whom|date=April 2016}} to build an airport on the Island. In 1999, this was taken up by the island government.\n\nIt was suggested that an airport would extend the United Kingdom's capabilities to carry out airborne missions in the South Atlantic region, such as [[maritime patrol]]s in accordance with international fishing agreements (e.g., [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]]), counter-piracy missions along important trade routes, and also [[airlift]] operations notably into Southern Africa.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAccording to analysts,{{who|date=May 2017}} the UK government's decision to finally go ahead with the airport, after long delays, seems to be driven in part by concerns over a continuing tense standoff with Argentina in the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]]. The island is about {{convert|3812|mi}} from the Falklands \u2013 seven hours and 40 minutes' flight time. But, analysts say that was nevertheless an improvement over the present state of isolation from the UK for both St Helena and the Falklands.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |title=St. Helena airport a key Falklands link |date=7 November 2011 |publisher=United Press International, Inc. |access-date=8 August 2012 |work=news article |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202081633/http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |archive-date=2 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe following possible benefits were also factors in the decision-making process:\n* Air access would allow St Helena to develop its tourism sector.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n* The new wharf in Rupert's Bay could allow regularly passing cruise ships to land passengers at the island and bring tourists if sized appropriately. The lack of a protected landing facility represents a limitation on the development of cruise tourism. In unfavourable sea conditions, landing is hazardous and potential revenue is lost as many cruise ships refuse to allow passengers to land in such circumstances. In addition, because there is no protected landing facility, many cruise companies do not incorporate St Helena into their itineraries. The sea is roughest in summer which marks the peak of the cruise season.<ref>[http://www.sainthelena.gov.sh/data/files/non_technical_summary.pdf \"''Jamestown, St Helena Wharf Improvements, Project EIA: Phase 2, Final Report''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103165325/http://www.sainthelena.gov.sh/data/files/non_technical_summary.pdf |date=3 November 2011 }} by the Government of St Helena, 8 August 2011</ref>\n* Medical evacuations to South Africa for treatment of serious cases of illness would be sped up significantly: it may take up to one month until transport to South Africa by RMS ''St Helena'' becomes available.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n* The availability of heavy construction equipment would facilitate [[alternative energy]] projects, such as the construction of larger wind turbines, a [[tidal power plant]] or a dam with a hydro-power station in one of St Helena's valleys.<ref>[http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/application/documents/Environmental-Statement/Volume_2_Technical_Summary/ES_Vol_2_Chap%2017_Combined%20Effects.pdf St Helena Airport Environmental Statement \u2013 Volume 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081417/http://www.sainthelenaaccess.com/application/documents/Environmental-Statement/Volume_2_Technical_Summary/ES_Vol_2_Chap%2017_Combined%20Effects.pdf |date=26 April 2012 }} by Faber Maunsell AECOM, p. 17-3</ref> Limitations in cargo size of ''[[RMS St Helena (1989)|RMS St Helena]]'' and the unavailability of a large crane prohibit construction of larger wind turbines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXiTOjFj8MI#t=0m15s |title=Interview with Craig Penwarden, Renewable Energy Engineer at Saint Helena Government |access-date=28 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523004935/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXiTOjFj8MI#t=0m15s |archive-date=23 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:View out over Prosperous Bay Plain, St Helena Island, c1985.

Prior to the opening of the airport, the island was only reachable by sea, making it one of the most remote populated places on earth, measured as travel time from major cities. Sea journeys used to take five days from [[Cape Town]], with departures once every three weeks.\n\nThe first consideration of an airport on St Helena was made in 1943 by the [[South African Air Force]], which undertook a survey on [[Prosperous Bay Plain]] from October 1943 until January 1944, but concluded that, while technically feasible, an airport was not a practical proposition.<ref name=\"consultation_annex_a\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202192044/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/consultations/sthelena/consult-sthele-annexes-apr09.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2011 |title=DFID Consultation Document \u2013 Annex A \u2013 Summary of cost/benefit analysis and financial costs |publisher=DFID |date=16 April 2009 |page=12 }}</ref>\nFrom the 1960s, there was an idea{{by whom|date=April 2016}} to build an airport on the Island. In 1999, this was taken up by the island government.\n\nIt was suggested that an airport would extend the United Kingdom's capabilities to carry out airborne missions in the South Atlantic region, such as [[maritime patrol]]s in accordance with international fishing agreements (e.g., [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas]]), counter-piracy missions along important trade routes, and also [[airlift]] operations notably into Southern Africa.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAccording to analysts,{{who|date=May 2017}} the UK government's decision to finally go ahead with the airport, after long delays, seems to be driven in part by concerns over a continuing tense standoff with Argentina in the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]]. The island is about {{convert|3812|mi}} from the Falklands \u2013 seven hours and 40 minutes' flight time. But, analysts say that was nevertheless an improvement over the present state of isolation from the UK for both St Helena and the Falklands.<ref name=\"upi.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |title=St. Helena airport a key Falklands link |date=7 November 2011 |publisher=United Press International, Inc. |access-date=8 August 2012 |work=news article |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202081633/http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/07/St-Helena-airport-a-key-Falklands-link/UPI-78911320686806/ |archive-date=2 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe following possible benefits were also factors in the decision-making process:\n* Air access would allow St Helena to develop its tourism sector.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n* The new wharf in Rupert's Bay could allow regularly passing cruise ships to land passengers at the island and bring tourists if sized appropriately. The lack of a protected landing facility represents a limitation on the development of cruise tourism. In unfavourable sea conditions, landing is hazardous and potential revenue is lost as many cruise ships refuse to allow passengers to land in such circumstances. In addition, because there is no protected landing facility, many cruise companies do not incorporate St Helena into their itineraries.

Although nests are most closely associated with [[bird]]s, members of all classes of [[vertebrate]]s and some [[invertebrate]]s construct nests.  They may be composed of [[life|organic]] material such as [[twig]]s, [[grass]], and [[leaf|leaves]], or may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[tree]], or [[building]]. Human-made materials, such as [[String (structure)|string]], [[plastic]], [[cloth]], or [[paper]], may also be used. Nests can be found in all types of [[habitat]].\n\nNest building is driven by a [[biological]] urge known as the [[nesting instinct]] in birds and mammals. Generally each species has a distinctive style of nest.  Nest complexity is roughly correlated with the level of parental care by adults.  Nest building is considered a key adaptive advantage among birds, and they exhibit the most variation in their nests ranging from simple holes in the ground to elaborate [[communal nests]] hosting hundreds of individuals.  Nests of [[prairie dogs]] and several [[social insects]] can host millions of individuals.\n\n==Nest building==\n===Purposes of nesting===\n====Structural purposes====\nNest building is often driven by a biological urge in [[pregnant]] animals to protect one's offspring known as the [[nesting instinct]].  Animals build nests to protect their [[egg (biology)|eggs]], their offspring, or themselves from danger. The simplest nest structures are adapted to hide eggs from [[predator]]s, shield them from the sun or other environmental factors, or simply keep them from being scattered in [[ocean currents]]. In some cases, nests also help provide [[safety in numbers]] for egg-laying animals.<ref name=SDNMH>{{cite web|title=Nests and Nest-building Animals|author=Tom Dem\u00e9r\u00e9|author2=Bradford D. Hollingsworth|publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum|date=Spring 2002|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/archive/research/herpetology/NestBuilding.pdf|accessdate=August 19, 2013|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pandion haliaetus -Belize -building nest-8.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of [[osprey]]s building a nest.]]\n\n====Social purposes====\nMany nest builders provide parental care to their young, while others simply lay their eggs and leave. [[Brooding]] (incubating eggs by sitting on them) is common among birds. In general, nest complexity increases in relation to the level of parental care provided.<ref name=SDNMH />  Nest building reinforces social behavior, allowing for larger populations in small spaces to the point of increasing the [[carrying capacity]] of an environment.  Insects that exhibit the most complex nest building also exhibit the greatest social structure.  Among mammals, the [[naked mole-rat]] displays a [[Caste (biology)|caste]] structure similar to the [[social insects]] while building extensive [[burrow]]s that house hundreds of individuals. <ref name=Hansell />\n\n===Usage of environment===\nVersatility in use of construction material may be an adaptive advantage (less energy used to gather materials) or a disadvantage (less ability to specialize construction).  The available evidence suggests that [[natural selection]] more often favors [[Generalist and specialist species|specialization over flexibility]] in nest construction.<ref name=Hansell />{{why?|date=August 2018}}\n\nAt the most basic level, there are only two types of nest building: sculpting and assembly.\n====Sculpting====\nSculpting is the process of removing material to achieve a desired outcome.  Most commonly this entails burrowing into the ground or plant matter to create a nesting site.  \n====Assembly====\nAssembly entails gathering, transporting, and arranging materials to create a novel structure.  Transportation has the greatest time and energy cost so animals are usually adapted to build with materials available in their immediate environment. \n\n===Building Materials===\n[[Plant matter]] is the most common construction material for nests. Other common materials include [[fur]] or [[feathers]], perhaps from the animal itself, [[mud]] or [[dirt]], [[fecal matter]], and specialized [[secretions]] from the animal's body. \n\n===Effects on environment===\nNest building can have a substantial impact on the environment in which animals live. The combined [[digging]] activity of [[termite]]s and [[mole-rat]]s in [[South Africa]] has created a \"mima prairie\" landscape marked by huge areas of flat land punctuated by mounds {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|2|m|ft}} high. Similar structures exist in the [[United States]], created by [[pocket gopher]]s, and [[Argentina]], rodents of the genus ''[[Ctenomys]]''.  \n\n====Lasting effects====\nNests constructed by [[megapode]] birds have been mistaken for [[anthropological]] features by professionals, due to their exceptional height ({{convert|10|m|ft|disp=x| [|]}}) and abundance (hundreds in a single location).<ref name=Hansell />\n\n==Nest builders==\n[[File:Natural Beehive and Honeycombs.jpg|thumb|Hundreds of honeybees gather on their honeycomb nest.]]\nNest architecture may be as useful for distinguishing species as the animals' physical appearance. Species identified through such means are called ''ethospecies''. This is especially common in wasps and termites, but also can apply to birds. In most animals, there is some variation in nest construction between individuals. Whether these differences are driven by genetics or learned behavior is unknown.<ref name=Hansell />\n\nWith the exception of a few tunneling mammals, nest builders exhibit no specialized anatomy, instead making use of body parts primarily used for other purposes. This is possibly due to the sporadic nature of nest building, minimizing the selective pressures of anatomy used for nest building.<ref name=Hansell />\n\n===Birds===\n{{main|Bird nest}}\n\nIn general, birds are the most skilled nest builders, although not all species of birds build nests, some laying their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] directly onto rock ledges or bare soil without first modifying the area.  Complex nest building is considered to be one of the key adaptive advantages of birds.<ref name=SDNMH />  Nests help regulate temperature and reduce predation risks, thus increasing the chance that offspring live to adulthood.<ref name=Hansell />\n\nBird nests vary from simple depressions in the ground known as scrapes to largely unstructured collections of branches to elaborately woven pendants or spheres.  The [[megapode]]s, one of the few groups who do not directly brood their young, incubate their young in a mound of decomposing vegetation.  One species, ''[[Macrocephalon maleo]]'', uses volcanic sand warmed by geothermal heat to keep its eggs warm.<ref name=SDNMH />  Among the simple nest builders are [[falcon]]s, [[owl]]s, and many [[shorebird]]s.  The [[Ploceidae|weavers]] exhibit perhaps the most elaborate nests, complete with strands of grass tied into knots.  Most bird nests lie somewhere in the middle, with the majority building cup-shaped nests using some combination of mud, twigs and leaves, and feathers.  Some birds, such [[flamingo]]s and [[swifts]], use saliva to help hold their nest together.  The [[edible-nest swiftlet]] uses saliva alone to construct their nests.<ref name=Britannica />  The [[rufous hornero]] nest is composed entirely of mud and feces, which is placed on tree branches to allow the sun to harden it into a usable structure.<ref name=PopMech /> The [[tailorbird]]s stitch together leaves to provide cover for their nest sites.<ref name=SDNMH />\n\n[[File:Webervogelnst Auoblodge.JPG|thumb|left|A single nesting colony of the sociable weaver may house hundreds of individuals]]\nThe [[sociable weaver]] builds large communal nests in which many individual nests reside.  They divide the nest using walls of grass placed atop a base of large sticks.  At the entrances to the nest, sharp sticks are placed to ward off intruders.<ref name=PopMech /> A single communal site can measure {{convert|2|m|ft}} in height and {{convert|8|m|ft}} in width.

The jelly structure prevents the eggs from washing away.<ref name=SDNMH />\n\n===Fish===\nFish engage in nest building activities ranging from simply scooping out sediment to building enclosed structures out of plant matter.  Male [[stickleback]]s produce a special enzyme in their kidneys that they use to bind plants together.<ref name=Britannica />\n\n===Reptiles===\nThe [[American alligator]] is known for its parenting skills.  They build large nests of mud and vegetation on river banks or vegetation mats.  The female digs a hole in the center to lay her eggs, covers them, and then guards them for two months until they hatch. When eggs start to hatch, she breaks open the nest which has hardened over time and leads the young to the water where she continues to care for them for another year.  Alligators are very particular about their nesting sites and will abandon a site if things go wrong.<ref name=SDNMH />\n\n[[Cobra]]s use leaves and other debris to build nests in which they lay eggs that both sexes guard.  They carry the vegetation to the nest site by kinking their necks.<ref name=Britannica />  [[Sea turtle]]s dig a hole in the sand above the high tide line in which they lay their eggs.  They then cover the soft eggs to protect them from the sun and predators and leave.<ref name=SDNMH />\n\n===Dinosaurs===\n{{see also|Dinosaur egg}}\n\nFrom the fossil record, it is known that many, or perhaps all, [[dinosaur]]s laid eggs.  Paleontologists have identified a number of features that allow them to distinguish a nesting site from a random clustering of eggs.  Those include regular clustering patterns, the co-occurrence of whole eggs with broken eggs and/or hatchlings, and the occurrence of physical features such as evidence of excavation.<ref name=SDNMH />\n\n[[File:Maiasaura Nest Model.001 - Natural History Museum of London.JPG|thumb|left|''Maiasaura'' probably exhibited great amounts of parental care.]]\nThe ''[[Oviraptor]]'' nests of [[Mongolia]] are perhaps the most famous case of dinosaur nesting.  One specimen was found fossilized atop a nest in a brooding posture, proving the animal had been poorly named (Oviraptor means \"egg taker\").<ref name=SDNMH />\n\nA site known as [[Egg Mountain]] in [[Montana]] provides exceptional evidence of dinosaur nesting behavior.  The site features dozens of nests each with 20 or more eggs belonging to the ''[[Maiasaura]]''.  Juvenile teeth at the site exhibit signs of wear, while the leg bones are not developed enough to walk.  This allowed scientists to conclude that the species provided extensive parental care for its young.

Although nests are most closely associated with [[bird]]s, members of all classes of [[vertebrate]]s and some [[invertebrate]]s construct nests.  They may be composed of [[life|organic]] material such as [[twig]]s, [[grass]], and [[leaf|leaves]], or may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a [[Rock (geology)|rock]], [[tree]], or [[building]]. Human-made materials, such as [[String (structure)|string]], [[plastic]], [[cloth]], or [[paper]], may also be used. Nests can be found in all types of [[habitat]].\n\nNest building is driven by a [[biological]] urge known as the [[nesting instinct]] in birds and mammals. Generally each species has a distinctive style of nest.  Nest complexity is roughly correlated with the level of parental care by adults.  Nest building is considered a key adaptive advantage among birds, and they exhibit the most variation in their nests ranging from simple holes in the ground to elaborate [[communal nests]] hosting hundreds of individuals.  Nests of [[prairie dogs]] and several [[social insects]] can host millions of individuals.\n\n==Nest building==\n===Purposes of nesting===\n====Structural purposes====\nNest building is often driven by a biological urge in [[pregnant]] animals to protect one's offspring known as the [[nesting instinct]].  Animals build nests to protect their [[egg (biology)|eggs]], their offspring, or themselves from danger. The simplest nest structures are adapted to hide eggs from [[predator]]s, shield them from the sun or other environmental factors, or simply keep them from being scattered in [[ocean currents]]. In some cases, nests also help provide [[safety in numbers]] for egg-laying animals.<ref name=SDNMH>{{cite web|title=Nests and Nest-building Animals|author=Tom Dem\u00e9r\u00e9|author2=Bradford D. Hollingsworth|publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum|date=Spring 2002|url=http://www.sdnhm.org/archive/research/herpetology/NestBuilding.pdf|accessdate=August 19, 2013|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pandion haliaetus -Belize -building nest-8.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of [[osprey]]s building a nest.]]\n\n====Social purposes====\nMany nest builders provide parental care to their young, while others simply lay their eggs and leave. [[Brooding]] (incubating eggs by sitting on them) is common among birds. In general, nest complexity increases in relation to the level of parental care provided.<ref name=SDNMH />  Nest building reinforces social behavior, allowing for larger populations in small spaces to the point of increasing the [[carrying capacity]] of an environment.  Insects that exhibit the most complex nest building also exhibit the greatest social structure.  Among mammals, the [[naked mole-rat]] displays a [[Caste (biology)|caste]] structure similar to the [[social insects]] while building extensive [[burrow]]s that house hundreds of individuals. <ref name=Hansell />\n\n===Usage of environment===\nVersatility in use of construction material may be an adaptive advantage (less energy used to gather materials) or a disadvantage (less ability to specialize construction).  The available evidence suggests that [[natural selection]] more often favors [[Generalist and specialist species|specialization over flexibility]] in nest construction.<ref name=Hansell />{{why?|date=August 2018}}\n\nAt the most basic level, there are only two types of nest building: sculpting and assembly.\n====Sculpting====\nSculpting is the process of removing material to achieve a desired outcome.  Most commonly this entails burrowing into the ground or plant matter to create a nesting site.  \n====Assembly====\nAssembly entails gathering, transporting, and arranging materials to create a novel structure.  Transportation has the greatest time and energy cost so animals are usually adapted to build with materials available in their immediate environment. \n\n===Building Materials===\n[[Plant matter]] is the most common construction material for nests. Other common materials include [[fur]] or [[feathers]], perhaps from the animal itself, [[mud]] or [[dirt]], [[fecal matter]], and specialized [[secretions]] from the animal's body. \n\n===Effects on environment===\nNest building can have a substantial impact on the environment in which animals live. The combined [[digging]] activity of [[termite]]s and [[mole-rat]]s in [[South Africa]] has created a \"mima prairie\" landscape marked by huge areas of flat land punctuated by mounds {{convert|30|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|2|m|ft}} high. Similar structures exist in the [[United States]], created by [[pocket gopher]]s, and [[Argentina]], rodents of the genus ''[[Ctenomys]]''.  \n\n====Lasting effects====\nNests constructed by [[megapode]] birds have been mistaken for [[anthropological]] features by professionals, due to their exceptional height ({{convert|10|m|ft|disp=x| [|]}}) and abundance (hundreds in a single location).<ref name=Hansell />\n\n==Nest builders==\n[[File:Natural Beehive and Honeycombs.jpg|thumb|Hundreds of honeybees gather on their honeycomb nest.]]\nNest architecture may be as useful for distinguishing species as the animals' physical appearance. Species identified through such means are called ''ethospecies''. This is especially common in wasps and termites, but also can apply to birds. In most animals, there is some variation in nest construction between individuals. Whether these differences are driven by genetics or learned behavior is unknown.<ref name=Hansell />\n\nWith the exception of a few tunneling mammals, nest builders exhibit no specialized anatomy, instead making use of body parts primarily used for other purposes. This is possibly due to the sporadic nature of nest building, minimizing the selective pressures of anatomy used for nest building.<ref name=Hansell />\n\n===Birds===\n{{main|Bird nest}}\n\nIn general, birds are the most skilled nest builders, although not all species of birds build nests, some laying their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] directly onto rock ledges or bare soil without first modifying the area.  Complex nest building is considered to be one of the key adaptive advantages of birds.<ref name=SDNMH />  Nests help regulate temperature and reduce predation risks, thus increasing the chance that offspring live to adulthood.<ref name=Hansell />\n\nBird nests vary from simple depressions in the ground known as scrapes to largely unstructured collections of branches to elaborately woven pendants or spheres.  The [[megapode]]s, one of the few groups who do not directly brood their young, incubate their young in a mound of decomposing vegetation.  One species, ''[[Macrocephalon maleo]]'', uses volcanic sand warmed by geothermal heat to keep its eggs warm.<ref name=SDNMH />  Among the simple nest builders are [[falcon]]s, [[owl]]s, and many [[shorebird]]s.  The [[Ploceidae|weavers]] exhibit perhaps the most elaborate nests, complete with strands of grass tied into knots.  Most bird nests lie somewhere in the middle, with the majority building cup-shaped nests using some combination of mud, twigs and leaves, and feathers.  Some birds, such [[flamingo]]s and [[swifts]], use saliva to help hold their nest together.  The [[edible-nest swiftlet]] uses saliva alone to construct their nests.<ref name=Britannica />  The [[rufous hornero]] nest is composed entirely of mud and feces, which is placed on tree branches to allow the sun to harden it into a usable structure.<ref name=PopMech /> The [[tailorbird]]s stitch together leaves to provide cover for their nest sites.<ref name=SDNMH />\n\n[[File:Webervogelnst Auoblodge.JPG|thumb|left|A single nesting colony of the sociable weaver may house hundreds of individuals]]\nThe [[sociable weaver]] builds large communal nests in which many individual nests reside.

They build large nests of mud and vegetation on river banks or vegetation mats.  The female digs a hole in the center to lay her eggs, covers them, and then guards them for two months until they hatch. When eggs start to hatch, she breaks open the nest which has hardened over time and leads the young to the water where she continues to care for them for another year.  Alligators are very particular about their nesting sites and will abandon a site if things go wrong.<ref name=SDNMH />\n\n[[Cobra]]s use leaves and other debris to build nests in which they lay eggs that both sexes guard.  They carry the vegetation to the nest site by kinking their necks.<ref name=Britannica />  [[Sea turtle]]s dig a hole in the sand above the high tide line in which they lay their eggs.  They then cover the soft eggs to protect them from the sun and predators and leave.<ref name=SDNMH />\n\n===Dinosaurs===\n{{see also|Dinosaur egg}}\n\nFrom the fossil record, it is known that many, or perhaps all, [[dinosaur]]s laid eggs.  Paleontologists have identified a number of features that allow them to distinguish a nesting site from a random clustering of eggs.

The site features dozens of nests each with 20 or more eggs belonging to the ''[[Maiasaura]]''.

{"title_page": "Asymmetric induction", "text_new": "[[Image:Energy diagram for enantioselective synthesis.png|300px|thumb|A [[Gibbs free energy]] plot of an enantioselective addition reaction. The effect of asymmetric induction is to lower the transition state energy for the formation of one enantiomer over the other]]\n\nIn [[stereochemistry]], '''asymmetric induction''' (also '''enantioinduction''')  describes the preferential formation in a [[chemical reaction]] of one [[enantiomer]] or [[diastereoisomer]] over the other as a result of the influence of a [[optical isomerism|chiral]] feature present in the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], [[reagent]], [[catalyst]] or environment.<ref>[[IUPAC]] [[Gold Book]] definition [http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00483.html Link]</ref> Asymmetric induction is a key element in [[asymmetric synthesis]].\n\nAsymmetric induction was introduced by [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] based on his work on [[carbohydrate]]s.<ref>''Asymmetric Synthesis of Natural Products'', Ari Koskinen {{ISBN|0-471-93848-3}}</ref> Several types of induction exist.\n\n'''Internal asymmetric induction''' makes use of a chiral center bound to the reactive center through a [[covalent bond]] and remains so during the reaction. The starting material is often derived from [[chiral pool synthesis]]. In '''relayed asymmetric induction''' the chiral information is introduced in a separate step and removed again in a separate chemical reaction. Special synthons are called [[chiral auxiliary|chiral auxiliaries]]. In '''external asymmetric induction''' chiral information is introduced in the [[transition state]] through a [[catalyst]] of [[chiral ligand]]. This method of [[asymmetric synthesis]] is economically most desirable.\n\n==Carbonyl 1,2 asymmetric induction==\n\nSeveral models exist to describe chiral induction at carbonyl carbons during nucleophilic additions.  These models are based on a combination of steric and electronic considerations and are often in conflict with each other. Models have been devised by Cram (1952), Cornforth (1959), Felkin (1969) and others.\n\n===Cram's rule===\nThe '''Cram's rule of asymmetric induction''' developed by [[Donald J. Cram]] in 1952<ref>''Studies in Stereochemistry. X. The Rule of \"Steric Control of Asymmetric Induction\" in the Syntheses of Acyclic Systems'' [[Donald J. Cram]], Fathy Ahmed Abd Elhafez [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; '''1952'''; 74(23); 5828\u20135835. [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1952/74/i23/f-pdf/f_ja01143a007.html Abstract]</ref> is an early concept relating to the prediction of stereochemistry in certain [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]] systems. In full the rule is:\n\n''In certain non-catalytic reactions that diastereomer will predominate, which could be formed by the approach of the entering group from the least hindered side when the rotational conformation of the C-C bond is such that the double bond is flanked by the two least bulky groups attached to the adjacent asymmetric center.''\n\nThe rule indicates that the presence of an asymmetric center in a molecule induces the formation of an asymmetric center adjacent to it based on [[steric hindrance]].\n\nIn his 1952 publication Cram presented a large number of reactions described in the literature for which the conformation of the reaction products could be explained based on this rule and he also described an elaborate experiment (''scheme 1'') making his case.\n\n:[[Image:CramruleOfAsymmetricInduction.png|600px|Scheme 1. Cram's rule of asymmetric induction]]\n\nThe experiments involved two reactions. In experiment one ''2-phenylpropionaldehyde'' ('''1''', [[racemic]] but (R)-enantiomer shown) was reacted with the [[Grignard reagent]] of [[bromobenzene]] to ''1,2-diphenyl-1-propanol'' ('''2''') as a mixture of [[diastereomer]]s, predominantly the [[threo]] [[isomer]] (see for explanation the [[Fischer projection]]).\n\nThe preference for the formation of the threo isomer can be explained by the rule stated above by having the active [[nucleophile]] in this reaction attacking the [[carbonyl group]] from the least hindered side (see [[Newman projection]] '''A''') when the carbonyl is positioned in a [[staggered conformation|staggered]] formation with the [[methyl]] group and the [[hydrogen]] atom, which are the two smallest [[substituent]]s creating a minimum of [[steric hindrance]], in a [[Gauche (stereochemistry)|gauche orientation]] and [[phenyl]] as the most bulky group in the [[anti conformation]].\n\nThe second reaction is the [[organic reduction]] of ''1,2-diphenyl-1-propanone'' '''2''' with [[lithium aluminium hydride]], which results in the same reaction product as above but now with preference for the [[erythro]] isomer ('''2a'''). Now a [[hydride]] anion (H<sup>\u2212</sup>) is the nucleophile attacking from the least hindered side (imagine hydrogen entering from the paper plane).\n\nIn the original 1952 publication, additional evidence was obtained for the structural assignment of the reaction products by applying them to a [[Chugaev elimination]], wherein the threo isomer reacts to the [[cis isomer]] of -\u03b1-methyl-[[stilbene]] and the erythro isomer to the trans version.\n\n:[[Image:CramAsymmetricInductionChugaevReaction.png|600px|Scheme 2. Cram Asymmetric Induction Chugaev Reaction]]\n\n===Felkin model===\nThe '''Felkin model''' (1968) named after [[Hugh Felkin]] also predicts the [[stereochemistry]] of [[nucleophilic addition]] reactions to [[carbonyl]] groups.<ref>''Torsional strain involving partial bonds. The stereochemistry of the lithium aluminium hydride reduction of some simple open-chain ketones'' Marc Ch\u00e9rest, Hugh Felkin and Nicole Prudent [[Tetrahedron Letters]] Volume 9, Issue 18, '''1968''', Pages 2199-2204 {{doi|10.1016/S0040-4039(00)89719-1}}</ref> Felkin argued that the Cram model suffered a major drawback: an [[eclipsed]] conformation in the [[transition state]] between the carbonyl substituent (the hydrogen atom in aldehydes) and the largest \u03b1-carbonyl substituent. He demonstrated that by increasing the steric bulk of the carbonyl substituent from [[methyl]] to [[ethyl group|ethyl]] to [[isopropyl]] to [[isobutyl]], the [[stereoselectivity]] also increased, which is not predicted by Cram's rule:\n\n:[[Image:FelkinModel.png|400px|Scheme 3. Felkin model for chiral induction]]\n\nThe Felkin rules are:\n* The [[transition state]]s are reactant-like.\n* [[Strain (chemistry)#Torsional strain|Torsional strain]] (Pitzer strain) involving partial bonds (in transition states) represents a substantial fraction of the strain between fully formed bonds, even when the degree of bonding is quite low. The conformation in the TS is [[staggered conformation|staggered]] and not eclipsed with the substituent R skew with respect to two adjacent groups one of them the smallest in TS A.\n:[[Image:FelkinTransitionState.png|300px|Scheme 4. Felkin transition state A and Cram transition state B]]\n: For comparison TS B is the Cram transition state.\n* The main steric interactions involve those around R and the nucleophile but not the carbonyl oxygen atom.\n* A [[polar effect]] or electronic effect stabilizes a transition state with maximum separation between the nucleophile and an [[electron-withdrawing group]]. For instance [[haloketone]]s do not obey Cram's rule, and, in the example above, replacing the electron-withdrawing [[phenyl]] group by a [[cyclohexyl]] group reduces stereoselectivity considerably.\n\n===Felkin\u2013Anh model===\nThe '''Felkin\u2013Anh model'''<ref>It bears mentioning that in Vietnamese, the surname is given first, and so this would be better called the Felkin\u2013Nguyen Model.</ref> is an extension of the Felkin model that incorporates improvements suggested by Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u1ecdng Anh and [[Odile Eisenstein]] to correct for two key weaknesses in Felkin's model. The first weakness addressed was the statement by Felkin of a strong polar effect in nucleophilic addition transition states, which leads to the complete inversion of stereochemistry by S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, without offering justifications as to why this phenomenon was observed. Anh's solution was to offer the antiperiplanar effect as a consequence of asymmetric induction being controlled by both substituent and orbital effects.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, ''O. Nouv. J. Chim.'' '''1977''', ''1'', 61.</ref><ref>Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O.; Lefour, J-M.; Dau, M-E. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.''

''Tetrahedron'' '''1974''', ''30'', 1563.</ref> ideas allowed Anh to postulate a non-perpendicular attack by the nucleophile on the carbonyl center, anywhere from 95\u00b0 to 105\u00b0 relative to the oxygen-carbon double bond, favoring approach closer to the smaller substituent and thereby solve the problem of predictability for aldehydes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>Anh, N.

However, many examples exist of reactions that display stereoselectivity opposite of what is predicted by the basic tenets of the Cram and Felkin\u2013Anh models.  Although both of the models include attempts to explain these reversals, the products obtained are still referred to as \"anti-Felkin\" products.  One of the most common examples of altered asymmetric induction selectivity requires an \u03b1-carbon substituted with a component with [[Lewis base]] character (i.e. O, N, S, P substituents).  In this situation, if a [[Lewis acid]] such as Al-iPr<sub>2</sub> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> is introduced, a [[bidentate]] [[chelation]] effect can be observed.  This locks the [[carbonyl]] and the [[Lewis base]] substituent in an eclipsed conformation, and the [[nucleophile]] will then attack from the side with the smallest free \u03b1-carbon substituent.<ref>Mengel A., Reiser O.''Chem. Rev.'', '''1999''', ''99'' (5), 1191\u20131224.</ref>  If the chelating R group is identified as the largest, this will result in an \"anti-Felkin\" product.\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure4.png]]\n\nThis [[stereoselective]] control was recognized and discussed in the first paper establishing the Cram model, causing Cram to assert that his model requires non-chelating conditions.<ref>Cram DJ, Elhafez FA. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.''; '''1952'''; ''74''(23); 5828\u20135835.</ref>  An example of [[chelation]] control of a reaction can be seen here, from a 1987 paper that was the first to directly observe such a \"Cram-chelate\" intermediate,<ref>Reetz MT, Hullmann M, Seitz T. ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.'' '''1987.''' ''26,'' 477\u2013480.</ref> vindicating the model:\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure5.png]]\n\nHere, the methyl titanium chloride forms a Cram-chelate.  The methyl group then dissociates from [[titanium]] and attacks the carbonyl, leading to the anti-Felkin diastereomer.\n\nA non-chelating electron-withdrawing substituent effect can also result in anti-Felkin selectivity.  If a substituent on the \u03b1-carbon is sufficiently electron withdrawing, the [[nucleophile]] will add ''anti-'' relative to the [[electron withdrawing group]], even if the substituent is not the largest of the 3 bonded to the \u03b1-carbon.  Each model offers a slightly different explanation for this phenomenon.  A polar effect was postulated by the Cornforth model<ref>Cornforth JW, Cornforth MRH, Mathew KK. ''J. Chem.Soc.'' '''1959,''' 112\u2013127.</ref> and the original Felkin model,<ref>Cherest M, Felkin H, Prudent N. ''Tetrahedron Lett.'' '''1968,''' ''18,'' 2199\u20132204.</ref> which placed the EWG substituent and incoming [[nucleophile]] ''anti''- to each other in order to most effectively cancel the [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of the [[transition structure]].\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure6.png]]\n\nThis [[Newman projection]] illustrates the Cornforth and Felkin [[transition state]] that places the EWG ''anti-'' to the incoming [[nucleophile]], regardless of its steric bulk relative to R<sub>S</sub> and R<sub>L</sub>.\n\nThe improved Felkin\u2013Anh model, as discussed above, makes a more sophisticated assessment of the polar effect by considering [[molecular orbital]] interactions in the stabilization of the preferred transition state.  A typical reaction illustrating the potential anti-Felkin selectivity of this effect, along with its proposed [[transition structure]], is pictured below:\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure7.png]]\n\n==Carbonyl 1,3 asymmetric induction==\nIt has been observed that the stereoelectronic environment at the \u03b2-carbon of can also direct asymmetric induction.  A number of predictive models have evolved over the years to define the stereoselectivity of such reactions.\n\n===Chelation model===\n\nAccording to Reetz, the Cram-chelate model for 1,2-inductions can be extended to predict the chelated complex of a \u03b2-alkoxy aldehyde and metal.  The nucleophile is seen to attack from the less sterically hindered side and ''anti-'' to the substituent R<sub>\u03b2</sub>, leading to the ''anti-''adduct as the major product.<ref>Reetz, M.T.; Jung, A. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', '''1983''', ''105'', 4833.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure8.jpg]]\n\nTo make such chelates, the metal center must have at least two free coordination sites and the protecting ligands should form a bidentate complex with the Lewis acid.\n\n===Non-chelation model===\n\n===Cram\u2013Reetz model===\nCram and Reetz demonstrated that 1,3-stereocontrol is possible if the reaction proceeds through an acyclic transition state. The reaction of \u03b2-alkoxy aldehyde with allyltrimethylsilane showed good selectivity for the ''anti-''1,3-diol, which was explained by the Cram polar model. The polar benzyloxy group is oriented anti to the carbonyl to minimize dipole interactions and the nucleophile attacks ''anti-'' to the bulkier (R<sub>M</sub>) of the remaining two substituents.<ref>Leitereg, T.J.; Cram, D.J. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1968''', ''90'', 4011.</ref><ref>Reetz. M.T.; Kesseler, K.; Jung, A. ''Tetrahedron Lett''. '''1984''', ''25'', 729.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure9.jpg]]\n\n===Evans model===\n\nMore recently, Evans presented a different model for nonchelate 1,3-inductions. In the proposed transition state, the \u03b2-stereocenter is oriented ''anti-'' to the incoming nucleophile, as seen in the Felkin\u2013Anh model. The polar X group at the \u03b2-stereocenter is placed ''anti-'' to the carbonyl to reduce dipole interactions, and R\u03b2 is placed ''anti-'' to the aldehyde group to minimize the steric hindrance. Consequently, the 1,3-''anti''-diol would be predicted as the major product.<ref>Evans, D.A.; Duffy, J.L.; Dart, M.J. ''Tetrahedron Lett.''  '''1994''', ''35'', 8537.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure10.jpg]]\n\n==Carbonyl 1,2 and 1,3 asymmetric induction==\nIf the substrate has both an \u03b1- and \u03b2-stereocenter, the Felkin\u2013Anh rule (1,2-induction) and the Evans model (1,3-induction) should considered at the same time. If these two stereocenters have an ''anti-'' relationship, both models predict the same diastereomer (the stereoreinforcing case).\n\n[[Image:felkinanhfigure11.jpg]]\n\nHowever, in the case of the syn-substrate, the Felkin\u2013Anh and the Evans model predict different products (non-stereoreinforcing case).  It has been found that the size of the incoming nucleophile determines the type of control exerted over the stereochemistry.  In the case of a large nucleophile, the interaction of the \u03b1-stereocenter with the incoming nucleophile becomes dominant; therefore, the Felkin product is major one.  Smaller nucleophiles, on the other hand, result in 1,3 control determining the asymmetry.<ref>Evans, D.A.; Dart, M.J.; Duffy, J.L.; Yang, M.G. ''J .Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1996''', ''118'', 4322.</ref>\n\n[[Image:felkinanhfigure12.jpg]]\n\n==Acyclic alkenes asymmetric induction==\n\nChiral acyclic alkenes also show [[diastereoselectivity]] upon reactions such as [[epoxidation]] and enolate alkylation. The substituents around the alkene can favour the approach of the [[electrophile]] from one or the other face of the molecule. This is the basis of the '''Houk's model''', based on theoretical work by [[Kendall Houk]], which predicts that the selectivity is stronger for [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|''cis'' than for ''trans'' double bonds]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Organic Chemistry|last1= Clayden|last2= Greeves|last3= Warren|last4= Wothers|year= 2001|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn= 978-0-19-850346-0|page= [https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00clay_0/page/895 895]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00clay_0/page/895}}</ref>\n\n:[[File:Houk's model.tif|400px|Diastereoselective epoxidation of a cis alkene]]\n\nIn the example shown, the ''cis'' alkene assumes the shown conformation to minimize [[steric effect|steric clash]] between R<sub>S</sub> and the methyl group. The approach of the electrophile preferentially occurs from the same side of the medium group (R<sub>M</sub>) rather than the large group (R<sub>L</sub>), mainly producing the shown diastereoisomer. Since for a ''trans'' alkene the steric hindrance between R<sub>S</sub> and the H group is not as large as for the ''cis'' case, the selectivity is much lower.\n\n[[File:Felkin-Ahn model for nucleophilic addition to chiral aldehydes.png|thumb|Felkin\u2013Ahn model for nucleophilic addition to chiral aldehydes]]\n\n[[File:Substrate control. addition of achiral allylmetals to \u03b1-chiral aldehydes..png|thumb|Substrate control. addition of achiral allylmetals to \u03b1-chiral aldehydes.]]\n\n[[File:An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to \u03b1-chiral aldehyde..png|thumb|An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to \u03b1-chiral aldehyde.]]\n\n==Substrate control: asymmetric induction by molecular framework in acyclic systems==\n\nAsymmetric induction by the molecular framework of an acyclic substrate is the idea that asymmetric [[steric]] and [[Solid-state physics#Electronic properties|electronic]] properties of a molecule may determine the chirality of subsequent chemical reactions on that molecule. This principal is used to design [[chemical syntheses]] where one [[stereocentre]] is in place and additional stereocentres are required.\n\nWhen considering how two [[functional groups]] or species react, the precise 3D configurations of the chemical entities involved will determine how they may approach one another. Any restrictions as to how these species may approach each other will determine the configuration of the product of the reaction. In the case of asymmetric induction, we are considering the effects of one asymmetric centre on a molecule on the reactivity of other functional groups on that molecule. The closer together these two sites are, the larger an influence is expected to be observed. A more holistic approach to evaluating these factors is by [[computational modelling]],<ref>Houk, K. N. et al., Science, 1986, 231, 1108-1117.</ref> however, simple qualitative factors may also be used to explain the predominant trends seen for some synthetic steps. The ease and accuracy of this qualitative approach means it is more commonly applied in synthesis and substrate design. Examples of appropriate molecular frameworks are alpha chiral aldehydes and the use of chiral auxiliaries.\n\n===Asymmetric induction at alpha-chiral aldehydes===\n\nPossible reactivity at aldehydes include [[nucleophilic attack]] and addition of allylmetals. The stereoselectivity of nucleophilic attack at alpha-chiral aldehydes may be described by the Felkin\u2013Anh or polar Felkin Anh models and addition of achiral allylmetals may be described by Cram\u2019s rule.\n\n===Felkin\u2013Anh and polar Felkin\u2013Anh model===\n\nSelectivity in nucleophilic additions to chiral aldehydes is often explained by the Felkin\u2013Anh model<ref>a) Anh, N. T. Top. Curr. Chem. 1980, 88, 145\u2013162; (b) Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. Nouv. J. Chim. 1977, 1, 61\u201370; (c) Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. Tetrahedron Lett. 1976, 26, 155\u2013158.</ref> (see figure). The nucleophile approaches the carbon of the carbonyl group at the [[Burgi-Dunitz angle]].<ref>Burgi, H. B.; Dunitz, J. D.; Lehn, J. M.; Wipff, G. Tetrahedron. 1974. 12, 1563\u20131572.</ref> At this trajectory, attack from the bottom face is disfavored due to steric bulk of the adjacent, large, functional group.\n\nThe polar Felkin\u2013Anh model is applied in the scenario where X is an electronegative group. The polar Felkin\u2013Anh model postulates that the observed stereochemistry arises due to hyperconjugative stabilization arising from the anti-periplanar interaction between the C-X antibonding \u03c3* orbital and the forming bond.\n\nImproving Felkin\u2013Anh selectivity for organometal additions to aldehydes can be achieved by using organo-aluminum nucleophiles instead of the corresponding [[Grignard reaction|Grignard]] or organolithium nucleophiles. Claude Spino and co-workers<ref>Spino, C.; Granger, M. C.; Boisvert, L.; Beaulieu, C. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 4183\u20134185.</ref> have demonstrated significant stereoselectivity improvements upon switching from vinylgrignard to vinylalane reagents with a number of chiral aldehydes.\n\n===Cram\u2019s rule===\n\nAddition of achiral allylmetals to [[aldehydes]] forms a chiral alcohol, the stereochemical outcome of this reaction is determined by the chirality of the [[\u03b1-carbon]] on the aldehyde substrate (Figure \"Substrate control: addition of achiral allylmetals to \u03b1-chiral aldehydes\"). The allylmetal reagents used include [[boron]], [[tin]] and [[titanium]].\n\nCram\u2019s rule explains the stereoselectivity by considering the transition state depicted in figure 3. In the transition state the oxygen lone pair is able to interact with the boron centre whilst the allyl group is able to add to the carbon end of the carbonyl group. The steric demand of this transition state is minimized by the \u03b1-carbon configuration holding the largest group away from (trans to) the congested carbonyl group and the allylmetal group approaching past the smallest group on the \u03b1-carbon centre. In the example below (Figure \"An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to \u03b1-chiral aldehyde\"), (R)-2-methylbutanal (1) reacts with the allylboron reagent (2) with two possible diastereomers of which the (R, R)-isomer is the major product. The Cram model of this reaction is shown with the carbonyl group placed trans to the [[ethyl group|ethyl]] group (the large group) and the allyl boron approaching past the hydrogen (the small group). The structure is shown in [[Newman projection]]. In this case the [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction happens at the face where the hydrogen (the small group) is, producing the (R, R)-isomer as the major product.\n\n===Chiral auxiliaries===\n\nAsymmetric stereoinduction can be achieved with the use of chiral auxiliaries. Chiral auxiliaries may be reversibly attached to the substrate, inducing a diastereoselective reaction prior to cleavage, overall producing an enantioselective process. Examples of chiral auxiliaries include, Evans\u2019 chiral oxazolidinone auxiliaries (for asymmetric aldol reactions)<ref>Evans, D. A.; Bartroli, J.; Shih, T. L., Am. Chem. Soc., 1981, 103, 2127-2129.</ref> pseudoephedrine amides and [[tert-butanesulfinamide]] imines.\n\n== Substrate control: asymmetric induction by molecular framework in cyclic systems ==\n\n[[Cyclic molecule]]s often exist in much more rigid conformations than their linear counterparts. Even very large [[macrocycle]]s like [[erythromycin]] exist in defined geometries despite having many degrees of freedom. Because of these properties, it is often easier to achieve asymmetric induction with macrocyclic substrates rather than linear ones. Early experiments performed by [[W. Clark Still]]<ref>Still, W. C.; Galynker, I. Tetrahedron 1981, 37, 3981-3996.</ref> and colleagues showed that medium- and large-ring organic molecules can provide striking levels of stereo induction as substrates in reactions such as kinetic [[enolate]] [[alkylation]], [[dimethylcuprate]] addition, and catalytic [[hydrogenation]]. Even a single methyl group is often sufficient to bias the diastereomeric outcome of the reaction. These studies, among others, helped challenge the widely-held scientific belief that large rings are too floppy to provide any kind of stereochemical control. \n\nA number of total syntheses have made use of [[macrocyclic stereocontrol]] to achieve desired reaction products.

Substrate-controlled synthetic schemes have many advantages, since they do not require the use of complex asymmetric reagents to achieve selective transformations.\n\n==Reagent control: addition of chiral allylmetals to achiral aldehydes==\n\nIn [[organic synthesis]], reagent control is an approach to selectively forming one [[stereoisomer]] out of many, the [[stereoselectivity]] is determined by the structure and [[chirality]] of the reagent used. When chiral allylmetals are used for [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction to achiral [[aldehydes]], the [[chirality]] of the newly generated alcohol carbon is determined by the chirality of the allymetal reagents (Figure 1). The chirality of the allymetals usually comes from the asymmetric ligands used. The metals in the allylmetal reagents include [[boron]], [[tin]], [[titanium]], [[silicon]], etc.\n\n[[File:17 fig. 1.png|thumb|Fig. 1: Reagent control: addition of chiral allylmetals to achiral aldehydes]]\n\nVarious chiral ligands have been developed to prepare chiral allylmetals for the reaction with aldehydes.

The effect of asymmetric induction is to lower the transition state energy for the formation of one enantiomer over the other]]\n\n'''Asymmetric induction''' (also '''enantioinduction''') in [[stereochemistry]] describes the preferential formation in a [[chemical reaction]] of one [[enantiomer]] or [[diastereoisomer]] over the other as a result of the influence of a [[optical isomerism|chiral]] feature present in the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], [[reagent]], [[catalyst]] or environment.<ref>[[IUPAC]] [[Gold Book]] definition [http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00483.html Link]</ref> Asymmetric induction is a key element in [[asymmetric synthesis]].\n\nAsymmetric induction was introduced by [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] based on his work on [[carbohydrate]]s.<ref>''Asymmetric Synthesis of Natural Products'', Ari Koskinen {{ISBN|0-471-93848-3}}</ref> Several types of induction exist.\n\n'''Internal asymmetric induction''' makes use of a chiral center bound to the reactive center through a [[covalent bond]] and remains so during the reaction. The starting material is often derived from [[chiral pool synthesis]]. In '''relayed asymmetric induction''' the chiral information is introduced in a separate step and removed again in a separate chemical reaction. Special synthons are called [[chiral auxiliary|chiral auxiliaries]]. In '''external asymmetric induction''' chiral information is introduced in the [[transition state]] through a [[catalyst]] of [[chiral ligand]]. This method of [[asymmetric synthesis]] is economically most desirable.\n\n==Carbonyl 1,2 asymmetric induction==\n\nSeveral models exist to describe chiral induction at carbonyl carbons during nucleophilic additions.  These models are based on a combination of steric and electronic considerations and are often in conflict with each other. Models have been devised by Cram (1952), Cornforth (1959), Felkin (1969) and others.\n\n===Cram's rule===\nThe '''Cram's rule of asymmetric induction''' developed by [[Donald J. Cram]] in 1952<ref>''Studies in Stereochemistry. X. The Rule of \"Steric Control of Asymmetric Induction\" in the Syntheses of Acyclic Systems'' [[Donald J. Cram]], Fathy Ahmed Abd Elhafez [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]; '''1952'''; 74(23); 5828\u20135835. [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1952/74/i23/f-pdf/f_ja01143a007.html Abstract]</ref> is an early concept relating to the prediction of stereochemistry in certain [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]] systems. In full the rule is:\n\n''In certain non-catalytic reactions that diastereomer will predominate, which could be formed by the approach of the entering group from the least hindered side when the rotational conformation of the C-C bond is such that the double bond is flanked by the two least bulky groups attached to the adjacent asymmetric center.''\n\nThe rule indicates that the presence of an asymmetric center in a molecule induces the formation of an asymmetric center adjacent to it based on [[steric hindrance]].\n\nIn his 1952 publication Cram presented a large number of reactions described in the literature for which the conformation of the reaction products could be explained based on this rule and he also described an elaborate experiment (''scheme 1'') making his case.\n\n:[[Image:CramruleOfAsymmetricInduction.png|600px|Scheme 1. Cram's rule of asymmetric induction]]\n\nThe experiments involved two reactions. In experiment one ''2-phenylpropionaldehyde'' ('''1''', [[racemic]] but (R)-enantiomer shown) was reacted with the [[Grignard reagent]] of [[bromobenzene]] to ''1,2-diphenyl-1-propanol'' ('''2''') as a mixture of [[diastereomer]]s, predominantly the [[threo]] [[isomer]] (see for explanation the [[Fischer projection]]).\n\nThe preference for the formation of the threo isomer can be explained by the rule stated above by having the active [[nucleophile]] in this reaction attacking the [[carbonyl group]] from the least hindered side (see [[Newman projection]] '''A''') when the carbonyl is positioned in a [[staggered conformation|staggered]] formation with the [[methyl]] group and the [[hydrogen]] atom, which are the two smallest [[substituent]]s creating a minimum of [[steric hindrance]], in a [[Gauche (stereochemistry)|gauche orientation]] and [[phenyl]] as the most bulky group in the [[anti conformation]].\n\nThe second reaction is the [[organic reduction]] of ''1,2-diphenyl-1-propanone'' '''2''' with [[lithium aluminium hydride]], which results in the same reaction product as above but now with preference for the [[erythro]] isomer ('''2a'''). Now a [[hydride]] anion (H<sup>\u2212</sup>) is the nucleophile attacking from the least hindered side (imagine hydrogen entering from the paper plane).\n\nIn the original 1952 publication, additional evidence was obtained for the structural assignment of the reaction products by applying them to a [[Chugaev elimination]], wherein the threo isomer reacts to the [[cis isomer]] of -\u03b1-methyl-[[stilbene]] and the erythro isomer to the trans version.\n\n:[[Image:CramAsymmetricInductionChugaevReaction.png|600px|Scheme 2. Cram Asymmetric Induction Chugaev Reaction]]\n\n===Felkin model===\nThe '''Felkin model''' (1968) named after [[Hugh Felkin]] also predicts the [[stereochemistry]] of [[nucleophilic addition]] reactions to [[carbonyl]] groups.<ref>''Torsional strain involving partial bonds. The stereochemistry of the lithium aluminium hydride reduction of some simple open-chain ketones'' Marc Ch\u00e9rest, Hugh Felkin and Nicole Prudent [[Tetrahedron Letters]] Volume 9, Issue 18, '''1968''', Pages 2199-2204 {{doi|10.1016/S0040-4039(00)89719-1}}</ref> Felkin argued that the Cram model suffered a major drawback: an [[eclipsed]] conformation in the [[transition state]] between the carbonyl substituent (the hydrogen atom in aldehydes) and the largest \u03b1-carbonyl substituent. He demonstrated that by increasing the steric bulk of the carbonyl substituent from [[methyl]] to [[ethyl group|ethyl]] to [[isopropyl]] to [[isobutyl]], the [[stereoselectivity]] also increased, which is not predicted by Cram's rule:\n\n:[[Image:FelkinModel.png|400px|Scheme 3. Felkin model for chiral induction]]\n\nThe Felkin rules are:\n* The [[transition state]]s are reactant-like.\n* [[Strain (chemistry)#Torsional strain|Torsional strain]] (Pitzer strain) involving partial bonds (in transition states) represents a substantial fraction of the strain between fully formed bonds, even when the degree of bonding is quite low. The conformation in the TS is [[staggered conformation|staggered]] and not eclipsed with the substituent R skew with respect to two adjacent groups one of them the smallest in TS A.\n:[[Image:FelkinTransitionState.png|300px|Scheme 4. Felkin transition state A and Cram transition state B]]\n: For comparison TS B is the Cram transition state.\n* The main steric interactions involve those around R and the nucleophile but not the carbonyl oxygen atom.\n* A [[polar effect]] or electronic effect stabilizes a transition state with maximum separation between the nucleophile and an [[electron-withdrawing group]]. For instance [[haloketone]]s do not obey Cram's rule, and, in the example above, replacing the electron-withdrawing [[phenyl]] group by a [[cyclohexyl]] group reduces stereoselectivity considerably.\n\n===Felkin\u2013Anh model===\nThe '''Felkin\u2013Anh model'''<ref>It bears mentioning that in Vietnamese, the surname is given first, and so this would be better called the Felkin\u2013Nguyen Model.</ref> is an extension of the Felkin model that incorporates improvements suggested by Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u1ecdng Anh and [[Odile Eisenstein]] to correct for two key weaknesses in Felkin's model. The first weakness addressed was the statement by Felkin of a strong polar effect in nucleophilic addition transition states, which leads to the complete inversion of stereochemistry by S<sub>N</sub>2 reactions, without offering justifications as to why this phenomenon was observed. Anh's solution was to offer the antiperiplanar effect as a consequence of asymmetric induction being controlled by both substituent and orbital effects.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, ''O. Nouv. J. Chim.'' '''1977''', ''1'', 61.</ref><ref>Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O.; Lefour, J-M.; Dau, M-E. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1973''', ''95'', 6146.</ref> In this effect, the best nucleophile acceptor \u03c3* orbital is aligned parallel to both the \u03c0 and \u03c0* orbitals of the carbonyl, which provide stabilization of the incoming anion.\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure1.png]]\n\nThe second weakness in the Felkin Model was the assumption of substituent minimization around the carbonyl R, which cannot be applied to aldehydes.\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure2.png]]\n\nIncorporation of [[B\u00fcrgi\u2013Dunitz angle]]<ref>B\u00fcrgi, H. B.; Dunitz, J. D.; Shefter, E. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1973,''' ''95'', 5065.</ref><ref>B\u00fcrgi, H. B.; Dunitz, J. D.; Lehn, J. M.; Wipff, G. ''Tetrahedron'' '''1974''', ''30'', 1563.</ref> ideas allowed Anh to postulate a non-perpendicular attack by the nucleophile on the carbonyl center, anywhere from 95\u00b0 to 105\u00b0 relative to the oxygen-carbon double bond, favoring approach closer to the smaller substituent and thereby solve the problem of predictability for aldehydes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. ''Tetrahedron Lett.'' '''1976''', 155.</ref><ref>Anh, N. T. ''Top. Curr. Chem.'' '''1980''', ''88'', 146.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure3.png]]\n\n=== Anti\u2013Felkin selectivity ===\n\nThough the Cram and Felkin\u2013Anh models differ in the [[Conformational isomerism|conformers]] considered and other assumptions, they both attempt to explain the same basic phenomenon: the preferential addition of a [[nucleophile]] to the most sterically favored face of a [[carbonyl]] moiety.  However, many examples exist of reactions that display stereoselectivity opposite of what is predicted by the basic tenets of the Cram and Felkin\u2013Anh models.  Although both of the models include attempts to explain these reversals, the products obtained are still referred to as \"anti-Felkin\" products.  One of the most common examples of altered asymmetric induction selectivity requires an \u03b1-carbon substituted with a component with [[Lewis base]] character (i.e. O, N, S, P substituents).  In this situation, if a [[Lewis acid]] such as Al-iPr<sub>2</sub> or Zn<sup>2+</sup> is introduced, a [[bidentate]] [[chelation]] effect can be observed.  This locks the [[carbonyl]] and the [[Lewis base]] substituent in an eclipsed conformation, and the [[nucleophile]] will then attack from the side with the smallest free \u03b1-carbon substituent.<ref>Mengel A., Reiser O.''Chem. Rev.'', '''1999''', ''99'' (5), 1191\u20131224.</ref>  If the chelating R group is identified as the largest, this will result in an \"anti-Felkin\" product.\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure4.png]]\n\nThis [[stereoselective]] control was recognized and discussed in the first paper establishing the Cram model, causing Cram to assert that his model requires non-chelating conditions.<ref>Cram DJ, Elhafez FA. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.''; '''1952'''; ''74''(23); 5828\u20135835.</ref>  An example of [[chelation]] control of a reaction can be seen here, from a 1987 paper that was the first to directly observe such a \"Cram-chelate\" intermediate,<ref>Reetz MT, Hullmann M, Seitz T. ''Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.'' '''1987.''' ''26,'' 477\u2013480.</ref> vindicating the model:\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure5.png]]\n\nHere, the methyl titanium chloride forms a Cram-chelate.  The methyl group then dissociates from [[titanium]] and attacks the carbonyl, leading to the anti-Felkin diastereomer.\n\nA non-chelating electron-withdrawing substituent effect can also result in anti-Felkin selectivity.  If a substituent on the \u03b1-carbon is sufficiently electron withdrawing, the [[nucleophile]] will add ''anti-'' relative to the [[electron withdrawing group]], even if the substituent is not the largest of the 3 bonded to the \u03b1-carbon.  Each model offers a slightly different explanation for this phenomenon.  A polar effect was postulated by the Cornforth model<ref>Cornforth JW, Cornforth MRH, Mathew KK. ''J. Chem.Soc.'' '''1959,''' 112\u2013127.</ref> and the original Felkin model,<ref>Cherest M, Felkin H, Prudent N. ''Tetrahedron Lett.'' '''1968,''' ''18,'' 2199\u20132204.</ref> which placed the EWG substituent and incoming [[nucleophile]] ''anti''- to each other in order to most effectively cancel the [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of the [[transition structure]].\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure6.png]]\n\nThis [[Newman projection]] illustrates the Cornforth and Felkin [[transition state]] that places the EWG ''anti-'' to the incoming [[nucleophile]], regardless of its steric bulk relative to R<sub>S</sub> and R<sub>L</sub>.\n\nThe improved Felkin\u2013Anh model, as discussed above, makes a more sophisticated assessment of the polar effect by considering [[molecular orbital]] interactions in the stabilization of the preferred transition state.  A typical reaction illustrating the potential anti-Felkin selectivity of this effect, along with its proposed [[transition structure]], is pictured below:\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure7.png]]\n\n==Carbonyl 1,3 asymmetric induction==\nIt has been observed that the stereoelectronic environment at the \u03b2-carbon of can also direct asymmetric induction.  A number of predictive models have evolved over the years to define the stereoselectivity of such reactions.\n\n===Chelation model===\n\nAccording to Reetz, the Cram-chelate model for 1,2-inductions can be extended to predict the chelated complex of a \u03b2-alkoxy aldehyde and metal.  The nucleophile is seen to attack from the less sterically hindered side and ''anti-'' to the substituent R<sub>\u03b2</sub>, leading to the ''anti-''adduct as the major product.<ref>Reetz, M.T.; Jung, A. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'', '''1983''', ''105'', 4833.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure8.jpg]]\n\nTo make such chelates, the metal center must have at least two free coordination sites and the protecting ligands should form a bidentate complex with the Lewis acid.\n\n===Non-chelation model===\n\n===Cram\u2013Reetz model===\nCram and Reetz demonstrated that 1,3-stereocontrol is possible if the reaction proceeds through an acyclic transition state. The reaction of \u03b2-alkoxy aldehyde with allyltrimethylsilane showed good selectivity for the ''anti-''1,3-diol, which was explained by the Cram polar model. The polar benzyloxy group is oriented anti to the carbonyl to minimize dipole interactions and the nucleophile attacks ''anti-'' to the bulkier (R<sub>M</sub>) of the remaining two substituents.<ref>Leitereg, T.J.; Cram, D.J. ''J. Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1968''', ''90'', 4011.</ref><ref>Reetz. M.T.; Kesseler, K.; Jung, A. ''Tetrahedron Lett''. '''1984''', ''25'', 729.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure9.jpg]]\n\n===Evans model===\n\nMore recently, Evans presented a different model for nonchelate 1,3-inductions. In the proposed transition state, the \u03b2-stereocenter is oriented ''anti-'' to the incoming nucleophile, as seen in the Felkin\u2013Anh model. The polar X group at the \u03b2-stereocenter is placed ''anti-'' to the carbonyl to reduce dipole interactions, and R\u03b2 is placed ''anti-'' to the aldehyde group to minimize the steric hindrance. Consequently, the 1,3-''anti''-diol would be predicted as the major product.<ref>Evans, D.A.; Duffy, J.L.; Dart, M.J. ''Tetrahedron Lett.''  '''1994''', ''35'', 8537.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Felkinanhfigure10.jpg]]\n\n==Carbonyl 1,2 and 1,3 asymmetric induction==\nIf the substrate has both an \u03b1- and \u03b2-stereocenter, the Felkin\u2013Anh rule (1,2-induction) and the Evans model (1,3-induction) should considered at the same time. If these two stereocenters have an ''anti-'' relationship, both models predict the same diastereomer (the stereoreinforcing case).\n\n[[Image:felkinanhfigure11.jpg]]\n\nHowever, in the case of the syn-substrate, the Felkin\u2013Anh and the Evans model predict different products (non-stereoreinforcing case).  It has been found that the size of the incoming nucleophile determines the type of control exerted over the stereochemistry.  In the case of a large nucleophile, the interaction of the \u03b1-stereocenter with the incoming nucleophile becomes dominant; therefore, the Felkin product is major one.  Smaller nucleophiles, on the other hand, result in 1,3 control determining the asymmetry.<ref>Evans, D.A.; Dart, M.J.; Duffy, J.L.; Yang, M.G. ''J .Am. Chem. Soc.'' '''1996''', ''118'', 4322.</ref>\n\n[[Image:felkinanhfigure12.jpg]]\n\n==Acyclic alkenes asymmetric induction==\n\nChiral acyclic alkenes also show [[diastereoselectivity]] upon reactions such as [[epoxidation]] and enolate alkylation. The substituents around the alkene can favour the approach of the [[electrophile]] from one or the other face of the molecule. This is the basis of the '''Houk's model''', based on theoretical work by [[Kendall Houk]], which predicts that the selectivity is stronger for [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|''cis'' than for ''trans'' double bonds]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Organic Chemistry|last1= Clayden|last2= Greeves|last3= Warren|last4= Wothers|year= 2001|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|isbn= 978-0-19-850346-0|page= [https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00clay_0/page/895 895]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00clay_0/page/895}}</ref>\n\n:[[File:Houk's model.tif|400px|Diastereoselective epoxidation of a cis alkene]]\n\nIn the example shown, the ''cis'' alkene assumes the shown conformation to minimize [[steric effect|steric clash]] between R<sub>S</sub> and the methyl group. The approach of the electrophile preferentially occurs from the same side of the medium group (R<sub>M</sub>) rather than the large group (R<sub>L</sub>), mainly producing the shown diastereoisomer. Since for a ''trans'' alkene the steric hindrance between R<sub>S</sub> and the H group is not as large as for the ''cis'' case, the selectivity is much lower.\n\n[[File:Felkin-Ahn model for nucleophilic addition to chiral aldehydes.png|thumb|Felkin\u2013Ahn model for nucleophilic addition to chiral aldehydes]]\n\n[[File:Substrate control. addition of achiral allylmetals to \u03b1-chiral aldehydes..png|thumb|Substrate control. addition of achiral allylmetals to \u03b1-chiral aldehydes.]]\n\n[[File:An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to \u03b1-chiral aldehyde..png|thumb|An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to \u03b1-chiral aldehyde.]]\n\n==Substrate control: asymmetric induction by molecular framework in acyclic systems==\n\nAsymmetric induction by the molecular framework of an acyclic substrate is the idea that asymmetric [[steric]] and [[Solid-state physics#Electronic properties|electronic]] properties of a molecule may determine the chirality of subsequent chemical reactions on that molecule. This principal is used to design [[chemical syntheses]] where one [[stereocentre]] is in place and additional stereocentres are required.\n\nWhen considering how two [[functional groups]] or species react, the precise 3D configurations of the chemical entities involved will determine how they may approach one another. Any restrictions as to how these species may approach each other will determine the configuration of the product of the reaction. In the case of asymmetric induction, we are considering the effects of one asymmetric centre on a molecule on the reactivity of other functional groups on that molecule. The closer together these two sites are, the larger an influence is expected to be observed. A more holistic approach to evaluating these factors is by [[computational modelling]],<ref>Houk, K. N. et al., Science, 1986, 231, 1108-1117.</ref> however, simple qualitative factors may also be used to explain the predominant trends seen for some synthetic steps. The ease and accuracy of this qualitative approach means it is more commonly applied in synthesis and substrate design. Examples of appropriate molecular frameworks are alpha chiral aldehydes and the use of chiral auxiliaries.\n\n===Asymmetric induction at alpha-chiral aldehydes===\n\nPossible reactivity at aldehydes include [[nucleophilic attack]] and addition of allylmetals. The stereoselectivity of nucleophilic attack at alpha-chiral aldehydes may be described by the Felkin\u2013Anh or polar Felkin Anh models and addition of achiral allylmetals may be described by Cram\u2019s rule.\n\n===Felkin\u2013Anh and polar Felkin\u2013Anh model===\n\nSelectivity in nucleophilic additions to chiral aldehydes is often explained by the Felkin\u2013Anh model<ref>a) Anh, N. T. Top. Curr. Chem. 1980, 88, 145\u2013162; (b) Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. Nouv. J. Chim. 1977, 1, 61\u201370; (c) Anh, N. T.; Eisenstein, O. Tetrahedron Lett. 1976, 26, 155\u2013158.</ref> (see figure). The nucleophile approaches the carbon of the carbonyl group at the [[Burgi-Dunitz angle]].<ref>Burgi, H. B.; Dunitz, J. D.; Lehn, J. M.; Wipff, G. Tetrahedron. 1974. 12, 1563\u20131572.</ref> At this trajectory, attack from the bottom face is disfavored due to steric bulk of the adjacent, large, functional group.\n\nThe polar Felkin\u2013Anh model is applied in the scenario where X is an electronegative group. The polar Felkin\u2013Anh model postulates that the observed stereochemistry arises due to hyperconjugative stabilization arising from the anti-periplanar interaction between the C-X antibonding \u03c3* orbital and the forming bond.\n\nImproving Felkin\u2013Anh selectivity for organometal additions to aldehydes can be achieved by using organo-aluminum nucleophiles instead of the corresponding [[Grignard reaction|Grignard]] or organolithium nucleophiles. Claude Spino and co-workers<ref>Spino, C.; Granger, M. C.; Boisvert, L.; Beaulieu, C. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 4183\u20134185.</ref> have demonstrated significant stereoselectivity improvements upon switching from vinylgrignard to vinylalane reagents with a number of chiral aldehydes.\n\n===Cram\u2019s rule===\n\nAddition of achiral allylmetals to [[aldehydes]] forms a chiral alcohol, the stereochemical outcome of this reaction is determined by the chirality of the [[\u03b1-carbon]] on the aldehyde substrate (Figure \"Substrate control: addition of achiral allylmetals to \u03b1-chiral aldehydes\"). The allylmetal reagents used include [[boron]], [[tin]] and [[titanium]].\n\nCram\u2019s rule explains the stereoselectivity by considering the transition state depicted in figure 3. In the transition state the oxygen lone pair is able to interact with the boron centre whilst the allyl group is able to add to the carbon end of the carbonyl group. The steric demand of this transition state is minimized by the \u03b1-carbon configuration holding the largest group away from (trans to) the congested carbonyl group and the allylmetal group approaching past the smallest group on the \u03b1-carbon centre. In the example below (Figure \"An example of substrate controlled addition of achiral allyl-boron to \u03b1-chiral aldehyde\"), (R)-2-methylbutanal (1) reacts with the allylboron reagent (2) with two possible diastereomers of which the (R, R)-isomer is the major product. The Cram model of this reaction is shown with the carbonyl group placed trans to the [[ethyl group|ethyl]] group (the large group) and the allyl boron approaching past the hydrogen (the small group). The structure is shown in [[Newman projection]]. In this case the [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction happens at the face where the hydrogen (the small group) is, producing the (R, R)-isomer as the major product.\n\n===Chiral auxiliaries===\n\nAsymmetric stereoinduction can be achieved with the use of chiral auxiliaries. Chiral auxiliaries may be reversibly attached to the substrate, inducing a diastereoselective reaction prior to cleavage, overall producing an enantioselective process. Examples of chiral auxiliaries include, Evans\u2019 chiral oxazolidinone auxiliaries (for asymmetric aldol reactions)<ref>Evans, D. A.; Bartroli, J.; Shih, T. L., Am. Chem. Soc., 1981, 103, 2127-2129.</ref> pseudoephedrine amides and [[tert-butanesulfinamide]] imines.\n\n== Substrate control: asymmetric induction by molecular framework in cyclic systems ==\n\n[[Cyclic molecule]]s often exist in much more rigid conformations than their linear counterparts. Even very large [[macrocycle]]s like [[erythromycin]] exist in defined geometries despite having many degrees of freedom. Because of these properties, it is often easier to achieve asymmetric induction with macrocyclic substrates rather than linear ones. Early experiments performed by [[W. Clark Still]]<ref>Still, W. C.; Galynker, I. Tetrahedron 1981, 37, 3981-3996.</ref> and colleagues showed that medium- and large-ring organic molecules can provide striking levels of stereo induction as substrates in reactions such as kinetic [[enolate]] [[alkylation]], [[dimethylcuprate]] addition, and catalytic [[hydrogenation]]. Even a single methyl group is often sufficient to bias the diastereomeric outcome of the reaction. These studies, among others, helped challenge the widely-held scientific belief that large rings are too floppy to provide any kind of stereochemical control. \n\nA number of total syntheses have made use of [[macrocyclic stereocontrol]] to achieve desired reaction products.

Substrate-controlled synthetic schemes have many advantages, since they do not require the use of complex asymmetric reagents to achieve selective transformations.\n\n==Reagent control: addition of chiral allylmetals to achiral aldehydes==\n\nIn [[organic synthesis]], reagent control is an approach to selectively forming one [[stereoisomer]] out of many, the [[stereoselectivity]] is determined by the structure and [[chirality]] of the reagent used. When chiral allylmetals are used for [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction to achiral [[aldehydes]], the [[chirality]] of the newly generated alcohol carbon is determined by the chirality of the allymetal reagents (Figure 1). The chirality of the allymetals usually comes from the asymmetric ligands used. The metals in the allylmetal reagents include [[boron]], [[tin]], [[titanium]], [[silicon]], etc.\n\n[[File:17 fig. 1.png|thumb|Fig. 1: Reagent control: addition of chiral allylmetals to achiral aldehydes]]\n\nVarious chiral ligands have been developed to prepare chiral allylmetals for the reaction with aldehydes. [[H. C. Brown]] was the first to report the chiral allylboron reagents for asymmetric allylation reactions with aldehydes.<ref>Brown, H. C.; Jadhav, P. K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 2092.</ref> The chiral allylboron reagents were synthesized from the natural product (+)-a-pinene in two steps. The TADDOL ligands developed by [[Dieter Seebach]] has been used to prepare chiral allyltitanium compounds for asymmetric allylation with aldehydes.<ref>Duthaler, R. O.; Hafner, A. Chem. Rev. 1992, 92, 807.</ref> Jim Leighton has developed chiral allysilicon compounds in which the release of ring strain facilitated the stereoselective allylation reaction, 95% to 98% enatiomeric excess could be achieved for a range of achiral aldehydes.<ref>Kinnaird, J.

B. Hunt and Patton McNaughton, the band increased in size to 128 members by 1947.\n\n===Clarence Sawhill and Kelly James 1952-1982===\nIn 1952, Clarence Sawhill became director of bands. F. (Freeman) Kelly James became the director of the marching band, a position he would hold until suffering a stroke at the UCLA-[[University of California, Berkeley|Cal]] football game in 1980.<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00076&toc.id=div00176&brand=calisphere 1985 In Memoriam: Freeman Kelly James, Jr., Music: Los Angeles] University of California (System) Academic Senate, 1985</ref> Sawhill and James grew the UCLA band program to include a 100-piece Concert Band, an 80-piece Symphonic Wind Ensemble, a 144-piece Marching Band, and a 60-piece Varsity Band.\n\nIn the 1950s the UCLA Marching Band uniforms were gold/yellow jackets with navy blue pants, blue shakos and white shoes. The band marched in a military style. The band appeared in color on the cover of the November 26, 1956 issue of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1956/1126.html|title=(picture) Sports Illustrated cover November 26, 1956|access-date=April 1, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512195421/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1956/1126.html|archive-date=May 12, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is one of the few so honored beginning with the [[The Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band|University of Oklahoma marching band]] (1954), the [[Princeton University Band]] (1955), and later, [[The Ohio State University Marching Band]] (1958). This marks the first appearance by any UCLA organization on the cover of the magazine.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the band emulated the [[Queen's Guard]]. The band had a similar marching style, including the distinctive arm swinging, but also having the high \"chair\" step. The uniform pants were school colors blue and black trim, and imitation [[bearskin]] (or tall [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]]) hats. In the early 1960s, the uniform coats were gold. later the uniform coats were dark blue. The shoes were black with white spats.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\" />\n\nIn 1961, the band made a European Tour which included performances in Denmark, France, Austria, Germany, England and Switzerland.\n\nIn 1972, women were admitted to the UCLA Band, as well as other college marching bands around the country as a response to the [[Title IX]] educational amendment. Many marching bands, including the UCLA Band, had women members or a women's auxiliary unit during [[World War II]], but the bands gradually became all-male organizations after the war.\n\nIn 1973, the band wore gold jackets, navy blue pants, navy blue turtleneck sweaters, and no hat, for one game. They were never used after that.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\" />\n\nIn 1977, the school purchased new uniforms that were royal blue with yellow trim. The large overcoats had a white front with block vertical UCLA letters. There were tall white plush busby hats with blue and yellow plumes.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\" />\n\n===Thomas Lee and Gordon Henderson===\n\nIn 1985, the band ordered newly designed uniforms, in the current military style. These uniforms were designed with band member input to replace the brightly colored 1977 uniforms. The uniforms consisted of navy blue wool trousers and coat with gold trim and white, knee-length, gold capes on the left shoulder. The shoes were changed to white. White gloves were standard as well. The large bearskin hats were replaced by Shako hats with white 12\" feather plumes. An all-powder blue uniform was prototyped, but rejected in favor of the navy blue. The color guard did wear powder blue uniform coats and skirts similar in style to the new uniforms for two years.\n\nIn 2007 the band was outfitted with new uniforms at the USC game. The coats were the then official \"[[True Blue (color)|True Blue]]\" color adopted by UCLA in 2004. Other elements from the 1985 uniforms were retained.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\" />\n\nIn 1985, Thomas Lee came from the University of Texas to be the Director of Bands and Director of the Wind Ensemble.\n\nThe UCLA Bruin Marching Band was the 1993 recipient of the [[Sudler Trophy]], presented by the [[John Philip Sousa Foundation]] in recognition of the Band's tradition of excellence and innovation.<ref name=\"sudler\">{{cite web | title = The Sudler Trophy | publisher = John Philip Sousa Foundation | year = 2002 | url = http://www.sousafoundation.org/allProjects/trophy.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031221110619/http://sousafoundation.org/allProjects/trophy.htm | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2003-12-21 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe band became part of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music in 2007 when the departments of Music, Ethnomusicology and Musicology were combined.

It was adapted from their showtune \"[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up the Band]]\", and was presented to UCLA at an All-University Sing held in Royce Hall during Fall 1936.<ref>[http://www.uclahistoryproject.ucla.edu/Songs/StrikeuptheBand.html UCLA History Project - Songs: Strike Up The Band for UCLA]</ref> The ''[[Star Spangled Banner]]'' is played by the band in concert formation.

Field formations include fast moving precision drill progressions, letter blocks, pictures, concert arcs, and the famous Cursive UCLA formation. The band performs many different styles of shows, depending upon the occasion.\n\nThe exception to the drum corps marching style is the traditional pregame \"run-on\" where the band rapidly high-steps onto the field into the block letter U-C-L-A formation.\n\n==History==\nIn 1925, at the Vermont Avenue campus, the UCLA Marching Band originated as a 50-piece ROTC unit under the direction of W. G. Powell. The band was part of the welcoming group when [[John Philip Sousa]] visited Los Angeles in 1928, and were directed by Sousa in the performance of \"[[Stars and Stripes Forever]]\".<ref>[http://www.today.ucla.edu/out-about/this-month_061107/ This Month (November) 78 years ago] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214092358/http://www.today.ucla.edu/out-about/this-month_061107/ |date=2008-02-14 }} UCLA Today Magazine, November 7, 2006</ref> At that time, the director was Ben Laietsky, a member of Sousa's band. The band remained a military group until 1934. In 1935, under the direction of Leroy Allen, the group became an integral part of campus life, providing music at rallies and games. The original uniforms were military style, with military caps and waist-length capes.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\">{{cite news\n| title      = Clothes Make the Band\n| first      = Mark\n| last       = Davis\n| url        = http://magazine.ucla.edu/features/bruin-marching-band/ \n| magazine   = UCLA Magazine\n| date       = 1 January 2008\n| accessdate = 22 August 2010\n| quote      = Following years of uncertain color chaos and confusion, years in which Bruinwear of all sorts and stripes exploded in a cyan anarchy of powdered to royal to pilfered blues (not to mention the infamously brief experiment of black basketball uniforms), the campus finally settled on one true Bruin blue in 2004\n}}</ref>\n\nUnder directors C. B. Hunt and Patton McNaughton, the band increased in size to 128 members by 1947.\n\n===Clarence Sawhill and Kelly James 1952-1982===\nIn 1952, Clarence Sawhill became director of bands. F. (Freeman) Kelly James became the director of the marching band, a position he would hold until suffering a stroke at the UCLA-[[University of California, Berkeley|Cal]] football game in 1980.<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00076&toc.id=div00176&brand=calisphere 1985 In Memoriam: Freeman Kelly James, Jr., Music: Los Angeles] University of California (System) Academic Senate, 1985</ref> Sawhill and James grew the UCLA band program to include a 100-piece Concert Band, an 80-piece Symphonic Wind Ensemble, a 144-piece Marching Band, and a 60-piece Varsity Band.\n\nIn the 1950s the UCLA Marching Band uniforms were gold/yellow jackets with navy blue pants, blue shakos and white shoes. The band marched in a military style. The band appeared in color on the cover of the November 26, 1956 issue of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1956/1126.html|title=(picture) Sports Illustrated cover November 26, 1956|access-date=April 1, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512195421/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1956/1126.html|archive-date=May 12, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is one of the few so honored beginning with the [[The Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band|University of Oklahoma marching band]] (1954), the [[Princeton University Band]] (1955), and later, [[The Ohio State University Marching Band]] (1958). This marks the first appearance by any UCLA organization on the cover of the magazine.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the band emulated the [[Queen's Guard]]. The band had a similar marching style, including the distinctive arm swinging, but also having the high \"chair\" step. The uniform pants were school colors blue and black trim, and imitation [[bearskin]] (or tall [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]]) hats. In the early 1960s, the uniform coats were gold. later the uniform coats were dark blue. The shoes were black with white spats.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\" />\n\nIn 1961, the band made a European Tour which included performances in Denmark, France, Austria, Germany, England and Switzerland.\n\nIn 1972, women were admitted to the UCLA Band, as well as other college marching bands around the country as a response to the [[Title IX]] educational amendment. Many marching bands, including the UCLA Band, had women members or a women's auxiliary unit during [[World War II]], but the bands gradually became all-male organizations after the war.\n\nIn 1973, the band wore gold jackets, navy blue pants, navy blue turtleneck sweaters, and no hat, for one game. They were never used after that.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\" />\n\nIn 1977, the school purchased new uniforms that were royal blue with yellow trim. The large overcoats had a white front with block vertical UCLA letters. There were tall white plush busby hats with blue and yellow plumes.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\" />\n\n===Thomas Lee and Gordon Henderson===\n\nIn 1985, the band ordered newly designed uniforms, in the current military style. These uniforms were designed with band member input to replace the brightly colored 1977 uniforms. The uniforms consisted of navy blue wool trousers and coat with gold trim and white, knee-length, gold capes on the left shoulder. The shoes were changed to white. White gloves were standard as well. The large bearskin hats were replaced by Shako hats with white 12\" feather plumes. An all-powder blue uniform was prototyped, but rejected in favor of the navy blue. The color guard did wear powder blue uniform coats and skirts similar in style to the new uniforms for two years.\n\nIn 2007 the band was outfitted with new uniforms at the USC game. The coats were the then official \"[[True Blue (color)|True Blue]]\" color adopted by UCLA in 2004. Other elements from the 1985 uniforms were retained.<ref name=\"CLOTHESMAKE\" />\n\nIn 1985, Thomas Lee came from the University of Texas to be the Director of Bands and Director of the Wind Ensemble.\n\nThe UCLA Bruin Marching Band was the 1993 recipient of the [[Sudler Trophy]], presented by the [[John Philip Sousa Foundation]] in recognition of the Band's tradition of excellence and innovation.<ref name=\"sudler\">{{cite web | title = The Sudler Trophy | publisher = John Philip Sousa Foundation | year = 2002 | url = http://www.sousafoundation.org/allProjects/trophy.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20031221110619/http://sousafoundation.org/allProjects/trophy.htm | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2003-12-21 | accessdate = 2007-08-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe band became part of the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music in 2007 when the departments of Music, Ethnomusicology and Musicology were combined. Musician and recording executive [[Herb Alpert]] gave $30 million to UCLA in November 2007, the single largest individual gift to music higher education in the western United States.\n\nLee retired from UCLA in 2012, and Dr. Travis Cross was appointed the new Wind Ensemble conductor in 2013.\n\n==Traditions==\nFor the football pregame show, the UCLA Marching Band traditionally opens with the ''Bruin Fanfare'' and ''Strike Up The Band for UCLA,'' a gift from [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] to UCLA. It was adapted from their showtune \"[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up the Band]]\", and was presented to UCLA at an All-University Sing held in Royce Hall during Fall 1936.<ref>[http://www.uclahistoryproject.ucla.edu/Songs/StrikeuptheBand.html UCLA History Project - Songs: Strike Up The Band for UCLA]</ref> The ''[[Star Spangled Banner]]'' is played by the band in concert formation.

The band marches off the field to ''[[The Mighty Bruins]]'', composed in 1984 by Academy Award-winning composer [[Bill Conti]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the UCLA Alumni Association.\n\nFollowing all athletic contests, the band plays the UCLA Alma Mater \"[[Hail to the Hills of Westwood]]\". After victories, this is followed by \"[[Rover (song)|Rover]]\".\n\n==Away game appearances==\nThe entire UCLA Bruin Marching Band travels to the San Francisco Bay area each fall for either the Stanford or Cal game. This tradition began in 1931, when the band traveled to the Stanford game by ship from Los Angeles.

(Nexstar also holds a 31% interest in TV Food Network, LLC, the [[Discovery, Inc.]]-controlled parent of [[Food Network]] and [[Cooking Channel]].) WGN America runs a mixture of recent and older comedy and drama series (including some first-run programs licensed for broadcast on the channel), and theatrical [[feature film]]s.\n\nWGN America was originally established on November 9, 1978, when [[Gemstar\u2013TV Guide International|United Video Inc.]] began redistributing the signal of [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9) in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]\u2014which, alongside WGN America, Chicago-based local [[United States cable news|cable news]] channel [[Chicagoland Television]] (CLTV) and [[talk radio|news/talk]]/[[sports radio]] station [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (720 AM), was among the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] broadcasting properties of [[Tribune Media]] (formerly known as the Tribune Company prior to the August 2014 spin-off of its [[Tribune Publishing|publishing division]]) until the closure of Nexstar's acquisition of Tribune in September 2019\u2014to cable and [[direct-broadcast satellite television|satellite]] subscribers throughout the United States. This expanded the prominent [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] into America's second [[communications satellite|satellite-distributed]] national \"[[superstation]],\" after the concept's progenitor, [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]-based WTBS (now separately operating as [[WPCH-TV]] in the Atlanta [[media market|market]] and as conventional subscription channel [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] nationwide).\n\nAs the national feed of WGN-TV, the channel broadcast a variety of programming seen on the Chicago signal, including sports (mainly [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] baseball, and [[Chicago Bulls]] basketball games); locally originated news, children's, religious and [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs; movies; and syndicated series. The WGN local and national feeds originally maintained nearly identical program schedules, aside from some sporting events that were restricted to the Chicago-area signal under league policy restrictions. In the years following the January 1990 re-imposition of federal [[syndication exclusivity]] regulations, programming between the two feeds increasingly deviated as the WGN national feed incorporated alternative syndicated programming to replace shows on the WGN-TV schedule that were subjected to market exclusivity claims by individual television stations and some local programs that the national feed chose not to clear (particularly from the late 2000s onward, as the WGN Chicago signal began expanding its local news programming and added lifestyle programs to its schedule). On December 14, 2014, WGN America was converted by Tribune into a conventional basic cable network, at which time it started to be offered on cable providers within the Chicago market alongside its existing local carriage on satellite providers [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]]. The former parent station, WGN-TV, maintains a separate schedule of local and syndicated programs exclusively catering to the Chicago market.\n\n{{As of|September 2018}}, WGN America was received by approximately 80 million households that subscribe to a pay television service throughout the United States (or 62.7% of households with at least one television set).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen coverage estimates for September see gains at ESPN networks, NBCSN, and NBA TV, drops at MLBN and NFLN (Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: September 2018)|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|author=Andrew Bucholtz|website=Awful Announcing|publisher=[[NESN|NESN Digital]]|date=September 10, 2018|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nWGN America traces its origins to '''[[WGN-TV]]''', a [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] that began operating over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 9 on April 5, 1948 as the second commercial television station to sign on in both the Chicago [[media market|market]] and the state of Illinois \u2013 after WBKB-TV (channel 4, now [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WBBM-TV]] on channel 2), which began experimental operations as W9XBK in 1940 and converted into a commercially licensed [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] on September 6, 1946 \u2013 and the 19th commercial station to sign on in the United States. The station \u2013 which, until January 1948, had originally planned to use the [[call sign]] '''WGNA''' \u2013 was founded by WGN, Incorporated, the broadcasting subsidiary of the [[Tribune Publishing|Chicago Tribune Company]] (owned by [[Robert R. McCormick]], then the editor and publisher of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''), which had also owned local radio stations [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (720 AM) and WGNB (98.7 FM; frequency now occupied by [[WFMT]]). WGN America and its Chicago-based broadcast television and radio siblings borrow the [[List of three-letter broadcast callsigns in the United States|three-letter]] \"WGN\" initialism from the \"<u>W</u>orld's <u>G</u>reatest <u>N</u>ewspaper\" slogan used by the ''Tribune'' from August 29, 1911 until December 31, 1976. (The calls were initially obtained by the ''Tribune'' in 1924 for use on the former WDAP radio station, which it had then recently acquired from Zenith-Edgewater Beach Broadcasting, by permission of the owners of the then-under-construction [[SS Carl D.

The station was also known locally for its lineup of children's programs including ''[[The Bozo Show|Bozo's Circus]]'' (which became the most well-known iteration of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' franchise through its local and, later, national popularity, featuring a mix of comedy sketches, circus acts, cartoon shorts and in-studio audience participation games), ''[[Ray Rayner]] and His Friends'' (a variety show which featured animated shorts, arts and crafts segments, animal and science segments and a viewer mail segment) and ''[[Garfield Goose and Friends]]'' (a series hosted by [[Frazier Thomas]] as the \"[[prime minister]]\" to the titular clacking goose who designated himself as \"King of the United States,\" which is considered to be the longest running puppet show on local television) as well as a robust lineup of feature films (showing as many as four movies \u2013 one in the morning, and two to three films per night \u2013 each weekday, and between three and six movies per day on weekends).\n\nChannel 9 was Chicago's leading independent station for much of the period between the early 1960s and the early 1990s; although it was briefly overtaken in this distinction from 1979 to 1981 by rival independent [[WFLD]] (channel 32, now a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] owned-and-operated station), which forced WGN-TV parent subsidiary [[Tribune Broadcasting]] (previously known as the WGN Continental Broadcasting Company from 1956 until 1981) to initiate efforts to beef up the station's inventory of off-network syndicated programs and add product from the Tribune Company's upstart national syndication unit, [[Tribune Entertainment]]. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the WGN-TV signal began to be retransmitted via [[microwave relay]] to [[cable television]] systems in much of the central [[Midwestern United States]], enabling the station to reach far beyond the Chicago television market and reach areas that lacked access to an entertainment-based independent station.

United Video initially charged prospective cable systems 10\u00a2 per subscriber to receive the WGN-TV signal, the same rate Southern Satellite Systems charged for 24-hour-a-day retransmission of WTBS. WGN Continental Broadcasting and station management originally treated WGN-TV as a \"passive\" superstation, asserting a neutral position over United Video's national retransmission of its signal and holding no oversight over national promotion of the WGN signal. (This was in contrast to WTBS, which handled nationalized promotional responsibilities rather than leaving those duties to its satellite carrier, as WGN had done.) This allowed WGN Continental/Tribune Broadcasting to continue paying for syndicated programming and advertising at local rates rather than those comparable to other national networks. Tribune was also not directly compensated by United Video for their retransmission or promotion of WGN's signal; though under [[compulsory license]] provisions applying to out-of-market stations through the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] (further defined through the formation of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal in 1982), WGN-TV did receive [[royalty payment]]s made by cable and satellite systems retransmitting the national WGN feed to the [[United States Copyright Office]] for retransmission of any copyrighted programming over which it held ownership (including news, public affairs, children's and sports programs).<ref>{{cite web|title=The state of the superstations|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/79-OCR/BC-1979-07-23-OCR-Page-0029.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications Inc.|page=29|date=July 23, 1979|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Birth of a Nation's Superstation: WGN executives were aghast when the channel was first put up on satellite, but the 'curse' turned into quite the blessing|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115224993.html|author=Kathy Haley|periodical=[[Multichannel News]]|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|date=April 5, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105132013/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115224993.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=November 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"usco-royalty\">{{cite web|title=Rate Adjustment for Satellite Carrier Compulsory License|url=http://www.copyright.gov/history/mls/ML-574.pdf|website=[[U.S. Copyright Office]]|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSince United Video did not seek the Tribune Company's permission to relay the WGN-TV signal, for many years, WGN and United Video's relationship was described as being \"not particularly friendly,\" going as far as Tribune even attempting legal challenges to stop retransmission of its signal, even though a Copyright Act exemption clause regarding \"passive\" carriers in the compulsory license statute of Section 111 effectively defined that satellite carriers were not required to seek direct the express permission of a television station or its licensee (such as WGN-TV/WGN Continental Broadcasting) to redistribute out-of-market broadcast signals.

However, despite being notified that WGN would be conducting tests of the programming information [[teletext]], United Video chose to substitute the material with teletext content from its [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]] business news service; its repurposing of the VBI became the subject of a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit filed by Tribune Broadcasting against United Video in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] that April, alleging that it retransmitted the station's prime time newscast, ''The Nine O'Clock News'' (now titled ''WGN News at Nine''), as well as other WGN-TV programs in a \"mutilated and altered\" fashion to use profitable teletext content from the Dow Jones service in a manner which resulted in United Video exercising direct control over the content in violation of Section 111(a) (3) of the 1976 Copyright Act and in interference with an agreement between WGN-TV and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] cable provider Albuquerque Cable Television Inc. to supply the EPG teletext to subscribers. United Video contended that the Copyright Act's passive carrier rules applied to how it utilized the VBI, maintaining also that transmitting extraneous material to cable systems did not constitute a public performance and the teletext material was a separate transmission from the copyrighted program since it required a standalone decoder to view it over television receivers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interpreting the copyright act|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/81-OCR/1981-05-04-BC-OCR-Page-0056.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|page=57|date=May 4, 1981|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}<br>{{cite web|title=Interpreting the copyright act|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/81-OCR/1981-05-04-BC-OCR-Page-0057.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|page=57|date=May 4, 1981|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sticky issue in WGN-United Video case|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/81-OCR/1981-09-07-BC-OCR-Page-0089.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|page=89|date=September 7, 1981|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 8, 1981, District Court Judge Susan Getzendanner denied injunctive relief to WGN Continental Broadcasting and dismissed the case against United Video, citing that it was not required to carry the station's teletext transmission.

Separate national advertising or [[Per inquiry advertising|per inquiry ads]] also began to be inserted over the satellite feed in place of local advertisements intended for broadcast in the Chicago market (which, with a few exceptions, became exclusively carried by channel 9 locally). This also allowed the station to increase the amount of advertising revenue it accrued by charging separate rates for the Chicago-area signal and a higher fee for advertisers purchasing airtime on the national signal, and offering advertisers exclusive commercial avails for either the Chicago-based audience or the national cable audience, or uniform avails for both the national and local audiences. Despite the feed restructuring, the vast majority of the shows viewable over WGN-TV in the Chicago area continued to air nationally over the satellite signal.

(This feed was originally structured similarly to the concurrently launched [[WWOR EMI Service]] feed of WWOR-TV, albeit with a larger amount of shared programming.) Of the four United Video-distributed superstations, WGN was the only one to have its national coverage expand post-Syndex, adding 2.2 million households with cable or satellite service to its total reach by July 1990; some systems also began to swap out New York City-area rivals WPIX and WWOR in favor of offering the WGN superstation feed in the years immediately following that feed's launch as it offered fewer blackout-subjected programs than other affected superstations. The national feed's distribution gradually expanded further to [[direct broadcast satellite]] through agreements with [[DirecTV]], Dish Network and [[Primestar]] over the course of the 1990s.

(In the case of the Chicago signal, this marked the first time that WGN-TV was affiliated with a major broadcast network since DuMont ceased operations in August 1956.) The WGN cable agreement resulted in The WB becoming the second American broadcast television network to distribute its programming directly to a cable-originated service to provide extended coverage in designated \"white areas\" without broadcast affiliate clearances and one of three network-to-cable undertakings stewarded by Jamie Kellner. As The WB was under development, Kellner was in process of developing The WeB, a proposed national WB cable feed for smaller markets based upon a service that he launched as President of the Fox Broadcasting Company, [[Foxnet]], which operated from June 1991 until September 2006. The use of WGN as a national relay feed gave The WB an early advantage over the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) \u2013 another fledgling network that made its national debut on January 16, 1995, as a [[joint venture]] between [[BHC Communications|Chris-Craft/United Television]] and [[Paramount Television]] \u2013 which declined to allow the WWOR EMI Service to act as its national conduit in spite of similar initial gaps in UPN's broadcast affiliate coverage. The WGN superstation feed accounted for roughly 18% of the national coverage that The WB had at launch, with the rest of the network's initial 62% total reach coming from the 60 broadcast affiliates (including WGN-TV) that were willing to adhere to its [[reverse compensation]] plan for prospective affiliates. In some areas where cable systems did not carry the superstation feed ''and'' maintenance of a local WB affiliate was not yet possible, satellite distribution was the only method in which viewers could see the network's programming over WGN. (The WGN national feed served as the default WB affiliate for residents in 152 markets and the entirety of 21 U.S. states\u2014[[Alaska]], [[Arkansas]], [[Delaware]], [[Idaho]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Maine]], [[Mississippi]], [[Montana]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]], [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[West Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Wyoming]]\u2014at varying periods of time up through the launch of The WeB.)

Comparatively, approximately 50% of the programs seen on WGN consisted of those originating on the Chicago feed that were cleared for \"full-signal\" carriage by the national feed; this proportion of common programming dropped to around 30% by 2005 through the prior removal of WB programming and the overall schedule beginning to rely more on programs acquired specifically for national carriage as syndicators increasingly insisted on exclusivity protection for their series and film packages and were unwilling to license the rights to higher-profile syndicated programs to the superstation feed, believing that it would be more lucrative to license those programs to individual stations.\n\nOn July 12, 2000, Gemstar International Group Limited acquired TV Guide, Inc. (which United Video Satellite Group renamed itself following its 1999 purchase of ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine from [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]), subsequently changing its name to [[Gemstar\u2013TV Guide International]]. In April 2001, Tribune Broadcasting purchased a majority interest in UVTV \u2013 one of three satellite carrier units, along with Superstar/Netlink Group and Netlink USA, that were operated by the company \u2013 from TV Guide, Inc. unit of Gemstar\u2013TV Guide (which was refocusing its assets around ''TV Guide'' magazine, the [[TV Guide#TV Guide Interactive|TV Guide Interactive]] [[electronic program guide|interactive program guide]] platform and the TV Guide Channel) for $106 million in cash, shifting responsibility for retransmission, distribution and promotion of the WGN superstation feed to Tribune and effectively transitioning WGN from a \"passive\" to an \"active\" superstation, as TBS had been since it was first uplinked in December 1976. (The transaction would be the subject of a 2004 [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] securities fraud investigation against co-president Peter Boylan that determined that Gemstar failed to inform investors that Tribune committed to a six-year, $100 million advertising contract with Gemstar in exchange for selling its stake in WGN to Tribune.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Boylan-SEC Deal Cost $600K|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/boylan-sec-deal-cost-600k-151207|author=Steve Donohue|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=August 15, 2004|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn September 10, 2001, the channel's name was changed to '''WGN Superstation''', in an effort by Tribune Broadcasting to emphasize the channel's national programming prominence; the WGN-TV Chicago signal, meanwhile, continued to use the callsign-only \"WGN\" branding with the \"Channel 9\" identification remaining as a sub-brand. On November 11, 2002, the superstation feed underwent another name change, becoming known as '''Superstation WGN''' to reflect the strong national standing of the channel; this change coincided with the introduction of the Akzidenz Grotesk \"arrow G\" logo introduced by WGN-TV at that time (and used until May 15, 2017), which was stylized for the superstation feed's logo design to also incorporate an oval with a die-cut \"S\" emblem to represent its superstation status.\n\nOn April 1, 2007, Chicago-based real estate investor [[Sam Zell]] announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company in a [[leveraged buyout]] worth $8.2 billion, under which Tribune employees were awarded stock and given effective ownership of the company.

A few shows were also dropped from the WGN America schedule (such as longtime staples ''[[U.S. Farm Report]]'' and ''[[Soul Train]]''), primarily due to the Tribune Company dissolving its television production and distribution unit, [[Tribune Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New eyes on new WGN America|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-05-28/business/0805270671_1_clear-channel-communications-superstation-wgn-national-channel|author=Phil Rosenthal|author-link=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=May 28, 2008|accessdate=October 13, 2015}}</ref> The network's [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen logo bug]] was revised In late July 2008, to feature the eye-and-profile element of the logo morphing into the \"WGN America\" text; the eye-and-profile element remained part of the general logo in all other uses until January 2009, when it was deemphasized in favor of using the channel's wordmark text as the primary logo.

However, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reporter Cynthia Littleton noted that such a revamp may not be fiscally viable, as it would risk piling on additional debt on top of that which Sinclair had already accrued through the spate of station purchases it has made since the 2011 acquisition of [[Four Points Media Group]] (estimated at $3.268 billion as of March 31, 2017), and the debt it would have assumed through the Tribune deal.<ref>{{cite news|title=Conservative-leaning TV station owner Sinclair getting bigger with Tribune deal|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/08/media/sinclair-buys-tribune-media/|author=Brian Stelter|author-link=Brian Stelter|website=[[CNN Money]]|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System/Time Warner|date=May 8, 2017|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Will Sinclair Broadcast Group take on Fox News after buying Tribune Media in a $3.9-billion deal?|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-tribune-sinclair-20170508-story.html|author=Stephen Battaglio|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Tronc|date=May 8, 2017|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sinclair's high-stakes gamble to reshape television news|url=http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2017/05/sinclairs_high_stakes_gamble_to_reshape_television_news.html|author=Thomas Lifson|periodical=American Thinker|publisher=|date=May 9, 2017|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sinclair Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results|url=https://seekingalpha.com/pr/16819273-sinclair-reports-first-quarter-2017-financial-results|website=Seeking Alpha|date=May 3, 2017|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}</ref> Former [[professional wrestling]] executive [[Eric Bischoff]] spoke in favor of the Sinclair-Tribune deal during a Q&A session on his official [[Periscope (app)|Periscope]] account on March 14, 2018, noting that Sinclair could utilize WGN America to expand the reach of Sinclair-owned [[professional wrestling]]  [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[Ring of Honor]] in a similar manner that the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] utilized [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and its predecessors including [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] and [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] from the 1970s until the early 2000s via TBS and TNT.

As is typical for cable networks, some of the shows airing on the channel are also available on other broadcast television stations throughout the United States; for much of its post-Syndex existence as the superstation feed of WGN-TV/Chicago, many of these programs were cleared by television syndication distributors for \"full-signal\" rights, therefore allowing them to air on WGN America as they do not fall under syndication exclusivity regulations (for example, although ''How I Met Your Mother'' is syndicated to other television stations nationwide, including WGN-TV, it is allowed to air on WGN America due to its clearance by [[20th Television]] for \"full-signal\" carriage). However, in 2013, WGN America began to acquire exclusive cable rights to programs eligible for syndication (such as ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'') as part of the channel's shift towards operating as a conventional cable network.<ref>{{cite news|title=WGN America Acquires Off-Network Rights to 'Person of Interest'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wgn-america-acquires-network-rights-644436|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Guggenheim Partners|Prometheus Global Media]]|date=October 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFeature films on WGN America are also cleared for \"full-signal\" carriage, as the channel runs movies from film packages distributed for local broadcast syndication by [[Warner Bros. Television]], [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]], 20th Television, [[Sony Pictures Television]] and other distributors. Movies formed much of the superstation's prime time schedule for much of its existence until the \"Superstation WGN\" branding era, though there have been exceptions: fewer prime time movies aired during the week during its four-year run as a cable-only affiliate of The WB from January 1995 to October 1999, particularly as that network's programming expanded to additional nights, with films airing on a nightly basis again \u2013 except on certain nights throughout the year to accommodate WGN-TV-produced sports telecasts cleared for national retransmission \u2013 once WB programming was dropped. (Films were later removed from Sunday nights with the launch of the \"Outta Sight Retro Night\" block in August 2007 and from Thursday nights between 2009 and 2010 to accommodate original programs such as ''WWE Superstars''.) WGN America then relegated its movie telecasts to Sunday afternoons and weekend late nights from September 18, 2010<ref>{{cite news|title=WGN America Fall 2010 Schedule|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2010/07/wgn-america-fall-2010-schedule-tca.html|website=Sitcoms Online|date=July 2010}}</ref> until prime time films returned on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays in May 2013.\n\nUntil 2012, the channel's morning and early afternoon schedule heavily relied on reruns of television series produced between the 1960s and the early 1990s. These programs were also prominently featured as part of the classic sitcom block \"Outta Sight Retro Night,\" which aired Sunday nights (incorporating a one-hour breakaway within the block's designated nine-hour-long time period for the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time simulcasts of ''WGN News at Nine'' and ''Instant Replay'') from August 26, 2007 until September 5, 2010. Some of the programs shown as part of the block \u2013 which included series such as ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[Newhart (TV series)|Newhart]]'', ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Barney Miller]]'' and ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' \u2013 had previously aired on WGN prior to the re-implementation of Syndex, or even after the rules went into effect on the Chicago signal or/and the superstation feed. (Tribune Broadcasting later included some of these shows on [[Antenna TV]], a broadcast network focusing on classic television series that Tribune launched on January 1, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Outta Sight Retro Night|url=http://www.wgnamerica.com/pages/outta_sight_retro_night|website=WGN America|publisher=Tribune Broadcasting|accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], WGN America acquired sub-run syndication rights to series that had previously aired in their original broadcast runs during the channel's affiliation with The WB, including ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'', ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]'' and ''[[The Parent 'Hood]]''. Between 2006 and 2009, WGN America ran teen- and preteen-oriented sitcoms during mid-afternoon timeslots such as ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'', ''[[Even Stevens]]'' and ''Sister, Sister'', only for these shows to quickly be moved to overnight [[graveyard slot]]s (when the show's target audiences are usually not awake) and then removed from the channel entirely shortly afterward. This was likely due to the restructuring of Tribune's television division and a distribution agreement with the [[Disney Channel]] that proved too expensive to maintain.\n\n===Original and licensed programming===\nOn August 21, 2008, WGN America announced a partnership with [[Indianapolis]] radio station [[WFBQ]] to broadcast a televised version of ''[[The Bob & Tom Show]]'' radio program, originally produced for the Tribune-owned Indianapolis [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] of Fox affiliate [[WXIN (TV)|WXIN]] (channel 59) and CW affiliate [[WTTV]] (channel 4, now a CBS affiliate).

Upon its premiere in September 1983, the national feed added a simulcast of WGN-TV's midday newscast, then known as ''Midday Newscope'' and originally structured as a half-hour local version of the [[Gannett Company|Gannett Broadcasting]]\u2013[[Telepictures]]-produced ''Newscope'' syndicated format.

The ''WGN Morning News'' became the first WGN-TV newscast to be denied clearance on or removed from the national feed, with its removal from the lineup following the September 13, 1996, broadcast reportedly being due to self-imposed exclusivity restrictions concerning the newscast's paid segments and rate charges that the station's sales department \u2013 which negotiates the appearance and the terms for those segments \u2013 would have to pay if the segments aired nationally. (The discontinuance of the morning news simulcast also accommodated the then-newly-launched Kids' WB weekday morning block, which the national feed originally intended to air alongside the block's existing weekday afternoon hour.)\n\nThe national feed also served as one of two cable distributors \u2013 along with [[TLC (TV network)|The Learning Channel]], which aired the program for the final four years of its run \u2013 for the ''[[Independent Network News (TV program)|Independent Network News]]'' (''INN'') (later retitled ''INN: The Independent News'' in September 1984 and ''USA Tonight'' in January 1987), a Tribune-syndicated national news effort originating from then-New York sister station WPIX that premiered on June 9, 1980 as a weeknightly prime time broadcast.

Even prior to the decision to remove sports from WGN America's schedule entirely, the channel had chosen not to air certain sports-related programming carried on the Chicago signal such as the Blackhawks' victory parade following its [[2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2010 Stanley Cup championship win]] and a half-hour special paying tribute to the late Cubs player and broadcaster [[Ron Santo]] in [[2011 Chicago Cubs season|2011]]. (In the respective cases, WGN-TV's coverage of Santo's [[funeral]] aired on the [[digital subchannel]]s of selected stations owned by Tribune and its partner group [[Local TV LLC|Local TV]], while the [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]] provided a simulcast of the Chicago signal's feed of the Blackhawks' victory parade.)\n\nAs part of the network's conversion from a superstation into a general entertainment cable channel, on May 30, 2014, Tribune announced that WGN America would phase out national carriage of WGN-TV-originated Chicago Cubs, Bulls and White Sox game telecasts by the end of that year. Peter Liguori, president and CEO of Tribune Media at the time, cited the limited revenue and viewership accrued from the national simulcasts relative to their contractual expense \u2013 revenue was reportedly only covering 20% of the rights fees \u2013 behind the decision to drop the national telecasts. Several seasons of sub-par play by the Cubs after Tribune's sale of the team to [[Thomas S. Ricketts]] in late 2009 also played a factor, as the team's television package cost five times as much for rights fees alone as the revenue it brought in for the national broadcasts. (Ironically, two seasons later, the Cubs underwent a major turnaround and had its strongest season in decades, going on to win its first [[World Series]] championship since 1908.

Under CRTC linkage rules first implemented in 1983 that require providers to offer U.S.-based program services in [[A la carte cable television|discretionary tiers]] tied to Canadian services, WGN-TV/WGN America and other authorized U.S. superstations typically have been sold to prospective subscribers of one or more domestic premium services \u2013 such as [[Crave (TV network)|Crave]] (formerly First Choice and The Movie Network), [[Starz (Canada)|Starz]] (formerly Moviepix and The Movie Network Encore), [[Super Channel (Canadian TV channel)|Super Channel]], [[Super \u00c9cran]] and [[Western Canada]]-based regional pay services [[Movie Central]] (the original user of the Superchannel name, now defunct) and [[Encore Avenue]] (also now defunct). However, some providers have chosen to offer WGN in a specialty tier under a related rule that allows for an eligible superstation of the provider's choice to be carried on a non-premium tier.

(Among the country's satellite providers, Star Choice [now [[Shaw Direct]]] began carrying the national feed upon the satellite provider's 1994 launch; Bell ExpressVu! [now [[Bell TV]]] began distributing the Chicago-area signal when it commenced operations in 1996.) During its four-year tenure as the network's national feed, the WGN national feed provided WB network programs to areas of Canada (mainly those far from the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian\u2013U.S. border]]) out of the signal reach of other American-based WB affiliates; however, [[simultaneous substitution]] rules have applied to certain WB programs that were concurrently carried by Canadian-based terrestrial networks (such as [[CTV 2|NewNet]] and [[A-Channel (Craig Media)|A-Channel]]).\n\nCanadian distribution of the feed then known as Superstation WGN was reduced significantly on January 17, 2007, when WGN's main Canadian uplink carrier, [[Shaw Broadcast Services]], switched its distributed feed of the station to the Chicago signal, a decision believed to have resulted from increased licensing fees for carriage of the then-superstation feed. Despite this, some providers continued to carry the national WGN channel in lieu of or \u2013 as was the case with providers such as [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS TV]] and [[Cogeco|Cogeco Cable]] \u2013 in tandem with the Chicago feed, resulting in the duplication of CW network and many syndicated programs that are available within the country on other networks (such as fellow superstations KTLA and [[Boston]]-based [[WSBK-TV]]). While CRTC had approved the Chicago station's broadcast signal ''and'' its national cable feed for carriage on any domestic multichannel television provider, the conversion of WGN America from a superstation into an independent general-entertainment service and its resulting programming separation from WGN-TV led Tribune Broadcasting to announce on December 15, 2014 that it would terminate all Canadian distribution rights for WGN America, effective January 1, 2015,<ref>{{cite web|title=Notice from Cogeco|url=https://www.facebook.com/Cogeco/posts/975584402457889|website=[[Facebook]]|via=[[Cogeco]]|date=December 15, 2014}}</ref><!-- Yes, the source is from Cogeco Cable's Facebook account.

(Nexstar also holds a 31% interest in TV Food Network, LLC, the [[Discovery, Inc.]]-controlled parent of [[Food Network]] and [[Cooking Channel]].) WGN America runs a mixture of recent and older comedy and drama series (including some first-run programs licensed for broadcast on the channel), and theatrical [[feature film]]s.\n\nWGN America was originally established on November 9, 1978, when [[Gemstar\u2013TV Guide International|United Video Inc.]] began redistributing the signal of [[WGN-TV]] (channel 9) in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]\u2014which, alongside WGN America, Chicago-based local [[United States cable news|cable news]] channel [[Chicagoland Television]] (CLTV) and [[talk radio|news/talk]]/[[sports radio]] station [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (720 AM), was among the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] broadcasting properties of [[Tribune Media]] (formerly known as the Tribune Company prior to the August 2014 spin-off of its [[Tribune Publishing|publishing division]]) until the closure of Nexstar's acquisition of Tribune in September 2019\u2014to cable and [[direct-broadcast satellite television|satellite]] subscribers throughout the United States. This expanded the prominent [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] into America's second [[communications satellite|satellite-distributed]] national \"[[superstation]],\" after the concept's progenitor, [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]-based WTBS (now separately operating as [[WPCH-TV]] in the Atlanta [[media market|market]] and as conventional subscription channel [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] nationwide).\n\nAs the national feed of WGN-TV, the channel broadcast a variety of programming seen on the Chicago signal, including sports (mainly [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] baseball, and [[Chicago Bulls]] basketball games); locally originated news, children's, religious and [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] programs; movies; and syndicated series. The WGN local and national feeds originally maintained nearly identical program schedules, aside from some sporting events that were restricted to the Chicago-area signal under league policy restrictions. In the years following the January 1990 re-imposition of federal [[syndication exclusivity]] regulations, programming between the two feeds increasingly deviated as the WGN national feed incorporated alternative syndicated programming to replace shows on the WGN-TV schedule that were subjected to market exclusivity claims by individual television stations and some local programs that the national feed chose not to clear (particularly from the late 2000s onward, as the WGN Chicago signal began expanding its local news programming and added lifestyle programs to its schedule). On December 14, 2014, WGN America was converted by Tribune into a conventional basic cable network, at which time it started to be offered on cable providers within the Chicago market alongside its existing local carriage on satellite providers [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]]. The former parent station, WGN-TV, maintains a separate schedule of local and syndicated programs exclusively catering to the Chicago market.\n\n{{As of|September 2018}}, WGN America was received by approximately 80 million households that subscribe to a pay television service throughout the United States (or 62.7% of households with at least one television set).<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen coverage estimates for September see gains at ESPN networks, NBCSN, and NBA TV, drops at MLBN and NFLN (Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: September 2018)|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|author=Andrew Bucholtz|website=Awful Announcing|publisher=[[NESN|NESN Digital]]|date=September 10, 2018|accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nWGN America traces its origins to '''[[WGN-TV]]''', a [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television station]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] that began operating over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 9 on April 5, 1948 as the second commercial television station to sign on in both the Chicago [[media market|market]] and the state of Illinois \u2013 after WBKB-TV (channel 4, now [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WBBM-TV]] on channel 2), which began experimental operations as W9XBK in 1940 and converted into a commercially licensed [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] on September 6, 1946 \u2013 and the 19th commercial station to sign on in the United States. The station \u2013 which, until January 1948, had originally planned to use the [[call sign]] '''WGNA''' \u2013 was founded by WGN, Incorporated, the broadcasting subsidiary of the [[Tribune Publishing|Chicago Tribune Company]] (owned by [[Robert R. McCormick]], then the editor and publisher of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''), which had also owned local radio stations [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] (720 AM) and WGNB (98.7 FM; frequency now occupied by [[WFMT]]). WGN America and its Chicago-based broadcast television and radio siblings borrow the [[List of three-letter broadcast callsigns in the United States|three-letter]] \"WGN\" initialism from the \"<u>W</u>orld's <u>G</u>reatest <u>N</u>ewspaper\" slogan used by the ''Tribune'' from August 29, 1911 until December 31, 1976.

The station was also known locally for its lineup of children's programs including ''[[The Bozo Show|Bozo's Circus]]'' (which became the most well-known iteration of the ''[[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]]'' franchise through its local and, later, national popularity, featuring a mix of comedy sketches, circus acts, cartoon shorts and in-studio audience participation games), ''[[Ray Rayner]] and His Friends'' (a variety show which featured animated shorts, arts and crafts segments, animal and science segments and a viewer mail segment) and ''[[Garfield Goose and Friends]]'' (a series hosted by [[Frazier Thomas]] as the \"[[prime minister]]\" to the titular clacking goose who designated himself as \"King of the United States,\" which is considered to be the longest running puppet show on local television) as well as a robust lineup of feature films (showing as many as four movies \u2013 one in the morning, and two to three films per night \u2013 each weekday, and between three and six movies per day on weekends).\n\nChannel 9 was Chicago's leading independent station for much of the period between the early 1960s and the early 1990s; although it was briefly overtaken in this distinction from 1979 to 1981 by rival independent [[WFLD]] (channel 32, now a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] owned-and-operated station), which forced WGN-TV parent subsidiary [[Tribune Broadcasting]] (previously known as the WGN Continental Broadcasting Company from 1956 until 1981) to initiate efforts to beef up the station's inventory of off-network syndicated programs and add product from the Tribune Company's upstart national syndication unit, [[Tribune Entertainment]]. Beginning in the mid-1970s, the WGN-TV signal began to be retransmitted via [[microwave relay]] to [[cable television]] systems in much of the central [[Midwestern United States]], enabling the station to reach far beyond the Chicago television market and reach areas that lacked access to an entertainment-based independent station.

United Video initially charged prospective cable systems 10\u00a2 per subscriber to receive the WGN-TV signal, the same rate Southern Satellite Systems charged for 24-hour-a-day retransmission of WTBS. WGN Continental Broadcasting and station management originally treated WGN-TV as a \"passive\" superstation, asserting a neutral position over United Video's national retransmission of its signal and holding no oversight over national promotion of the WGN signal. (This was in contrast to WTBS, which handled nationalized promotional responsibilities rather than leaving those duties to its satellite carrier, as WGN had done.) This allowed WGN Continental/Tribune Broadcasting to continue paying for syndicated programming and advertising at local rates rather than those comparable to other national networks.

However, despite being notified that WGN would be conducting tests of the programming information [[teletext]], United Video chose to substitute the material with teletext content from its [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]] business news service; its repurposing of the VBI became the subject of a [[copyright infringement]] lawsuit filed by Tribune Broadcasting against United Video in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]] that April, alleging that it retransmitted the station's prime time newscast, ''The Nine O'Clock News'' (now titled ''WGN News at Nine''), as well as other WGN-TV programs in a \"mutilated and altered\" fashion to use profitable teletext content from the Dow Jones service in a manner which resulted in United Video exercising direct control over the content in violation of Section 111(a) (3) of the 1976 Copyright Act and in interference with an agreement between WGN-TV and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] cable provider Albuquerque Cable Television Inc. to supply the EPG teletext to subscribers.

(In the case of the Chicago signal, this marked the first time that WGN-TV was affiliated with a major broadcast network since DuMont ceased operations in August 1956.) The WGN cable agreement resulted in The WB becoming the second American broadcast television network to distribute its programming directly to a cable-originated service to provide extended coverage in designated \"white areas\" without broadcast affiliate clearances and one of three network-to-cable undertakings stewarded by Jamie Kellner. As The WB was under development, Kellner was in process of developing The WeB, a proposed national WB cable feed for smaller markets based upon a service that he launched as President of the Fox Broadcasting Company, [[Foxnet]], which operated from June 1991 until September 2006. The use of WGN as a national relay feed gave The WB an early advantage over the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]) \u2013 another fledgling network that made its national debut on January 16, 1995, as a [[joint venture]] between [[BHC Communications|Chris-Craft/United Television]] and [[Paramount Television]] \u2013 which declined to allow the WWOR EMI Service to act as its national conduit in spite of similar initial gaps in UPN's broadcast affiliate coverage. The WGN superstation feed accounted for roughly 18% of the national coverage that The WB had at launch, with the rest of the network's initial 62% total reach coming from the 60 broadcast affiliates (including WGN-TV) that were willing to adhere to its [[reverse compensation]] plan for prospective affiliates. In some areas where cable systems did not carry the superstation feed ''and'' maintenance of a local WB affiliate was not yet possible, satellite distribution was the only method in which viewers could see the network's programming over WGN. (The WGN national feed served as the default WB affiliate for residents in 152 markets and the entirety of 21 U.S. states\u2014[[Alaska]], [[Arkansas]], [[Delaware]], [[Idaho]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Maine]], [[Mississippi]], [[Montana]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Mexico]], [[North Dakota]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]], [[South Dakota]], [[Tennessee]], [[Vermont]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[West Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Wyoming]]\u2014at varying periods of time up through the launch of The WeB.) United Video intended to provide an alternate feed of WGN with substitute programming for markets that had a WB-affiliated station; however, no such measure was taken, creating network duplication in markets where over-the-air WB affiliates were forced to compete with the WGN cable feed.<ref name=\"John Lippman\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Time Warner Takes Crucial Step Toward New Network Television: A pact with superstation WGN-TV gives it access to 73% of homes.

With local availability becoming less of an issue and with exclusivity protections being granted by the network to its affiliates in certain markets by this time, on January 27, 1999, Time Warner and Tribune mutually agreed to cease the stopgap WB programming relay over the WGN superstation feed effective that fall. On October 6, when the WGN superstation feed formally stopped carrying WB network programming, Kids' WB programming on weekday mornings and afternoons and on Sunday mornings was replaced with syndicated series, while feature films replaced The WB's prime time programs, resulting in the superstation's schedule more so resembling an independent station than a general entertainment cable network due to the presence of local programming from WGN-TV.<ref>{{cite web|title=WB affils cheer end of WGN feed|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/99-OCR/BC-1999-02-01-OCR-Page-0029.pdf|author=Michael Stroud|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=American Radio History|page=29|date=February 1, 1999|accessdate=March 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Muller May Have His Eyes on TV Show|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-02-11-9902110097-story.html|author=Jim Kirk|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=February 11, 1999|accessdate=March 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WGN to drop the WB for off-net series|url=https://variety.com/1999/tv/news/wgn-to-drop-the-wb-for-off-net-series-1117490789/|author=Richard Katz|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=January 28, 1999|accessdate=March 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=UVTV dropping WB lineup to air movies, sports|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/uvtv-dropping-wb-lineup-to-air-movies-sports/article_26c7e083-5a46-5f15-8fef-59737e6d9aaf.html|author=Rita Sherrow|newspaper=Tulsa World|publisher=World Publishing Company|date=January 30, 1999|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WGN Drops WB, Adds Movies, Sitcoms|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/wgn-drops-wb-adds-movies-sitcoms-148648|author=Linda Moss|periodical=Multichannel News|publisher=Cahners Business Information|via=HighBeam Research|date=September 20, 1999|accessdate=June 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328150223/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55897252.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=March 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Last night Dawson's last?

Comparatively, approximately 50% of the programs seen on WGN consisted of those originating on the Chicago feed that were cleared for \"full-signal\" carriage by the national feed; this proportion of common programming dropped to around 30% by 2005 through the prior removal of WB programming and the overall schedule beginning to rely more on programs acquired specifically for national carriage as syndicators increasingly insisted on exclusivity protection for their series and film packages and were unwilling to license the rights to higher-profile syndicated programs to the superstation feed, believing that it would be more lucrative to license those programs to individual stations.\n\nOn July 12, 2000, Gemstar International Group Limited acquired TV Guide, Inc. (which United Video Satellite Group renamed itself following its 1999 purchase of ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine from [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]), subsequently changing its name to [[Gemstar\u2013TV Guide International]]. In April 2001, Tribune Broadcasting purchased a majority interest in UVTV \u2013 one of three satellite carrier units, along with Superstar/Netlink Group and Netlink USA, that were operated by the company \u2013 from TV Guide, Inc. unit of Gemstar\u2013TV Guide (which was refocusing its assets around ''TV Guide'' magazine, the [[TV Guide#TV Guide Interactive|TV Guide Interactive]] [[electronic program guide|interactive program guide]] platform and the TV Guide Channel) for $106 million in cash, shifting responsibility for retransmission, distribution and promotion of the WGN superstation feed to Tribune and effectively transitioning WGN from a \"passive\" to an \"active\" superstation, as TBS had been since it was first uplinked in December 1976. (The transaction would be the subject of a 2004 [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] securities fraud investigation against co-president Peter Boylan that determined that Gemstar failed to inform investors that Tribune committed to a six-year, $100 million advertising contract with Gemstar in exchange for selling its stake in WGN to Tribune.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Boylan-SEC Deal Cost $600K|url=https://www.multichannel.com/news/boylan-sec-deal-cost-600k-151207|author=Steve Donohue|periodical=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=August 15, 2004|accessdate=April 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn September 10, 2001, the channel's name was changed to '''WGN Superstation''', in an effort by Tribune Broadcasting to emphasize the channel's national programming prominence; the WGN-TV Chicago signal, meanwhile, continued to use the callsign-only \"WGN\" branding with the \"Channel 9\" identification remaining as a sub-brand. On November 11, 2002, the superstation feed underwent another name change, becoming known as '''Superstation WGN''' to reflect the strong national standing of the channel; this change coincided with the introduction of the Akzidenz Grotesk \"arrow G\" logo introduced by WGN-TV at that time (and used until May 15, 2017), which was stylized for the superstation feed's logo design to also incorporate an oval with a die-cut \"S\" emblem to represent its superstation status.\n\nOn April 1, 2007, Chicago-based real estate investor [[Sam Zell]] announced plans to purchase the Tribune Company in a [[leveraged buyout]] worth $8.2 billion, under which Tribune employees were awarded stock and given effective ownership of the company.

On-air promotions began identifying the channel as WGN America on a limited basis since the beginning of May 2008, although [[station identification|channel IDs]] using the \"Superstation WGN\" moniker remained in place during the transitional period.

A few shows were also dropped from the WGN America schedule (such as longtime staples ''[[U.S. Farm Report]]'' and ''[[Soul Train]]''), primarily due to the Tribune Company dissolving its television production and distribution unit, [[Tribune Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite news|title=New eyes on new WGN America|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-05-28/business/0805270671_1_clear-channel-communications-superstation-wgn-national-channel|author=Phil Rosenthal|author-link=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=May 28, 2008|accessdate=October 13, 2015}}</ref> The network's [[digital on-screen graphic|on-screen logo bug]] was revised In late July 2008, to feature the eye-and-profile element of the logo morphing into the \"WGN America\" text; the eye-and-profile element remained part of the general logo in all other uses until January 2009, when it was deemphasized in favor of using the channel's wordmark text as the primary logo.

Movies formed much of the superstation's prime time schedule for much of its existence until the \"Superstation WGN\" branding era, though there have been exceptions: fewer prime time movies aired during the week during its four-year run as a cable-only affiliate of The WB from January 1995 to October 1999, particularly as that network's programming expanded to additional nights, with films airing on a nightly basis again \u2013 except on certain nights throughout the year to accommodate WGN-TV-produced sports telecasts cleared for national retransmission \u2013 once WB programming was dropped. (Films were later removed from Sunday nights with the launch of the \"Outta Sight Retro Night\" block in August 2007 and from Thursday nights between 2009 and 2010 to accommodate original programs such as ''WWE Superstars''.) WGN America then relegated its movie telecasts to Sunday afternoons and weekend late nights from September 18, 2010<ref>{{cite news|title=WGN America Fall 2010 Schedule|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2010/07/wgn-america-fall-2010-schedule-tca.html|website=Sitcoms Online|date=July 2010}}</ref> until prime time films returned on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays in May 2013.\n\nUntil 2012, the channel's morning and early afternoon schedule heavily relied on reruns of television series produced between the 1960s and the early 1990s. These programs were also prominently featured as part of the classic sitcom block \"Outta Sight Retro Night,\" which aired Sunday nights (incorporating a one-hour breakaway within the block's designated nine-hour-long time period for the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time simulcasts of ''WGN News at Nine'' and ''Instant Replay'') from August 26, 2007 until September 5, 2010. Some of the programs shown as part of the block \u2013 which included series such as ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[Newhart (TV series)|Newhart]]'', ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'', ''[[Barney Miller]]'' and ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' \u2013 had previously aired on WGN prior to the re-implementation of Syndex, or even after the rules went into effect on the Chicago signal or/and the superstation feed. (Tribune Broadcasting later included some of these shows on [[Antenna TV]], a broadcast network focusing on classic television series that Tribune launched on January 1, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Outta Sight Retro Night|url=http://www.wgnamerica.com/pages/outta_sight_retro_night|website=WGN America|publisher=Tribune Broadcasting|accessdate=November 9, 2008}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], WGN America acquired sub-run syndication rights to series that had previously aired in their original broadcast runs during the channel's affiliation with The WB, including ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', ''[[The Wayans Bros.]]'', ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]'' and ''[[The Parent 'Hood]]''. Between 2006 and 2009, WGN America ran teen- and preteen-oriented sitcoms during mid-afternoon timeslots such as ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'', ''[[Even Stevens]]'' and ''Sister, Sister'', only for these shows to quickly be moved to overnight [[graveyard slot]]s (when the show's target audiences are usually not awake) and then removed from the channel entirely shortly afterward. This was likely due to the restructuring of Tribune's television division and a distribution agreement with the [[Disney Channel]] that proved too expensive to maintain.\n\n===Original and licensed programming===\nOn August 21, 2008, WGN America announced a partnership with [[Indianapolis]] radio station [[WFBQ]] to broadcast a televised version of ''[[The Bob & Tom Show]]'' radio program, originally produced for the Tribune-owned Indianapolis [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] of Fox affiliate [[WXIN (TV)|WXIN]] (channel 59) and CW affiliate [[WTTV]] (channel 4, now a CBS affiliate). The program debuted on WGN America on November 3, 2008, originally airing in a standard [[late night television|late night]] slot,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Bob & Tom Show|url=http://www.wgnamerica.com/bobandtom.html|website=WGN America|publisher=Tribune Company}}</ref> before being shifted to an overnight [[graveyard slot]] until the ''Bob & Tom'' television broadcast ended on September 13, 2010. On December 19, 2008, Tribune reached a deal with [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] to broadcast ''[[WWE Superstars]]'' as an hour-long weekly program on WGN America.<ref name=\"wwesuperstars\">{{cite press release|title=WGN America Enters the Ring|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/wgnamerica|website=[[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]|date=December 19, 2008|accessdate=December 19, 2008}}</ref> The program started airing on WGN America on April 16, 2009, airing on the channel for two years until ''Superstars'' was dropped from its lineup after the April 7, 2011 telecast. (''WWE Superstars'' was then made available on WWE's subscription-based [[WWE Network]] until its cancellation in November 2016.)\n\nIn April 2010, WGN America announced it would begin carrying ''[[Earl Pitts (radio character)|Earl Pitts Uhmerikun]]'', a television version of the radio commentary series created by [[Gary Burbank]]. Burbank \u2013 whose segments as the \"middle American\" archetype character began airing on the channel that same month \u2013 had long maintained a close relationship with certain executives working at that time for the Tribune Company, who approached him about bringing the segments to television.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wake Up WGN Uhmerika!

When Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its proposed purchase of Tribune Media, Sinclair CEO Christopher Ripley's plans for the channel to focus on \"cost-effective\" original programs were cited as being based on the assertion that the network's then-current original programming budget was unjustified based on the channel's ratings (while not among the top 25 highest-rated cable networks, WGN America's viewership had gradually increased since the introduction of original scripted series, posting its highest monthly ratings in March 2017, during which it total viewership averaged 446,000 viewers and viewership among adults ages 25 to 54 totaled at 157,000).<ref name=\"sinclair-wgnamerica\"/><ref>{{cite press release|title=WGN America Posts Best Primetime Month In Network's History|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wgn-america-posts-best-primetime-month-in-networks-history-300436471.html|publisher=[[Tribune Broadcasting]]|via=[[PR Newswire]]|date=April 7, 2017|accessdate=May 19, 2017}}</ref> Ripley's statement immediately put into question the future of the [[slavery]]-era period drama ''[[Underground (TV series)|Underground]]'', which premiered on the network in March 2016 and ended its second season two days after the announcement of Tribune acquisition on May 10, 2017. Reports stated that ''Underground'' production company/distributor [[Sony Pictures Television]] would seek other network and streaming partners to continue the program (with [[Hulu]], which maintains a content deal with WGN America, being among the possible candidates); WGN would announce its decision to cancel the series on May 30.

Upon its premiere in September 1983, the national feed added a simulcast of WGN-TV's midday newscast, then known as ''Midday Newscope'' and originally structured as a half-hour local version of the [[Gannett Company|Gannett Broadcasting]]\u2013[[Telepictures]]-produced ''Newscope'' syndicated format.

The ''WGN Morning News'' became the first WGN-TV newscast to be denied clearance on or removed from the national feed, with its removal from the lineup following the September 13, 1996, broadcast reportedly being due to self-imposed exclusivity restrictions concerning the newscast's paid segments and rate charges that the station's sales department \u2013 which negotiates the appearance and the terms for those segments \u2013 would have to pay if the segments aired nationally.

Citing in part the station's statewide cable distribution (which, after the SyndEx rules were implemented, would occasionally subject the evening drawings to preemption associated with that of the delayed 9:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast when sports clearance restrictions applied to the WGN national feed), the Lottery moved its live evening telecasts back to the WGN local and national feeds on January 1, 1994, airing by then at 9:22&nbsp;p.m. CT during the prime time news simulcast; midday drawings for Pick 3 and Pick 4 were added upon their introduction on December 20, 1994.

Even prior to the decision to remove sports from WGN America's schedule entirely, the channel had chosen not to air certain sports-related programming carried on the Chicago signal such as the Blackhawks' victory parade following its [[2010 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2010 Stanley Cup championship win]] and a half-hour special paying tribute to the late Cubs player and broadcaster [[Ron Santo]] in [[2011 Chicago Cubs season|2011]].

Peter Liguori, president and CEO of Tribune Media at the time, cited the limited revenue and viewership accrued from the national simulcasts relative to their contractual expense \u2013 revenue was reportedly only covering 20% of the rights fees \u2013 behind the decision to drop the national telecasts. Several seasons of sub-par play by the Cubs after Tribune's sale of the team to [[Thomas S.

(Ironically, two seasons later, the Cubs underwent a major turnaround and had its strongest season in decades, going on to win its first [[World Series]] championship since 1908.

In particular, the channel was not available in portions of the [[New York metropolitan area|New York City metropolitan area]] (the home market of former sister station WPIX) until January 15, 2016, when Cablevision (now [[Altice USA]]) began to carry WGN America as part of a broader deal that also saw Cablevision's then-parent subsidiary, Cablevision Systems Corporation, acquire Tribune Media's 2.8% ownership interest in [[Newsday|Newsday Holdings]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cablevision to Carry WGN America Under New Tribune Media Content Deal|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cablevision-carry-tribunes-wgn-america-821695|author=Georg Szalai|periodical=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=September 10, 2015}}</ref> In the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], WGN America is carried by the three major cable television providers serving the immediate area (Comcast Xfinity, [[RCN Corporation|RCN]] and [[Wide Open West|WOW!]]), in addition to the WGN-TV broadcast signal. Prior to its conversion into a basic-tier channel in December 2014, Chicago-area residents could only receive WGN America through satellite providers Dish Network and DirecTV.<ref name=FederWGNAComcast/><ref name=B&CWGNAComcast/>\n\nSince its conversion from a superstation, WGN America has occasionally been targeted in Tribune Media's [[retransmission consent]] negotiations with cable and satellite providers as an extraneous asset they would like to pay less for, noting that most of the channel's programming is also syndicated to other broadcast and cable-originated networks. (Examples {{as of|2019|lc=y}} include ''Blue Bloods'' [which also airs on [[Ion Television]]], ''Murder, She Wrote'' [aired on [[Hallmark Movies & Mysteries]]], ''Last Man Standing'' [aired on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] and in broadcast syndication], and ''In the Heat of the Night'' [aired on [[MeTV]] and Tribune-owned This TV].) Disagreements over contractual terms resulted in [[Charter Communications]] removing WGN America and Tribune-owned television stations licensed to markets serviced by the provider from its [[Spectrum (cable service)|Spectrum]] systems nationwide for nine days in January 2019, with Spectrum\u2014in a looping message shown over the channels occupied by the Tribune stations during the dispute-induced blackout\u2014referring to WGN America as a network \"which very few people watch\" in its defense of their position in the negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|title=WITI-TV, WGN America back on Spectrum cable, ending a 9-day blackout in a fracas over fees|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/television-radio/2019/01/11/witi-tv-wgn-america-back-spectrum-cable-ending-9-day-blackout/2546090002/|author=Chris Foran|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=January 11, 2019|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|title=Spectrum/Tribune Broadcasting Dispute Messages (WGN America, KCPQ-TV and KZJO-TV)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-OeBdUQ730&t=79s|publisher=TWCJim (channel off-air pickup of listed stations)|via=[[YouTube]]|date=January 2, 2019|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Canadian distribution===\nIn April 1985, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) approved eligibility for the signals of WGN-TV and fellow American superstations WTBS, WOR-TV and WPIX to be retransmitted as [[List of foreign television channels available in Canada#American Superstations eligible for national distribution|foreign services]] by multichannel television providers within [[Canada]]. Under CRTC linkage rules first implemented in 1983 that require providers to offer U.S.-based program services in [[A la carte cable television|discretionary tiers]] tied to Canadian services, WGN-TV/WGN America and other authorized U.S. superstations typically have been sold to prospective subscribers of one or more domestic premium services \u2013 such as [[Crave (TV network)|Crave]] (formerly First Choice and The Movie Network), [[Starz (Canada)|Starz]] (formerly Moviepix and The Movie Network Encore), [[Super Channel (Canadian TV channel)|Super Channel]], [[Super \u00c9cran]] and [[Western Canada]]-based regional pay services [[Movie Central]] (the original user of the Superchannel name, now defunct) and [[Encore Avenue]] (also now defunct). However, some providers have chosen to offer WGN in a specialty tier under a related rule that allows for an eligible superstation of the provider's choice to be carried on a non-premium tier. (Although KWGN-TV has also been authorized for carriage by the CRTC since that point, the Denver sister station is not carried on any multichannel television providers within Canada.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Notice CRTC 1985-72 \u2013 Optional Canadian and Non-Canadian Satellite Services|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1985/PB85-72.htm|website=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]]|date=April 4, 1985|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ARCHIVED \u2013 Public Notice CRTC 84\u201381|url=https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1984/pb84-81.htm|website=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|date=April 2, 1984|accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A look at Tier III: Launched in October 1997, much doom was predicted for the launch of Tier III.

(Among the country's satellite providers, Star Choice [now [[Shaw Direct]]] began carrying the national feed upon the satellite provider's 1994 launch; Bell ExpressVu! [now [[Bell TV]]] began distributing the Chicago-area signal when it commenced operations in 1996.) During its four-year tenure as the network's national feed, the WGN national feed provided WB network programs to areas of Canada (mainly those far from the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian\u2013U.S. border]]) out of the signal reach of other American-based WB affiliates; however, [[simultaneous substitution]] rules have applied to certain WB programs that were concurrently carried by Canadian-based terrestrial networks (such as [[CTV 2|NewNet]] and [[A-Channel (Craig Media)|A-Channel]]).\n\nCanadian distribution of the feed then known as Superstation WGN was reduced significantly on January 17, 2007, when WGN's main Canadian uplink carrier, [[Shaw Broadcast Services]], switched its distributed feed of the station to the Chicago signal, a decision believed to have resulted from increased licensing fees for carriage of the then-superstation feed. Despite this, some providers continued to carry the national WGN channel in lieu of or \u2013 as was the case with providers such as [[Manitoba Telecom Services|MTS TV]] and [[Cogeco|Cogeco Cable]] \u2013 in tandem with the Chicago feed, resulting in the duplication of CW network and many syndicated programs that are available within the country on other networks (such as fellow superstations KTLA and [[Boston]]-based [[WSBK-TV]]). While CRTC had approved the Chicago station's broadcast signal ''and'' its national cable feed for carriage on any domestic multichannel television provider, the conversion of WGN America from a superstation into an independent general-entertainment service and its resulting programming separation from WGN-TV led Tribune Broadcasting to announce on December 15, 2014 that it would terminate all Canadian distribution rights for WGN America, effective January 1, 2015,<ref>{{cite web|title=Notice from Cogeco|url=https://www.facebook.com/Cogeco/posts/975584402457889|website=[[Facebook]]|via=[[Cogeco]]|date=December 15, 2014}}</ref><!-- Yes, the source is from Cogeco Cable's Facebook account.

However, most providers across Canada \u2013 including some that lost access to WGN America \u2013 continue to receive WGN-TV (which, in addition to being available to premium channel subscribers, had also previously been available as part of the [[NHL Centre Ice]] sports package, primarily for simulcasts of Chicago Blackhawks games that WGN-TV aired until the [[2018\u201319 Chicago Blackhawks season|2018\u201319 season]]), as the station is still authorized for domestic distribution as a superstation.\n\n==See also==\nIn relation to WGN America's prior history as a cable-originated affiliate of The WB, the following articles discuss similar cable-only affiliates of broadcast television networks:\n* [[The WB 100+ Station Group]] \u2013 a station group created by The WB in September 1998, made up of mostly locally managed cable-only television outlets in small and mid-sized U.S. markets that did not have an over-the-air affiliate, which superseded WGN America's de facto WB affiliate status for these areas\n* [[The CW Plus]] \u2013 successor of The WB 100+; a station group made up primarily of cable-only outlets that formerly served as affiliates of The WB 100+ Station Group and digital multicast channels\n* [[Foxnet]] \u2013 a similar cable-only network for markets without a Fox affiliate, that operated from 1991 to 2006\n* [[CTV Two Alberta]] \u2013 a cable-originated affiliate of [[CTV Two]] in the Canadian province of [[Alberta]]\n* [[CTV Two Atlantic]] \u2013 a similar cable-originated affiliate of CTV Two in [[Atlantic Canada]]\n* [[City Saskatchewan]] \u2013 a similar cable-originated affiliate of the [[City (TV network)|City]] television network in the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wgnamerica.com/ WGN America official website]\n*[http://wgn.com/ WGN.com]\n*[http://www.sitcomsonline.com/blog/2008/10/sitcomsonlinecom-exclusive-interview.html Interview with WGN America]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Articles and topics related to WGN America\n|state=collapsed\n|list1=\n{{WGN America}}\n{{Chicago TV}}\n{{Sports television in the United States}}\n{{Superstations}}\n{{NXST TV}}\n{{Chicago Cubs}}\n{{Chicago White Sox}}\n{{Chicago Bulls}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Superstations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1978]]\n[[Category:English-language television stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Chicago Bulls broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cubs broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Chicago White Sox broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football broadcasters]]\n", "name_user": "20chances", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNexstar Media Group ownerhsip", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN_America"}

Kent Hawryluk served as Founding Publisher and Lisa Frankenberg as Founding General Manager. Other programs introduced at that time were the Business Network, Lion's Share Group Publishing and the Prague Post Foundation (set up separately as a Czech-registered, non-profit foundation, and which later became The Prague Post Endowment Fund with the change in Czech nonprofit laws).\n\nThe mission of ''The Prague Post'' was simple and direct: to publish the best possible English-language newspaper for and about the rapidly changing Czechoslovakia and more broadly, Central Europe. The aim was to place particular emphasis on news, business, and cultural listings.\n\n[[Alan Levy]], a foreign correspondent for the [[International Herald Tribune]] and author of ''So Many Heroes'', an eyewitness account of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, was hired as the Founding Editor-in-Chief.<ref>\"[http://www.thinkexpats.com/component/content/article/309.html Alan Levy, The Pen of Prague]\". http://www.thinkexpats.com. Retrieved on 20 March 2011.</ref> The original staff hired by Levy included former reporters and editors from a wide range of magazines and daily newspapers, including the ''Sacramento Bee'', ''Sacramento Union'', ''The New York Review of Books'', ''Business International'', the ''Grinnell Herald-Register'', ''Fortune'' magazine and the ''Tampa Tribune''.\n\nLion's Share Group established the wholly owned subsidiary company Prague Post s.r.o. in March 1994 to take over the publishing of the newspaper, while Lion's Share Group became a holding company.\n\n===Chronological history===\n'''1991'''\n\n''The Prague Post'', located in a small room off Old Town Square in [[Prague]], debuted with a 12-page issue on 1 October 1991. The first paper covered news and business, offered a weekly calendar of listings and included a regular pub guide.\n\nIn late 1991, the paper moved to larger offices on Politick\u00fdch v\u011bz\u0148\u016f, off [[Wenceslas Square]], and increased to 16 pages.\n\n'''1992'''\nIn February 1992, \"Night & Day\", a redesigned and enlarged cultural listings section, was introduced. A regular features page concentrating on in-depth news, culture and lifestyle articles debuted in early May 1992.\n\nThe paper underwent extensive redesign, increased to 24 pages, switched street delivery days from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and moved printing operations to [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], on 18 November 1992. This enabled it to offer color capability to advertisers, higher quality print resolution and more timely international distribution. Several new regular sections appeared at this time including sports, \"The Big Picture\", a page devoted to news from Central and Eastern European regions and \"East View\", a column of material from other English-language newspapers in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nKent Hawryluk's day-to-day involvement with the newspaper ended in December 1992, and Lisa Frankenberg took over the responsibilities of publisher.  An additional suite of rooms was added to the offices at Politick\u00fdch v\u011bz\u0148\u016f and the staff continued to expand, along with the company's investment in computers and publishing equipment.\n\n'''1993'''\nA monthly supplement devoted to special news coverage about [[Slovakia]] and entertainment listings for [[Bratislava]] was introduced in January, 1993, but was later curtailed as reporting became more difficult in Slovakia. In July 1993, \"Summer in the City\" was published as a tabloid insert for the remaining weeks of the summer. The tabloid included up-to-the-minute travel information for tourists, filling in where the guidebooks left off.\n\n''The Prague Post'' launched special pullout sections on 1 September 1993: \"Money & Markets,\" \"Travel & Leisure\" and \"Real Estate.\" These sections, aimed at providing expert, specialized coverage, appeared on the first, second and third weeks of the month, respectively. The remaining week(s) of each month were filled with a series of special topics, including \"Computers & Technology\", \"The Modern Office\", \"Human Resources\" and \"Fashion.\" The special sections have changed and evolved over the years in response to readers\u2019 needs.\n\nThe newspaper moved into newly reconstructed offices in the historic YMCA building at Na Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed 12 on 1 December 1993.\n\n'''1994'''\n''The Prague Post'' underwent a significant redesign on January 19, 1994, transforming the second section into the tabloid-size pullout \"Night & Day\". This newly designed pullout consisted of articles detailing culture, features, listings, and a Prague Profile. It also introduced several new additions such as the Service Page, Ask Eva (an advice column), My Gene Pool (a cartoon strip) and reviews. The front section of the paper, consisting of news, business, sports and opinion also received a design improvement at this time.\n\nLater in 1994, \"Night & Day\" increased in size to include the classifieds section. At this time, the business editorial department also began publishing weekly researched industry lists that are included in the annual Book of Lists.\n\n'''1995'''\nThe 1995 ''Book of Lists'', under development throughout 1994, was published in early 1995. An updated version of the ''Book of Lists'' was published annually until 2000.\n\nIn 1995 the paper continued to grow in all areas as advertising revenue increased. The Prague Post began sponsoring two well-known events: the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and the Valtice Arts Festival.\n\n'''1996'''\n''The Prague Post'' celebrated its 5th Anniversary on 28 September 1996, with a black-tie, gala evening at N\u00e1rodn\u00ed D\u016fm na Vinohradech, attended by over 1,000 guests with dignitaries, including five ambassadors, past and present employees and clients. This Gala event was a memorable evening, aptly marking a significant occasion in the life of the newspaper and its importance in the market.\n\n''The Prague Post'' added sponsorship of the Prague International Marathon in the summer of 1996, and published a 12-page, four-color tabloid Holiday Shopping Guide for the month of December.\n\n'''1997'''\nIn April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' was awarded first place for \u2018Excellence in Newspaper Marketing\u2019 by the International Newspaper Marketing Association for an in-house marketing campaign.\n\nOn 1 April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' launched its website at www.praguepost.cz (today it is \"[http://www.praguepost.com www.praguepost.com]\"). The initial site offered several top stories from the weekly newspaper as well as information for tourists and relocation information for people planning to move to Prague. It quickly gained a significant following, particularly with readers based outside the [[Czech Republic]].\n\n'''1998'''\nIn May, 1998, Lisa Frankenberg returned from business school to resume an active role in the day-to-day operations of the newspaper as President and Publisher.\n\n'''1999'''\nThe newspaper underwent another significant redesign near the end of 1999. Randy Stano, winner of two Pulitzer prizes for design, was recruited to undertake the process of re-designing the newspaper. ''The Prague Post'' was granted an Award of Excellence for re-design by the Society of News Design.\n\nThe offices of ''The Prague Post'' were relocated to a two-story office space at \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nsk\u00e1 20 in Prague 1.\n\n'''2000'''\nSince its strong debut, ''The Prague Post'' has attracted much international media coverage, with articles about the paper and its staff appearing in ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Smithsonian'', ''Fortune'', ''The Columbia Journalism Review'', ''Advertising Age'', ''The European'' and ''Telegraph'' of London. In addition, the newspaper was profiled on [[BBC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] ([[60 Minutes]] and the [[CBS Evening News]]) and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (Prime Time Live and the ABC Evening News).\n\n''The Prague Post'' was re-launched with its new design and format on 19 January 2000. Printing of the newspaper was moved from [[Frankfurt]] to a printing house in [[Prague]].\n\n'''2001'''\n''The Prague Post'' received three design awards from the Society of News Design in 2001. The website was re-designed and re-launched in the autumn 2001. Its new face attracted new and existing readers with an estimated 10,000 hits per day.\n\n'''2002-2003'''\n''The Prague Post'' introduced a successful new product \u2013 ''Dining Out Guide'' \u2013 first published in 2003. It is a guide to the finest culinary experiences in Prague.\n\n'''2004'''\nOn 2 April 2004 [[Alan Levy]] died, aged 72. Two weeks later, ''The Prague Post'' said goodbye to its founding editor-in-chief in a public memorial service attended by numerous personalities of Czech political, business and cultural life.\n\n'''2005'''\nThe company also worked toward improving the quality of the paper and the services provided, including the rest of its publishing portfolio \u2013 the ''Book of Lists'' and ''Dining Out Guide''.\n\n'''2006'''\nIn 2006, ''The Prague Post'' proudly celebrated its 15th birthday. The night was in recognition of The Prague Post's long-standing tradition as a reputable English-language newspaper in the [[Czech Republic]].\n\nFormer and current staff were recognized on the night for their contributions to the development and growth of the Czech Republic's oldest and most popular English-language newspaper. [[Alan Levy]] was remembered and recognized on the night for his years of service and dedication to the paper.\n\n'''2007'''\nIn 2007, two new supplements were added to the newspaper. The \"Luxury Hotel Guide\" was designed to provide an in-depth look into the luxury hotels around Prague, while the \"Weddings\" supplement offers insight into all facets of wedding planning.\n\nIn 2007, ''The Prague Post'' also helped with the revival of English-language theater in [[Prague]] with the launching of the first annual Prague Post Playwriting Contest.\n\n'''2008'''\nThe Prague Post launches a digital edition for Amazon Kindle, the first paper in the Czech Republic to do so.

Kent Hawryluk served as Founding Publisher and Lisa Frankenberg as Founding General Manager. Other programs introduced at that time were the Business Network, Lion's Share Group Publishing and the Prague Post Foundation (set up separately as a Czech-registered, non-profit foundation, and which later became The Prague Post Endowment Fund with the change in Czech nonprofit laws).\n\nThe mission of ''The Prague Post'' was simple and direct: to publish the best possible English-language newspaper for and about the rapidly changing Czechoslovakia and more broadly, Central Europe. The aim was to place particular emphasis on news, business, and cultural listings.\n\n[[Alan Levy]], a foreign correspondent for the [[International Herald Tribune]] and author of ''So Many Heroes'', an eyewitness account of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, was hired as the Founding Editor-in-Chief.<ref>\"[http://www.thinkexpats.com/component/content/article/309.html Alan Levy, The Pen of Prague]\". http://www.thinkexpats.com.

The first paper covered news and business, offered a weekly calendar of listings and included a regular pub guide.\n\nIn late 1991, the paper moved to larger offices on Politick\u00fdch v\u011bz\u0148\u016f, off [[Wenceslas Square]], and increased to 16 pages.\n\n'''1992'''\nIn February 1992, \"Night & Day\", a redesigned and enlarged cultural listings section, was introduced. A regular features page concentrating on in-depth news, culture and lifestyle articles debuted in early May 1992.\n\nThe paper underwent extensive redesign, increased to 24 pages, switched street delivery days from Tuesdays to Wednesdays and moved printing operations to [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]], on 18 November 1992. This enabled it to offer color capability to advertisers, higher quality print resolution and more timely international distribution. Several new regular sections appeared at this time including sports, \"The Big Picture\", a page devoted to news from Central and Eastern European regions and \"East View\", a column of material from other English-language newspapers in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nKent Hawryluk's day-to-day involvement with the newspaper ended in December 1992, and Lisa Frankenberg took over the responsibilities of publisher.  An additional suite of rooms was added to the offices at Politick\u00fdch v\u011bz\u0148\u016f and the staff continued to expand, along with the company's investment in computers and publishing equipment.\n\n'''1993'''\nA monthly supplement devoted to special news coverage about [[Slovakia]] and entertainment listings for [[Bratislava]] was introduced in January, 1993, but was later curtailed as reporting became more difficult in Slovakia. In July 1993, \"Summer in the City\" was published as a tabloid insert for the remaining weeks of the summer. The tabloid included up-to-the-minute travel information for tourists, filling in where the guidebooks left off.\n\n''The Prague Post'' launched special pullout sections on 1 September 1993: \"Money & Markets,\" \"Travel & Leisure\" and \"Real Estate.\" These sections, aimed at providing expert, specialized coverage, appeared on the first, second and third weeks of the month, respectively. The remaining week(s) of each month were filled with a series of special topics, including \"Computers & Technology\", \"The Modern Office\", \"Human Resources\" and \"Fashion.\" The special sections have changed and evolved over the years in response to readers\u2019 needs.\n\nThe newspaper moved into newly reconstructed offices in the historic YMCA building at Na Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed 12 on 1 December 1993.\n\n'''1994'''\n''The Prague Post'' underwent a significant redesign on January 19, 1994, transforming the second section into the tabloid-size pullout \"Night & Day\". This newly designed pullout consisted of articles detailing culture, features, listings, and a Prague Profile. It also introduced several new additions such as the Service Page, Ask Eva (an advice column), My Gene Pool (a cartoon strip) and reviews. The front section of the paper, consisting of news, business, sports and opinion also received a design improvement at this time.\n\nLater in 1994, \"Night & Day\" increased in size to include the classifieds section. At this time, the business editorial department also began publishing weekly researched industry lists that are included in the annual Book of Lists.\n\n'''1995'''\nThe 1995 ''Book of Lists'', under development throughout 1994, was published in early 1995. An updated version of the ''Book of Lists'' was published annually until 2000.\n\nIn 1995 the paper continued to grow in all areas as advertising revenue increased. The Prague Post began sponsoring two well-known events: the [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] and the Valtice Arts Festival.\n\n'''1996'''\n''The Prague Post'' celebrated its 5th Anniversary on 28 September 1996, with a black-tie, gala evening at N\u00e1rodn\u00ed D\u016fm na Vinohradech, attended by over 1,000 guests with dignitaries, including five ambassadors, past and present employees and clients. This Gala event was a memorable evening, aptly marking a significant occasion in the life of the newspaper and its importance in the market.\n\n''The Prague Post'' added sponsorship of the Prague International Marathon in the summer of 1996, and published a 12-page, four-color tabloid Holiday Shopping Guide for the month of December.\n\n'''1997'''\nIn April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' was awarded first place for \u2018Excellence in Newspaper Marketing\u2019 by the International Newspaper Marketing Association for an in-house marketing campaign.\n\nOn 1 April 1997, ''The Prague Post'' launched its website at www.praguepost.cz (today it is \"[http://www.praguepost.com www.praguepost.com]\"). The initial site offered several top stories from the weekly newspaper as well as information for tourists and relocation information for people planning to move to Prague. It quickly gained a significant following, particularly with readers based outside the [[Czech Republic]].\n\n'''1998'''\nIn May, 1998, Lisa Frankenberg returned from business school to resume an active role in the day-to-day operations of the newspaper as President and Publisher.\n\n'''1999'''\nThe newspaper underwent another significant redesign near the end of 1999. Randy Stano, winner of two Pulitzer prizes for design, was recruited to undertake the process of re-designing the newspaper. ''The Prague Post'' was granted an Award of Excellence for re-design by the Society of News Design.\n\nThe offices of ''The Prague Post'' were relocated to a two-story office space at \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nsk\u00e1 20 in Prague 1.\n\n'''2000'''\nSince its strong debut, ''The Prague Post'' has attracted much international media coverage, with articles about the paper and its staff appearing in ''[[USA Today]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Smithsonian'', ''Fortune'', ''The Columbia Journalism Review'', ''Advertising Age'', ''The European'' and ''Telegraph'' of London. In addition, the newspaper was profiled on [[BBC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] ([[60 Minutes]] and the [[CBS Evening News]]) and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (Prime Time Live and the ABC Evening News).\n\n''The Prague Post'' was re-launched with its new design and format on 19 January 2000. Printing of the newspaper was moved from [[Frankfurt]] to a printing house in [[Prague]].\n\n'''2001'''\n''The Prague Post'' received three design awards from the Society of News Design in 2001. The website was re-designed and re-launched in the autumn 2001. Its new face attracted new and existing readers with an estimated 10,000 hits per day.\n\n'''2002-2003'''\n''The Prague Post'' introduced a successful new product \u2013 ''Dining Out Guide'' \u2013 first published in 2003. It is a guide to the finest culinary experiences in Prague.\n\n'''2004'''\nOn 2 April 2004 [[Alan Levy]] died, aged 72. Two weeks later, ''The Prague Post'' said goodbye to its founding editor-in-chief in a public memorial service attended by numerous personalities of Czech political, business and cultural life.\n\n'''2005'''\nThe company also worked toward improving the quality of the paper and the services provided, including the rest of its publishing portfolio \u2013 the ''Book of Lists'' and ''Dining Out Guide''.\n\n'''2006'''\nIn 2006, ''The Prague Post'' proudly celebrated its 15th birthday. The night was in recognition of The Prague Post's long-standing tradition as a reputable English-language newspaper in the [[Czech Republic]].\n\nFormer and current staff were recognized on the night for their contributions to the development and growth of the Czech Republic's oldest and most popular English-language newspaper. [[Alan Levy]] was remembered and recognized on the night for his years of service and dedication to the paper.\n\n'''2007'''\nIn 2007, two new supplements were added to the newspaper. The \"Luxury Hotel Guide\" was designed to provide an in-depth look into the luxury hotels around Prague, while the \"Weddings\" supplement offers insight into all facets of wedding planning.\n\nIn 2007, ''The Prague Post'' also helped with the revival of English-language theater in [[Prague]] with the launching of the first annual Prague Post Playwriting Contest.\n\n'''2008'''\nThe Prague Post launches a digital edition for Amazon Kindle, the first paper in the Czech Republic to do so.

club based in [[Kratovo, North Macedonia|Kratovo]], [[North Macedonia]] who play in the [[Macedonian First Football League|Macedonian First League]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded in 1965.\n\nSileks biggest accomplishment in 90s came in the [[1989\u201390 Yugoslav Cup|Cup]] where they reached the quarter-finals. It was a remarkable achievement considering they defeated both Sarajevo teams, [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|FK \u017deljezni\u010dar]] and [[FK Sarajevo]] in back to back rounds, and they were both top-league sides at that time. Since the formation of the [[First Macedonian Football League]], they played at top level from the start until their relegation in 2013. Their biggest success happened during the 1990s, when they won three league titles (including a record five time runners-up) and two national cups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rsssf.com/tablesf/fyromhist.html#93|title=Macedonia&nbsp;\u2013 List of Final Tables|work=Igor Kramarsic and Goran Mancevski|first=|last=}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\n'''{{Flagicon|Macedonia}} [[Macedonian First Football League|Macedonian First League]]:'''\n*'''Winners (3):''' [[1995\u201396 Macedonian First Football League|1995\u201396]], [[1996\u201397 Macedonian First Football League|1996\u201397]], [[1997\u201398 Macedonian First Football League|1997\u201398]]\n*Runners-up (5): [[1992\u201393 Macedonian First Football League|1992\u201393]], [[1993\u201394 Macedonian First Football League|1993\u201394]], [[1994\u201395 Macedonian First Football League|1994\u201395]], [[1998\u201399 Macedonian First Football League|1998\u201399]], [[2003\u201304 Macedonian First Football League|2003\u201304]]\n\n'''{{Flagicon|Macedonia}} [[Macedonian Second Football League|Macedonian Second League]]:'''\n*'''Winners (1):''' [[2013\u201314 Macedonian Second Football League|2013\u201314]]\n\n'''{{Flagicon|SR Macedonia}} Macedonian Republic Cup:'''\n*'''Winners (2):''' 1988\u201389, 1989\u201390\n\n'''{{Flagicon|Macedonia}} [[Macedonian Football Cup]]:'''\n*'''Winners (2):''' [[1993\u201394 Macedonian Football Cup|1993\u201394]], [[1996\u201397 Macedonian Football Cup|1996\u201397]]\n*Runners-up (1): [[1994\u201395 Macedonian Football Cup|1994\u201395]]\n\n==Recent seasons==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=9|League\n!rowspan=2 width=\"30\"|[[Macedonian Football Cup|Cup]]\n!rowspan=2 colspan=2 width=\"200\"|[[UEFA#Competitions|European competitions]]\n|-\n!Division\n!width=\"25\"|P\n!width=\"25\"|W\n!width=\"25\"|D\n!width=\"25\"|L\n!width=\"25\"|F\n!width=\"25\"|A\n!width=\"25\"|Pts\n!width=\"40\"|Pos\n|-\n|1992\u201393\n|[[1992\u201393 Macedonian First Football League|1.
