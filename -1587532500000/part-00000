Marcus meets with the owners, observes the business operations and investigates their financial records. Marcus will then evaluate the company and make an offer to buy a stake in the business over a [[Gentleman's agreement|handshake.]] Marcus will then assume 100% control to fix the business and make it profitable. This either leads to successful re-launches, or a falling out between Marcus and the owners.\n\n== Series overview ==\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" rowspan=\"2\" | Episodes\n! style=\"padding:0 80px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Originally aired\n|-\n!

Their profits on their cars are too low to cover overhead expenses, their revenue is cut through the use of wholesalers, and Andrew feels restricted by Jon. Marcus offers $200,000 for a third of the business, as well as licensing rights to launch the company to a national brand. Marcus makes changes to the process, getting Jon to appraise the car with the seller in person, and forces him to eliminate the middle-men in the deals to improve profits. Meanwhile, he addresses the tension between Jon and Andrew by giving Andrew the opportunity to create an advertisement without Jon's interference. Marcus invests over $300,000 to remodel the business to give it a new uniform look. Jon pulls through with firmer prices with sellers and making more profit through selling direct to dealers. Andrew impresses Jon with his marketing work. The brothers repair their rift, and the business takes off in the following months, opening stores in several states and attracting new licensees.|LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2|EpisodeNumber2 = 2|Title = Jacob Maarse Florists|Aux1 = Pasadena, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|6|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Started by his father, Hank's floral shop has lost money ever since he took over, and is now a disorganised shopfront with inefficient delivery, underpriced flowers, no inventory system and selling a variety of gifts. Marcus offers $100,000 for 25% of the business. Over the week, Marcus invests over $150,000 in renovating the neglected shop and upgrading their delivery vehicles. Marcus also demotes Marina, the general manager. Marcus organises a grand re-opening with the new shop layout, resulting in improved profits and morale, and Marina shines in her new role as retail manager. However, Hank reneges on the deal, claiming that Marcus had not invested anything into the business despite his visible efforts. Furious at Hank's ignorance and childish attitude, Marcus leaves on a note that he fully intends on getting his money back. |LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3|EpisodeNumber2 = 3|Title = Planet Popcorn|Aux1 = Southern California, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|13|df=y}}|ShortSummary = With a lucrative contract with [[Disney]], Sharla's company, Planet Popcorn, works several mobile locations at fairs but is unable to turn a profit. Marcus arrives at the company office to find it in disarray. As a cash-only business, the company has no system in place to track the money in the tills, no security at their stores, and piles of money are literally strewn over the floor. Marcus tentatively offers $200,000 for 50% of the business and full financial control. He plans to set up a retail location near a shopping mall, but Sharla pushes for a more remote location. She reveals that she is looking to expand into [[crepe]]s rather than popcorn, which infuriates Marcus. Sharla is also uncooperative when redesigning the package, and tries to go behind Marcus's back to purchase a [[domain name]] owned by Marcus for the business. The deal goes sour when Marcus uncovers over $300,000 unaccounted for in the financial records. Sharla attempts to block Marcus from discussing the finances without her, but Sharla is incapable of understanding the figures. Marcus brings in a [[forensic accountant]], who actually discovers that nearly twice as much money has gone missing from the company. Sharla does not seem alarmed, which causes Marcus to grow concerned and back out of the deal.|LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4|EpisodeNumber2 = 4|Title = Eco-Me|Aux1 = Pomona, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|20|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Eco-Me focuses on all-natural cleaning products as an alternative to the artificial chemicals used in most products. Marcus shows some interest in developing the brand further and offers $500,000 for 20% of the business. Marcus is not impressed with the marketing and sales pitch, and the brand fails to attract interest from vendors and [[focus group]]s. Criticism is aimed at the misleading \"all natural\" claim and ambiguous product purpose\u2014the products are named after generic people (\"Dave\") and are sold as \"general purpose cleaners\", although they are in fact not appropriate for all purposes. Marcus is disappointed in the long-distance sales manager, who is very passive in making deals, forcing Marcus to sell the product to a hotel chain by cleaning toilets himself. The owner is also very stubborn in changing the name and package design. They manage to compromise with Marcus, and successfully market their product to a vendor. |LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5|EpisodeNumber2 = 5|Title = LA Dogworks|Aux1= Orange County, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|27|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Andrew runs LA Dogworks, a facility for dog owners to receive full service, including boarding, grooming and training. However, Andrew has a very poor understanding of running a business and the kennels have very low occupancy, resulting in very low monthly profits. Marcus tentatively offers $1 million for 50% of the business and full operational control and begins the process of developing private-label products for LA Dogworks. However, his main concern is Andrew's management style. Andrew is highly critical of customers and their needs, responding aggressively to online complaints. He has an even worse regard for his employees, being abusive and regards their complaints as incompetency. In particular, he showed no compassion when one of his employees was bitten, and placed the blame squarely on him. Initially the employees are hopeful of change with Marcus's arrival, but as Andrew's dictatorial demeanor worsens, they begin to leave. Marcus makes little headway after bringing in a psychologist to assess Andrew's interactions in the workplace, revealing that he is a sociopath. A final confrontation between Andrew, his manager and Marcus leaves Marcus in silent anger, and Andrew storms out.|LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6|EpisodeNumber2 = 6|Title = [[Mr. Green Tea Ice Cream Company|Mr. Green Tea]]|Aux1 = Keyport, NJ|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|9|3|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Started as a rival line to [[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]], Mr. Green Tea sells [[green tea]], [[ginger]] and [[adzuki bean|red bean]]-flavor [[ice cream]] to the restaurant business. Unlike previous businesses on the show, Mr. Green Tea is not a failing business, but has reached stagnation. Production is limited by using a co-packer rather than manufacturing their own ice cream, and owner Rich is very conservative in business decisions compared to his son Michael. Michael wishes to invest in a larger facility and estimates a $600,000 cost to get it running. Marcus offers $600,000 for 35% of the business. They acquire the new property and begin working on new product lines for [[gelato]] and [[mochi]]. However, Rich finds the pace of the change to be too quick and struggles to be decisive. Michael also makes reckless mistakes, purchasing a promotional car without approval and severely underestimating the cost of building out the new warehouse. Despite this, Marcus continues his investment. A month later, they clear out the warehouse and project good growth in the coming years.\n\nMarcus then briefly recalls Maarse Florists (Episode 2) to reveal that after the fallout with the owner, he had been repaid by the owner's mother.|LineColor = e38181}}\n|}\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{| style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\" class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"7%\" | No.\noverall\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"7%\" | No. in\nseries\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"40%\" | Business\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"20%\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"15%\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7|EpisodeNumber2 = 1|Title = Athans Motors|Aux1 = Morton Grove, IL|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|2|25|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Opened by Pete Athans, Athans Motors is an unsuccessful car sales company with millions in debt, no inventory, no sales and losing over $150,000 a month. Marcus inspects the business and finds that Pete has wasted millions in creating a lounge for visitors to watch movies and play games instead of purchasing cars, of which he only has 20. Furthermore, all the cars are expensive luxury vehicles rather than affordable used cars for the market, forcing general manager Tony to turn away prospective buyers. Having made his fortune in the [[automotive industry]], Marcus offers $3.5 million for 50% of the company. He liquidates all the cars that cannot be sold as well as the lounge amenities to have capital to double their current inventory. He also plans to remodel the site to use the floor space to sell car products and rename the business for a grand opening. Pete, however, is resistant to the change despite his inexperience. His [[micromanagement]] frustrates Tony, who resigns. Pete also attempts to walk out of the deal after his business is re-branded to AutoMatch USA, but Marcus soothes his shock and he commits to the re-launch. The grand opening is hindered by heavy snow, but Pete and Marcus successfully host the opening to a busy crowd. |LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8|EpisodeNumber2 = 2|Title = A. Stein Meat Products|Aux1 = Brooklyn, NY|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|4|df=y}}|ShortSummary = A 75-year-old business run by Alan and Howard, Stein Meats is a $50,000,000 business selling meats to retailers and restaurants. Although they sell a lot of products, including their Brooklyn Burger brand, they are millions in debt due to not following up on receivables owed to them. Marcus invests $1 million for 50% of the company, and begins the process of chasing up buyers for money owed. However, he is disappointed that the owners and Frank, the general manager, are passive in chasing up receivables, which is what led to them going into debt. Furthermore, the office manager, Donna, is frustrated that Frank does not understand the process to acquire approval for purchases, and threatens to quit. Marcus audits the financials, and is alarmed to find that the business's figures have been under-reported and they owe nearly six times more money than Marcus believed, plus they are two weeks away from [[bankruptcy]] and are unable to make the payroll. Marcus backs out of the $1 million deal, but agrees to support the business by investing $200,000 to provide working capital in return for the Brooklyn Burger brand.\n\nMarcus then recaps his investment with 1 800 Car Cash (Season 1 Episode 1). The business is turning a healthy profit, has opened a second store location with three more planned. Marcus has then turned the business into a nation-wide model with stores across the country. |LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9|EpisodeNumber2 = 3|Title = Michael Sena's Pro-Fit|Aux1 = Dyer, IN|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|11|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Michael Sena, a pioneering personal trainer and author, owns his own training center with his wife, Tina. Pro-Fit offers a highly specialised group training facility, but sees very little activity throughout most of the day. While Marcus is impressed with their passion and training, he sees that expanding the training to incorporate other disciplines, such as [[yoga]] and [[pilates]], would sustain the business, which Michael is not in favor of. Marcus offers $50,000 individually to Tina to market a new line of [[protein bar]]s in return for 50% of the product. Marcus offers $250,000 to Michael for 75% of the gym business, on the condition that they search for a larger site and diversify their services. Marcus connects Tina with a commercial kitchen to produce bite-sized protein bars. However, Michael takes issue with being left out of the process, and fails to get out of his 3-year lease, causing Marcus to walk out of the deal. Humbled by his failure, Michael acts on his own to re-brand the company as \"Tina and Michael's Pro-Fit\" to make up with his wife. Impressed with this change of character, Marcus offers a smaller investment to get the current site profitable. While Michael disappoints Marcus by changing the floor plan without approval, the business re-opens and takes off with more clients and Tina's protein bites are positively received in trials.|LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 10|EpisodeNumber2 = 4|Title = Worldwide Trailers|Aux1 = Tampa, FL|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|18|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Owned by Tom and Nancy, Worldwide Trailers manufactures concession trailers, mostly to [[food truck]] operators. Marcus is very impressed with the product, but is shocked by the inefficiency. He learns that the trailers are put together in their plant in Georgia, and then sent to Tampa for finishing and sales. A visit to the Georgia site reveals a committed team who are capable of complete the trailers on site, but there is a lack of organisation. Marcus offers $700,000 for 50% of the business. He focuses on moving the business to the Georgia location to cut expenses. He brings in a team to evaluate their inventory, and with everything literally lying around outside and no one responsible, they declare the site to have the worst inventory they have ever seen. The operation is complicated by Nancy's refusal to move from Tampa. The deal falls apart when Nancy and Tim are unable to get over their marital breakup and have an argument in front of Marcus and the employees, forcing Marcus to turn away.|LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 11|EpisodeNumber2 = 5|Title = Skullduggery|Aux1= Anaheim, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|25|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Originally started as a fossil replica company, Skullduggery is now owned by brothers Steven and Peter and produces traditional toys. The company is running at a loss, and Marcus offers to invest $1.1 million to pay off the debt, plus another $1 million for working capital, for 50% of the business. Steven and Peter walk out on Marcus and afterwards demand that he only get 30%. Marcus agrees on the condition that he receives full financial control. Disappointed that the company does not do any [[market research]] for their products, Marcus organises a [[focus group]] with kids and parents. The MaxTrax light-up cars are a favourite, while the AeroFlix is confusing, despite being a significant investment. The parents report that they believe the products are not unique enough to draw attention, which Steven takes very poorly. Marcus clears out their useless inventory to gain some funds, which the owners protest again, and they are also reluctant to invest in making more efficient molds in the factory. Marcus invests in developing a creative lab and purchases a [[3D printing|3D printer]]. However, his meeting with [[NASCAR]] turns sour when Steven and Peter outright refuse to work with them. After development on the NASCAR product stalls, Steven, Peter and their father try to re-negotiate the deal, taking issue with Marcus controlling the financials. With the deal points no longer agreed on, Marcus cuts his losses and leaves. |LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 12|EpisodeNumber2 = 6|Title = Sweet Pete's|Aux1 = Jacksonville, FL|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|4|1|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Run by eccentric candymaker Peter and wife Alison, Sweet Pete's is a popular candy store that offers classes for children to learn to make candy. The business is crippled by their location, a residential area with a domestic kitchen. Despite this, their passion keeps them working around the clock to fulfill a bulk order, with Marcus coming in to lend a hand. Their expansion opportunities are ruled out by their business partner Dane, who provided them with the property and invested $2000 in cash. Despite Peter's demands, Dane refuses to sell his part of the company and Peter and Alison are living off $10,000 a year from their share. Marcus offers $750,000 for 50% of the business. Dane refuses to relinquish his shares despite Marcus's offer to return his $2000 investment plus interest. Marcus helps Peter set up an online service, rents a commercial kitchen space, hires more staff and scouts for a new prime location. Dane tries to negotiate a new deal, feeling that he is not being valued for his contribution, and demands $150,000 for his shares. Insulted by the inflated figure, Marcus reads through the shareholder agreement, and Peter is confronted with the option of abandoning the name and recipes to start fresh. Instead, Marcus uncovers a clause which determines [[stock dilution]]. He confronts Dane and tells him that Peter and Alison will be loaned money to invest into the business, which will dilute Dane's shares unless he matches the investment. Unable to match this proposition, Dane leaves the business, paving the way for Peter and Alison to expand their Sweet Pete's brand. With the new store being built, Marcus gives them a mobile candy store.\n\nSweet Pete's would go on to meet huge success and be featured several times in later episodes. |LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 13 |EpisodeNumber2 = 7|Title = Amazing Grapes|Aux1 = Orange County, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|4|8|df=y}}|ShortSummary = In a classic case of [[absentee business owner|absent owners]], Amazing Grapes is mostly run by the staff and focuses on selling [[wine]] and [[beer]]. However, their most profitable aspect, the bar and restaurant, is poorly sited in the building and has minimal floor space for their margins, while the space is filled with inventory that cannot be sold. The staff are very knowledgeable and experienced, but are overruled by the owners when they do turn up to manage. Marcus offers $300,000 for 51% of the business, with 25% going to the staff. Marcus remodels the store to give more floor space to the bar and restaurant, moving the display shelves to illuminated sides. Although met with initial resistance, Marcus is pleased at the relaunch. | LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 14 |EpisodeNumber2 = 8|Title = Key West Key Lime Pie Co.|Aux1 = Key West, FL|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|4|15|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Owned by Jim and Alison, the Key West Key Lime Co. is riding on the success of being the \"Nation's Best Pie\", with high revenue for their product. However, they are not turning a profit. Marcus finds that they have two locations: their main store and a shipping office, which is losing money. He is also disappointed to find that their signature pies use pre-made crusts and powdered ingredients to speed up the process. Marcus invests $450,000 for 51% of the business, on the condition that they do not sell what they do not make, and that development is focused on creating a proprietary pie. Marcus closes down the unprofitable shipping office and clears out all non-company items in the store, much to Jim's ire. Jim is even more resistant to changing the recipe after Marcus hires three pastry chefs to create new recipes. The staff reveal that Jim's original crust was the best, which Marcus is surprised to hear after Jim's reliance on pre-made crusts. Jim perfects the recipe and the shop is renovated to more prominently display the pies and the baking process. Marcus rewards manager Tami, who is pregnant and working two jobs, by giving her a pay rise and maternal pay. The store reopens successfully, but Jim has a hard time coping with the change.| LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 15|EpisodeNumber2 = 9|Title = Courage.b|Aux1 = Greenwich, CT |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|10|14|df=y}}|ShortSummary = A clothing line started by Noemi and managed by son Nicolas, Courage.b met initial success but has run into difficult times in the changing economy. Marcus invests $800,000 for 30% of the business. Marcus has to throw out their useless inventory, a result of Noemi's unsuccessful ideas. Instead, Marcus focuses on building \"five pillars\" based on their main product and establishes a distinct, consistent look. During the process, Nicolas is abusive to his mother, and Marcus manages to get him to open up, revealing a control streak and sense of mistrust. The team works together to remodel the store, turning it into a high-class establishment.| LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 16|EpisodeNumber2 = 10|Title = Artistic Stitch |Aux1 = Queens, NY |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|10|21|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Originally a successful [[embroidery]] company, Artistic Stitch was expanded by owner Sal into a mini-[[Strip mall|mall]], including baseball pens, a basketball court, and an Italian restaurant. As a result of this spending, Sal has accumulated significant debt. Wanting to close most of the unnecessary businesses and focus on the embroidery, Marcus offers $660,000 for 50% of the business and full financial control. Marcus sets up a new DIY printing station and renames the establishment \"Queen's Vibe\". He discovers that the sales manager Nick has made minimal effort to market their services, having only put in ads in the [[Yellow Pages]] and not having contracts with any major businesses. Marcus tests Nick's sales pitch by taking him out to the local fire station, where Nick is unable to deliver a clear pitch. Marcus takes over and they secure a deal. As a result, Marcus changes Nick's payment from a salary to a 100% commission plan, which Nick accepts. Meanwhile, Marcus uncovers erratic spending on the company credit card by Sal, and pending legal action from the landlord due to unpaid rent and operating without a certificate. Unable to trust Sal, Marcus cuts his losses and walks out on the deal.| LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 17 |EpisodeNumber2 = 11|Title = Swanson's Fish Market|Aux1 = Fairfield, CT |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|10|28|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Run by Gary, Swanson's Fish Market has been crippled by a fire that destroyed their historic store building, and a separate fire that gutted their warehouse. Marcus finds the business to be unappealing, but the customers praise the prepared foods, such as fish soup, sold in limited numbers. Marcus offers $1 million for the building with 0% stake in the company, with the option for the owners to buy it back. Marcus reorganises the store to display high-margin fish more prominently and focuses on the prepared foods. The building's co-tenant, a caf\u00e9, is folded into the Swanson business when they are unable to pay their overdue rent, allowing Swanson to make and sell more of their food products. With the investment money, the company is able to remove some of their debt to vendors. However, Marcus is very critical of the luxurious lifestyle of the owners, including driving a [[BMW]], owning a boat and renovating their house, despite their struggling business. Finally, Marcus becomes furious when he investigates the property documents and realises that the process for [[foreclosure]] began before Marcus arrived. Furious at their dishonesty, Marcus storms out of the deal.| LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 18 |EpisodeNumber2 = 12 |Title = Unique Salon & Spa |Aux1 = Long Island, NY|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|11|4|df=y}}|ShortSummary = A specialised hair salon owned by Carolyn, Unique has several store locations and her primary location has become neglected. A breakup with her former partner has left the business in turmoil, and to carry her through, Carolyn sells a range of beauty products in her store. The main revenue earner is their colour bar. However, they lack an inventory system, resulting in a loss of customers and significant losses in waste. Marcus invests $250,000 for 20% of the business, while also pushing Carolyn's Unique product label and claiming 51%. Marcus eliminates all brands from the store apart from Unique, which he repackages for better appearance. Using the names of Carolyn's children, they rename the brand \u201cErika Cole by Racquel\u201d. The salon is renovated and their ineffective general manager is removed, giving Carolyn a direct line to her store managers. With the store remodelled and the new inventory system put into place, Unique reopens and is very successful. | LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 19 |EpisodeNumber2 = 13|Title = West End Coffee Company|Aux1 = Greenville, SC |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|11|11|df=y}}|ShortSummary = West End Coffee is run by Rebecca and John, a divorced couple. The company roasts coffee and sells it wholesale, however they have very limited operating capacity. Marcus offers $200,000 for 51% of the business. While they initially agree, Marcus realises that their divorce has caused a stalemate in their relationships. Rebecca is fearful of John firing her from the company, but John invested his retirement fund, controlled by Rebecca, into the business. This accidental arrangement makes John feel like a hostage, and their bickering has caused a collapse in communication within the company. Marcus mediates the dispute and persuades Rebecca to relinquish her control of John's fund, and he sets the pair up to meet with a local restaurant for a partnership. Marcus returns a week later to find that the deal they made has stalled, and the two have returned to their argumentative past.

Having previously turned around his father's tool-turning business into the sports industry, Scott is struggling to modernise. His workshop is poorly designed with no flow and poor inventory tracking, and he is losing business. Marcus negotiates $630,000 for 30% of the business and 3% royalty. Marcus meets with MLB and discovers that Coopersburg Sports does not have the reach it claims it has, with the number of stadiums in which their products are sold diminishing.

He wishes to have a bigger cut in the business, but evades Marcus when offered the restaurant manager position. Instead, Ewell is fixated on marketing the restaurant and working through [[social media]], which Marcus does not believe is currently needed as the restaurant is already highly successful.

Marcus finds the showroom to be a chaotic collection of signs, which the team cleans up. When a nearby hotel visits to get their sign repaired, Marcus is disappointed when Anthony fails to take the opportunity to visit the hotel in person and defers it to the next day. Marcus also begins to see Anthony's aggressive and dominating attitude. Anthony makes arbitrary changes to designs made by his project manager, Josh, using fancier but less practical fonts. When Josh and Anthony visit the hotel, Anthony overrules Josh's expertise by claiming impossibly short delivery times, confusing the buyer. He also berates Marcus for being late, despite having no obligation to be present. Marcus is then contacted by a local business owner, who shares Anthony's negative reputation in town, having been sued over a disagreement regarding an improper sign. Marcus, not interested in getting involved, leaves the business.

Marcus identifies the kitchen to be the weak link in the process, and invests in new equipment to improve output, since the store is usually sold out of pies early in the day. He is also critical of Betty's reluctance to write down her recipes, which causes a bottleneck in the process, and her stubbornness in making their own ice cream. More importantly, he convinces Betty of the need to close down Elizabethan Desserts to cut losses and focus on the pie shop.

Marcus concludes that Sam and Alexa had no intention of doing business with him, and only applied for the show to get Max out and for publicity.|LineColor = e3cd81}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 44 |EpisodeNumber2 = 20 |Title= Farmgirl Flowers|Aux1 = San Francisco, CA|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2016|2|2|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Owned by Christina, Farmgirl Flowers is a growing [[e-commerce]] business focusing on delivering flower arrangements. Marcus is impressed with the business model, focusing on a single-choice daily flower arrangement, allowing the business to reduce costs and minimise waste. However, despite planning an expansion to nation-wide delivery, their logistics and online interface are not up to scratch. Christina is concerned that her competitors will beat her, and believes that her failure to raise capital is because of her gender. While reasonably confident in their growth, Marcus has reservations about how much value Christina thinks he brings to the business. Christina demands an investment of $1 million for 5% of the business, which leaves Marcus speechless. Marcus counters with $1 million for 25%. Christina is unwilling to go over 10%. Marcus does not agree to the deal, citing that the small stake gives him little personal interest in the business.\n\nMarcus then recaps and revisits his investment with The Simple Greek (formerly My Big Fat Greek Gyro, Season 2). The rebranded Greek fast-food restaurant has turned out to be successful and they are receiving numerous franchisee applications. However, all is not well, as owner Mike has not been actively contributing to the business and Marcus has not been receiving any return on his investment of $400,000 in re-launching the brand. Marcus has planned an expansion to Chicago and Mike's son Andreas is sent there to take charge. However, Marcus is severely disappointed that Mike was late to the grand opening, and challenges his integrity, offering to buy him out if he didn't care. On top of that, Marcus has had to hire an adviser to fill the role Mike did not take. Mike insists that he is willing to stay with the business in the long term. Marcus introduces [[Greek yogurt]] to the menu to increase profits throughout the day, and he helps Andreas and his parents see eye-to-eye.|LineColor = e3cd81}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 45 |EpisodeNumber2 = 21 |Title= Growing Pains at Mr. Green Tea|Aux1 = Keyport, NJ|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2016|2|9|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Marcus returns to Mr. Green Tea (Season 1). Their revenue has nearly doubled since their new production plant began. However, there are problems between owner Rich and his son and vice-president, Michael. Michael wishes to have equity in the business, but his cavalier attitude does not impress the conservative Rich. Marcus finds that Michael has introduced several new ice cream flavours, but has not done any market research. Marcus is particularly unimpressed with the [[black sesame]] flavour, as well as Michael's lack of understanding of the cost of his failures. Marcus tries to coach Michael into become a better leader. They go to a supermarket to get feedback on the new flavours, with [[fortune cookie]] and [[chai latte]] being popular, and black sesame receiving negative feedback. They also find that the prominent company name misleads people into thinking green tea was in every flavour. Marcus instructs Michael to change the package design, which leads to an argument. Eager to support Michael's development, Marcus brings the team to their cream supplier, where Michael is able to secure a lower cost per gallon for a larger order. Rich develops a new flavour based on spicy mango. They visit a Mexican restaurant that currently only sells their vanilla ice cream, but after overwhelmingly positive feedback, they accept the new flavour. Michael pulls through with the redesigned packaging. As a final challenge, Marcus arranges a meeting with frozen yogurt chain [[16 Handles]]. Although 16 Handles have never out-sourced one of their handles, Michael is able to successfully pitch their product and impress them with their flavours. Through this, Michael is able to prove that he is a valuable part of the business.|LineColor = e3cd81}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 46 |EpisodeNumber2 = 22 |Title= Progress Report #4|Aux1= |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2016|2|16|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Amazing Grapes (Season 2) has increased its revenue, but is not running at capacity and could pull in more profit. Marcus identifies the small kitchen to be an issue, and plans a $75,000 expansion to improve speed and quality. He is disappointed to find that beer and online sales have been poor, and both are the responsibility of beer seller Matt. The staff confide with Marcus that Matt has proven to be lazy, having only put 20% of the inventory online and having no knowledge of the margins and inventory of beer in store. Marcus tasks Matt to give him the numbers, but Matt's apathetic attitude prompts the staff to fire Matt.\n\nReturning to Shuler's Bar-B-Que (Season 2), Marcus is impressed with the banquet hall expansion and general store. However, he is also surprised and disappointed that Norton and Lynn have not sought advice from Marcus in setting up the general store, resulting in a disastrously large and eclectic assortment of products, including flamingo decorations and assorted clothing. While Marcus berates the owners for their lack of experience in managing a general store, he sees the banquet hall as a good investment. Before the general store opens, Marcus helps in rearranging the layout to promote more of Shuler's products.\n\nMarcus finds Grafton Furniture (Season 3) to be doing well despite the passing of the family patriarch, Esteban. Steve has opened a caf\u00e9 for the workers in memory of Esteban. The factory is working efficiently and the design room is generating a high level of revenue.\n\nAt SJC Drums (Season 3), owner Mike has been successfully selling drum kits on tour and secured contracts. The workshop has expanded, including a CNC machine that can produce a drum shell in 9 minutes. However, the relationship between brothers Mike and Scott has not healed. Marcus counsels Mike and praises his efforts, assuring him that he has done all that he can. Marcus then meets the SJC team at the [[NAMM Show]], exactly a year since they first met. He is happy to see the business finding new lucrative contracts, and ends on a positive note about owners Chris and Mike. |LineColor = e3cd81}}\n|}\n\n===Season 4, part 1===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\"\n\n! style=\"background:#D772CB; color:#000;\" width=\"7%\" | No.\noverall\n! style=\"background:#D772CB; color:#000;\" width=\"7%\" | No. in\nseries\n! style=\"background:#D772CB; color:#000;\" width=\"40%\" |Business\n! style=\"background:#D772CB; color:#000;\" width=\"20%\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#D772CB; color:#000;\" width=\"15%\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 47|EpisodeNumber2 = 1|Title = Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour Restaurants|Aux1 = Southern CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|8|23|df=y}}|ShortSummary = [[Farrell's Ice Cream Parlour]] is an iconic family-run restaurant chain started in 1963. With originally over a hundred stores, Farrell's eventually closed every location until it was bought by current owners Mike and Paul in 2009. Marcus finds that the current restaurants are merely an imitation of the old Farrell's experience, with uninspired food, loud celebrations, outsourced ice cream and the lack of a unique candy store experience. Marcus takes the team to [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], where he shows them positive food service practices and colourful candy store displays, though this is met with some resistance.\n\nMarcus begins to make major changes to the restaurant. He sources a company to begin producing Farrell's original ice cream. He revitalises the candy front by moving manager Sandy (who is also the HR manager) out and assigning merchandise manager Shauna to the role, renovating the restaurant and addressing Mike's negative leadership style. Progress is stalled by a miscalculation, with the owners needing another $200,000 to keep one of their locations open. Regional manager Travis is called in, and he advises that due to rising costs, the location should be closed. Marcus is impressed by his decisiveness and honesty, and decides to give him an equity share in the company and he is assigned to be the general manager of all locations while Mike is in charge of marketing.\n\nAfter a last-minute rush, the restaurant is relaunched. Shauna has greatly revamped the candy store, the kitchen is operating efficiently and Marcus is pleased with everyone in their clearly defined roles.\n\nAs of June 2019, the store is now closed.<ref>https://www.vcstar.com/story/money/business/2019/06/13/worlds-last-farrells-ice-cream-parlour-closes/1438921001</ref>\n\n|LineColor = D772CB}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 48|EpisodeNumber2 = 2|Title = DiLascia|Aux1 = Los Angeles, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|8|30|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Run by Patrick, DiLascia specialises in screen-printed t-shirts and supported by siblings Dan and Kelly. DiLascia has had some initial success, including a partnership with [[TMZ]] and several retail outlets. However, one of their retailers went out of business, causing a loss of a third of their revenue. With the majority of the printing screens unused and with over $200,000 in negative equity, the company is effectively insolvent. Marcus offers a deal on the condition that Dan and Kelly eventually each get 10% of company.\n\nMarcus soon discovers that the business has no process for product design and has no records of sales. He introduces Patrick to creative studio Two Arrows to focus on his design ideas and to expand his women's line, while also convincing him to close down the unprofitable retail store. Marcus takes Patrick to a Courage.b store (Season 2) in Connecticut to do focus group surveys, but he struggles to handle feedback. Despite his nerves, he delivers a convincing sales pitch to [[Bloomingdale's]] and is given the opportunity to do a trunk sale. The plan goes awry when a box of printed shirts is lost in transit, and Marcus is disappointed in Patrick's tendency to hide from problems. Nonetheless, the trunk sale is very popular and Marcus is satisfied with his investment in Patrick.\n|LineColor = D772CB}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 49|EpisodeNumber2 = 3|Title = The Soup Market|Aux1 = Milwaukee, WI |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|6|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Dave wishes to turn his soup diner into a national franchise. However, the sudden passing of his business partner has left him managing the business alone. Marcus expresses some concern at the uninspired design for his locations, the lack of lighter healthier options, and Dave's lack of knowledge regarding his profits. There is also a disturbing mystery and avoidance over Dave's former best friend, Grace.\n\nAfter shaking on the deal, Marcus gets Dave's soups tested for nutritional value, bringing up very high levels of fat and sodium, which Dave refuses to alter. Marcus brings in Dean from Precise Graphix (Season 3) to redesign the interior, but Dave continues to resist change and criticises Marcus's chain, The Simple Greek (Season 2), for being too plain. During the redesign, Grace appears, surprising Marcus with her role as co-director of operations. Marcus discovers that Grace has been asked to be invisible due to a perceived affair with Dave. Marcus confronts Dave about his lack of honesty, and Dave admits that his previous feelings for Grace have caused her to suffer due to his mishandling of his personal life.\n\nThe renovated restaurant launches a grand opening with new healthier recipes from Dave, resulting in very good reception. However, despite organising the event, Grace was excluded from the opening. Marcus, Grace and Dave have a frank talk about the situation, and Dave promises to make positive changes. Weeks later, Grace calls Marcus and informs him that Dave fired her for insubordination and called the police to remove her from the premises. Grace also reveals that she had filed for a sexual harassment claim prior to being terminated. Marcus returns to The Soup Market to find that Dave has reversed all of the changes.

However, the business has gone off track in response to retailer demand, creating expensive watches and losing the branding and focus on charity. The company also lacks a creative process, with their designs and packaging being uninspired and rushed.\n\nMarcus helps the owners get back on track. Consultation with branding experts reveal the trap of adopting too many stereotypical lifestyle motifs. He convinces co-founder Trevor to invest his mother's charitable history back into the company's branding. To address retailers' concerns over selling an inexpensive watch, Marcus creates a silent salesman display, but co-owner Travis rushes the job and creates a plain shelf.

Marcus witnesses the team in action at a corporate function, and is impressed with the quality of the food, but finds the presentation lacklustre. Marcus also finds that Tad can be an aggressive micromanager. The business is in a bad situation due to its focus on catering for the film industry, resulting in unstable seasonal business. Marcus addresses Tad's management style after his employees become aggravated during a buffet luncheon, telling him to delegate and let them learn to solve problems on their own.\n\nMarcus decides to expand into the [[food truck]] industry to have more predictable revenue. When Tad arrives with the truck, the employees reveal that they are on the verge of a mutiny due to Tad's lack of communication. Marcus allows them to air their concerns and explains that the food trucks will benefit them on top of their hourly wage, and manages to buy a second food truck for the business. However, an inspection of Tad's food truck reveals numerous needed repairs, and Marcus confronts Tad over his oversight. Tad snaps and swears at Marcus, but Marcus soothes Tad's anxiety and explains that this is how his employees feel about him.\n\nMarcus arranges Honest Foods to cater for the 50th anniversary of his company, [[Camping World]] and Good Sam.

Although Marcus likes the idea of all-natural cleaning products, he is confused by their range of non-related products, high price point and labelling that looks like a royal product. The company financials are also showing heavy losses, which Max seems to be in denial over. Max asks for 1 million dollars to launch a new product line, but Marcus rebuffs this proposal. Marcus settles on $250,000 for 30% ownership of Murchison-Hume, and a 70% stake in their Best in Show brand.\n\nMarcus encounters problems with Max. In seeing her product on shelves, he discovers that Max had made prior arrangements for product to be spotlighted for Marcus's visit, presenting a fa\u00e7ade that she was doing much better than she actually was. In redesigning the packaging, Max walks out, refusing to change the name and label. Later, during a visit to Marcus's pet store chain. Bentley's (Season 3), Max tries to re-negotiate on the deal, proposing that Marcus only gets 15% of the ownership and earns his way up. This infuriates Marcus, and he leaves to allow Max to discuss the original offer with her husband.\n\nMarcus's return to the company office reveals that Max has pushed ahead with turning the office into an unfeasible mini-distribution centre. Max agrees to the original terms of the deal. However, upon moving all of their inventory to the warehouse, Marcus discovers that instead of $280,000 of inventory, they only have $50,000. Marcus is furious that Max does not see this as a big deal, and frustrated with her flippant attitude, he walks out on the deal.\n|LineColor = D772CB}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 53|EpisodeNumber2 = 7|Title = Pacific Hospitality|Aux1 = Los Angeles, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|10|4|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Based in California, Pacific Hospitality creates furniture for the commercial market, with contracts to major companies such as [[The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf|The Coffee Bean]], [[MGM]] and [[Caesars Palace]]. The company has a similar history to Marcus's previous investment, Grafton Furniture (Season 3). Both were successful immigrant family businesses which had problems with profit margins and manufacturing processes. On the back of Grafton's successful transformation and impressed with the owner's daughter, Ana, Marcus proposes an unusual deal: that Pacific Hospitality be co-owned by Marcus and Grafton.\n\nMarcus identifies that the companies and personnel complement each other, as Grafton specialises in residential furniture and Pacific deals with hospitality and retail. Marcus hopes that Pacific can manufacture Grafton products and service the West Coast, which Grafton has struggled in. The Pacific Hospitality warehouse is emptied and redesigned to implement a production line, with Ana impressing Marcus with her own floor plan design.\n\nMarcus tasks Ana and Grafton owner and designer Steve to do a pitch for a furniture package for The Simple Greek franchisees (Season 2). Steve is offended when Marcus delegates the design role to Ana and decides to make a competing design. Marcus is correct with his prediction: Steve's design is good, but not practical or attractive for a restaurant franchise, while Ana's creative process tries to blend in with the concept. Steve, accustomed to being told what to make, has difficulty accepting feedback.\n\nLater, Marcus decides to merge the two companies into one. Steve balks at being removed from design, but Marcus explains that Steve's superior management skills and Ana's design talents would benefit the overall health of the company. Steve throws his support behind Ana, and Marcus assigns Ana to be his chief designer for all his businesses.

Marcus notes the barren, minimalist design\u2014the lack of food and accessories, and even the franchise name\u2014implies that it is purely a take-out store. The company is insolvent with a million-dollar debt, with Jeff investing poorly in building and selling corporate stores and franchisees being poorly supported. Marcus also notes that Jeff has no passion or interest in tea.\n\nIn moving forward, Marcus rebrands the concept as \u201cThe American Tea & Spice Shop\u201d. He erases the payables owed to the tea distributor by offering him equity in the company. While he organises the prototype build, Marcus deals with Taylor's immaturity and his rocky relationship with Jeff. Jeff effectively disowns Taylor despite Marcus's efforts at mediation. Problems also arise when Jeff continues to try to sell the old Tea2Go franchise, despite not being aware of franchise law and essentially competing with Marcus to maintain a separate entity. Marcus sees this is a blessing in disguise, as he can now start up a new holding company and the franchisees can decide where to go.\n\nThe prototype American Tea & Spice Shop is successfully opened.

Because of Howard's impulsive buys, the store has accumulated too much useless inventory and has an overwhelming about of debt.\n\nMarcus's first order is to liquidate everything in the store, raising over $300,000 in cash and clearing the space to do a complete renovation. Marcus and Robyn work together to decide which departments to feature in the store, but Howard opposes Robyn's ideas. Marcus warns Robyn to stop Howard from being the dominant voice in order to save the business. Howard continues to frustrate Marcus with his absences, and the relationships becomes tense when Howard continuously sends threatening emails to Marcus. Marcus discovers that Howard has been very anxious over the lack of funds, and Robyn reveals that she has been hiding money from Howard to protect him from himself.\n\nDespite Howard taking a vacation during the reopening, he comes on board and together the team successfully launch the grand opening of a much cleaner, more organised store.\n|LineColor = D772CB}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 56|EpisodeNumber2 = 10|Title = Los Gemelos|Aux1 = Port Chester, NY|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|22|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Started as an authentic Mexican restaurant by Adelo, Los Gemelos expanded into producing [[tortilla]]s.

Referred by [[George Lopez]], Marcus takes an interest in the tortilla factory, but is shocked to find that Adelo's operations are not compliant with food and occupational safety codes.\n\nMarcus decides on a different deal than what he normally proposes. He instructs Adelo to close the factory instead of investing in it, and instead he proposes a new Hispanic food company using Marcus's business skills, Adelo's knowledge of authentic Mexican food, and George's image and marketing. Adelo has some initial problems with understanding the need for detailed market research, including an assumption that Mission Foods would be a better distributor, which Marcus rebuffed. He also did not mention his factory's eviction and loss of his equipment. Despite this, Adelo impresses Marcus and George with his salsa recipes and the new \u201cTa Loco\u201d brand, taking George's catch phrase.\n\nMarcus arranges a sales pitch with [[Sam's Club]], fulfilling Adelo's dream of making it into a large retailer.

Marcus notes Susana's shaky confidence and causes: her father Mario is pressuring her to divide her stock between her brothers, who currently work in the factory owned by Mario. Anna is also using her leverage in demanding 50/50 ownership or a higher wage than Susana.\n\nMarcus addresses the problem of having too much inventory, low cashflow and excessive collection. He proposes several shipping options with different price points to stabilise cash flow. However, Anna snaps and has a breakdown, citing a lack of respect and Susana doesn't step up to her. Marcus brings in Stephanie from Courage.b (Season 2), now in charge of Marcus's fashion businesses, to help with building a core collection. Marcus holds a liquidation sale for the dead inventory.

Marcus meets with the owners, observes the business operations and investigates their financial records. Marcus will then evaluate the company and make an offer to buy a stake in the business over a [[Gentleman's agreement|handshake.]] Marcus will then assume 100% control to fix the business and make it profitable.

Their profits on their cars are too low to cover overhead expenses, their revenue is cut through the use of wholesalers, and Andrew feels restricted by Jon. Marcus offers $200,000 for a third of the business, as well as licensing rights to launch the company to a national brand. Marcus makes changes to the process, getting Jon to appraise the car with the seller in person, and forces him to eliminate the middle-men in the deals to improve profits. Meanwhile, he addresses the tension between Jon and Andrew by giving Andrew the opportunity to create an advertisement without Jon's interference. Marcus invests over $300,000 to remodel the business to give it a new uniform look. Jon pulls through with firmer prices with sellers and making more profit through selling direct to dealers. Andrew impresses Jon with his marketing work. The brothers repair their rift, and the business takes off in the following months, opening stores in several states and attracting new licensees.|LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2|EpisodeNumber2 = 2|Title = Jacob Maarse Florists|Aux1 = Pasadena, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|6|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Started by his father, Hank's floral shop has lost money ever since he took over, and is now a disorganised shopfront with inefficient delivery, underpriced flowers, no inventory system and selling a variety of gifts. Marcus offers $100,000 for 25% of the business. Over the week, Marcus invests over $150,000 in renovating the neglected shop and upgrading their delivery vehicles. Marcus also demotes Marina, the general manager. Marcus organises a grand re-opening with the new shop layout, resulting in improved profits and morale, and Marina shines in her new role as retail manager. However, Hank reneges on the deal, claiming that Marcus had not invested anything into the business despite his visible efforts. Furious at Hank's ignorance and childish attitude, Marcus leaves on a note that he fully intends on getting his money back. |LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3|EpisodeNumber2 = 3|Title = Planet Popcorn|Aux1 = Southern California, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|13|df=y}}|ShortSummary = With a lucrative contract with [[Disney]], Sharla's company, Planet Popcorn, works several mobile locations at fairs but is unable to turn a profit. Marcus arrives at the company office to find it in disarray. As a cash-only business, the company has no system in place to track the money in the tills, no security at their stores, and piles of money are literally strewn over the floor. Marcus tentatively offers $200,000 for 50% of the business and full financial control. He plans to set up a retail location near a shopping mall, but Sharla pushes for a more remote location. She reveals that she is looking to expand into [[crepe]]s rather than popcorn, which infuriates Marcus. Sharla is also uncooperative when redesigning the package, and tries to go behind Marcus's back to purchase a [[domain name]] owned by Marcus for the business. The deal goes sour when Marcus uncovers over $300,000 unaccounted for in the financial records. Sharla attempts to block Marcus from discussing the finances without her, but Sharla is incapable of understanding the figures. Marcus brings in a [[forensic accountant]], who actually discovers that nearly twice as much money has gone missing from the company. Sharla does not seem alarmed, which causes Marcus to grow concerned and back out of the deal.|LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4|EpisodeNumber2 = 4|Title = Eco-Me|Aux1 = Pomona, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|20|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Eco-Me focuses on all-natural cleaning products as an alternative to the artificial chemicals used in most products. Marcus shows some interest in developing the brand further and offers $500,000 for 20% of the business. Marcus is not impressed with the marketing and sales pitch, and the brand fails to attract interest from vendors and [[focus group]]s. Criticism is aimed at the misleading \"all natural\" claim and ambiguous product purpose\u2014the products are named after generic people (\"Dave\") and are sold as \"general purpose cleaners\", although they are in fact not appropriate for all purposes. Marcus is disappointed in the long-distance sales manager, who is very passive in making deals, forcing Marcus to sell the product to a hotel chain by cleaning toilets himself. The owner is also very stubborn in changing the name and package design. They manage to compromise with Marcus, and successfully market their product to a vendor. |LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5|EpisodeNumber2 = 5|Title = LA Dogworks|Aux1= Orange County, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|8|27|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Andrew runs LA Dogworks, a facility for dog owners to receive full service, including boarding, grooming and training. However, Andrew has a very poor understanding of running a business and the kennels have very low occupancy, resulting in very low monthly profits. Marcus tentatively offers $1 million for 50% of the business and full operational control and begins the process of developing private-label products for LA Dogworks. However, his main concern is Andrew's management style. Andrew is highly critical of customers and their needs, responding aggressively to online complaints. He has an even worse regard for his employees, being abusive and regards their complaints as incompetency. In particular, he showed no compassion when one of his employees was bitten, and placed the blame squarely on him. Initially the employees are hopeful of change with Marcus's arrival, but as Andrew's dictatorial demeanor worsens, they begin to leave. Marcus makes little headway after bringing in a psychologist to assess Andrew's interactions in the workplace, revealing that he is a sociopath. A final confrontation between Andrew, his manager and Marcus leaves Marcus in silent anger, and Andrew storms out.|LineColor = e38181}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6|EpisodeNumber2 = 6|Title = [[Mr. Green Tea Ice Cream Company|Mr. Green Tea]]|Aux1 = Keyport, NJ|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|9|3|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Started as a rival line to [[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]], Mr. Green Tea sells [[green tea]], [[ginger]] and [[adzuki bean|red bean]]-flavor [[ice cream]] to the restaurant business. Unlike previous businesses on the show, Mr. Green Tea is not a failing business, but has reached stagnation. Production is limited by using a co-packer rather than manufacturing their own ice cream, and owner Rich is very conservative in business decisions compared to his son Michael. Michael wishes to invest in a larger facility and estimates a $600,000 cost to get it running. Marcus offers $600,000 for 35% of the business. They acquire the new property and begin working on new product lines for [[gelato]] and [[mochi]]. However, Rich finds the pace of the change to be too quick and struggles to be decisive. Michael also makes reckless mistakes, purchasing a promotional car without approval and severely underestimating the cost of building out the new warehouse. Despite this, Marcus continues his investment. A month later, they clear out the warehouse and project good growth in the coming years.\n\nMarcus then briefly recalls Maarse Florists (Episode 2) to reveal that after the fallout with the owner, he had been repaid by the owner's mother.|LineColor = e38181}}\n|}\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{| style=\"width:98%; margin:auto; background:#fff;\" class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"7%\" | No.\noverall\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"7%\" | No. in\nseries\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"40%\" | Business\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"20%\" | Location\n! style=\"background:#e2a482; color:#000;\" width=\"15%\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7|EpisodeNumber2 = 1|Title = Athans Motors|Aux1 = Morton Grove, IL|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|2|25|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Opened by Pete Athans, Athans Motors is an unsuccessful car sales company with millions in debt, no inventory, no sales and losing over $150,000 a month. Marcus inspects the business and finds that Pete has wasted millions in creating a lounge for visitors to watch movies and play games instead of purchasing cars, of which he only has 20. Furthermore, all the cars are expensive luxury vehicles rather than affordable used cars for the market, forcing general manager Tony to turn away prospective buyers. Having made his fortune in the [[automotive industry]], Marcus offers $3.5 million for 50% of the company. He liquidates all the cars that cannot be sold as well as the lounge amenities to have capital to double their current inventory. He also plans to remodel the site to use the floor space to sell car products and rename the business for a grand opening. Pete, however, is resistant to the change despite his inexperience. His [[micromanagement]] frustrates Tony, who resigns. Pete also attempts to walk out of the deal after his business is re-branded to AutoMatch USA, but Marcus soothes his shock and he commits to the re-launch. The grand opening is hindered by heavy snow, but Pete and Marcus successfully host the opening to a busy crowd. |LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 8|EpisodeNumber2 = 2|Title = A. Stein Meat Products|Aux1 = Brooklyn, NY|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|4|df=y}}|ShortSummary = A 75-year-old business run by Alan and Howard, Stein Meats is a $50,000,000 business selling meats to retailers and restaurants. Although they sell a lot of products, including their Brooklyn Burger brand, they are millions in debt due to not following up on receivables owed to them. Marcus invests $1 million for 50% of the company, and begins the process of chasing up buyers for money owed. However, he is disappointed that the owners and Frank, the general manager, are passive in chasing up receivables, which is what led to them going into debt. Furthermore, the office manager, Donna, is frustrated that Frank does not understand the process to acquire approval for purchases, and threatens to quit. Marcus audits the financials, and is alarmed to find that the business's figures have been under-reported and they owe nearly six times more money than Marcus believed, plus they are two weeks away from [[bankruptcy]] and are unable to make the payroll. Marcus backs out of the $1 million deal, but agrees to support the business by investing $200,000 to provide working capital in return for the Brooklyn Burger brand.\n\nMarcus then recaps his investment with 1 800 Car Cash (Season 1 Episode 1). The business is turning a healthy profit, has opened a second store location with three more planned. Marcus has then turned the business into a nation-wide model with stores across the country. |LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9|EpisodeNumber2 = 3|Title = Michael Sena's Pro-Fit|Aux1 = Dyer, IN|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|11|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Michael Sena, a pioneering personal trainer and author, owns his own training center with his wife, Tina. Pro-Fit offers a highly specialised group training facility, but sees very little activity throughout most of the day. While Marcus is impressed with their passion and training, he sees that expanding the training to incorporate other disciplines, such as [[yoga]] and [[pilates]], would sustain the business, which Michael is not in favor of. Marcus offers $50,000 individually to Tina to market a new line of [[protein bar]]s in return for 50% of the product. Marcus offers $250,000 to Michael for 75% of the gym business, on the condition that they search for a larger site and diversify their services. Marcus connects Tina with a commercial kitchen to produce bite-sized protein bars. However, Michael takes issue with being left out of the process, and fails to get out of his 3-year lease, causing Marcus to walk out of the deal. Humbled by his failure, Michael acts on his own to re-brand the company as \"Tina and Michael's Pro-Fit\" to make up with his wife. Impressed with this change of character, Marcus offers a smaller investment to get the current site profitable. While Michael disappoints Marcus by changing the floor plan without approval, the business re-opens and takes off with more clients and Tina's protein bites are positively received in trials.|LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 10|EpisodeNumber2 = 4|Title = Worldwide Trailers|Aux1 = Tampa, FL|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|18|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Owned by Tom and Nancy, Worldwide Trailers manufactures concession trailers, mostly to [[food truck]] operators. Marcus is very impressed with the product, but is shocked by the inefficiency. He learns that the trailers are put together in their plant in Georgia, and then sent to Tampa for finishing and sales. A visit to the Georgia site reveals a committed team who are capable of complete the trailers on site, but there is a lack of organisation. Marcus offers $700,000 for 50% of the business. He focuses on moving the business to the Georgia location to cut expenses. He brings in a team to evaluate their inventory, and with everything literally lying around outside and no one responsible, they declare the site to have the worst inventory they have ever seen. The operation is complicated by Nancy's refusal to move from Tampa. The deal falls apart when Nancy and Tim are unable to get over their marital breakup and have an argument in front of Marcus and the employees, forcing Marcus to turn away.|LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 11|EpisodeNumber2 = 5|Title = Skullduggery|Aux1= Anaheim, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|3|25|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Originally started as a fossil replica company, Skullduggery is now owned by brothers Steven and Peter and produces traditional toys. The company is running at a loss, and Marcus offers to invest $1.1 million to pay off the debt, plus another $1 million for working capital, for 50% of the business. Steven and Peter walk out on Marcus and afterwards demand that he only get 30%. Marcus agrees on the condition that he receives full financial control. Disappointed that the company does not do any [[market research]] for their products, Marcus organises a [[focus group]] with kids and parents. The MaxTrax light-up cars are a favourite, while the AeroFlix is confusing, despite being a significant investment. The parents report that they believe the products are not unique enough to draw attention, which Steven takes very poorly. Marcus clears out their useless inventory to gain some funds, which the owners protest again, and they are also reluctant to invest in making more efficient molds in the factory. Marcus invests in developing a creative lab and purchases a [[3D printing|3D printer]]. However, his meeting with [[NASCAR]] turns sour when Steven and Peter outright refuse to work with them. After development on the NASCAR product stalls, Steven, Peter and their father try to re-negotiate the deal, taking issue with Marcus controlling the financials. With the deal points no longer agreed on, Marcus cuts his losses and leaves. |LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 12|EpisodeNumber2 = 6|Title = Sweet Pete's|Aux1 = Jacksonville, FL|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|4|1|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Run by eccentric candymaker Peter and wife Alison, Sweet Pete's is a popular candy store that offers classes for children to learn to make candy. The business is crippled by their location, a residential area with a domestic kitchen. Despite this, their passion keeps them working around the clock to fulfill a bulk order, with Marcus coming in to lend a hand. Their expansion opportunities are ruled out by their business partner Dane, who provided them with the property and invested $2000 in cash. Despite Peter's demands, Dane refuses to sell his part of the company and Peter and Alison are living off $10,000 a year from their share. Marcus offers $750,000 for 50% of the business. Dane refuses to relinquish his shares despite Marcus's offer to return his $2000 investment plus interest. Marcus helps Peter set up an online service, rents a commercial kitchen space, hires more staff and scouts for a new prime location. Dane tries to negotiate a new deal, feeling that he is not being valued for his contribution, and demands $150,000 for his shares. Insulted by the inflated figure, Marcus reads through the shareholder agreement, and Peter is confronted with the option of abandoning the name and recipes to start fresh. Instead, Marcus uncovers a clause which determines [[stock dilution]]. He confronts Dane and tells him that Peter and Alison will be loaned money to invest into the business, which will dilute Dane's shares unless he matches the investment. Unable to match this proposition, Dane leaves the business, paving the way for Peter and Alison to expand their Sweet Pete's brand. With the new store being built, Marcus gives them a mobile candy store.\n\nSweet Pete's would go on to meet huge success and be featured several times in later episodes. |LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 13 |EpisodeNumber2 = 7|Title = Amazing Grapes|Aux1 = Orange County, CA|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|4|8|df=y}}|ShortSummary = In a classic case of [[absentee business owner|absent owners]], Amazing Grapes is mostly run by the staff and focuses on selling [[wine]] and [[beer]]. However, their most profitable aspect, the bar and restaurant, is poorly sited in the building and has minimal floor space for their margins, while the space is filled with inventory that cannot be sold. The staff are very knowledgeable and experienced, but are overruled by the owners when they do turn up to manage. Marcus offers $300,000 for 51% of the business, with 25% going to the staff. Marcus remodels the store to give more floor space to the bar and restaurant, moving the display shelves to illuminated sides. Although met with initial resistance, Marcus is pleased at the relaunch. | LineColor = e2a482}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 14 |EpisodeNumber2 = 8|Title = Key West Key Lime Pie Co.|Aux1 = Key West, FL|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|4|15|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Owned by Jim and Alison, the Key West Key Lime Co. is riding on the success of being the \"Nation's Best Pie\", with high revenue for their product. However, they are not turning a profit. Marcus finds that they have two locations: their main store and a shipping office, which is losing money. He is also disappointed to find that their signature pies use pre-made crusts and powdered ingredients to speed up the process. Marcus invests $450,000 for 51% of the business, on the condition that they do not sell what they do not make, and that development is focused on creating a proprietary pie. Marcus closes down the unprofitable shipping office and clears out all non-company items in the store, much to Jim's ire. Jim is even more resistant to changing the recipe after Marcus hires three pastry chefs to create new recipes. The staff reveal that Jim's original crust was the best, which Marcus is surprised to hear after Jim's reliance on pre-made crusts. Jim perfects the recipe and the shop is renovated to more prominently display the pies and the baking process. Marcus rewards manager Tami, who is pregnant and working two jobs, by giving her a pay rise and maternal pay.

Marcus invests $800,000 for 30% of the business. Marcus has to throw out their useless inventory, a result of Noemi's unsuccessful ideas.

Marcus sets up a new DIY printing station and renames the establishment \"Queen's Vibe\". He discovers that the sales manager Nick has made minimal effort to market their services, having only put in ads in the [[Yellow Pages]] and not having contracts with any major businesses. Marcus tests Nick's sales pitch by taking him out to the local fire station, where Nick is unable to deliver a clear pitch. Marcus takes over and they secure a deal. As a result, Marcus changes Nick's payment from a salary to a 100% commission plan, which Nick accepts.

Marcus reorganises the store to display high-margin fish more prominently and focuses on the prepared foods. The building's co-tenant, a caf\u00e9, is folded into the Swanson business when they are unable to pay their overdue rent, allowing Swanson to make and sell more of their food products. With the investment money, the company is able to remove some of their debt to vendors.

Marcus finds the showroom to be a chaotic collection of signs, which the team cleans up. When a nearby hotel visits to get their sign repaired, Marcus is disappointed when Anthony fails to take the opportunity to visit the hotel in person and defers it to the next day. Marcus also begins to see Anthony's aggressive and dominating attitude. Anthony makes arbitrary changes to designs made by his project manager, Josh, using fancier but less practical fonts. When Josh and Anthony visit the hotel, Anthony overrules Josh's expertise by claiming impossibly short delivery times, confusing the buyer. He also berates Marcus for being late, despite having no obligation to be present. Marcus is then contacted by a local business owner, who shares Anthony's negative reputation in town, having been sued over a disagreement regarding an improper sign. Marcus, not interested in getting involved, leaves the business.

Not only has J relied on his family to providing funding without investing a single dollar himself, J continues to maintain an expensive lifestyle.

Marcus identifies the kitchen to be the weak link in the process, and invests in new equipment to improve output, since the store is usually sold out of pies early in the day. He is also critical of Betty's reluctance to write down her recipes, which causes a bottleneck in the process, and her stubbornness in making their own ice cream. More importantly, he convinces Betty of the need to close down Elizabethan Desserts to cut losses and focus on the pie shop.

While Samantha is receptive of Marcus's suggestions, Mark has difficult accepting criticism. Mark clings onto the idea of each candle having a story, but a visit to the local candle shop reveals the reality that customers pick only by look and smell. Furthermore, Mark has a tendency to hold grudges, refusing to work with a candle manufacturer due to an error made years ago. Mark is persuaded to work with the manufacturer, and Marcus provides creative input into the box design. Mark reveals that his mistrust stems from a broken family.

The longboards have very high quality and finish, and the workers are highly skilled, leading Marcus to offer $300,000 for 40% of the business, on the condition that the key staff also gain a small percentage of his shares. Marcus learns that Mike has been making the product for a non-existent market\u2014Mike avoids the competition by making boards for the 30-50 age group, pricing the boards at $329 based on the cost of manufacturing rather than the market. Marcus takes Mike to visit [[Rob Dyrdek]], who is impressed by the board but also baffled by Mike's target audience. Marcus urges Mike to design shortboards more appropriate for the younger market. When Marcus returns, he is shocked to find that staff have been leaving. Mike wishes to renegotiate the staff's share of the deal, which Marcus rebukes by claiming more for himself. Mike's arrogance and continual loss of employees leads Marcus to back out of the deal. |LineColor = e3cd81}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 41 |EpisodeNumber2 = 17 |Title= Vision Quest |Aux1 = Ronkonkoma, NY |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|1|5|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Vision Quest is a company specialising in [[lighting]] and owned by Larry. The business stands out in that it designs and manufactures their lighting products. Marcus offers $375,000 for 50% of the business. While he is impressed with the product, the company has been poorly managed due to a lack of structure. Furthermore, Larry has been hoarding failed projects, artificially inflating the value of the company. Larry has an opportunity to prove himself by producing custom lighting for a local hospital. However, he embarrasses himself and an associate company when a mistake in the inventory forces him to delay the product. Larry gets a second chance to prove himself when Marcus invites him to a new Sweet Pete's store in need of new lighting before their grand opening. Larry completes the design and installation only a minute before the opening.

Marcus arrives at their location to find that the business is pulling in some revenue as a wholesaler, but are losing money as a retailer. Additionally, CEO Dan has a dominating presence in the business, with his spending on developing unpopular items left unchecked. Marcus offers $750,000 for 51% of the business. He sets to work on closing down their unsuccessful retail front and moves them to one of his offices in the heart of the art and fashion district. He then sets a clear design template of focusing on five different kinds of shoes with designs based on four global regions. Dan, however, is too unfocused and tries too hard to impress Marcus instead of following instructions, investing too much time and money into purchasing excessive materials and ordering numerous shoes.

However, their production is seriously hampered due to an ambiguous arrangement with Alexa's father, Max, whose condiment-manufacturing business takes up 90% of the floor space and contaminates the marshmallows with spices. Marcus offers $100,000 for 46% of the company, with 10% going to dedicated accountant Dede and the remainder going to Alexa and Sam, on the condition that they talk with Max about moving out. Marcus brings Sam and Alexa out to a farmer's market to determine their most popular flavours, and discover that Alexa's best-selling [[salted caramel]] is particularly underwhelming. Marcus brings in Pete Beringer (Sweet Pete's, Season 2) to consult, but Sam and Alexa are outwardly hostile to working with Pete. Back at the warehouse, a water pipe bursts, causing flooding, and Sam and Alexa have not spoken to Max about moving. Feeling that he is being used to mediate the discussion, Marcus gets Max to agree to move out. Marcus returns weeks later to find that Max has moved into a cheaper and larger facility and is happy with the new space. However, he meets with Dede to find that she has been ousted from the company. She confesses that Sam and Alexa used her cancer survival story to gain leverage with Marcus to get the deal. Marcus confronts the two owners. Sam shows an aggressive streak, having demanded that Dede contribute financially despite there being no condition requiring her to do so. Marcus concludes that Sam and Alexa had no intention of doing business with him, and only applied for the show to get Max out and for publicity.|LineColor = e3cd81}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 44 |EpisodeNumber2 = 20 |Title= Farmgirl Flowers|Aux1 = San Francisco, CA|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2016|2|2|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Owned by Christina, Farmgirl Flowers is a growing [[e-commerce]] business focusing on delivering flower arrangements. Marcus is impressed with the business model, focusing on a single-choice daily flower arrangement, allowing the business to reduce costs and minimise waste. However, despite planning an expansion to nation-wide delivery, their logistics and online interface are not up to scratch. Christina is concerned that her competitors will beat her, and believes that her failure to raise capital is because of her gender. While reasonably confident in their growth, Marcus has reservations about how much value Christina thinks he brings to the business. Christina demands an investment of $1 million for 5% of the business, which leaves Marcus speechless. Marcus counters with $1 million for 25%. Christina is unwilling to go over 10%. Marcus does not agree to the deal, citing that the small stake gives him little personal interest in the business.\n\nMarcus then recaps and revisits his investment with The Simple Greek (formerly My Big Fat Greek Gyro, Season 2). The rebranded Greek fast-food restaurant has turned out to be successful and they are receiving numerous franchisee applications. However, all is not well, as owner Mike has not been actively contributing to the business and Marcus has not been receiving any return on his investment of $400,000 in re-launching the brand. Marcus has planned an expansion to Chicago and Mike's son Andreas is sent there to take charge. However, Marcus is severely disappointed that Mike was late to the grand opening, and challenges his integrity, offering to buy him out if he didn't care. On top of that, Marcus has had to hire an adviser to fill the role Mike did not take. Mike insists that he is willing to stay with the business in the long term. Marcus introduces [[Greek yogurt]] to the menu to increase profits throughout the day, and he helps Andreas and his parents see eye-to-eye.|LineColor = e3cd81}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 45 |EpisodeNumber2 = 21 |Title= Growing Pains at Mr. Green Tea|Aux1 = Keyport, NJ|OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2016|2|9|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Marcus returns to Mr. Green Tea (Season 1). Their revenue has nearly doubled since their new production plant began. However, there are problems between owner Rich and his son and vice-president, Michael. Michael wishes to have equity in the business, but his cavalier attitude does not impress the conservative Rich. Marcus finds that Michael has introduced several new ice cream flavours, but has not done any market research. Marcus is particularly unimpressed with the [[black sesame]] flavour, as well as Michael's lack of understanding of the cost of his failures. Marcus tries to coach Michael into become a better leader. They go to a supermarket to get feedback on the new flavours, with [[fortune cookie]] and [[chai latte]] being popular, and black sesame receiving negative feedback. They also find that the prominent company name misleads people into thinking green tea was in every flavour. Marcus instructs Michael to change the package design, which leads to an argument. Eager to support Michael's development, Marcus brings the team to their cream supplier, where Michael is able to secure a lower cost per gallon for a larger order. Rich develops a new flavour based on spicy mango. They visit a Mexican restaurant that currently only sells their vanilla ice cream, but after overwhelmingly positive feedback, they accept the new flavour. Michael pulls through with the redesigned packaging. As a final challenge, Marcus arranges a meeting with frozen yogurt chain [[16 Handles]]. Although 16 Handles have never out-sourced one of their handles, Michael is able to successfully pitch their product and impress them with their flavours. Through this, Michael is able to prove that he is a valuable part of the business.|LineColor = e3cd81}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 46 |EpisodeNumber2 = 22 |Title= Progress Report #4|Aux1= |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2016|2|16|df=y}}|ShortSummary = Amazing Grapes (Season 2) has increased its revenue, but is not running at capacity and could pull in more profit. Marcus identifies the small kitchen to be an issue, and plans a $75,000 expansion to improve speed and quality. He is disappointed to find that beer and online sales have been poor, and both are the responsibility of beer seller Matt. The staff confide with Marcus that Matt has proven to be lazy, having only put 20% of the inventory online and having no knowledge of the margins and inventory of beer in store. Marcus tasks Matt to give him the numbers, but Matt's apathetic attitude prompts the staff to fire Matt.\n\nReturning to Shuler's Bar-B-Que (Season 2), Marcus is impressed with the banquet hall expansion and general store. However, he is also surprised and disappointed that Norton and Lynn have not sought advice from Marcus in setting up the general store, resulting in a disastrously large and eclectic assortment of products, including flamingo decorations and assorted clothing. While Marcus berates the owners for their lack of experience in managing a general store, he sees the banquet hall as a good investment. Before the general store opens, Marcus helps in rearranging the layout to promote more of Shuler's products.\n\nMarcus finds Grafton Furniture (Season 3) to be doing well despite the passing of the family patriarch, Esteban. Steve has opened a caf\u00e9 for the workers in memory of Esteban. The factory is working efficiently and the design room is generating a high level of revenue.\n\nAt SJC Drums (Season 3), owner Mike has been successfully selling drum kits on tour and secured contracts. The workshop has expanded, including a CNC machine that can produce a drum shell in 9 minutes. However, the relationship between brothers Mike and Scott has not healed. Marcus counsels Mike and praises his efforts, assuring him that he has done all that he can. Marcus then meets the SJC team at the [[NAMM Show]], exactly a year since they first met.

With originally over a hundred stores, Farrell's eventually closed every location until it was bought by current owners Mike and Paul in 2009. Marcus finds that the current restaurants are merely an imitation of the old Farrell's experience, with uninspired food, loud celebrations, outsourced ice cream and the lack of a unique candy store experience. Marcus takes the team to [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], where he shows them positive food service practices and colourful candy store displays, though this is met with some resistance.\n\nMarcus begins to make major changes to the restaurant. He sources a company to begin producing Farrell's original ice cream. He revitalises the candy front by moving manager Sandy (who is also the HR manager) out and assigning merchandise manager Shauna to the role, renovating the restaurant and addressing Mike's negative leadership style. Progress is stalled by a miscalculation, with the owners needing another $200,000 to keep one of their locations open. Regional manager Travis is called in, and he advises that due to rising costs, the location should be closed. Marcus is impressed by his decisiveness and honesty, and decides to give him an equity share in the company and he is assigned to be the general manager of all locations while Mike is in charge of marketing.\n\nAfter a last-minute rush, the restaurant is relaunched.

With the majority of the printing screens unused and with over $200,000 in negative equity, the company is effectively insolvent. Marcus offers a deal on the condition that Dan and Kelly eventually each get 10% of company.\n\nMarcus soon discovers that the business has no process for product design and has no records of sales. He introduces Patrick to creative studio Two Arrows to focus on his design ideas and to expand his women's line, while also convincing him to close down the unprofitable retail store. Marcus takes Patrick to a Courage.b store (Season 2) in Connecticut to do focus group surveys, but he struggles to handle feedback. Despite his nerves, he delivers a convincing sales pitch to [[Bloomingdale's]] and is given the opportunity to do a trunk sale. The plan goes awry when a box of printed shirts is lost in transit, and Marcus is disappointed in Patrick's tendency to hide from problems.

There is also a disturbing mystery and avoidance over Dave's former best friend, Grace.\n\nAfter shaking on the deal, Marcus gets Dave's soups tested for nutritional value, bringing up very high levels of fat and sodium, which Dave refuses to alter. Marcus brings in Dean from Precise Graphix (Season 3) to redesign the interior, but Dave continues to resist change and criticises Marcus's chain, The Simple Greek (Season 2), for being too plain. During the redesign, Grace appears, surprising Marcus with her role as co-director of operations. Marcus discovers that Grace has been asked to be invisible due to a perceived affair with Dave. Marcus confronts Dave about his lack of honesty, and Dave admits that his previous feelings for Grace have caused her to suffer due to his mishandling of his personal life.\n\nThe renovated restaurant launches a grand opening with new healthier recipes from Dave, resulting in very good reception. However, despite organising the event, Grace was excluded from the opening. Marcus, Grace and Dave have a frank talk about the situation, and Dave promises to make positive changes. Weeks later, Grace calls Marcus and informs him that Dave fired her for insubordination and called the police to remove her from the premises. Grace also reveals that she had filed for a sexual harassment claim prior to being terminated. Marcus returns to The Soup Market to find that Dave has reversed all of the changes.

Marcus also finds that Tad can be an aggressive micromanager. The business is in a bad situation due to its focus on catering for the film industry, resulting in unstable seasonal business. Marcus addresses Tad's management style after his employees become aggravated during a buffet luncheon, telling him to delegate and let them learn to solve problems on their own.\n\nMarcus decides to expand into the [[food truck]] industry to have more predictable revenue. When Tad arrives with the truck, the employees reveal that they are on the verge of a mutiny due to Tad's lack of communication. Marcus allows them to air their concerns and explains that the food trucks will benefit them on top of their hourly wage, and manages to buy a second food truck for the business.

Although Marcus likes the idea of all-natural cleaning products, he is confused by their range of non-related products, high price point and labelling that looks like a royal product. The company financials are also showing heavy losses, which Max seems to be in denial over. Max asks for 1 million dollars to launch a new product line, but Marcus rebuffs this proposal. Marcus settles on $250,000 for 30% ownership of Murchison-Hume, and a 70% stake in their Best in Show brand.\n\nMarcus encounters problems with Max. In seeing her product on shelves, he discovers that Max had made prior arrangements for product to be spotlighted for Marcus's visit, presenting a fa\u00e7ade that she was doing much better than she actually was. In redesigning the packaging, Max walks out, refusing to change the name and label. Later, during a visit to Marcus's pet store chain. Bentley's (Season 3), Max tries to re-negotiate on the deal, proposing that Marcus only gets 15% of the ownership and earns his way up. This infuriates Marcus, and he leaves to allow Max to discuss the original offer with her husband.\n\nMarcus's return to the company office reveals that Max has pushed ahead with turning the office into an unfeasible mini-distribution centre. Max agrees to the original terms of the deal. However, upon moving all of their inventory to the warehouse, Marcus discovers that instead of $280,000 of inventory, they only have $50,000.

The company has a similar history to Marcus's previous investment, Grafton Furniture (Season 3). Both were successful immigrant family businesses which had problems with profit margins and manufacturing processes. On the back of Grafton's successful transformation and impressed with the owner's daughter, Ana, Marcus proposes an unusual deal: that Pacific Hospitality be co-owned by Marcus and Grafton.\n\nMarcus identifies that the companies and personnel complement each other, as Grafton specialises in residential furniture and Pacific deals with hospitality and retail. Marcus hopes that Pacific can manufacture Grafton products and service the West Coast, which Grafton has struggled in. The Pacific Hospitality warehouse is emptied and redesigned to implement a production line, with Ana impressing Marcus with her own floor plan design.\n\nMarcus tasks Ana and Grafton owner and designer Steve to do a pitch for a furniture package for The Simple Greek franchisees (Season 2). Steve is offended when Marcus delegates the design role to Ana and decides to make a competing design. Marcus is correct with his prediction: Steve's design is good, but not practical or attractive for a restaurant franchise, while Ana's creative process tries to blend in with the concept. Steve, accustomed to being told what to make, has difficulty accepting feedback.\n\nLater, Marcus decides to merge the two companies into one. Steve balks at being removed from design, but Marcus explains that Steve's superior management skills and Ana's design talents would benefit the overall health of the company.

The company is insolvent with a million-dollar debt, with Jeff investing poorly in building and selling corporate stores and franchisees being poorly supported. Marcus also notes that Jeff has no passion or interest in tea.\n\nIn moving forward, Marcus rebrands the concept as \u201cThe American Tea & Spice Shop\u201d. He erases the payables owed to the tea distributor by offering him equity in the company. While he organises the prototype build, Marcus deals with Taylor's immaturity and his rocky relationship with Jeff. Jeff effectively disowns Taylor despite Marcus's efforts at mediation. Problems also arise when Jeff continues to try to sell the old Tea2Go franchise, despite not being aware of franchise law and essentially competing with Marcus to maintain a separate entity. Marcus sees this is a blessing in disguise, as he can now start up a new holding company and the franchisees can decide where to go.\n\nThe prototype American Tea & Spice Shop is successfully opened.

He instructs Adelo to close the factory instead of investing in it, and instead he proposes a new Hispanic food company using Marcus's business skills, Adelo's knowledge of authentic Mexican food, and George's image and marketing. Adelo has some initial problems with understanding the need for detailed market research, including an assumption that Mission Foods would be a better distributor, which Marcus rebuffed. He also did not mention his factory's eviction and loss of his equipment. Despite this, Adelo impresses Marcus and George with his salsa recipes and the new \u201cTa Loco\u201d brand, taking George's catch phrase.\n\nMarcus arranges a sales pitch with [[Sam's Club]], fulfilling Adelo's dream of making it into a large retailer.

It was established on 7 May 2014 as the first team in the Indian Super League, and plays its home games at the Vivekananda Yuva Bharati Krirangan, also known as the [[Salt Lake Stadium]].\n\nThe team is owned by Kolkata Games and Sports Pvt. Ltd. which consists of former [[List of India national cricket captains|Indian cricket captain]] [[Sourav Ganguly]], alongside businessmen [[Harshavardhan Neotia]], [[Sanjiv Goenka]] and Utsav Parekh. Initially, for first three seasons, Spanish [[La Liga]] club [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] was also a co-owner; later Goenka bought the shares owned by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. After the end of their partnership with Spanish giant, Atl\u00e9tico de Kolkata has been rechristened to ATK in July 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-atletico-de-kolkata-to-be-just-atk-from-now-goenka-2510678|title=Revealed \u2013 here's what Atletico de Kolkata will be called from now on \u2013 Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=22 July 2017|website=dnaindia.com|accessdate=21 September 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723192650/http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-atletico-de-kolkata-to-be-just-atk-from-now-goenka-2510678|archivedate=23 July 2017}}</ref> The team's name and colours are derived from their former Spanish partner.\n\nUnder coach [[Antonio L\u00f3pez Habas]], Atl\u00e9tico hosted and won the first match of the Indian Super League.

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]] began using the Wonderlic Personnel Test to select candidates for [[aviator|pilot]] [[training]] and [[air navigation|navigation]]. During this time period, 1940\u20131960, it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to E. F. Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s [[Tom Landry]], coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/> It is still used in the annual [[NFL Combine]] as a form of pre-draft assessment.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time.

The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test \u2013 Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability.

Wonderlic claims that using the Wonderlic Personality Test to select individuals whose traits are aligned with the demands of the position, employers can improve employee productivity, employee satisfaction and customer service while reducing recruitment costs and employee turnover.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wonderlic|url=http://www.wonderlic.com/assessments/personality|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAdded during the 1990s, the Wonderlic Personality Test contains two sections. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]], [[neuroticism|emotional stability/neuroticism]], and [[openness to experience]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Description of Five Factor Model|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/five-factor-model.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> These are essentially the same [[Construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]] as the [[Big Five personality traits]], also known as the Five Factor Model.\n\n===Motivation===\nAveraging 10\u201315 minutes, the 58-item assessment is based on leading workplace motivation model, Holland/RIASEC. It evaluates a candidate\u2019s interests, which helps predict how motivated they will be by the actual responsibilities of the job. The more motivated they are by those responsibilities, the likelier they will succeed in that position.<ref>[https://wonderlic.com/wonscore/motivation/ \"Motivation\"] ''Wonderlic.com''.

Matthews and Kerry Lassiter report that the Wonderlic test \"was most strongly associated with overall intellectual functioning,\" which is what it is purported to measure.<ref name=\"Matthews2007\" /> However, Matthews and Lassiter did not find the Wonderlic to be a successful measure of [[fluid and crystallized intelligence]], and they stated that \"the Wonderlic test scores did not clearly show convergent or divergent validity evidence across these two broad domains of cognitive ability.\"<ref name=\"Matthews2007\" /> In academic testing, the Wonderlic test has shown high correlations with aptitude tests such as the General Aptitude Test Battery.<ref name=\"Matthews2007\" />\n\n==Legal matters==\n===''Jordan v. New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.

The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test \u2013 Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability. The Wonderlic Personnel Test is a much more comprehensive test.<ref name=\"wonderlic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderlic.com/ |title=Ready. Test.

Wonderlic claims that using the Wonderlic Personality Test to select individuals whose traits are aligned with the demands of the position, employers can improve employee productivity, employee satisfaction and customer service while reducing recruitment costs and employee turnover.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wonderlic|url=http://www.wonderlic.com/assessments/personality|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAdded during the 1990s, the Wonderlic Personality Test contains two sections. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]], [[neuroticism|emotional stability/neuroticism]], and [[openness to experience]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Description of Five Factor Model|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/five-factor-model.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> These are essentially the same [[Construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]] as the [[Big Five personality traits]], also known as the Five Factor Model.\n\n===Motivation===\nAveraging 10\u201315 minutes, the 58-item assessment is based on leading workplace motivation model, Holland/RIASEC. It evaluates a candidate\u2019s interests, which helps predict how motivated they will be by the actual responsibilities of the job. The more motivated they are by those responsibilities, the likelier they will succeed in that position.<ref>[https://wonderlic.com/wonscore/motivation/ \"Motivation\"] ''Wonderlic.com''.

However, the questions may take different angles depending upon the \u2018intelligence\u2019 of the question setters.\n<ref name=\"Wonderlic1939\"/><ref name=\"Merron\"/><ref name=\"tests.com\"/> Practice questions will include:\n* If a piece of rope cost 20 cents per 2 feet, how many feet can you buy for 30 dollars?\n* Which of the numbers in this group represents the smallest amount? a) 0.3 b) 0.08 c) 1 d) 0.33\n* A high-speed train travels 25 feet in 1/3 second.

As a personnel test the Wonderlic is used to gauge an applicant's job potential, educational potential, and training potential.<ref name=\"Wonderlic1983\"/> Six forms of this test are made available (A, B, C, D, E, and F) in which Wonderlic suggests that when two of these versions are to be used, the best combinations are A and B or D and F.<ref name=\"Kazmier\">Kazmier, L.J. & Browne C.G.(1959).

New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.
