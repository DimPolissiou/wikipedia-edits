The family are watching the launch in their home when they see the rocketship explode on their TV screens. 8 months later, it is revealed that Alex is applying to Greenhouse Academy to honour his mother\u2019s memory. Hayley drives Alex to Greenhouse Academy. Upon arrival, Alex introduces himself to Daniel, captain of The Eagles basketball team. He then proceeds to take the written test, whilst other main characters are introduced \u2013 including members of both the Eagles and the Ravens (the two opposing clubhouses at the Academy). Alex partakes in the physical test to join the Eagles but is sabotaged by Daniel, whilst Hayley watches from the sidelines and meets Leo, captain of the Ravens. Louis Osmond, head of Greenhouse Academy, offers both Woods siblings a place at Greenhouse, Alex in the Eagles and Hayley in the Ravens.

The Opening Challenge between the Eagles and the Ravens commences, and Hayley and Alex address the rivalry between their two clubhouses. To win the Challenge, they must solve a riddle to find a key, unlock a case and ring the gong. Hayley reluctantly joins the search on the beach to solve the first part of the riddle. Meanwhile, Sophie comforts Alex when he is teased by the other Eagles about the blog post. Leo and Hayley solve the riddle and the Ravens are crowned winners of the Opening Challenge. At the Woods home, Carter has contacted his ex-colleague and FBI agent about a suspected break-in. It is revealed that a woman named Judy hired the intruder to delete all files on the Woods family computer that included her name.

The relationship between Hayley and Leo also grows as he tries to cheer her up by playing music and teaching her some chords. The Eagles want revenge after losing the Opening Challenge, so convince Alex to steal a key from his sister to get into the Ravens' clubhouse.

The Ravens begin to celebrate the Eagles misfortune, aside from Leo who tries to talk to the Eagles. Daniel wakes up in the hospital and reveals how he found the taser. Meanwhile back at the Academy, Max and Emma, both Ravens, compete in a heated chess game.

Alex convinces Daniel that his best friend, Parker, would be a good choice for the new captain of the Eagles as he can be easily manipulated to enforce Daniel\u2019s rules. At first, Parker is unsure but eventually agrees. An FBI agent and Brooke begin separately investigating the explosion that destroyed the taser barb. Brooke updates Sophie and tells Sophie her theories surrounding the taser barb destruction. Leo and Hayley decide their relationship will go no further.

The family are watching the launch in their home when they see the rocketship explode on their TV screens. 8 months later, it is revealed that Alex is applying to Greenhouse Academy to honour his mother\u2019s memory. Hayley drives Alex to Greenhouse Academy. Upon arrival, Alex introduces himself to Daniel, captain of The Eagles basketball team. He then proceeds to take the written test, whilst other main characters are introduced \u2013 including members of both the Eagles and the Ravens (the two opposing clubhouses at the Academy). Alex partakes in the physical test to join the Eagles but is sabotaged by Daniel, whilst Hayley watches from the sidelines and meets Leo, captain of the Ravens. Louis Osmond, head of Greenhouse Academy, offers both Woods siblings a place at Greenhouse, Alex in the Eagles and Hayley in the Ravens.

Though there is still tension between Alex and Daniel, Sophie, a member of the Eagles and writer for the official Greenhouse blog, befriends Alex. The Opening Challenge between the Eagles and the Ravens commences, and Hayley and Alex address the rivalry between their two clubhouses. To win the Challenge, they must solve a riddle to find a key, unlock a case and ring the gong. Hayley reluctantly joins the search on the beach to solve the first part of the riddle. Meanwhile, Sophie comforts Alex when he is teased by the other Eagles about the blog post. Leo and Hayley solve the riddle and the Ravens are crowned winners of the Opening Challenge. At the Woods home, Carter has contacted his ex-colleague and FBI agent about a suspected break-in. It is revealed that a woman named Judy hired the intruder to delete all files on the Woods family computer that included her name. Later, it is revealed that Judy is Daniel\u2019s mother and she has a secret agenda with the Dean of the Academy that is endangered by the appearance of Alex and Hayley.\n| LineColor       = 9F0000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Breaking and Entering\n| DirectedBy      = Roee Florentin\n| WrittenBy       = Giora Chamizer & Paula Yoo\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|9|8}}\n| ShortSummary    = Daniel is seen to be suffering from pain in his leg, and soon, Daniel\u2019s girlfriend Brooke Osmond becomes suspicious.

The relationship between Hayley and Leo also grows as he tries to cheer her up by playing music and teaching her some chords. The Eagles want revenge after losing the Opening Challenge, so convince Alex to steal a key from his sister to get into the Ravens' clubhouse. The Eagles vandalise the Raven\u2019s clubhouse whilst they sleep. The FBI agent from the Woods home is seen at Greenhouse, searching for a Park Ranger\u2019s lost taser as part of a missing person's case.

It is discovered that the infection in Daniel\u2019s leg is due to a taser barb, confirming Brooke\u2019s suspicions. The Ravens begin to celebrate the Eagles misfortune, aside from Leo who tries to talk to the Eagles. Daniel wakes up in the hospital and reveals how he found the taser. Meanwhile back at the Academy, Max and Emma, both Ravens, compete in a heated chess game. The FBI discover that the taser barb was destroyed on the way to the lab so there is nothing to link Daniel to the crime. Judy and a rogue FBI agent are behind its destruction.

Alex convinces Daniel that his best friend, Parker, would be a good choice for the new captain of the Eagles as he can be easily manipulated to enforce Daniel\u2019s rules. At first, Parker is unsure but eventually agrees. An FBI agent and Brooke begin separately investigating the explosion that destroyed the taser barb. Brooke updates Sophie and tells Sophie her theories surrounding the taser barb destruction. Leo and Hayley decide their relationship will go no further. Sophie decides to run for the Eagles captain position. At the beach near Greenhouse Academy, there is an underground lair where Judy and Marcus, the groundskeeper at the Greenhouse, conspire.
