Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28&nbsp;December south of [[Nauru]]. After forming, Rewa moved southwest through the [[Solomon Islands]], crossing the [[160th&nbsp;meridian east]] from the [[Tropical cyclone basins#South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific basin]] into the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Australian region|Australian region]]. The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward, paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December. Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a [[Tropical cyclone scales|Category&nbsp;4]]&nbsp;tropical cyclone on 2&nbsp;January. It maintained this intensity for about 12&nbsp;hours before an increase in [[wind shear]] induced its weakening by 3&nbsp;January. The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4&nbsp;January, before it passed over [[New Caledonia]] between 5\u20136 January. After affecting New Caledonia, Rewa weakened to a [[tropical depression]] and turned northwestward before re-entering the Australian basin on 10&nbsp;January.\n\nOver the following days, the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward, peaking in intensity as a [[Australian scale|Category&nbsp;5 severe tropical cyclone]]. It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days. Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Mackay, Queensland]], the cyclone began interacting with an [[Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex|upper-level trough]] on 18&nbsp;January, causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast. Rewa transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on 20&nbsp;January, with its remnants bringing heavy rain to [[New Zealand]] three days later.\n\nThe cyclone caused the deaths of 22&nbsp;people on its course, affecting parts of the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, [[Eastern states of Australia|Eastern Australia]], New Caledonia, [[Vanuatu]] and New Zealand. Nine people in a banana [[dinghy]] en route to [[Rossel Island]] went missing at the height of the storm; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island. In Queensland, three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm, and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe. One death took place in New Caledonia, while flooding caused eight drownings in Papua New Guinea. After this usage of the name Rewa, the name was [[List of retired South Pacific tropical cyclone names#Tropical cyclone names retired in the 1990s|retired]].\n\n==Meteorological history==\n[[File:Rewa 1993 track.png|thumb|left|Track map of Tropical Cyclone Rewa, based on data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.]]\nDuring 26 December, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) started to monitor a [[tropical depression]] that had developed within the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], about 575&nbsp;km (355&nbsp;mi) to the south-east of [[Nauru]].<ref name=\"Rewa FMS Report\">{{cite report |title=Tropical Cyclone Rewa, 26 December 1993&nbsp;- 21 January 1994 |type=Global tropical/extratropical cyclone climatic atlas |date=25 June 1996 |publisher=Indiana University |author=Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Detachment |author2=National Climatic Data Center |url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/virtcdlib/index.cgi/4274123/FID1/DATA/TROPIC/SWP_NAR/1993_16.NAR%3B1 |accessdate=5 March 2013 |archivedate=5 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ety848NB?url=http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/virtcdlib/index.cgi/4274123/FID1/DATA/TROPIC/SWP_NAR/1993_16.NAR;1 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"IBTRACS\">{{cite web|url={{IBTRACS url|id=1993360S04171}}|publisher=International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship|title=1993 Tropical Cyclone REWA (1993360S04171)|accessdate=April 2, 2019}}</ref> Over the next few days the depression gradually developed and organised further, as it moved towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow.<ref name=\"Rewa FMS Report\"/><ref name=\"DTDSDEC93\">{{cite journal|title=December 1993|journal=Darwin Tropical Diagnostic Statement|year=1994|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|volume=12|issue=12|page=3|issn=1321-4233|author=Darwin Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/ntregion/statements/tropical/dtds-199312.pdf|accessdate=11 January 2012}}</ref> During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.<ref name=\"IBTRACS\"/><ref name=\"Hanstrum\">{{cite journal|title=The South Pacific and Southeast Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone Season 1993\u201394|author1=Hanstrum, Barry N|author2=Smith K.J.|author3=Bate, Peter W|accessdate=17 August 2011|issue=45|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|pages=137\u2013147|journal=Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Journal|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/amm/docs/1996/hanstrum.pdf|date=2 June 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"JTWC ATCR\">{{cite report|year=1995|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1994atcr.pdf|title=1994 Annual Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center}}</ref> Over the next few days, the system gradually intensified under the influence of favorable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29&nbsp;December and affecting the southeastern islands of [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name=\"DTDSDEC93\"/><ref name=\"Rewa TCR\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone Rewa|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/rewa.shtml|publisher=Australian Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the [[Tropical cyclone basins#South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific basin]] and into the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Australian region|Australian region]], where the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.<ref name=\"Hanstrum\"/><ref name=\"Diary\"/>\n\nOn 30&nbsp;December, the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale]] <small>(SSHS)</small>;

Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28&nbsp;December south of [[Nauru]]. After forming, Rewa moved southwest through the [[Solomon Islands]], crossing the [[160th&nbsp;meridian east]] from the [[Tropical cyclone basins#South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific basin]] into the [[Tropical cyclone basins#Australian region|Australian region]]. The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward, paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December. Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a [[Tropical cyclone scales|Category&nbsp;4]]&nbsp;tropical cyclone on 2&nbsp;January. It maintained this intensity for about 12&nbsp;hours before an increase in [[wind shear]] induced its weakening by 3&nbsp;January. The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4&nbsp;January, before it passed over [[New Caledonia]] between 5\u20136&nbsp;January. After affecting New Caledonia, Rewa weakened to a [[tropical depression]] and turned northwestward before re-entering the Australian basin on 10&nbsp;January.\n\nOver the following days, the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward, peaking in intensity as a [[Australian scale|Category&nbsp;5 severe tropical cyclone]]. It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days. Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Mackay, Queensland]], the cyclone began interacting with an [[Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex|upper-level trough]] on 18&nbsp;January, causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast. Rewa transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]] on 20&nbsp;January, with its remnants bringing heavy rain to [[New Zealand]] three days later.\n\nThe cyclone caused the deaths of 22&nbsp;people on its course, affecting parts of the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, [[Eastern states of Australia|Eastern Australia]], New Caledonia, [[Vanuatu]] and New Zealand. Nine people in a banana [[dinghy]] en route to [[Rossel Island]] went missing at the height of the storm; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island. In Queensland, three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm, and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe. One death took place in New Caledonia, while flooding caused eight drownings in Papua New Guinea.

were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter.<ref name=\"Alert\"/> A military training exercise that was due to take place in [[Shoalwater Bay]] had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to [[Rockhampton]] to avoid being cut off by flood waters.<ref name=\"Alert\"/> Along the coast, several ports including [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]] were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.<ref name=\"Alert\"/>\n\nOn 19 January Rewa started to affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast.<ref name=\"Rewa TCR\"/> However it did not make its predicted landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100&nbsp;km (60&nbsp;mi) of the coast.<ref name=\"Rewa TCR\"/><ref name=\"easing\"/> Two men off [[Yeppoon]]'s coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black

GATCO is run by an [[Board of directors|Executive Board]] supported by other officers and a team of representatives who sit on various key aviation committees. GATCO also has regional and unit representatives throughout the country.\n\nGATCO is the UK member association of the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers\u2019 Associations (IFATCA). IFATCA is a worldwide organisation representing more than 50,000 air traffic controllers in 126 countries. IFATCA was formed in 1961 and GATCO joined a year later. The main goals of the federation are to promote safety, efficiency and regularity in international air navigation and to assist and advise in the development of safe and orderly systems of air traffic control and new procedures and facilities. International cooperation is fundamental in the current ATM world. GATCO is ideally placed for the development and interchange of technical and professional information not only within Europe but on a worldwide stage. Over the years, GATCO has played a leading role within the federation, providing numerous reports and working papers. Many of these papers have formed the basis of IFATCA policy which, in turn, have been fed into [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) working groups which develop [[civil aviation]] regulations worldwide. This involvement allows the views and concerns of individual GATCO members to be heard and provides the opportunity to influence worldwide aviation regulations and procedures. Additionally, many GATCO members have held and currently hold positions within IFATCA, from members of standing committees and international representatives to members of IFATCA's own Executive Board. Being involved with IFATCA provides a unique opportunity for controllers to take active part in the discussion and decision-making of air traffic management matters at international and European levels, benefiting both the organisation and the individual's career.\n\nFor many years GATCO has provided representatives to serve on other aviation organisation's committees. It is through these channels that GATCO exerts influence and provides help and advice to the wider aviation community. The current list of organisation committees with GATCO representation are:\n\n'''Airspace Infringement Working Group (AIWG), CAA''': All the issues relating to airspace infringement in UK airspace are addressed through this [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] Working Group.\n\n'''Air Pilots Technical Committee, The Honourable Company of Air Pilots:''' The Air Pilots Technical Committee is the focal point for all aviation technical matters within The Honourable Company of Air Pilots. This Guild sponsors and encourages action and activities designed to ensure that aircraft are piloted and navigated safely by both pilots and navigators.\n\n'''Air Traffic Services Group (ATS), BALPA:''' The [[British Airline Pilots' Association]]'s (BALPA\u2019s) ATS group provides detailed comment on Air Traffic Management (ATM), ATC and issues emanating from the UK, European and international regulators, Government and ICAO.\n\n'''All-Party Parliamentary Group on General Aviation (APPG-GA):''' The APPG-GA promotes the objective, as set out by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]], of making the UK the best country in the world for GA. It aims to protect and enhance the UK network of GA airfields, creating high-tech jobs and growth.\n\n'''Association of UK Flight Information Service Officers (AUKFISO):''' The AUKFISO unites all the Flight Information Service (FIS) units throughout the UK. They deal with the various aspects of the FIS service and work with the CAA on enhancing and developing the service members units provide.\n\n'''Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (CHIRP):''' The main aim of CHIRP is to contribute to the enhancement of aviation safety in the UK by providing a totally independent and confidential reporting system for all individuals employed in or associated with the aviation industry.\n\n'''Flight Operations Group (FOG), RAeS:''' The FOG of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] (RAeS) represents the views and interests of those involved in all aspects of flight operations with a particular focus on [[Commercial aviation|commercial]] transport. The group includes [[Commercial pilot licence|commercial]], [[Private pilot|private]] and [[Glider (aircraft)|glider]] pilots, [[flight engineer]]s, air traffic controllers, [[Flight attendant|cabin crew]] and managers.\n\n'''Future Airspace Strategy Industry Information Group (FASIIG):''' FASIIG, a subgroup of the Future Airspace Strategy (FAS) coordinates the activities required across the aviation sector to develop an efficient UK airspace that has the capacity to meet change in demand for UK airspace, while at the same time balancing the needs of all stakeholders, maintaining the levels of safety and reducing the environmental impact of the aviation sector.\n\n'''General Aviation Safety Council (GASCo):''' GASCo is a charity that works to improve flight safety in all forms of general aviation. It is funded by the contributions of member organisations, pilots, aviation authorities and the public.\n\n'''National Air Traffic Management Advisory Committee (NATMAC), CAA:''' The CAA's Director of Airspace Policy (DAP) carries out consultations on aviation legislation changes. To get a wide variety of views the NATMAC provides a panel of representatives from all aspects of aviation who advise DAP on all airspace requirements.\n\n'''Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems Group (RPAS), BALPA:''' The British Airline Pilots Association's (BALPA\u2019s) RPAS group continually reviews technology, supports research, assesses potential risks, and works with regulators on new legislation in the [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|RPAS]] domain to make commercial aviation as safe as possible.\n\n'''UK Airprox Board:''' The UK Airprox Board's primary objective is to enhance air safety in the UK, in particular in respect of lessons to be learned and applied from [[Near miss (safety)|airprox]] occurrences reported within UK airspace. UKAB is sponsored jointly, and funded equally, by the CAA and the [[Military Aviation Authority]] (MAA). Members are nominated by civil/military organisations, sitting as experts and not representing any group or organisation.\n\n'''UK Bird Strike Committee (UKBSC), CAA:''' The CAA's UKBSC works with both national and governmental department officials and industry stakeholders to share information and exchange views on [[bird strike]]s.\n\n'''UK Flight Safety Committee (UKFSC):''' The UKFSC is a fully representative group of aviation safety professionals committed to further the cause of flight safety. Their meetings are attended by airlines, regulators, experts from most disciplines within the industry and unions to discuss accidents, incidents and safety issues within the aviation industry.\n\n==Executive Board==\n\nFrom <ref name=\"Structure\"/>\n\n{|  class=\"wikitable\"\n!

GATCO is run by an [[Board of directors|Executive Board]] supported by other officers and a team of representatives who sit on various key aviation committees. GATCO also has regional and unit representatives throughout the country.\n\nGATCO is the UK member association of the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers\u2019 Associations (IFATCA). IFATCA is a worldwide organisation representing more than 50,000 air traffic controllers in 126 countries. IFATCA was formed in 1961 and GATCO joined a year later. The main goals of the federation are to promote safety, efficiency and regularity in international air navigation and to assist and advise in the development of safe and orderly systems of air traffic control and new procedures and facilities. International cooperation is fundamental in the current ATM world. GATCO is ideally placed for the development and interchange of technical and professional information not only within Europe but on a worldwide stage. Over the years, GATCO has played a leading role within the federation, providing numerous reports and working papers. Many of these papers have formed the basis of IFATCA policy which, in turn, have been fed into [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) working groups which develop [[civil aviation]] regulations worldwide. This involvement allows the views and concerns of individual GATCO members to be heard and provides the opportunity to influence worldwide aviation regulations and procedures. Additionally, many GATCO members have held and currently hold positions within IFATCA, from members of standing committees and international representatives to members of IFATCA's own Executive Board. Being involved with IFATCA provides a unique opportunity for controllers to take active part in the discussion and decision-making of air traffic management matters at international and European levels, benefiting both the organisation and the individual's career.\n\nFor many years GATCO has provided representatives to serve on other aviation organisation's committees. It is through these channels that GATCO exerts influence and provides help and advice to the wider aviation community.

It was built parallel with the [[Nuremberg\u2013Augsburg railway]] during the first construction phase of the [[Nuremberg S-Bahn]] and opened on 9 June 2001.<ref name=\"eri-2001-344\">{{cite journal |title=S-Bahn nach Roth |journal= [[Eisenbahn-Revue International]] |issue=8-9 |year=2001 |issn=1421-2811 |page=344 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe first demands for an S-Bahn network in greater Nuremberg were made in 1966. [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] made a step in this direction in 1969 with the increase in services on the main lines during peak hour. The line between Nuremberg and Rothenburg was included in this, but did not receive regular interval services because of the dense traffic on the line. This service had to be withdrawn in the following years for operational reasons and also because of poor patronage, but Deutsche Bundesbahn still sought an improvement in services. In 1971, the then ''Bundesbahndirektion'' ([[Railway divisions in Germany|railway division]], BD) of Nuremberg was granted permission to develop solutions to improve services. The results were presented on 20 March 1975 as a \"framework plan for the Nuremberg S-Bahn\", which included an S-Bahn line from Nuremberg to Roth. This was included as part of the \"first stage\u201d of construction of the Nuremberg S-Bahn adopted on 29 June 1979, as well as in the financial agreement closed on 2 November 1981, which allowed detailed planning to begin.\n\n===Preliminary planning===\n\nThe realisation of the planned \"mainline replacement line\" between Roth and Fischbach through the ''Nuremberg Reichswald'' (imperial forest) would have relieved the Nuremberg\u2013Roth line and thus made room for S-Bahn services on the existing double track line. After the adjacent municipalities and citizens groups expressed opposition to the Reichswald route, the Nuremberg BD examined the plans between 1980 and 1985 on behalf of Deutsche Bundesbahn. At the same time, the BD proposed the construction of a [[Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway|new line from Nuremberg to Ingolstadt]] as an alternative option, which was politically popular, except in Augsburg and the adjacent municipalities of [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Swabia]]. As a result, a further report was commissioned on this proposal, which delayed the S-Bahn plans again. Planning could only resume for S-Bahn line S 3 in June 1991, after the completion of this report, which supported a new line. This also supported a separate, double-track line, running parallel to the Nuremberg\u2013Augsburg line, which would be modified to run as a single-track line.\n\n===Construction===\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the line took place on 29 June 1994 at N\u00fcrnberg-Reichelsdorf station. About 700 million [[Deutsche Mark]]s (about \u20ac358 million) was spent for the construction, including the duplication of the existing rail infrastructure, the construction of many engineering structures, the upgrading and construction of stations and the construction of the new line.<ref name=\" ETR_2001_07-08\">{{cite journal |author=J\u00fcrgen Seiler |title= Erste Baustufe der N\u00fcrnberger S-Bahn vollendet |journal= Eisenbahntechnische Rundschau| issue= 7/8 |year= 2001 |page= 439 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n====Infrastructure====\n\nThe stations of N\u00fcrnberg-Sandreuth, Reichelsdorfer Keller, Katzwang, Schwabach-Limbach, Rednitzhembach and B\u00fcchenbach were abandoned and replaced by new stations on the alignment of the S-Bahn line. Separate S-Bahn platforms were built and the old platforms were closed for passengers at the stations of N\u00fcrnberg-Eibach, N\u00fcrnberg-Reichelsdorf and Schwabach. Roth station received a new island platform, located just north of the station building, as a terminus for the S-Bahn trains. After a delay of three years, [[N\u00fcrnberg-Steinb\u00fchl station]], located between [[N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof]] and N\u00fcrnberg-Sandreuth at the eastern end of the flying junction, opened to traffic on 5 September 2004. All platforms are 145&nbsp;m long, 96&nbsp;cm high and provided with barrier-free access. Provision was made for building N\u00fcrnberg Wienerstra\u00dfe station between N\u00fcrnberg-Eibach and Nuremberg-Reichelsdorf. Bicycle storage (''B + R'') was provided at all stations except Schwabach-Limbach. Commuter car parking (''P + R'') was provided at all stations except N\u00fcrnberg-Steinb\u00fchl and N\u00fcrnberg\u2013Sandreuth.\n\nThe entire route is controlled from a newly established [[Electronic interlocking|electronic control centre]] at N\u00fcrnberg-Eibach,<ref name=\"eri-2001-344\" /> which was put into operation on 8 May 2001.\n\n====Line====\n\nFollowing a planning revision, an S-Bahn line was created that alternates between single and double track, running between N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof and Nuremberg-Eibach to the west and between Nuremberg-Reichelsdorf and the terminus at Roth to the east of the main line. This line runs to the east of the existing railway line between Nuremberg and Augsburg. In order for S-Bahn trains to operate without crossing the path of other services on the existing tracks 1-3 at Roth station, two terminating platforms were created for S-Bahn trains to the north of platform 1. Subsequently, a 604-metre-long single-track [[flying junction]] was built over the lines [[Nuremberg\u2013Bamberg railway|to Bamberg]]/[[Nuremberg\u2013W\u00fcrzburg railway|W\u00fcrzburg]] and [[Nuremberg\u2013Crailsheim railway|to Crailsheim]]. Other bridges built included a 125-metre-long steel [[truss bridge]] crossing the Southwest Tangent (a southwestern bypass of Nuremberg and [[F\u00fcrth]]) and the [[Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal|Main-Danube Canal]], a flyover between Nuremberg-Eibach and Nuremberg-Reichelsdorf in order to change from the west to the east side of the Nuremberg\u2013Augsburg line, and three bridges over the [[Rednitz]], [[Schwabach (Rednitz)|Schwabach]] and [[Aurach (Rednitz)|Aurach]] valleys. The line was provided with noise barriers to protect residents for almost its entire length.\n\nThe 604 m long Steinb\u00fchl Bridge was, at its opening, the longest bridge in Nuremberg.\n\n==Route==\n\nThe single-track train route leaves N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof to the west, running first past the outer grounds of the [[Nuremberg Transport Museum]]. From the bridge over Steinb\u00fchler Tunnel (a street under N\u00fcrnberg-Steinb\u00fchl station) the line goes onto the 604 metre-long flyover over the lines to Bamberg and to Crailsheim, as well as an elongated left turn over the [[Bundesautobahn 73|Frankenschnellweg]] autobahn. At the beginning of the structure is N\u00fcrnberg-Steinb\u00fchl station, which provides interchange with the [[Trams in Nuremberg|urban tram network]]. The line then runs with the districts of Schweinau to the west and Sandreuth to the east and crosses the south ring (federal highway B 4 R) over a bridge, on which N\u00fcrnberg-Sandreuth station is located. The line runs under the [[Nuremberg marshalling yard\u2013Nuremberg main goods yard railway|line that formerly connected the Nuremberg marshalling yard and the former Nuremberg main goods yard]] and the [[Nuremberg ring railway|ring railway]] and then crosses over the parallel Southwest Tangent road and the Main-Danube Canal.\n\nFrom the 4.6 kilometre point the line is double-track and after Nuremberg-Eibach station it runs through the eastern part of the district of Nuremberg-Eibach. Then, the line meets the Frankenschnellweg, now running parallel, and crosses the Nuremberg-Augsburg railway on a flyover near K\u00f6nigshofer Weg to continue on its eastern side. The line runs through the district of Reichelsdorf, including Nuremberg-Reichelsdorf station, which is located at the overpass over Weltenburger Stra\u00dfe. Subsequently, the line is single-track again and cuts through the growing suburbs to the southeast of Reichelsdorf and after Reichelsdorfer Keller station leaves the Nuremberg city area for the first time. The line now runs parallel with the Rednitz valley, which it crosses shortly afterwards on a 170-metre-long bridge in the Schwabach suburb of Wolkersdorf and re-enters the Nuremberg city area again briefly at Katzwang station.\n\nThe line continues through the [[Schwabach]] suburb of Limbach, crosses the Schwabach river and reached Schwabach station, located to the east of central Schwabach. The line then crosses [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 2|federal highway B2]] at a tangent in the district of Forsthof and runs under the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6 autobahn]] through the district of Vogelherd and out of Schwabach. In the [[Rednitzhembach]] district of Igelsdorf  the line reaches Rednitzhembach station, which is in the district of Pl\u00f6ckendorf, and, after passing through Untermaimbach it again runs along the Rednitz, which it follows from now on. The line reaches B\u00fcchenbach station on the eastern edge of [[B\u00fcchenbach]] municipality and crosses the Aurach, already in the Roth city area. The line runs to the west of central Roth and ends at Roth station. The western tracks connect to the [[Roth\u2013Greding railway]] to [[Hilpoltstein]].\n\n===Line standards===\n\nThe line is duplicated between the 4.6 and 8.8&nbsp;km points, the 13.1 and 16.9&nbsp;km points and the 22.1 and 25.5&nbsp;km points and single-track elsewhere. Furthermore, it is electrified throughout and can be operated at a maximum line speed of 120&nbsp;km/h. All stations along the route have platforms that are 145&nbsp;m long and 96&nbsp;cm high above the top of the rail.\n\n==Operations==\n\nServices on the line are operated by [[Push\u2013pull train|push-pull trains]], composed of [[DR Class 243|class 143]] electric locomotives with four ''x-Wagen'' (carriages), as S-Bahn line S 2 (Roth\u2013Nuremberg\u2013Altdorf).\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite journal|editor=[[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] |title=S-Bahn N\u00fcrnberg Netz \u201992 |journal=Die Deutsche

'''Nuremberg\u2013Roth railway''' is a 25.5&nbsp;km long main line railway in the German state of [[Bavaria]], running from [[N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof|Nuremberg]] via [[Schwabach]] to [[Roth, Bavaria|Roth]]. It was built parallel with the [[Nuremberg\u2013Augsburg railway]] during the first construction phase of the [[Nuremberg S-Bahn]] and opened on 9 June 2001.<ref name=\"eri-2001-344\">{{cite journal |title=S-Bahn nach Roth |journal= [[Eisenbahn-Revue International]] |issue=8-9 |year=2001 |issn=1421-2811 |page=344 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe first demands for an S-Bahn network in greater Nuremberg were made in 1966. [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] made a step in this direction in 1969 with the increase in services on the main lines during peak hour. The line between Nuremberg and Rothenburg was included in this, but did not receive regular interval services because of the dense traffic on the line. This service had to be withdrawn in the following years for operational reasons and also because of poor patronage, but Deutsche Bundesbahn still sought an improvement in services. In 1971, the then ''Bundesbahndirektion'' ([[Railway divisions in Germany|railway division]], BD) of Nuremberg was granted permission to develop solutions to improve services. The results were presented on 20 March 1975 as a \"framework plan for the Nuremberg S-Bahn\", which included an S-Bahn line from Nuremberg to Roth. This was included as part of the \"first stage\u201d of construction of the Nuremberg S-Bahn adopted on 29 June 1979, as well as in the financial agreement closed on 2 November 1981, which allowed detailed planning to begin.\n\n===Preliminary planning===\n\nThe realisation of the planned \"mainline replacement line\" between Roth and Fischbach through the ''Nuremberg Reichswald'' (imperial forest) would have relieved the Nuremberg\u2013Roth line and thus made room for S-Bahn services on the existing double track line. After the adjacent municipalities and citizens groups expressed opposition to the Reichswald route, the Nuremberg BD examined the plans between 1980 and 1985 on behalf of Deutsche Bundesbahn. At the same time, the BD proposed the construction of a [[Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway|new line from Nuremberg to Ingolstadt]] as an alternative option, which was politically popular, except in Augsburg and the adjacent municipalities of [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Swabia]]. As a result, a further report was commissioned on this proposal, which delayed the S-Bahn plans again. Planning could only resume for S-Bahn line S 3 in June 1991, after the completion of this report, which supported a new line. This also supported a separate, double-track line, running parallel to the Nuremberg\u2013Augsburg line, which would be modified to run as a single-track line.\n\n===Construction===\n\nThe groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the line took place on 29 June 1994 at N\u00fcrnberg-Reichelsdorf station. About 700 million [[Deutsche Mark]]s (about \u20ac358 million) was spent for the construction, including the duplication of the existing rail infrastructure, the construction of many engineering structures, the upgrading and construction of stations and the construction of the new line.<ref name=\" ETR_2001_07-08\">{{cite journal |author=J\u00fcrgen Seiler |title= Erste Baustufe der N\u00fcrnberger S-Bahn vollendet |journal= Eisenbahntechnische Rundschau| issue= 7/8 |year= 2001 |page= 439 |language=German}}</ref>\n\n====Infrastructure====\n\nThe stations of N\u00fcrnberg-Sandreuth, Reichelsdorfer Keller, Katzwang, Schwabach-Limbach, Rednitzhembach and B\u00fcchenbach were abandoned and replaced by new stations on the alignment of the S-Bahn line. Separate S-Bahn platforms were built and the old platforms were closed for passengers at the stations of N\u00fcrnberg-Eibach, N\u00fcrnberg-Reichelsdorf and Schwabach. Roth station received a new island platform, located just north of the station building, as a terminus for the S-Bahn trains. After a delay of three years, [[N\u00fcrnberg-Steinb\u00fchl station]], located between [[N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof]] and N\u00fcrnberg-Sandreuth at the eastern end of the flying junction, opened to traffic on 5 September 2004. All platforms are 145&nbsp;m long, 96&nbsp;cm high and provided with barrier-free access. Provision was made for building N\u00fcrnberg Wienerstra\u00dfe station between N\u00fcrnberg-Eibach and Nuremberg-Reichelsdorf. Bicycle storage (''B + R'') was provided at all stations except Schwabach-Limbach. Commuter car parking (''P + R'') was provided at all stations except N\u00fcrnberg-Steinb\u00fchl and N\u00fcrnberg\u2013Sandreuth.\n\nThe entire route is controlled from a newly established [[Electronic interlocking|electronic control centre]] at N\u00fcrnberg-Eibach,<ref name=\"eri-2001-344\" /> which was put into operation on 8 May 2001.\n\n====Line====\n\nFollowing a planning revision, an S-Bahn line was created that alternates between single and double track, running between N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof and Nuremberg-Eibach to the west and between Nuremberg-Reichelsdorf and the terminus at Roth to the east of the main line. This line runs to the east of the existing railway line between Nuremberg and Augsburg. In order for S-Bahn trains to operate without crossing the path of other services on the existing tracks 1-3 at Roth station, two terminating platforms were created for S-Bahn trains to the north of platform 1. Subsequently, a 604-metre-long single-track [[flying junction]] was built over the lines [[Nuremberg\u2013Bamberg railway|to Bamberg]]/[[Nuremberg\u2013W\u00fcrzburg railway|W\u00fcrzburg]] and [[Nuremberg\u2013Crailsheim railway|to Crailsheim]]. Other bridges built included a 125-metre-long steel [[truss bridge]] crossing the Southwest Tangent (a southwestern bypass of Nuremberg and [[F\u00fcrth]]) and the [[Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal|Main-Danube Canal]], a flyover between Nuremberg-Eibach and Nuremberg-Reichelsdorf in order to change from the west to the east side of the Nuremberg\u2013Augsburg line, and three bridges over the [[Rednitz]], [[Schwabach (Rednitz)|Schwabach]] and [[Aurach (Rednitz)|Aurach]] valleys. The line was provided with noise barriers to protect residents for almost its entire length.\n\nThe 604 m long Steinb\u00fchl Bridge was, at its opening, the longest bridge in Nuremberg.\n\n==Route==\n\nThe single-track train route leaves N\u00fcrnberg Hauptbahnhof to the west, running first past the outer grounds of the [[Nuremberg Transport Museum]]. From the bridge over Steinb\u00fchler Tunnel (a street under N\u00fcrnberg-Steinb\u00fchl station) the line goes onto the 604 metre-long flyover over the lines to Bamberg and to Crailsheim, as well as an elongated left turn over the [[Bundesautobahn 73|Frankenschnellweg]] autobahn. At the beginning of the structure is N\u00fcrnberg-Steinb\u00fchl station, which provides interchange with the [[Trams in Nuremberg|urban tram network]]. The line then runs with the districts of Schweinau to the west and Sandreuth to the east and crosses the south ring (federal highway B 4 R) over a bridge, on which N\u00fcrnberg-Sandreuth station is located. The line runs under the [[Nuremberg marshalling yard\u2013Nuremberg main goods yard railway|line that formerly connected the Nuremberg marshalling yard and the former Nuremberg main goods yard]] and the [[Nuremberg ring railway|ring railway]] and then crosses over the parallel Southwest Tangent road and the Main-Danube Canal.\n\nFrom the 4.6 kilometre point the line is double-track and after Nuremberg-Eibach station it runs through the eastern part of the district of Nuremberg-Eibach. Then, the line meets the Frankenschnellweg, now running parallel, and crosses the Nuremberg-Augsburg railway on a flyover near K\u00f6nigshofer Weg to continue on its eastern side. The line runs through the district of Reichelsdorf, including Nuremberg-Reichelsdorf station, which is located at the overpass over Weltenburger Stra\u00dfe. Subsequently, the line is single-track again and cuts through the growing suburbs to the southeast of Reichelsdorf and after Reichelsdorfer Keller station leaves the Nuremberg city area for the first time. The line now runs parallel with the Rednitz valley, which it crosses shortly afterwards on a 170-metre-long bridge in the Schwabach suburb of Wolkersdorf and re-enters the Nuremberg city area again briefly at Katzwang station.\n\nThe line continues through the [[Schwabach]] suburb of Limbach, crosses the Schwabach river and reached Schwabach station, located to the east of central Schwabach. The line then crosses [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 2|federal highway B2]] at a tangent in the district of Forsthof and runs under the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6 autobahn]] through the district of Vogelherd and out of Schwabach. In the [[Rednitzhembach]] district of Igelsdorf  the line reaches Rednitzhembach station, which is in the district of Pl\u00f6ckendorf, and, after passing through Untermaimbach it again runs along the Rednitz, which it follows from now on. The line reaches B\u00fcchenbach station on the eastern edge of [[B\u00fcchenbach]] municipality and crosses the Aurach, already in the Roth city area. The line runs to the west of central Roth and ends at Roth station. The western tracks connect to the [[Roth\u2013Greding railway]] to [[Hilpoltstein]].\n\n===Line standards===\n\nThe line is duplicated between the 4.6 and 8.8&nbsp;km points, the 13.1 and 16.9&nbsp;km points and the 22.1 and 25.5&nbsp;km points and single-track elsewhere. Furthermore, it is electrified throughout and can be operated at a maximum line speed of 120&nbsp;km/h. All stations along the route have platforms that are 145&nbsp;m long and 96&nbsp;cm high above the top of the rail.\n\n==Operations==\n\nServices on the line are operated by [[Push\u2013pull train|push-pull trains]], composed of [[DR Class 243|class 143]] electric locomotives with four ''x-Wagen'' (carriages), as S-Bahn line S 2 (Roth\u2013Nuremberg\u2013Altdorf).\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite journal|editor=[[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] |title=S-Bahn N\u00fcrnberg Netz \u201992 |journal=Die Deutsche Bahn |volume=11 |publisher=Hestra-Verlag |location=Darmstadt |year=1992|language=German}}\n* {{cite journal|author=J\u00fcrgen Seiler |title=Erste Baustufe der N\u00fcrnberger S-Bahn vollendet |journal=Eisenbahntechnische Rundschau |issue=7/8 |year=2001 |pages=435\u2013445|language=German}}\n\n{{coord missing|Bavaria}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nuremberg-Roth railway}}\n[[Category:Railway lines in Bavaria]]\n[[Category:Nuremberg S-Bahn lines]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 2001]]\n[[Category:2001 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Roth (district)]]\n[[Category:Schwabach]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Nuremberg]]\n", "name_user": "SFletcher06", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg%E2%80%93Roth_railway"}

He was old enough to witness charters in 1148, as was his younger brother [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], which suggests he was born c. 1130-1133, as the male age of majority was fifteen. (H.E. Mayer has suggested a limited degree of competence may have been accepted from the age of eight, reducing his age, but the examples given of this are of males of the royal house, whose situation was somewhat different.) He was probably about ten years older than his youngest brother, [[Balian of Ibelin]].\n\nAfter his father Barisan died in 1150, Helvis married the [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|Constable of Jerusalem]], [[Manasses of Hierges]], who was one of the strongest supporters of [[Queen Melisende]] in the power struggle against her son [[King Baldwin III]]. Manasses was exiled in 1152 when Baldwin was victorious in this struggle, allowing Hugh to inherit Ramla from his mother. Hugh took part in the [[Siege of Ascalon]] in 1153, and in 1157 was captured in battle at [[Banias]], being released probably the next year. In 1159 he visited the [[Principality of Antioch]] and met with [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Manuel I Comnenus]], who had arrived to assert his suzerainty over the principality. In 1163 Hugh married [[Agnes of Courtenay]] (1133 &ndash; 1184/1185), [[Lord of Toron|Lady of Toron]], the former wife of [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|King Amalric I]] and mother of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], daughter of [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II de Courtenay, Count of Edessa]], by whom he had no issue. It is possible that Agnes had already been betrothed or married to him before 1157, date some say it was the one of the actual marriage but she married Amalric after Hugh was taken prisoner; Amalric was forced to divorce her before becoming King in 1163. \n\nHugh participated Amalric's [[Crusader invasion of Egypt|expedition to Egypt]] in 1167, and was responsible for building a bridge over the [[Nile]]. The crusaders allied with the sultan against [[Shirkuh]], the general of [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]] who was also fighting for control of Egypt, and Hugh was sent to protect [[Cairo]] along with the sultan's son Kamil. Hugh was the first crusader ever to see the sultan's palace. At the siege of [[Bilbeis]] during the same Egyptian campaign, according to Ibelin family tradition, Hugh's life was saved by [[Philip of Milly]] after breaking his leg and falling under his horse.<ref>[[Malcolm Barber]], \"The career of Philip of Nablus in the kingdom of Jerusalem,\" in ''The Experience of Crusading, vol. 2: Defining the Crusader Kingdom'', Peter Edbury and Jonathan Phillips, eds.
