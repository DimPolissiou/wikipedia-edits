The growing town was devastated by a [[cholera]] epidemic in 1833, which had spread throughout the waterways of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys: 500 of 7,000 Lexington residents died within two months, including nearly one-third of the congregation of [[Christ Church Episcopal (Lexington Kentucky)|Christ Church Episcopal]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/lexington/cce.htm \"Christ Church Episcopal\"], Lexington, National Park Service.

Cholera was spread by people using contaminated water supplies, but its transmission was not understood in those years. Often, the wealthier people would flee town for outlying areas to try to avoid the spread of disease.\n\n[[File:VictorianSquareJBM.jpg|thumb|left|Victorian Square in downtown Lexington]]\nPlanters held slaves for use as field hands, laborers, artisans, and [[domestic servant]]s. In the city, slaves worked primarily as domestic servants and artisans, although they also worked with merchants, shippers, and in a wide variety of trades. Plantations raised commodity crops of tobacco and hemp, and thoroughbred horse breeding and racing became established in this part of the state. In 1850, one-fifth of the state's population were slaves, and Lexington had the highest concentration of slaves in the entire state. It also had a significant population of [[free people of color|free blacks]], who were usually of mixed race. By 1850, First African Baptist Church, led by [[London Ferrill]], a free black from Virginia, had a congregation of 1,820 persons, the largest of any, black or white, in the entire state.<ref name=Nutter/>\n\nMany of 19th-century America's leading political and military figures spent part of their lives in the city, including U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] (who attended [[Transylvania University]] in 1823 and 1824); [[General officers in the Confederate States Army|Confederate general]] [[John Hunt Morgan]]; [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C.

Lincoln's wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] was born and raised in Lexington, and the couple visited the city several times after their marriage in 1842.\n\nDuring the 19th century, migrants moved from central Kentucky to Tennessee and Missouri. They established their traditional crops and livestock in Middle Tennessee and an area of Missouri along the Missouri River. While Kentucky stayed in the Union during the American Civil War, the residents of different regions of the state had divided loyalties.\n\n===20th century to present===\nAmidst the tensions between black and white populations over the lack of [[affordable housing]] in the city, a race riot broke out on September 1, 1917. At the time, the Colored A.&M. Fair (one of the largest African American fairs in the South) on Georgetown Pike attracted more African Americans from the surrounding area into the city. Also during this time, some [[Kentucky National Guard]] troops were camping on the edge of the city. Three troops passed in front of an African American restaurant and shoved some people on the sidewalk. A fight broke out, reinforcements for the troops and civilians both appeared, and soon a riot had begun. The Kentucky National Guard was summoned, and once the riot had ended, armed soldiers on foot and mount and police patrolled the streets.

When a large mob gathered outside the courthouse where Lockett's trial was underway, Kentucky Governor [[Edwin P. Morrow]] massed the National Guard troops into the streets and work alongside local law enforcement. As the mob advanced on the courthouse, the National Guard opened fire, killing six and wounding 50 others. Fearing further retaliation from the mob, Morrow urged the [[United States Army]] to provide assistance. Led by Brigadier General [[Francis Marshall (general)|Francis C. Marshall]], approximately 1,200 federal troops from nearby [[Camp Zachary Taylor]] moved into the city the same day to assist National Guard forces and local police in bringing order and peace. Marshall declared [[martial law]] in the city and had soldiers positioned throughout the area for two weeks. Lockett was eventually executed on March 11 at the [[Kentucky State Penitentiary]] in [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]] after being found guilty of murdering Hardman.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Murder of Geneva Hardman and Lexington's Mob Riot of 1920 (True Crime)|page=89-100, 103-120|author=Peter Brackney|work=[[The History Press]]|date=January 20, 2020|isbn=1-4671-4396-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935 during the [[Great Depression]], the Addiction Research Center (ARC) was created as a small research unit at the [[United States Public Health Service]] hospital in Lexington.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol10N6/ARCHistory.html |title=History of the Addiction Research Center |publisher=Drugabuse.gov |date=May 15, 1935 |accessdate=November 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825210041/http://drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol10N6/ARCHistory.html |archive-date=August 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Founded as one of the first [[drug rehabilitation]] clinics in the nation, the ARC was affiliated with a federal prison.

One of the most famous is [[Ashland (Henry Clay home)|Ashland: The Henry Clay Estate]] along Richmond Road east of downtown. This two-story museum is a [[National Historic Landmark]] and was the former home of statesman [[Henry Clay]].\n\nSince the late 20th century, Lexington has demolished hundreds of historic structures to make way for hotels, banks, and parking structures. The [[Lexington Public Library]] was constructed where the historic Phoenix Hotel once stood. An historic 1880s block located on Main Street was demolished.

Woolworth Building (Lexington, Kentucky)|Woolworth's]] building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] for its significance as a site of protests during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] against [[Racial segregation|segregation]] during the 1960s. Activists conducted sit-ins to gain integrated lunch service, full access to facilities, and more employment. The building was demolished by its owner in 2004 and the area paved for use as a parking lot until further development.<ref>{{Cite journal\n |title=Downtown Lexington's Next Loss: Woolworth's \n |publisher=Preservation Magazine \n |date=August 2004 \n |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmpre/is_200408/ai_n6889984 \n |accessdate=March 7, 2009 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628155404/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmpre/is_200408/ai_n6889984 \n |archivedate=June 28, 2014 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n\n===College athletics===\n[[File:KentuckyCommonwealthStadium-EZInterior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kroger Field|Kroger Field (Formerly Commonwealth Stadium)]]]]\nThe [[Kentucky Wildcats]], the athletic program of the University of Kentucky, is Lexington's most popular sports entity.

[[Roger Clemens]] pitched in one game for the Legends in 2006 as part of his preparation to return to the [[Houston Astros]].\n\nLexington was also home to the [[Kentucky Thoroblades]], a minor league hockey team that competed in the [[American Hockey League]] from 1996-2001.  The team played its home games at [[Rupp Arena]]. From 2002-03 the [[Lexington Men O' War]] played hockey, lasting one season.\n\n===Horse racing and equestrian events===\n[[File:R3DE StadiumJump.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]] Event]]\nThis area has been known as a major center for [[Thoroughbred]] breeding since the late 18th century due to the high [[calcium in biology|calcium]] content in the soils of the inner [[Bluegrass region]]. Horses raised on its grass are thought to develop stronger bones and greater endurance.\n\nThe city is home to two [[horse-racing]] tracks, [[Keeneland]] and [[The Red Mile]] harness track. Keeneland, sporting live races in April and October, is steeped in tradition; little has changed since the track's opening in 1936. Keeneland hosted the [[2015 Breeders' Cup|2015]] [[Breeders' Cup]], with the event's signature race, the [[Breeders' Cup Classic]], won by [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|Triple Crown]] winner [[American Pharoah]]. This track also has the world's largest thoroughbred auction house; 19 [[Kentucky Derby]] winners, 21 [[Preakness Stakes]] winners, and 18 [[Belmont Stakes]] winners were purchased at Keeneland sales. Its most notable race is the [[Blue Grass Stakes]], which is considered an important preparation for the Kentucky Derby. The Red Mile is the oldest horse racing track in the city and the second-oldest in the nation. It runs live [[harness racing|harness races]], in which horses pull two-wheeled carts called sulkies. The two tracks announced a partnership in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://redmileky.com/red-mile-news/red-mile-and-keeneland-joint-venture/#id8dB5d8GlagE70thTNwMT9Q|title=Red Mile and Keeneland Joint Venture - Red Mile - Lexington, Kentucky|date=October 13, 2014|accessdate=July 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817042840/http://redmileky.com/red-mile-news/red-mile-and-keeneland-joint-venture/#id8dB5d8GlagE70thTNwMT9Q|archive-date=August 17, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Kentucky Horse Park]], located along scenic [[Kentucky Route 1973|Iron Works Pike]] in northern Fayette County, is a comparative latecomer to Lexington, opening in 1978.

Lexington has an elected mayor and city council-style of government.\n\n===Mayor===\nOn November 2, 2010, Vice Mayor [[Jim Gray (American politician)|Jim Gray]] defeated Mayor Jim Newberry to become Lexington's first openly gay mayor. He was re-elected in 2014 but passed up a third and final term in 2018 to run for Congress. He lost the Democratic primary to Amy McGrath. [[Linda Gorton]], who had been vice mayor in his first term, defeated former police chief Ronnie Bastin for mayor.\n\n===Urban County Council===\nThe Urban County Council is a 15-member legislative group. Twelve of the members represent specific districts and serve two-year terms; three are elected citywide as at-large council members and serve four-year terms. The at-large member receiving the highest number of votes in the general election automatically becomes the vice mayor, who in the absence of the mayor, is the presiding officer of the council.

The Division of Police resulted from the merger of the Lexington Police Department with the Fayette County Patrol in 1974. The Fayette County Sheriff's Office is responsible for court service, including court security, prisoner transport, process and warrant service, and property tax collection. The 1974 merger also consolidated the office of city jailer into the office of county jailer, a constitutional position. In 1992 (effective 1993), the Kentucky General Assembly enabled a correctional services division to be established by ordinance, making employees civil-service employees rather than political appointees.<ref>KRS 67A.028</ref>\n\nThe University of Kentucky Police Department, the Transylvania University Department of Public Safety, [[Blue Grass Airport]] Public Safety, Lexington-Fayette Division of Community Corrections, [[Fayette County Public Schools (Kentucky)|Fayette County Public Schools]] Department of Law Enforcement, the [[Veterans Affairs]] Police Department, and the Kentucky Horse Park Police also have jurisdiction within their geographic areas in Lexington-Fayette County. In addition, the Lexington-Fayette Animal Care and Control exercises law enforcement over animal control issues and the [[Kentucky State Police]], [[Kentucky Vehicle Enforcement|KSP Division of Commercial Vehicle Enforcement]], and [[Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources]] can be seen performing their respective law enforcement duties within the county. Several federal law enforcement agencies, such as the [[FBI]] and [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], maintain satellite offices within Lexington. Prisons in Fayette County include the [[Federal Medical Center, Lexington]], operated by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], and the [[Blackburn Correctional Complex]], operated by the [[Kentucky Department of Corrections]].\n\n===Fire protection===\nAll fire/rescue protection within Lexington-Fayette County (with the exception of the [[Blue Grass Airport]]) is provided by the [[Lexington Fire Department]]. The current department was formed with the merger of the county and city fire departments in 1973. Lexington Fire Department is the largest single fire department in Kentucky with over 600 personnel and 24 individual fire stations broken into five districts (battalions).{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|List of schools in Lexington, Kentucky}}\n[[File:Memorial Hall UK.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Memorial Hall (University of Kentucky)|Memorial Hall]] is the most frequently photographed building at the University of Kentucky.]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census]], of Lexington's population over the age of 25, 22.4% hold a bachelor's degree, 11.4% hold a master's degree,  3.1% hold a professional degree, and 2.6% hold a doctoral degree.

Instead, Lexington has two beltways: inner [[New Circle Road|New Circle Road (KY 4)]] and outer [[Man o' War Boulevard]] (southern semicircle), then numerous [[Roads of Lexington, Kentucky|arterial highways/U.S. routes]] radiate from downtown to the surrounding suburbs and small towns.\n\nLexington suffers considerable [[traffic congestion]] for a city of its size due to the lack of freeways, the proximity of the University of Kentucky to downtown, and the substantial number of [[commuter]]s from outlying towns.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} For traffic relief on northern New Circle Road, [[Citation Boulevard]] is planned<ref>{{cite news|last=Aretakis|first=Rachel|title=Citation Boulevard extension begins|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2013/07/07/2707027/construction-underway-on-citation.html|accessdate=July 7, 2013|newspaper=Herald-Leader|date=August 7, 2013}}</ref> to connect Leestown Road and Russell Cave Road. Other proposed projects include widening/closing certain roads and changing directions from one-way to two-way.\n\n===Air===\n[[Blue Grass Airport]] is Lexington's primary commercial airport. It provides about 13 nonstop flights and a total of 86 flights daily from its two runways. Four major airlines operate connection service at Blue Grass, including [[Allegiant Air]], [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Express]].\n\nOn August 27, 2006, [[Comair Flight 5191]] took off from the wrong runway, and crashed in a nearby field, killing 49 of the 50 passengers, leaving the first officer alive but badly burned. The aircraft involved was a 50-seat Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-100ER, serial number 7472. On August 27, 2011, a memorial sculpture depicting 49 steel birds flying was unveiled and dedicated to the victims.\n\nThe airport is located {{convert|4|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the city center, at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 60 in Kentucky|US 60]] (Versailles Road) and Man o' War Boulevard.\n\nIn addition to commercial airline service, the airport is also home to several private (general aviation) operators, including TACAir, which serves as the airport's fixed-base operator. Flight training and aircraft maintenance services are also offered. A new general aviation runway was dedicated August 4, 2010.\n\n===Public transportation===\n{{Main|Lextran}}\nLexington is served by [[Lextran]], a [[public transportation|public transit]] bus agency operated by LFUCG and has been in existence since 1972. Lextran (officially the Transit Authority of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government) is a public transportation bus system serving Lexington, Kentucky. It runs bus routes throughout the city, which mostly all converge in downtown at the [[Lexington Transit Center]] located at 220 East Vine. It provides public transportation in the form of buses and lift vans. It operates seven days a week on a total of 24 bus routes from 5:00&nbsp;am until 12:30&nbsp;am. In addition to mainline and paratransit, Lextran contracts with the [[University of Kentucky]] and operates two routes around the campus. It also runs two routes to the [[Bluegrass Community and Technical College]] campuses. Though Lexington and Fayette County are a consolidated government, Lextran does not provide service outside the Lexington city proper due to limited funding.\n\n===Modal characteristics===\nIn 2016, 78.5 percent of working Lexington residents commuted by driving alone, 8.5 percent carpooled, 2 percent used public transportation, and 4 percent walked. About 2.3 of commuters used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle.

European explorers began to trade with them, but settlers did not come in large numbers until the late 18th century.\n\nLexington was named in June 1775, in what was then considered [[Fincastle County, Virginia]], 17 years before [[Kentucky]] became a [[list of US states|state]]. A party of frontiersmen, led by [[William McConnell (pioneer)|William McConnell]], camped on the Middle Fork of [[Elkhorn Creek (Kentucky)|Elkhorn Creek]] (now known as Town Branch and rerouted under Vine Street) at the site of the present-day [[McConnell Springs (springs)|McConnell Springs]]. Upon hearing of the colonists' victory in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] on April 19, 1775, they named the site Lexington. It was the first of many American places to be named after the [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Massachusetts town]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbyjamQWtScC&lpg=PA1&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Our Storehouse of Missouri Place Names | publisher=University of Missouri Press | author=Ramsay, Robert L. | year=1952 | page=16}}</ref> Danger from the ensuing war with the British and allied tribes delayed permanent settlement for four years.\n\nIn 1779, during the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Robert Patterson (pioneer)|Col.

I would suppose it contains about five hundred dwelling houses [it was closer to three hundred], many of them elegant and three stories high.

The growing town was devastated by a [[cholera]] epidemic in 1833, which had spread throughout the waterways of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys: 500 of 7,000 Lexington residents died within two months, including nearly one-third of the congregation of [[Christ Church Episcopal (Lexington Kentucky)|Christ Church Episcopal]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/lexington/cce.htm \"Christ Church Episcopal\"], Lexington, National Park Service.

Cholera was spread by people using contaminated water supplies, but its transmission was not understood in those years. Often, the wealthier people would flee town for outlying areas to try to avoid the spread of disease.\n\n[[File:VictorianSquareJBM.jpg|thumb|left|Victorian Square in downtown Lexington]]\nPlanters held slaves for use as field hands, laborers, artisans, and [[domestic servant]]s. In the city, slaves worked primarily as domestic servants and artisans, although they also worked with merchants, shippers, and in a wide variety of trades. Plantations raised commodity crops of tobacco and hemp, and thoroughbred horse breeding and racing became established in this part of the state. In 1850, one-fifth of the state's population were slaves, and Lexington had the highest concentration of slaves in the entire state. It also had a significant population of [[free people of color|free blacks]], who were usually of mixed race. By 1850, First African Baptist Church, led by [[London Ferrill]], a free black from Virginia, had a congregation of 1,820 persons, the largest of any, black or white, in the entire state.<ref name=Nutter/>\n\nMany of 19th-century America's leading political and military figures spent part of their lives in the city, including U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] (who attended [[Transylvania University]] in 1823 and 1824); [[General officers in the Confederate States Army|Confederate general]] [[John Hunt Morgan]]; [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C.

Lincoln's wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] was born and raised in Lexington, and the couple visited the city several times after their marriage in 1842.\n\nDuring the 19th century, migrants moved from central Kentucky to Tennessee and Missouri. They established their traditional crops and livestock in Middle Tennessee and an area of Missouri along the Missouri River. While Kentucky stayed in the Union during the American Civil War, the residents of different regions of the state had divided loyalties.\n\n===20th century to present===\nAmidst the tensions between black and white populations over the lack of [[affordable housing]] in the city, a race riot broke out on September 1, 1917. At the time, the Colored A.&M. Fair (one of the largest African American fairs in the South) on Georgetown Pike attracted more African Americans from the surrounding area into the city. Also during this time, some [[Kentucky National Guard]] troops were camping on the edge of the city. Three troops passed in front of an African American restaurant and shoved some people on the sidewalk. A fight broke out, reinforcements for the troops and civilians both appeared, and soon a riot had begun. The Kentucky National Guard was summoned, and once the riot had ended, armed soldiers on foot and mount and police patrolled the streets. All other National Guard troops were barred from the city streets until the fair ended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nkaa.uky.edu/nkaa/items/show/2069|title=Race Riot of 1917 (Lexington, KY) \u00b7 Notable Kentucky African Americans Database|website=nkaa.uky.edu|access-date=2020-02-05}}</ref>\n\nOn February 9, 1920, tensions flared up again over the trial of [[Will Lockett]], a black serial killer who murdered 10-year-old white girl Geneva Hardman. When a large mob gathered outside the courthouse where Lockett's trial was underway, Kentucky Governor [[Edwin P. Morrow]] massed the National Guard troops into the streets and work alongside local law enforcement. As the mob advanced on the courthouse, the National Guard opened fire, killing six and wounding 50 others. Fearing further retaliation from the mob, Morrow urged the [[United States Army]] to provide assistance. Led by Brigadier General [[Francis Marshall (general)|Francis C. Marshall]], approximately 1,200 federal troops from nearby [[Camp Zachary Taylor]] moved into the city the same day to assist National Guard forces and local police in bringing order and peace. Marshall declared [[martial law]] in the city and had soldiers positioned throughout the area for two weeks. Lockett was eventually executed on March 11 at the [[Kentucky State Penitentiary]] in [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]] after being found guilty of murdering Hardman.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Murder of Geneva Hardman and Lexington's Mob Riot of 1920 (True Crime)|page=89-100, 103-120|author=Peter Brackney|work=[[The History Press]]|date=January 20, 2020|isbn=1-4671-4396-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935 during the [[Great Depression]], the Addiction Research Center (ARC) was created as a small research unit at the [[United States Public Health Service]] hospital in Lexington.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol10N6/ARCHistory.html |title=History of the Addiction Research Center |publisher=Drugabuse.gov |date=May 15, 1935 |accessdate=November 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825210041/http://drugabuse.gov/NIDA_Notes/NNVol10N6/ARCHistory.html |archive-date=August 25, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> Founded as one of the first [[drug rehabilitation]] clinics in the nation, the ARC was affiliated with a federal prison.

At-Large Council Member Terms end on December 31, 2022.\n\n===Law enforcement===\nPrimary law enforcement duties within Lexington-Fayette County are the responsibility of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government Division of Police. The Division of Police resulted from the merger of the Lexington Police Department with the Fayette County Patrol in 1974. The Fayette County Sheriff's Office is responsible for court service, including court security, prisoner transport, process and warrant service, and property tax collection. The 1974 merger also consolidated the office of city jailer into the office of county jailer, a constitutional position. In 1992 (effective 1993), the Kentucky General Assembly enabled a correctional services division to be established by ordinance, making employees civil-service employees rather than political appointees.<ref>KRS 67A.028</ref>\n\nThe University of Kentucky Police Department, the Transylvania University Department of Public Safety, [[Blue Grass Airport]] Public Safety, Lexington-Fayette Division of Community Corrections, [[Fayette County Public Schools (Kentucky)|Fayette County Public Schools]] Department of Law Enforcement, the [[Veterans Affairs]] Police Department, and the Kentucky Horse Park Police also have jurisdiction within their geographic areas in Lexington-Fayette County. In addition, the Lexington-Fayette Animal Care and Control exercises law enforcement over animal control issues and the [[Kentucky State Police]], [[Kentucky Vehicle Enforcement|KSP Division of Commercial Vehicle Enforcement]], and [[Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources]] can be seen performing their respective law enforcement duties within the county. Several federal law enforcement agencies, such as the [[FBI]] and [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], maintain satellite offices within Lexington. Prisons in Fayette County include the [[Federal Medical Center, Lexington]], operated by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], and the [[Blackburn Correctional Complex]], operated by the [[Kentucky Department of Corrections]].\n\n===Fire protection===\nAll fire/rescue protection within Lexington-Fayette County (with the exception of the [[Blue Grass Airport]]) is provided by the [[Lexington Fire Department]]. The current department was formed with the merger of the county and city fire departments in 1973. Lexington Fire Department is the largest single fire department in Kentucky with over 600 personnel and 24 individual fire stations broken into five districts (battalions).{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Education==\n{{See also|List of schools in Lexington, Kentucky}}\n[[File:Memorial Hall UK.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Memorial Hall (University of Kentucky)|Memorial Hall]] is the most frequently photographed building at the University of Kentucky.]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census]], of Lexington's population over the age of 25, 22.4% hold a bachelor's degree, 11.4% hold a master's degree,  3.1% hold a professional degree, and 2.6% hold a doctoral degree.

Instead, Lexington has two beltways: inner [[New Circle Road|New Circle Road (KY 4)]] and outer [[Man o' War Boulevard]] (southern semicircle), then numerous [[Roads of Lexington, Kentucky|arterial highways/U.S. routes]] radiate from downtown to the surrounding suburbs and small towns.\n\nLexington suffers considerable [[traffic congestion]] for a city of its size due to the lack of freeways, the proximity of the University of Kentucky to downtown, and the substantial number of [[commuter]]s from outlying towns.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} For traffic relief on northern New Circle Road, [[Citation Boulevard]] is planned<ref>{{cite news|last=Aretakis|first=Rachel|title=Citation Boulevard extension begins|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2013/07/07/2707027/construction-underway-on-citation.html|accessdate=July 7, 2013|newspaper=Herald-Leader|date=August 7, 2013}}</ref> to connect Leestown Road and Russell Cave Road. Other proposed projects include widening/closing certain roads and changing directions from one-way to two-way.\n\n===Air===\n[[Blue Grass Airport]] is Lexington's primary commercial airport. It provides about 13 nonstop flights and a total of 86 flights daily from its two runways. Four major airlines operate connection service at Blue Grass, including [[Allegiant Air]], [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Express]].\n\nOn August 27, 2006, [[Comair Flight 5191]] took off from the wrong runway, and crashed in a nearby field, killing 49 of the 50 passengers, leaving the first officer alive but badly burned. The aircraft involved was a 50-seat Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-100ER, serial number 7472. On August 27, 2011, a memorial sculpture depicting 49 steel birds flying was unveiled and dedicated to the victims.\n\nThe airport is located {{convert|4|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the city center, at the intersection of [[U.S. Route 60 in Kentucky|US 60]] (Versailles Road) and Man o' War Boulevard.\n\nIn addition to commercial airline service, the airport is also home to several private (general aviation) operators, including TACAir, which serves as the airport's fixed-base operator. Flight training and aircraft maintenance services are also offered. A new general aviation runway was dedicated August 4, 2010.\n\n===Public transportation===\n{{Main|Lextran}}\nLexington is served by [[Lextran]], a [[public transportation|public transit]] bus agency operated by LFUCG and has been in existence since 1972. Lextran (officially the Transit Authority of the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government) is a public transportation bus system serving Lexington, Kentucky. It runs bus routes throughout the city, which mostly all converge in downtown at the [[Lexington Transit Center]] located at 220 East Vine. It provides public transportation in the form of buses and lift vans. It operates seven days a week on a total of 24 bus routes from 5:00&nbsp;am until 12:30&nbsp;am. In addition to mainline and paratransit, Lextran contracts with the [[University of Kentucky]] and operates two routes around the campus. It also runs two routes to the [[Bluegrass Community and Technical College]] campuses. Though Lexington and Fayette County are a consolidated government, Lextran does not provide service outside the Lexington city proper due to limited funding.\n\n===Modal characteristics===\nIn 2016, 78.5 percent of working Lexington residents commuted by driving alone, 8.5 percent carpooled, 2 percent used public transportation, and 4 percent walked. About 2.3 of commuters used all other forms of transportation, including taxi, bicycle, and motorcycle. About 4.7 worked out of the home.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Census Reporter|title=Means of Transportation to Work by Age|accessdate=May 6, 2018|url=https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B08101&geo_ids=16000US2146027&primary_geo_id=16000US2146027}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, 7.2 percent of city of Lexington households were without a car, which increased slightly to 7.4 percent in 2016.

Adora's newfound allegiance to the Resistance pits her against her former best friend [[Catra]], whose feelings of abandonment twist her personal ambitions, leading her to become Adora's mortal enemy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/53992/she-ra-reboot-netflix-news|title=She-Ra: first look at Netflix reboot|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, Adora reassembles the Princess Alliance, which successfully defends the rebel stronghold of Bright Moon against the Horde's assault, although engineer princess Entrapta defects to the Horde when she believes her allies have abandoned her. In the second and third seasons, Hordak attempts to build an interdimensional portal which will allow him to contact his creator, the warlord Horde Prime; due to the usual poor military decisions by Glimmer, both Adora and the sword are captured by Catra, providing Entrapta the means to get the portal operational, Catra activates the portal even though it threatens to tear the planet apart, and rebellion leader Queen Angella sacrifices herself to stop it. In the fourth season, friction arises between Adora and her friend Glimmer, Angella's daughter and Bright Moon's new queen, especially when Adora learns that her sword is the key to an ancient superweapon inside Etheria; after the superweapon is started, once again due to poor and selfish decisions by Glimmer, she destroys the sword to prevent the weapon from activating, but not before Etheria is pulled through a portal and becomes accessible to Horde Prime's armada.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{see also|List of She-Ra: Princess of Power and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Aimee Carrero]] as [[She-Ra|Adora / She-Ra]]\n** LaLa Nestor as young Adora\n* [[Karen Fukuhara]] as Glimmer, Princess (later Queen) of Bright Moon\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as [[Catra]]\n** Juliet Donenfeld as young Catra\n* [[Marcus Scribner]] as Bow\n* [[Reshma Shetty]] as Angella, Queen of Bright Moon\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as [[Shadow Weaver (character)|Shadow Weaver]]\n* Keston John as [[Hordak]], Horde Prime, [[Grizzlor]],<ref>{{cite news |title=KESTON JOHN VOICES |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Keston-John/ |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |work=Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref> Additional Voices\n* [[Lauren Ash]] as [[Scorpia (Princesses of Power)|Scorpia]]\n* [[Christine Woods]] as [[Entrapta]], Princess of Dryl\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Perfuma, Princess of Plumeria, Additional Voices\n* [[Jordan Fisher]] as Sea Hawk, Seneschal and Soda Pop\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Mermista, Princess of Salineas\n* Merit Leighton as Frosta, Princess of the Kingdom of Snows\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Castaspella\n* [[Krystal Joy Brown]] as Netossa, rebel princess\n* [[Noelle Stevenson]] as Spinnerella, rebel princess\n* Morla Gorrondona as Light Hope, Additional Voices\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Razz, Additional Voices\n* [[Adam Ray (comedian)|Adam Ray]] as [[Swift Wind]]\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Huntara<ref name=\"io901\">{{cite web |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=She-Ra Season 3 Is Coming This Summer and It's Bringing Geena Davis With It |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/she-ra-season-3-is-coming-this-summer-and-its-bringing-1834681402 |publisher=io9 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |date=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Zehra Fazal]] as Mara\n* Chris Jai Alex as George, one of Bow's fathers\n* Regi Davis as Lance, one of Bow's fathers\n* [[Dana Davis]] as Lonnie, Additional Voices\n* Antony Del Rio as Kyle, Additional Voices\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as King Micah\n** [[Taylor Gray]] as Young Micah\n* Jake Eberle as Norwyn and Tung Lashor\n* [[Jacob Tobia]] as Double Trouble\n* [[Amanda C.

This evil army is led by [[Hordak]], a tyrannical despot who dreams of conquering the whole of Etheria. One day, after getting lost in the woods, Adora finds a magic sword that transforms her into the Princess of Power, [[She-Ra]]. After realizing the suffering that the Horde has inflicted on Etheria and its inhabitants, Adora joins the Resistance in the fight against the Horde through rebuilding the Princess Alliance, a group of other [[magical girl]]s that once all opposed Hordak. Adora's newfound allegiance to the Resistance pits her against her former best friend [[Catra]], whose feelings of abandonment twist her personal ambitions, leading her to become Adora's mortal enemy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/53992/she-ra-reboot-netflix-news|title=She-Ra: first look at Netflix reboot|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, Adora reassembles the Princess Alliance, which successfully defends the rebel stronghold of Bright Moon against the Horde's assault, although engineer princess Entrapta defects to the Horde when she believes her allies have abandoned her. In the second and third seasons, Hordak attempts to build an interdimensional portal which will allow him to contact his creator, the warlord Horde Prime; Catra activates the portal even though it threatens to tear the planet apart, and rebellion leader Queen Angella sacrifices herself to stop it. In the fourth season, friction arises between Adora and her friend Glimmer, Angella's daughter and Bright Moon's new queen, especially when Adora learns that her sword is the key to an ancient superweapon inside Etheria; she destroys the sword to prevent the weapon from activating, but not before Etheria is pulled through a portal and becomes accessible to Horde Prime's armada.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{see also|List of She-Ra: Princess of Power and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Aimee Carrero]] as [[She-Ra|Adora / She-Ra]]\n** LaLa Nestor as young Adora\n* [[Karen Fukuhara]] as Glimmer, Princess (later Queen) of Bright Moon\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as [[Catra]]\n** Juliet Donenfeld as young Catra\n* [[Marcus Scribner]] as Bow\n* [[Reshma Shetty]] as Angella, Queen of Bright Moon\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as [[Shadow Weaver (character)|Shadow Weaver]]\n* Keston John as [[Hordak]], Horde Prime, [[Grizzlor]],<ref>{{cite news |title=KESTON JOHN VOICES |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Keston-John/ |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |work=Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref> Additional Voices\n* [[Lauren Ash]] as [[Scorpia (Princesses of Power)|Scorpia]]\n* [[Christine Woods]] as [[Entrapta]], Princess of Dryl\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Perfuma, Princess of Plumeria, Additional Voices\n* [[Jordan Fisher]] as Sea Hawk, Seneschal and Soda Pop\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Mermista, Princess of Salineas\n* Merit Leighton as Frosta, Princess of the Kingdom of Snows\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Castaspella\n* [[Krystal Joy Brown]] as Netossa, rebel princess\n* [[Noelle Stevenson]] as Spinnerella, rebel princess\n* Morla Gorrondona as Light Hope, Additional Voices\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Razz, Additional Voices\n* [[Adam Ray (comedian)|Adam Ray]] as [[Swift Wind]]\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Huntara<ref name=\"io901\">{{cite web |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=She-Ra Season 3 Is Coming This Summer and It's Bringing Geena Davis With It |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/she-ra-season-3-is-coming-this-summer-and-its-bringing-1834681402 |publisher=io9 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |date=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Zehra Fazal]] as Mara\n* Chris Jai Alex as George, one of Bow's fathers\n* Regi Davis as Lance, one of Bow's fathers\n* [[Dana Davis]] as Lonnie, Additional Voices\n* Antony Del Rio as Kyle, Additional Voices\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as King Micah\n** [[Taylor Gray]] as Young Micah\n* Jake Eberle as Norwyn and Tung Lashor\n* [[Jacob Tobia]] as Double Trouble\n* [[Amanda C.

That duty has been assumed by the Bundespolizei ([[Federal Police (Austria)|Federal Police]]).\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Military history of Austria}}\n{{See also|Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars}}\n\nBetween 1918 and 1920, the Austrian semi-regular army was called Volkswehr (\"People's Defence\"), and fought against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] army units occupying parts of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. It has been known as \"Bundesheer\" since then, except when Austria was a part of [[Nazi Germany]] (1938\u20131945; see [[Anschluss]]). The Austrian Army did develop a defence plan in 1938 against Germany{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, but politics prevented it from being implemented.\n\nWorld War II role of the \"Bundesheer\":\n*Elements of Austrian Army became [[9th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)]] \n*Elements of Austrian Army became [[44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]]\n*4th Austrian Division became the [[45th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]]\n\n\nIn 1955, Austria issued its [[Declaration of Neutrality]], meaning that it would never join a military alliance. The Austrian Armed Forces' main purpose since then has been the protection of Austria's neutrality. Its relationship with NATO is limited to the [[Partnership for Peace]] program.<ref>[https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-mission-to-nato/ Austrian Mission to NATO]</ref>\n\nWith the end of the [[Cold War]], the Austrian military have increasingly assisted the border police in controlling the influx of illegal immigrants through Austrian borders.  The [[Yugoslav Wars|war]] in the neighbouring Balkans resulted in the lifting of the restrictions on the range of weaponry of the Austrian military that had been imposed by the [[Austrian State Treaty]].\n\n{{see also|Structure of the Austrian Armed Forces in 1989}}\n\n<gallery>\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-08388, Klagenfurth, Einzug des Bundesheeres.jpg|Troops entering [[Klagenfurt]] after a manoeuvre in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (September, 1929)\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-09245, \u00d6sterreich, Skitruppen beim Man\u00f6ver.jpg|Austrian [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] in 1930\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-09448, Wien, Parade des Bundesheeres.jpg|Austrian Armed Forces celebrating their 10th anniversary in March 1930 at the [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[Heldenplatz]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12705, \u00d6sterreich, Man\u00f6ver der Gebirgsartillerie.jpg|Austrian mountain artillerymen during a manoeuvre in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12135, \u00d6sterreich, Fahnenweihe bei der Armee.jpg|New \"Standarten\" (flags) of Austrian Army units being consecrated by a Catholic priest in [[Mattersburg]], [[Burgenland]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12181, \u00d6sterreich, Pioniere beim Br\u00fcckenbau.jpg|Engineers building a bridge across the [[Danube]] during a manoeuvre in 1931\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-00805, Wien, Februark\u00e4mpfe, Bundesheer 2.jpg|Soldiers of the Austrian Army in Vienna, during the [[Austrian Civil War]] in 1934\nFile:Ausbildung in der Gruppe (18480913048).jpg|Troops of predecessor organisation ''[[B-Gendarmerie]]'' training with M1 Garands during the 1950s\n</gallery>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe main constitutional tasks of today's Austrian military are:\n* to protect the constitutionally established institutions and the population's democratic freedoms.\n* to maintain order and security inside the country.\n* to render assistance in the case of natural catastrophes and disasters of exceptional magnitude.\n\n== Organization ==\n{{Main|Structure of the Austrian Armed Forces}}\n\n[[Image:Austria Army Structure 2016.png|thumb|right|640px|Structure of the Austrian Army after the Bundesheerreform in 2016]]\n[[Image:Bataillon de la garde autrichienne.jpg|thumb|Austrian Guard Company during the [[Bastille Day parade]]]]\n[[Image:VFR Ost\u00f6sterreich Allentsteig 5845679463.jpg|thumb|[[Allentsteig]] (157 km\u00b2) is the largest [[Proving ground|training area]] in Austria.]]\n[[Image:Zeltweg und Umgebung von Norden Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zeltweg Air Base]]]]\n[[Image:J\u00e4gerbataillon 17 (9082965145).jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of the 17th Infantry Battalion during a manoeuvre]]\n<!--[[Image:J\u00e4gerbataillon 23 bmlv gv at 2.JPG|thumb|right|Austrian [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] in the [[Alps]]]]\n[[Image:Bundesheer at Airpower11 04.jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers of the 25th Infantry Battalion exiting a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]]]]\n[[File:Austrian forces at Combined Resolve II (14236023945).jpg|thumb|Austrian soldiers training with the [[Steyr AUG|StG 77]]]]-->\n\nUnder the constitution, the [[President of Austria|President]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. In reality, the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] has the decision-making authority, exercised through the Minister for National Defence. The Chancellor also chairs the National Defence Council, which has as its members a vice-chairman, the minister for national defence, an appointee of this minister, the Chief of the General Staff, and a parliamentary representative. The minister for national defence, acting in co-operation with the minister for interior, coordinates the work of the four major committees under the National Defence Council: the Military Defence Committee; the Civil Defence Committee; the Economic Defence Committee; and the Psychological Defence Committee. The Chief of the General Staff acts as the senior military adviser to the Minister for National Defence, assists the minister in the exercise of his authority, and, as the head of the general staff, is responsible for planning. However, the army commander exercises direct operational control of the Bundesheer in both peacetime and wartime.\n\nArticle 79 of the constitution, as amended in 1985, states that the Army is entrusted with the military defence of the country. Insofar as the legally constituted civil authority requests its co-operation, the army is further charged with protecting constitutional institutions and their capacity to act, as well as the democratic freedoms of the inhabitants; maintaining order and security in the interior; and rendering aid in disasters and mishaps of extraordinary scope. In administering the armed forces, the Ministry for National Defence is organized into four principal sections and the inspectorate general: Section I deals with legal and legislative matters; Section II handles personnel and recruitment matters, including discipline and grievances; Section III is concerned with troop command, schools, and other facilities, and it also comprises departments G-1 through G-5 as well as a separate department for air operations; and Section IV deals with procurement and supply, quartermaster matters, armaments, and ordnance (see fig. 12).\n\nThe general troop inspectorate is a separate section of the ministry with responsibility for co-ordination and fulfilment of the missions of the armed forces. It encompasses a general staff department, an attach\u00e9 department, and planning and inspection groups.\n\nThe armed forces consist solely of the army, of which the air force is considered a constituent part. In 1993, the total active complement of the armed forces was 52,000, of whom 20,000 to 30,000 were conscripts undergoing training of six to eight months. The army had 46,000 personnel on active duty (including an estimated 19,500 conscripts), and the air force had 6,000 personnel (2,400 conscripts).<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+at0157%29 which quotes \"Jane's Defence Weekly [London], 17, No. 4, January 24, 1992, 117-24. \"</ref>\n\n===Army===\n====Cold War structure====\n{{see|1989 Austrian Army order of battle}}\n\nUnder the area defence strategy, which had determined the army's organizational structure until 1993, the army was divided into three principal elements: the standing alert force (''Bereitschaftstruppe'') of active units, including the air division; the mobile militia (''Mobile Landwehr''), organized as eight mechanized reserve brigades to be deployed to key danger spots in the event of mobilization; and the stationary militia (''Raumgebundene Landwehr'') of twenty-six reserve infantry regiments organized for territorial defence. Both the mobile militia and the stationary militia were brought up to strength only in times of mobilization or during periods allotted for refresher training, usually three weeks in June. Training of conscripts was conducted by twenty-eight training and equipment-holding regiments (''Landwehrstammregimenter''). On mobilization, these regiments would disband, with their cadre reassigned to lead reserve units or form replacement regiments and battalions.\n\nAt the army level were a headquarters, guard, and special forces battalions and an artillery battalion at cadre strength. Two corps headquarters, one in the east at Graz and one in the west at Salzburg, would, on mobilization, command the provincially organized units in their respective zones. Each corps included artillery, antitank, antiaircraft, and engineering battalions, and a logistics regiment, all on a cadre basis.\n\nEach of the nine provincial military commands supervised the training and maintenance activities of their training and equipment-holding regiments. On mobilization, these nine commands would convert to a divisional headquarters commanding mobile militia, stationary militia, and other independent units.\n\nThe only active units immediately available in an emergency were those of the standing alert force of some 15,000 career soldiers supplemented by eight-month conscripts. The force was organized as a mechanized division consisting of three armored infantry brigades. Each brigade was composed of one tank battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, and one self-propelled artillery battalion. Two of the brigades had antitank battalions equipped with self-propelled weapons. The divisional headquarters was at Baden near Vienna; the three brigades were based in separate locations, also in the northeast of the country.\n\n====Post-Cold War structure====\nThe New Army Structure\u2014the reorganization plan announced in late 1991 and scheduled to be in place sometime in 1995\u2014replaces the previous two-corps structure with one of three corps. The new corps is headquartered at Baden, with responsibility for the two northeastern provinces of Lower Austria and Upper Austria. Army headquarters will be eliminated, as will the divisional structure for the three standing brigades. The three corps\u2014in effect, regional commands\u2014will be directly subordinate to the general troop inspector. The three mechanized brigades will be placed directly under the new Third Corps at Baden, although in the future one brigade may be assigned to each of the three corps. The mobile militia will be reduced from eight to six mechanized brigades. Each of the nine provincial commands will have at least one militia regiment of two to six battalions as well as local defence companies.\n\nTotal personnel strength\u2014both standing forces and reserves\u2014is to be materially contracted under the new plan. The fully mobilized army will decline in strength from 200,000 to 120,000. The standing alert force will be reduced from 15,000 to 10,000. Reaction time is to be radically shortened so that part of the standing alert force can be deployed within hours to a crisis zone (for example, one adjacent to the border with Slovenia). A task force ready for immediate deployment will be maintained by one of the mechanized brigades on a rotational basis. Separate militia training companies to which all conscripts are assigned will be dismantled; in the future, conscripts will undergo basic training within their mobilization companies. Conscripts in the final stages of their training could supplement the standing forces by being poised for operational deployment at short notice.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+at0158%29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317171915/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+at0158%29|date=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nPromotion is not based solely on merit but on position attained, level of education, and seniority. Officers with advanced degrees (for which study at the National Defence Academy qualifies) can expect to attain grade VIII before reaching the retirement age of sixty to sixty-five. Those with a baccalaureate degree can expect to reach grade VII (colonel), and those without university training will retire as captains or majors. Career NCOs form part of the same comprehensive personnel structure. It is common for NCOs to transfer at some stage in their careers to civilian status at the equivalent grade, either in the Ministry for National Defence or in the police or prison services after further training.\n\n===Austrian Air Force===\n{{Main|Austrian Air Force}}\n\nAustria's air force ({{lang-de|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte}}) has as its missions the defence of Austrian airspace, tactical support of Austrian ground forces, reconnaissance and military transport, and search-and-rescue support when requested by civil authorities.\n\nUntil 1985, when the first of twenty-four [[Saab 35 Draken]] were delivered, the country had remained essentially without the capacity to contest violations of its airspace. The Drakens, reconditioned after having served the [[Swedish Air Force]] since the early 1960s, were armed, in accordance with the restrictions on missiles in the State Treaty of 1955, only with a cannon. However, following Austria's revised interpretation of its obligations under the treaty, a decision was made in 1993 to procure [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]]s. The first of these missiles were purchased from Swedish air force inventory, while later a higher performance model was acquired directly from the United States, with deliveries commencing in 1995. French [[Mistral (missile)|Mistral]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s systems were purchased to add ground-based protection against air attack. The first of the systems arrived in Austria in 1993; final deliveries concluded in 1996.\n\nThe Drakens were retired in 2005 and 12 [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]] were leased from Switzerland to avoid a gap in the Austrian air defence capabilities until the first Austrian [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] units became operational in 2007. Besides one squadron of 15 Eurofighter Typhoons, the air force has a squadron with 28 [[Saab 105]] trainers, which double as reconnaissance and [[close air support]] planes.\n\nThe helicopter fleet includes 23 [[Bell UH-1N Twin Huey|AB 212]] helicopters used as light transport. 24 French [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] are in service as search-and-rescue helicopters. Furthermore, the air force fields 10 [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58B Kiowa]] as light scout helicopters. After Austria had to request assistance from the [[United States Army]], [[Swiss Air Force]], [[French Air Force]], and German [[Bundeswehr]] to evacuate survivors after the 1999 [[Galt\u00fcr Avalanche]] a decision was taken to equip the Austrian Air Force with medium-sized transport helicopters. Thus in 2002 Austria acquired 9 [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters. In 2003 the air force received 3 [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130K Hercules]] transport aircraft to support the armed forces in their UN peacekeeping and humanitarian activities.\n\n=== Austrian Special Operations Forces ===\n{{Main|Jagdkommando}}\n\nThe '''Jagdkommando''' (lit. ''Hunting Command'') is the Austrian Armed Forces' [[Special Operations]] group. The duties of this elite unit match those of its foreign counterparts, such as the [[United States Army Special Forces]] and [[British Special Air Service]] being amongst others [[counter-terrorism]] and [[counter-insurgency]]. Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialization of conventional units.\n\n== Unit Locations ==\n{{Location map+ | Austria\n| width = 960\n| float = center\n| caption = <center>Unit locations in 2018</center>\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Air Force Command\n    | position = top\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 49 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 02 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>Radar Btn</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 49 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 02 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Zeltweg Air Base|Zeltweg]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 12 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 44 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Linz Airport|H\u00f6rsching]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 11 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Brumowski Air Base|Langenlebarn]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 19 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 06 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Military Airport Aigen im Ennstal|Aigen]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 32 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 08 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Army Cmd\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 04 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 26 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>Guard Btn</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = red pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 11 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 21 | lon_dir = E\n}}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Rapid Mis.\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 25 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 35 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>19 Infantry</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 04 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 19 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>33 Infantry</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 07 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 28 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>3 Recon</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Orange pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 34 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 34 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label =  <small>3 Engineer</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Black pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 21 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = 4 Mech.

the armed forces, followed by four days of active service every two years for training and inspection. In 1971 the period of initial service was reduced to six months, followed by a total of sixty days of refresher training in the reserves. In the early 1990s, about 45,000 conscripts completed their initial military training every year, and 80,000 reservists participated in some form of exercises each year.\n\nReducing the mobilization strength of the army to 120,000 under the New Army Structure plan is to be accomplished in part by limiting initial training of recruits to six months, followed by reducing the period allotted for refresher training from twenty years to ten years. Each reservist is to receive training over a twelve-day period every second year during his first ten years of reserve duty, generally not extending beyond the time he reaches his mid-thirties. The reduced need for conscripts corresponds to a lower pool of young men because of a declining birth rate. The availability of about 40,000 fit trainees annually in 1993 was expected to fall to barely 30,000 by 2000 and to 26,000 by 2015.\n\nIn 2006 conscription was reduced to six months total. Mandatory reserve training was abolished. Since then the army reserve battalions (Miliz) are suffering from a lack of new reservists and are therefore overaging.\n\nUnder a 1974 law, conscientious objectors can be assigned work as medical orderlies, or other occupations in lieu of military service. Exemptions from service are liberally granted\u2014in 1992 about 12,000 persons were exempted, a great increase over the 1991 total of 4,500. The increase occurred after a new law, valid only for 1992 and 1993, no longer required young men to present their objections to the military in a credible way. Previously, that had not been the case. In 1990, for example, two young men rejected by the alternate service commission on the grounds that they did not present their beliefs in a credible manner were sentenced to prison terms of three months and one month, respectively.\n\nConscripts may attain the rank of private first class by the completion of initial training. Those with leadership potential may serve a longer period to obtain noncommissioned officer (NCO) status in the militia. Those volunteering for the career service can, after three to four years, apply to attend the NCO academy and later a senior NCO course to qualify as warrant officers. Both regular and militia officer candidates undergo a one-year program of basic training. After a further three years, regular officer candidates attending the military academy at Wiener Neustadt and militia officer candidates undergoing periodic intensified refresher training qualify as second lieutenants. The reserve obligation of conscripts generally ends by the time they reach their mid-thirties; NCOs and officers usually end their reserve status at a later age depending on their rank and specialization. By the early 1990s, some 1.3 million men had completed their initial service and refresher training obligations and had no further active-duty commitment.\n\nThe military personnel system is an integral part of a comprehensive civil service system. The nine officer ranks from officer candidate through general correspond to grades I through IX of the civil service system. The highest grade, IX, may be occupied by a section chief (undersecretary), a career ambassador, or a three-star general. A grade VIII position may be held by a departmental counselor, a career minister, or a brigadier general. Salary levels are the same for both civil and military personnel in the equivalent grades, although various allowances may be added, such as flight pay or hazardous-duty pay.\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:420 height:350\nPlotArea = width:330 height:250 left:50 bottom:70\nLegend = columns:1 left:52 top:40 columnwidth:100\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod = from:0 till:250000\nTimeAxis = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:25000 start:0\nColors=\n id:Manpower value:blue legend:Manpower\n\nPlotData=\n width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\n\n color:Manpower\n bar:1956 from:1 till:23000\n bar:1966 from:1 till:50000\n bar:1976 from:1 till:144000\n bar:1986 from:1 till:240000\n bar:1996 from:1 till:120000\n bar:2006 from:1 till:55000\n bar:2014 from:1 till:53000\n\nTextData=\n pos:(249,310) text:\"Total mobilized strength\"\n</timeline>\n\nThe system of promotion in the Austrian military, which offers no incentive for early retirement, means that the military is top-heavy with senior officers. The New Army Structure, which is intended to result in many fewer active-duty and reserve commands, compounds the difficulty. Personnel changes can be implemented only gradually, as the surplus of officers shrinks by attrition. In 1991, the army had four officers of general rank, fifty-nine at the rank of brigadier general (one star), 155 colonels, and 254 lieutenant colonels. The education of career officers is conducted at the Maria Theresia Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt, forty-five kilometres south of Vienna, which was founded in 1752. Young men who have completed their university entrance requirements are eligible to compete for places. The three-year course graduated 212 students in 1990. At the National Defence Academy in Vienna, which has a curriculum comparable to those of the National Defence University and the Army War College in the United States, operational and troop commanders of field-grade rank study for three years in preparation for general staff and command positions. The NCO school is located at Enns near Linz. Troop schools provide continuous specialized courses for officers and NCOs in artillery, air defence, armour, combat engineering, communications, and the like.\n\nWomen have been accepted for service in the Austrian armed forces since 1998. All service branches are open for female volunteers. In a public opinion survey in 1988, about 66 percent of those polled approved of opening the military to voluntary service by women; only nine percent favoured obligatory service.\n\n==Appearance==\n\nSince 2019 the new service uniform with a six colour camouflage pattern is issued, but the old service uniform in olive is still widespread and will be taken out of service very slowly.<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/cms/artikel.php?ID=9906</ref><ref>https://kurier.at/politik/inland/neue-tarnuniformen-ab-heute-ist-bundesheer-in-camouflage-look-im-einsatz/400424153</ref><ref>https://www.spartanat.com/2019/03/oesterreich-neue-tarnuniformen-ab-2018/</ref> The dress uniform is grey, for formal occasions a white uniform may be worn.

That duty has been assumed by the Bundespolizei ([[Federal Police (Austria)|Federal Police]]).\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|Military history of Austria}}\n{{See also|Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars}}\n\nBetween 1918 and 1920, the Austrian semi-regular army was called Volkswehr (\"People's Defence\"), and fought against [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] army units occupying parts of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. It has been known as \"Bundesheer\" since then, except when Austria was a part of [[Nazi Germany]] (1938\u20131945; see [[Anschluss]]). The Austrian Army did develop a defence plan in 1938 against Germany{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}, but politics prevented it from being implemented.\n\nWorld War II role of the \"Bundesheer\":\n*Elements of Austrian Army became [[9th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)]] \n*Elements of Austrian Army became [[44th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]]\n*4th Austrian Division became the [[45th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]]\n\n\nIn 1955, Austria issued its [[Declaration of Neutrality]], meaning that it would never join a military alliance. The Austrian Armed Forces' main purpose since then has been the protection of Austria's neutrality. Its relationship with NATO is limited to the [[Partnership for Peace]] program.<ref>[https://www.bmeia.gv.at/en/austrian-mission-to-nato/ Austrian Mission to NATO]</ref>\n\nWith the end of the [[Cold War]], the Austrian military have increasingly assisted the border police in controlling the influx of illegal immigrants through Austrian borders.  The [[Yugoslav Wars|war]] in the neighbouring Balkans resulted in the lifting of the restrictions on the range of weaponry of the Austrian military that had been imposed by the [[Austrian State Treaty]].\n\n{{see also|Structure of the Austrian Armed Forces in 1989}}\n\n<gallery>\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-08388, Klagenfurth, Einzug des Bundesheeres.jpg|Troops entering [[Klagenfurt]] after a manoeuvre in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (September, 1929)\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-09245, \u00d6sterreich, Skitruppen beim Man\u00f6ver.jpg|Austrian [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] in 1930\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-09448, Wien, Parade des Bundesheeres.jpg|Austrian Armed Forces celebrating their 10th anniversary in March 1930 at the [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[Heldenplatz]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12705, \u00d6sterreich, Man\u00f6ver der Gebirgsartillerie.jpg|Austrian mountain artillerymen during a manoeuvre in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12135, \u00d6sterreich, Fahnenweihe bei der Armee.jpg|New \"Standarten\" (flags) of Austrian Army units being consecrated by a Catholic priest in [[Mattersburg]], [[Burgenland]]\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-12181, \u00d6sterreich, Pioniere beim Br\u00fcckenbau.jpg|Engineers building a bridge across the [[Danube]] during a manoeuvre in 1931\nBundesarchiv Bild 102-00805, Wien, Februark\u00e4mpfe, Bundesheer 2.jpg|Soldiers of the Austrian Army in Vienna, during the [[Austrian Civil War]] in 1934\nFile:Ausbildung in der Gruppe (18480913048).jpg|Troops of predecessor organisation ''[[B-Gendarmerie]]'' training with M1 Garands during the 1950s\n</gallery>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe main constitutional tasks of today's Austrian military are:\n* to protect the constitutionally established institutions and the population's democratic freedoms.\n* to maintain order and security inside the country.\n* to render assistance in the case of natural catastrophes and disasters of exceptional magnitude.\n\n== Organization ==\n{{Main|Structure of the Austrian Armed Forces}}\n\n[[Image:Austria Army Structure 2016.png|thumb|right|640px|Structure of the Austrian Army after the Bundesheerreform in 2016]]\n[[Image:Bataillon de la garde autrichienne.jpg|thumb|Austrian Guard Company during the [[Bastille Day parade]]]]\n[[Image:VFR Ost\u00f6sterreich Allentsteig 5845679463.jpg|thumb|[[Allentsteig]] (157 km\u00b2) is the largest [[Proving ground|training area]] in Austria.]]\n[[Image:Zeltweg und Umgebung von Norden Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zeltweg Air Base]]]]\n[[Image:J\u00e4gerbataillon 17 (9082965145).jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers of the 17th Infantry Battalion during a manoeuvre]]\n<!--[[Image:J\u00e4gerbataillon 23 bmlv gv at 2.JPG|thumb|right|Austrian [[Gebirgsj\u00e4ger]] in the [[Alps]]]]\n[[Image:Bundesheer at Airpower11 04.jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers of the 25th Infantry Battalion exiting a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130 Hercules]]]]\n[[File:Austrian forces at Combined Resolve II (14236023945).jpg|thumb|Austrian soldiers training with the [[Steyr AUG|StG 77]]]]-->\n\nUnder the constitution, the [[President of Austria|President]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. In reality, the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] has the decision-making authority, exercised through the Minister for National Defence. The Chancellor also chairs the National Defence Council, which has as its members a vice-chairman, the minister for national defence, an appointee of this minister, the Chief of the General Staff, and a parliamentary representative. The minister for national defence, acting in co-operation with the minister for interior, coordinates the work of the four major committees under the National Defence Council: the Military Defence Committee; the Civil Defence Committee; the Economic Defence Committee; and the Psychological Defence Committee. The Chief of the General Staff acts as the senior military adviser to the Minister for National Defence, assists the minister in the exercise of his authority, and, as the head of the general staff, is responsible for planning. However, the army commander exercises direct operational control of the Bundesheer in both peacetime and wartime.\n\nArticle 79 of the constitution, as amended in 1985, states that the Army is entrusted with the military defence of the country. Insofar as the legally constituted civil authority requests its co-operation, the army is further charged with protecting constitutional institutions and their capacity to act, as well as the democratic freedoms of the inhabitants; maintaining order and security in the interior; and rendering aid in disasters and mishaps of extraordinary scope. In administering the armed forces, the Ministry for National Defence is organized into four principal sections and the inspectorate general: Section I deals with legal and legislative matters; Section II handles personnel and recruitment matters, including discipline and grievances; Section III is concerned with troop command, schools, and other facilities, and it also comprises departments G-1 through G-5 as well as a separate department for air operations; and Section IV deals with procurement and supply, quartermaster matters, armaments, and ordnance (see fig. 12).\n\nThe general troop inspectorate is a separate section of the ministry with responsibility for co-ordination and fulfilment of the missions of the armed forces. It encompasses a general staff department, an attach\u00e9 department, and planning and inspection groups.\n\nThe armed forces consist solely of the army, of which the air force is considered a constituent part. In 1993, the total active complement of the armed forces was 52,000, of whom 20,000 to 30,000 were conscripts undergoing training of six to eight months. The army had 46,000 personnel on active duty (including an estimated 19,500 conscripts), and the air force had 6,000 personnel (2,400 conscripts).<ref>http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+at0157%29 which quotes \"Jane's Defence Weekly [London], 17, No. 4, January 24, 1992, 117-24. \"</ref>\n\n===Army===\n====Cold War structure====\n{{see|1989 Austrian Army order of battle}}\n\nUnder the area defence strategy, which had determined the army's organizational structure until 1993, the army was divided into three principal elements: the standing alert force (''Bereitschaftstruppe'') of active units, including the air division; the mobile militia (''Mobile Landwehr''), organized as eight mechanized reserve brigades to be deployed to key danger spots in the event of mobilization; and the stationary militia (''Raumgebundene Landwehr'') of twenty-six reserve infantry regiments organized for territorial defence. Both the mobile militia and the stationary militia were brought up to strength only in times of mobilization or during periods allotted for refresher training, usually three weeks in June. Training of conscripts was conducted by twenty-eight training and equipment-holding regiments (''Landwehrstammregimenter''). On mobilization, these regiments would disband, with their cadre reassigned to lead reserve units or form replacement regiments and battalions.\n\nAt the army level were a headquarters, guard, and special forces battalions and an artillery battalion at cadre strength. Two corps headquarters, one in the east at Graz and one in the west at Salzburg, would, on mobilization, command the provincially organized units in their respective zones. Each corps included artillery, antitank, antiaircraft, and engineering battalions, and a logistics regiment, all on a cadre basis.\n\nEach of the nine provincial military commands supervised the training and maintenance activities of their training and equipment-holding regiments. On mobilization, these nine commands would convert to a divisional headquarters commanding mobile militia, stationary militia, and other independent units.\n\nThe only active units immediately available in an emergency were those of the standing alert force of some 15,000 career soldiers supplemented by eight-month conscripts. The force was organized as a mechanized division consisting of three armored infantry brigades. Each brigade was composed of one tank battalion, one mechanized infantry battalion, and one self-propelled artillery battalion. Two of the brigades had antitank battalions equipped with self-propelled weapons. The divisional headquarters was at Baden near Vienna; the three brigades were based in separate locations, also in the northeast of the country.\n\n====Post-Cold War structure====\nThe New Army Structure\u2014the reorganization plan announced in late 1991 and scheduled to be in place sometime in 1995\u2014replaces the previous two-corps structure with one of three corps. The new corps is headquartered at Baden, with responsibility for the two northeastern provinces of Lower Austria and Upper Austria. Army headquarters will be eliminated, as will the divisional structure for the three standing brigades. The three corps\u2014in effect, regional commands\u2014will be directly subordinate to the general troop inspector. The three mechanized brigades will be placed directly under the new Third Corps at Baden, although in the future one brigade may be assigned to each of the three corps. The mobile militia will be reduced from eight to six mechanized brigades. Each of the nine provincial commands will have at least one militia regiment of two to six battalions as well as local defence companies.\n\nTotal personnel strength\u2014both standing forces and reserves\u2014is to be materially contracted under the new plan. The fully mobilized army will decline in strength from 200,000 to 120,000. The standing alert force will be reduced from 15,000 to 10,000. Reaction time is to be radically shortened so that part of the standing alert force can be deployed within hours to a crisis zone (for example, one adjacent to the border with Slovenia). A task force ready for immediate deployment will be maintained by one of the mechanized brigades on a rotational basis. Separate militia training companies to which all conscripts are assigned will be dismantled; in the future, conscripts will undergo basic training within their mobilization companies. Conscripts in the final stages of their training could supplement the standing forces by being poised for operational deployment at short notice.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+at0158%29] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317171915/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+at0158%29|date=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nPromotion is not based solely on merit but on position attained, level of education, and seniority. Officers with advanced degrees (for which study at the National Defence Academy qualifies) can expect to attain grade VIII before reaching the retirement age of sixty to sixty-five. Those with a baccalaureate degree can expect to reach grade VII (colonel), and those without university training will retire as captains or majors. Career NCOs form part of the same comprehensive personnel structure. It is common for NCOs to transfer at some stage in their careers to civilian status at the equivalent grade, either in the Ministry for National Defence or in the police or prison services after further training.\n\n===Austrian Air Force===\n{{Main|Austrian Air Force}}\n\nAustria's air force ({{lang-de|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte}}) has as its missions the defence of Austrian airspace, tactical support of Austrian ground forces, reconnaissance and military transport, and search-and-rescue support when requested by civil authorities.\n\nUntil 1985, when the first of twenty-four [[Saab 35 Draken]] were delivered, the country had remained essentially without the capacity to contest violations of its airspace. The Drakens, reconditioned after having served the [[Swedish Air Force]] since the early 1960s, were armed, in accordance with the restrictions on missiles in the State Treaty of 1955, only with a cannon. However, following Austria's revised interpretation of its obligations under the treaty, a decision was made in 1993 to procure [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]]s. The first of these missiles were purchased from Swedish air force inventory, while later a higher performance model was acquired directly from the United States, with deliveries commencing in 1995. French [[Mistral (missile)|Mistral]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s systems were purchased to add ground-based protection against air attack. The first of the systems arrived in Austria in 1993; final deliveries concluded in 1996.\n\nThe Drakens were retired in 2005 and 12 [[Northrop F-5|F-5E Tiger II]] were leased from Switzerland to avoid a gap in the Austrian air defence capabilities until the first Austrian [[Eurofighter Typhoon]] units became operational in 2007. Besides one squadron of 15 Eurofighter Typhoons, the air force has a squadron with 28 [[Saab 105]] trainers, which double as reconnaissance and [[close air support]] planes.\n\nThe helicopter fleet includes 23 [[Bell UH-1N Twin Huey|AB 212]] helicopters used as light transport. 24 French [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] are in service as search-and-rescue helicopters. Furthermore, the air force fields 10 [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58B Kiowa]] as light scout helicopters. After Austria had to request assistance from the [[United States Army]], [[Swiss Air Force]], [[French Air Force]], and German [[Bundeswehr]] to evacuate survivors after the 1999 [[Galt\u00fcr Avalanche]] a decision was taken to equip the Austrian Air Force with medium-sized transport helicopters. Thus in 2002 Austria acquired 9 [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters. In 2003 the air force received 3 [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130K Hercules]] transport aircraft to support the armed forces in their UN peacekeeping and humanitarian activities.\n\n=== Austrian Special Operations Forces ===\n{{Main|Jagdkommando}}\n\nThe '''Jagdkommando''' (lit. ''Hunting Command'') is the Austrian Armed Forces' [[Special Operations]] group. The duties of this elite unit match those of its foreign counterparts, such as the [[United States Army Special Forces]] and [[British Special Air Service]] being amongst others [[counter-terrorism]] and [[counter-insurgency]]. Jagdkommando soldiers are highly trained professionals whose thorough and rigorous training enables them to take over when tasks or situations outgrow the capabilities and specialization of conventional units.\n\n== Unit Locations ==\n{{Location map+ | Austria\n| width = 960\n| float = center\n| caption = <center>Unit locations in 2018</center>\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Air Force Command\n    | position = top\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 49 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 02 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>Radar Btn</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 49 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 13 | lon_min = 02 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Zeltweg Air Base|Zeltweg]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 12 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 44 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Linz Airport|H\u00f6rsching]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 11 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Brumowski Air Base|Langenlebarn]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 19 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 06 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>[[Military Airport Aigen im Ennstal|Aigen]]</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Blue 0080ff pog.svg\n    | marksize = 10\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 32 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 14 | lon_min = 08 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Army Cmd\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 04 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 26 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>Guard Btn</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = red pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 11 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 21 | lon_dir = E\n}}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = Rapid Mis.\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 12\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 25 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 35 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>19 Infantry</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 47 | lat_min = 04 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 19 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>33 Infantry</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Green 008000 pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 07 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 28 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = <small>3 Recon</small>\n    | position = left\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Orange pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 34 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 16 | lon_min = 34 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label =  <small>3 Engineer</small>\n    | position = right\n    | background = white\n    | mark = Black pog.svg\n    | marksize = 8\n    | lat_deg = 48 | lat_min = 14 | lat_dir = N\n    | lon_deg = 15 | lon_min = 21 | lon_dir = E\n  }}\n  {{Location map~| Austria\n    | label = 4 Mech.

2006]]\n[[Image:Austrian forces at Combined Resolve II (14236022975).jpg|thumb|right|Paratroopers of the 25th Infantry Battalion]]\n\nUntil 1971 Austrian males were obligated to serve nine months in the armed forces, followed by four days of active service every two years for training and inspection. In 1971 the period of initial service was reduced to six months, followed by a total of sixty days of refresher training in the reserves. In the early 1990s, about 45,000 conscripts completed their initial military training every year, and 80,000 reservists participated in some form of exercises each year.\n\nReducing the mobilization strength of the army to 120,000 under the New Army Structure plan is to be accomplished in part by limiting initial training of recruits to six months, followed by reducing the period allotted for refresher training from twenty years to ten years. Each reservist is to receive training over a twelve-day period every second year during his first ten years of reserve duty, generally not extending beyond the time he reaches his mid-thirties. The reduced need for conscripts corresponds to a lower pool of young men because of a declining birth rate. The availability of about 40,000 fit trainees annually in 1993 was expected to fall to barely 30,000 by 2000 and to 26,000 by 2015.\n\nIn 2006 conscription was reduced to six months total. Mandatory reserve training was abolished. Since then the army reserve battalions (Miliz) are suffering from a lack of new reservists and are therefore overaging.\n\nUnder a 1974 law, conscientious objectors can be assigned work as medical orderlies, or other occupations in lieu of military service. Exemptions from service are liberally granted\u2014in 1992 about 12,000 persons were exempted, a great increase over the 1991 total of 4,500. The increase occurred after a new law, valid only for 1992 and 1993, no longer required young men to present their objections to the military in a credible way. Previously, that had not been the case. In 1990, for example, two young men rejected by the alternate service commission on the grounds that they did not present their beliefs in a credible manner were sentenced to prison terms of three months and one month, respectively.\n\nConscripts may attain the rank of private first class by the completion of initial training. Those with leadership potential may serve a longer period to obtain noncommissioned officer (NCO) status in the militia. Those volunteering for the career service can, after three to four years, apply to attend the NCO academy and later a senior NCO course to qualify as warrant officers. Both regular and militia officer candidates undergo a one-year program of basic training. After a further three years, regular officer candidates attending the military academy at Wiener Neustadt and militia officer candidates undergoing periodic intensified refresher training qualify as second lieutenants. The reserve obligation of conscripts generally ends by the time they reach their mid-thirties; NCOs and officers usually end their reserve status at a later age depending on their rank and specialization. By the early 1990s, some 1.3 million men had completed their initial service and refresher training obligations and had no further active-duty commitment.\n\nThe military personnel system is an integral part of a comprehensive civil service system. The nine officer ranks from officer candidate through general correspond to grades I through IX of the civil service system. The highest grade, IX, may be occupied by a section chief (undersecretary), a career ambassador, or a three-star general. A grade VIII position may be held by a departmental counselor, a career minister, or a brigadier general. Salary levels are the same for both civil and military personnel in the equivalent grades, although various allowances may be added, such as flight pay or hazardous-duty pay.\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:420 height:350\nPlotArea = width:330 height:250 left:50 bottom:70\nLegend = columns:1 left:52 top:40 columnwidth:100\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod = from:0 till:250000\nTimeAxis = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:25000 start:0\nColors=\n id:Manpower value:blue legend:Manpower\n\nPlotData=\n width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:7\n\n color:Manpower\n bar:1956 from:1 till:23000\n bar:1966 from:1 till:50000\n bar:1976 from:1 till:144000\n bar:1986 from:1 till:240000\n bar:1996 from:1 till:120000\n bar:2006 from:1 till:55000\n bar:2014 from:1 till:53000\n\nTextData=\n pos:(249,310) text:\"Total mobilized strength\"\n</timeline>\n\nThe system of promotion in the Austrian military, which offers no incentive for early retirement, means that the military is top-heavy with senior officers. The New Army Structure, which is intended to result in many fewer active-duty and reserve commands, compounds the difficulty. Personnel changes can be implemented only gradually, as the surplus of officers shrinks by attrition. In 1991, the army had four officers of general rank, fifty-nine at the rank of brigadier general (one star), 155 colonels, and 254 lieutenant colonels. The education of career officers is conducted at the Maria Theresia Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt, forty-five kilometres south of Vienna, which was founded in 1752. Young men who have completed their university entrance requirements are eligible to compete for places. The three-year course graduated 212 students in 1990. At the National Defence Academy in Vienna, which has a curriculum comparable to those of the National Defence University and the Army War College in the United States, operational and troop commanders of field-grade rank study for three years in preparation for general staff and command positions. The NCO school is located at Enns near Linz. Troop schools provide continuous specialized courses for officers and NCOs in artillery, air defence, armour, combat engineering, communications, and the like.\n\nWomen have been accepted for service in the Austrian armed forces since 1998. All service branches are open for female volunteers. In a public opinion survey in 1988, about 66 percent of those polled approved of opening the military to voluntary service by women; only nine percent favoured obligatory service.\n\n==Appearance==\n\nSince 2019 the new service uniform with a six colour camouflage pattern is issued, but the old service uniform in olive is still widespread and will be taken out of service very slowly.<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/cms/artikel.php?ID=9906</ref><ref>https://kurier.at/politik/inland/neue-tarnuniformen-ab-heute-ist-bundesheer-in-camouflage-look-im-einsatz/400424153</ref><ref>https://www.spartanat.com/2019/03/oesterreich-neue-tarnuniformen-ab-2018/</ref> The dress uniform is grey, for formal occasions a white uniform may be worn.
