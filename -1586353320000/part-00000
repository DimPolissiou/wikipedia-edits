{"title_page": "History of Yarmouth, Maine", "text_new": "{{main|Yarmouth, Maine}}\n\nThe '''history of Yarmouth, Maine''', is closely tied to its position on the banks of the [[Royal River]] and its proximity to [[Casco Bay]], an inlet of the [[Gulf of Maine]], itself a gulf of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\nSea-going ships were built in Yarmouth's harbor for around fifty years during the 19th century, while almost sixty mills were founded over 250 years along the town's section of the Royal River, making use of its four waterfalls for power.\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s originally settled the area, and several wars between they and later European settlers occurred before they were driven from the area for the final time in the mid-18th century.\n\n===Early settlers===\n\nTraces of human occupation in the Yarmouth area date to about 2,000 [[Before Christ|BC]].

(His family in [[Bedfordshire, England]], went by the family name ''Felce''. He called himself George ''Felch'', however, when he moved to America. He began to be known as George ''Felt'' in his later years.)\n\nIn 1630, Felt married 29-year-old Elizabeth Wilkinson, with whom he had six children: Elizabeth, George Jr., Mary, Moses I, Aaron and Moses II. Around 1649, the family moved back to [[Malden, Massachusetts]], just as it was being incorporated into a city. They returned to Casco Bay in 1667, shortly after which Felt bought two thousand more acres of land from Phillips. In 1684, Felt moved back to Massachusetts. He died in Malden, aged about 84, with Elizabeth surviving him by only on year. The couple had become the first citizens of Malden to receive town aid, such was their fall from wealth during the latter stages of their time in Maine.\n\nEnglishman William Royall (b. circa 1595, d. 1676) emigrated to [[Salem, Massachusetts]], in July 1629, aboard the ''[[Lyon's Whelp]]''. He was a servant in the [[Massachusetts Bay Company|Massachusetts Bay Colony Company]], and after serving his seven years, he was provided with a land grant in the [[Casco Bay]] area of Maine. In 1636, he purchased a farm at what is now the upscale Lambert Point, next to Redding Creek, at the southern tip of Lambert Road, where he lived with his wife, [[County Durham]] native Phoebe Green. They had thirteen children together between 1639 and 1657, the first being son William Jr.\n\nThe Royal River has ever-since borne Royall Sr.'s name, minus the second ''L'', though two streets off Gilman Road \u2014 Royall Meadow Road and Royall Point Road \u2014 carry the original spelling. This stream and its vicinity were called by the Indians \"Westcustogo\" \u2014 a name that, until the early 1990s, was preserved by an inn of the same name on Princes Point Road at its intersection with Lafayette Street.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/me4/westcustogoinn/ Westcustogo Inn]</ref>  (The building remains but it is now occupied by another business.)\n\nRoyall's family moved to [[Dorchester, Massachusetts]], in 1675, a year before William Sr.'s death. (He was able to see Isaac, son of William Jr. and one of his four grandchildren, born in 1672 before they moved south.) Following in his grandfather's footsteps, some eighty years after the fact, Isaac's brother, Sam Royall, moved to Yarmouth sometime after 1724. He died in the town in 1784. His son, Elijah, followed six years later.\n\nJohn Cousins (b. circa 1596, d. 1682), a native of [[Wiltshire]], England, had arrived a year or more earlier than Royall, with his wife, Mary, occupying the neck of land between the branches of the stream which has since taken his last name, and owning the island now also so-named. Their son, Isaac,<ref name=banfield>[http://banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com/cousinsdocument2.pdf \"Cousins Make Mark on Maine\"] - banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com</ref> emigrated from Wiltshire in 1647, aged about 34, arriving with his new wife, Elizabeth.<ref name=banfield/>\n\n[[File:Royal River, Yarmouth, Maine.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Royal River]] rushing by the mill en route to the First Falls]]\n\nBy 1676, approximately sixty-five people lived in Westcustogo.

They continued the contest until nightfall, when the Indians retired. It was not long before they appeared again, in such force that the thirty-six families of the settlement were forced to flee, abandoning their homes for a second time.\n\nThe unrest kept the area deserted for many years, but by 1715 settlers revisited their homes, by which point they found their fields and the sites of their habitations covered by a young growth of trees. The mills at the First Falls were rebuilt first.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1722, a \"Committee for the Resettlement of North Yarmouth\" was formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 1725, Massachusetts natives William and Matthew Scales were killed at the hands of the Indians. William's wife and daughter, both named Susannah, survived. His daughter married James Buxton the same year. They are both buried in the Ledge Cemetery.\n\nJoseph Felt, son of Moses Felt II, also perished. His wife, Sarah (Mills), and children were taken into captivity for five years. One of the captors remarked to Felt's widow: \"Husband much tough man! Shot good many times, no die! Take scalp off alive; then take knife and cut neck long 'round.\"<ref>''History of Cumberland County, Maine: Town of Cumberland'', Everts & Peck, 1880</ref> Joseph Felt's daughter and George Felt's great-granddaughter, Sarah, married in 1720 Captain Peter Weare, who recovered the family in some woods near Quebec. He later drowned while crossing the river near his home. The captain's son and Joseph Felt's brother-in-law, Joseph Weare, became a noted scout, pursuing the Native Americans at every opportunity until his death during a trip to Boston sometime after 1774. His widow, Mary Noyes, remarried, to Humphrey Merrill of Falmouth.\n\nOnce resettlement began, in 1727, the town's population began to grow rapidly. A proprietors' map was drawn up. It surveyed land divisions made with 103 original proprietors, each with a home lot of ten acres. If this lot was occupied and improved, the settler was permitted to apply for larger after-divisions.\n\nThe structural frame of the first [[meeting house]] was raised in 1729 near Westcustogo Hill on what is now Gilman Road, and nine years later the first school was built at the northwestern corner of the Princes Point Road intersection.\n\nNorth Yarmouth held its first town meeting on May 14, 1733.\n\nUp until 1756, the Indians were again very troublesome. In August 1746, a party of thirty-two Indians secreted themselves near the Lower Falls for the apparent purpose of surprising Weare's garrison, in the process killing 35-year-old Philip Greely, whose barking dog blew their cover.<ref name=rowe1936/> His wife was Hannah. Their son, Captain Jonathan Greeley, died in an engagement with a British [[frigate]] off [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], in 1781. He was 39. Hannah remarried, to Jonathan Underwood.\n\nIn June 1748,<ref>[https://archives.mainegenealogy.net/2011/09/north-yarmouth-deaths-1736-1762.html North Yarmouth Necrology, 1736\u20131762)] - Rev.

They killed the elderly Ebenezer Eaton.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nJoseph Burnell was the only inhabitant of the town to be killed at the hands of the Indians in 1751. He had been on horseback near the Presumpscot River falls when he was ambushed and shot. He was found scalped, with his steed lying nearby, having been shot four times.<ref name=rowe1936/> He left behind a wife and 14-year-old daughter, both named Sarah.\n\nIn 1756, Indians attacked the Means family, who lived at Flying Point. The family consisted of Thomas, his wife Alice, daughters Alice and Jane,<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/maineulsterscots/posts/1120272948037730 \"Maine Ulster Scots Project\"] - Facebook, May 6, 2016</ref> an infant son, Robert, and Molly Finney, sister of the patriarch and aged about sixteen. The family was dragged out of their home. Thomas was shot and scalped. Mother and baby ran back into the house and barricaded the door. One of the attackers shot through a hole in the wall, killing the infant and puncturing his mother's breast. John Martin, who had been sleeping in another room, fired at them, causing them to flee. They took with them Molly, whom they made follow them through the woods to Canada. Upon her arrival in Quebec, she was sold as a slave. A few months later, Captain William McLellan, of Falmouth, was in Quebec in charge of a group of prisoners for exchange. He had known Molly before her capture and secretly arranged for her escape. He came below her window and threw her a rope which she slid down. McLellan brought her back to Falmouth on his vessel. They married shortly afterwards.<ref name=rowe1936/> Alice remarried, to Colonel George Rogers. Thomas is interred in Freeport's First Parish Cemetery, alongside his son. His wife is buried with her second husband in Flying Point Cemetery.\n\nThe Means massacre was the last act of resistance by the indigenous people to occur within the limits of the town.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1764, 1,098 individuals lived in 154 houses. By 1810, the population was 3,295. During a time of peace, settlement began to relocate along the coast and inland.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nThe town's Main Street gradually became divided into the Upper Village (also known as the Corner) and Lower Falls, the split roughly located around the present-day [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|U.S. Route 1]] overpass (Brickyard Hollow, as it was known). Among the new proprietors at the time were descendants of the [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].\n\n[[File:Sylvanus Blanchard's house2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wooden plaques provided by the Yarmouth Village Improvement Society adorn more than 100 notable buildings in the town.

A 1975 replica now stands just beyond the brick schools on West Main Street.\n\n===Secession from North Yarmouth===\nYarmouth constituted the eastern part of North Yarmouth until 1849, when it [[secession|seceded]] and incorporated as an independent town. The split occurred due to bickering between the inland, farming-based contingent and the coastal maritime-oriented community. Unable to resolve this difference, the two halves of the town separated into present-day Yarmouth and North Yarmouth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nIn 1849 there were nine districts in Yarmouth, designated by numbers: Number One: (Cousins) Island; Number Two: Ledge; Number Three: (Lower) Falls; Number Four: Corner; Number Five: (Princes) Point; Number Six: Greely Road; Number Seven: Pratt; Number Eight: Sweetser; and Number Nine: East (Main). By 1874, however, efforts were made to abolish this setup due its being seen as \"unfair\" in terms of fund distribution.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1850, Yarmouth's population was 2,144, and very little changed over the hundred years that followed.\n\n18th- and 19th-century business relied heavily upon a variety of natural resources. Once lumber was cut and sent to market, the land was farmed. [[Tanneries]] were built near brooks; potteries and brickyards put to use the natural clay in the area; and mills flourished along the Royal River, providing services such as iron-forging and fulling cloth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n[[File:Yarmouth harbor.jpg|thumb|300px|A circa-1870 view of Yarmouth harbor, taken from where Yankee Marina \u2014 off Lafayette Street \u2014 is now, looking directly north to the East Main Street bridge]]\n\nMaritime activities were important from the beginning of the third settlement. Almost three hundred vessels were launched by Yarmouth's shipyards in the century between 1790 and 1890.<ref name=\"Hall\">''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Hall, Alan M., Arcadia (2002)</ref> Lumber from inland areas was shipped out from the harbor. Vessels were being built by 1740, and by 1818 shipbuilding in the area was in full swing, though Yarmouth's industry peaked in the 1870s, and declined rapidly shortly thereafter. Four major shipyards built vessels during this period. On the western side of the river, Henry Hutchins and Edward J. Stubbs operated from 1851 to 1884. Sylvanus Blanchard and his three sons owned the Blanchard Brothers shipyard on Union Wharf.<ref>[https://www.fishermensvoice.com/archives/0411BackThen.html \"Back Then\"] - ''Fishermen's Voice''</ref> Lyman Fessenden Walker's (b. 1836, d. 1920) shipyard launched forty vessels of all sizes. (Walker lived in the brick building at 51 Pleasant Street.)<ref name=Aldredge/> On the eastern side of the river, Giles Loring had a shipyard. It was here that the final large sailing vessel was built, in 1890.<ref name=\"YHS\"/> Today, there are just two boatyards, one on either side of Lower Falls Landing: Yarmouth Boatyard (formerly Union Wharf; established in 1948; located almost beneath the northbound lanes of Interstate 295) and Yankee Marina (established in 1964; whose entrance is near the crest of the Route 88 hill).\n\n===19th century Yarmouth===\nIn 1887, a fire started in the dry grass south of Grand Trunk Station by a spark from a passing train. Fanned by a strong wind, it spread rapidly into the woods and up over the ledge. Two hundred acres were burned, and the fire was only stopped because it reached the waters of Broad Cove.<ref name=rowe1936>''Ancient North Yarmouth and Yarmouth, Maine 1636-1936: A History'', William Hutchison Rowe (1937)</ref>\n\nYarmouth's \"town system\"<ref name=rowe1936/> went into effect in April 1889. Three of the former districts were discontinued because they were small and had dilapidated buildings.

A strong southerly breeze carried the sparks directly across the most thickly-settled part of town, causing small fires in various places so that over twenty buildings were burning concurrently.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\n===Into the 20th century===\n[[File:Yarmouth_Maine_harbour.jpeg|thumb|300px|A similar view in 2019]]\n\nIn 1918, the [[Spanish flu]] hit town in two waves, resulting in 370 cases and 14 deaths.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\nIn 1923, town historian William H.

Their son, Isaac,<ref name=banfield>[http://banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com/cousinsdocument2.pdf \"Cousins Make Mark on Maine\"] - banfield-hodgkinsfamily.com</ref> emigrated from Wiltshire in 1647, aged about 34, arriving with his new wife, Elizabeth.<ref name=banfield/>\n\n[[File:Royal River, Yarmouth, Maine.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Royal River]] rushing by the mill en route to the First Falls]]\n\nBy 1676, approximately sixty-five people lived in Westcustogo.

They continued the contest until nightfall, when the Indians retired. It was not long before they appeared again, in such force that the thirty-six families of the settlement were forced to flee, abandoning their homes for a second time.\n\nThe unrest kept the area deserted for many years, but by 1715 settlers revisited their homes, by which point they found their fields and the sites of their habitations covered by a young growth of trees. The mills at the First Falls were rebuilt first.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nIn 1722, a \"Committee for the Resettlement of North Yarmouth\" was formed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].\n\nIn 1725, Massachusetts natives William and Matthew Scales were killed at the hands of the Indians. William's wife and daughter, both named Susannah, survived. His daughter married James Buxton the same year. They are both buried in the Ledge Cemetery.\n\nJoseph Felt, son of Moses Felt II, also perished. His wife, Sarah (Mills), and children were taken into captivity for five years. One of the captors remarked to Felt's widow: \"Husband much tough man! Shot good many times, no die! Take scalp off alive; then take knife and cut neck long 'round.\"<ref>''History of Cumberland County, Maine: Town of Cumberland'', Everts & Peck, 1880</ref> Joseph Felt's daughter and George Felt's great-granddaughter, Sarah, married in 1720 Captain Peter Weare, who recovered the family in some woods near Quebec. He later drowned while crossing the river near his home. The captain's son and Joseph Felt's brother-in-law, Joseph Weare, became a noted scout, pursuing the Native Americans at every opportunity until his death during a trip to Boston sometime after 1774. His widow, Mary Noyes, remarried, to Humphrey Merrill of Falmouth.\n\nOnce resettlement began, in 1727, the town's population began to grow rapidly. A proprietors' map was drawn up. It surveyed land divisions made with 103 original proprietors, each with a home lot of ten acres. If this lot was occupied and improved, the settler was permitted to apply for larger after-divisions.\n\nThe structural frame of the first [[meeting house]] was raised in 1729 near Westcustogo Hill on what is now Gilman Road, and nine years later the first school was built at the northwestern corner of the Princes Point Road intersection.\n\nNorth Yarmouth held its first town meeting on May 14, 1733.\n\nUp until 1756, the Indians were again very troublesome. In August 1746, a party of thirty-two Indians secreted themselves near the Lower Falls for the apparent purpose of surprising Weare's garrison, in the process killing 35-year-old Philip Greely, whose barking dog blew their cover.<ref name=rowe1936/> His wife was Hannah. Their son, Captain Jonathan Greeley, died in an engagement with a British [[frigate]] off [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], in 1781. He was 39. Hannah remarried, to Jonathan Underwood.\n\nIn June 1748,<ref>[https://archives.mainegenealogy.net/2011/09/north-yarmouth-deaths-1736-1762.html North Yarmouth Necrology, 1736\u20131762)] - Rev.

He had been on horseback near the Presumpscot River falls when he was ambushed and shot. He was found scalped, with his steed lying nearby, having been shot four times.<ref name=rowe1936/> He left behind a wife and 14-year-old daughter, both named Sarah.\n\nIn 1756, Indians attacked the Means family, who lived at Flying Point. The family consisted of Thomas, his wife Alice, daughters Alice and Jane,<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/maineulsterscots/posts/1120272948037730 \"Maine Ulster Scots Project\"] - Facebook, May 6, 2016</ref> an infant son, Robert, and Molly Finney, sister of the patriarch and aged about sixteen. The family was dragged out of their home. Thomas was shot and scalped. Mother and baby ran back into the house and barricaded the door. One of the attackers shot through a hole in the wall, killing the infant and puncturing his mother's breast. John Martin, who had been sleeping in another room, fired at them, causing them to flee. They took with them Molly, whom they made follow them through the woods to Canada. Upon her arrival in Quebec, she was sold as a slave. A few months later, Captain William McLellan, of Falmouth, was in Quebec in charge of a group of prisoners for exchange. He had known Molly before her capture and secretly arranged for her escape. He came below her window and threw her a rope which she slid down. McLellan brought her back to Falmouth on his vessel. They married shortly afterwards.<ref name=rowe1936/> Alice remarried, to Colonel George Rogers. Thomas is interred in Freeport's First Parish Cemetery, alongside his son. His wife is buried with her second husband in Flying Point Cemetery.\n\nThe Means massacre was the last act of resistance by the indigenous people to occur within the limits of the town.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1764, 1,098 individuals lived in 154 houses. By 1810, the population was 3,295. During a time of peace, settlement began to relocate along the coast and inland.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nThe town's Main Street gradually became divided into the Upper Village (also known as the Corner) and Lower Falls, the split roughly located around the present-day [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|U.S. Route 1]] overpass (Brickyard Hollow, as it was known). Among the new proprietors at the time were descendants of the [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].\n\n[[File:Sylvanus Blanchard's house2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wooden plaques provided by the Yarmouth Village Improvement Society adorn more than 100 notable buildings in the town.

A 1975 replica now stands just beyond the brick schools on West Main Street.\n\n===Secession from North Yarmouth===\nYarmouth constituted the eastern part of North Yarmouth until 1849, when it [[secession|seceded]] and incorporated as an independent town. The split occurred due to bickering between the inland, farming-based contingent and the coastal maritime-oriented community. Unable to resolve this difference, the two halves of the town separated into present-day Yarmouth and North Yarmouth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\nIn 1849 there were nine districts in Yarmouth, designated by numbers: Number One: (Cousins) Island; Number Two: Ledge; Number Three: (Lower) Falls; Number Four: Corner; Number Five: (Princes) Point; Number Six: Greely Road; Number Seven: Pratt; Number Eight: Sweetser; and Number Nine: East (Main). By 1874, however, efforts were made to abolish this setup due its being seen as \"unfair\" in terms of fund distribution.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nBy 1850, Yarmouth's population was 2,144, and very little changed over the hundred years that followed.\n\n18th- and 19th-century business relied heavily upon a variety of natural resources. Once lumber was cut and sent to market, the land was farmed. [[Tanneries]] were built near brooks; potteries and brickyards put to use the natural clay in the area; and mills flourished along the Royal River, providing services such as iron-forging and fulling cloth.<ref name=\"YHS\"/>\n\n===Shipbuilding===\n[[File:Yarmouth harbor.jpg|thumb|300px|A circa-1870 view of Yarmouth harbor, taken from where Yankee Marina \u2014 off Lafayette Street \u2014 is now, looking directly north to the East Main Street bridge]]\n\nMaritime activities were important from the beginning of the third settlement. Almost three hundred vessels were launched by Yarmouth's shipyards in the century between 1790 and 1890.<ref name=\"Hall\">''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Hall, Alan M., Arcadia (2002)</ref> Lumber from inland areas was shipped out from the harbor. Vessels were being built by 1740, and by 1818 shipbuilding in the area was in full swing, though Yarmouth's industry peaked in the 1870s, and declined rapidly shortly thereafter. Four major shipyards built vessels during this period. On the western side of the river, Henry Hutchins and Edward J. Stubbs operated from 1851 to 1884. Sylvanus Blanchard and his three sons owned the Blanchard Brothers shipyard on Union Wharf.<ref>[https://www.fishermensvoice.com/archives/0411BackThen.html \"Back Then\"] - ''Fishermen's Voice''</ref> Lyman Fessenden Walker's (b. 1836, d. 1920) shipyard launched forty vessels of all sizes. (Walker lived in the brick building at 51 Pleasant Street.)<ref name=Aldredge/> On the eastern side of the river, Giles Loring had a shipyard. It was here that the final large sailing vessel was built, in 1890.<ref name=\"YHS\"/> Today, there are just two boatyards, one on either side of Lower Falls Landing: Yarmouth Boatyard (formerly Union Wharf; established in 1948; located almost beneath the northbound lanes of Interstate 295) and Yankee Marina (established in 1964; whose entrance is near the crest of the Route 88 hill).\n\n===19th century Yarmouth===\nIn 1887, a fire started in the dry grass south of Grand Trunk Station by a spark from a passing train. Fanned by a strong wind, it spread rapidly into the woods and up over the ledge. Two hundred acres were burned, and the fire was only stopped because it reached the waters of Broad Cove.<ref name=rowe1936>''Ancient North Yarmouth and Yarmouth, Maine 1636-1936: A History'', William Hutchison Rowe (1937)</ref>\n\nYarmouth's \"town system\"<ref name=rowe1936/> went into effect in April 1889. Three of the former districts were discontinued because they were small and had dilapidated buildings. These were Princes Point, Greely Road and the Sweetser district \u2013 the last of which was on the Sodom Road (now Granite Street) and the Freeport line.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\nElectricity came to Yarmouth in 1893.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\nAnother, more menacing fire occurred in April 1900 when the corn-canning factory of Asa York caught from a spark blown from the stack of the Walker & Cleaves sawmill. A strong southerly breeze carried the sparks directly across the most thickly-settled part of town, causing small fires in various places so that over twenty buildings were burning concurrently.<ref name=rowe1936/>\n\n===Into the 20th century===\n[[File:Yarmouth_Maine_harbour.jpeg|thumb|300px|A similar view in 2019]]\n\nIn 1918, the [[Spanish flu]] hit town in two waves, resulting in 370 cases and 14 deaths.<ref name=Aldredge/>\n\nIn 1923, town historian William H. Rowe announced that a history of Yarmouth was in the works. The project took thirteen more years to complete, but it was \"so thorough that it is still in print\".<ref name=Hall/> Rowe died in 1955, aged about 73.\n\nIn 1949, Yarmouth celebrated its centenary with a parade.<ref name=p23>''Images of America: Yarmouth'', Alan M. Hall (Arcadia, 2002), p.23</ref>\n\nRapid growth was experienced again around 1948 when Route 1 was put through the town. Two years later, there were 2,699 inhabitants of the town.

They belong to the [[Sawabantu languages|coastal Bantu]] group, widely known as ''Sawa'', and primarily occupy the [[Ndian]] and [[Meme (department)|Meme]] divisions of the [[Southwest_Region_(Cameroon)|Southwest Region of Cameroon]]. The people predominantly speak [[Oroko language|Oroko]], [[English language|English]], and [[Cameroon Pidgin|Cameroon Pidgin English]]. The Oroko are related to several ethnic groups (or tribes) in Cameroon's coastal areas, with whom they share a common traditional origin, and similar histories and cultures. These include the [[Bakweri]] (Kwe), [[Bakole people|Bakole]], [[Duala people|Duala]], [[Duala language|Ewodi]], the [[Sawabantu languages|Bodiman]], the [[Pongo people|Pongo]], the [[Bamboko]], the [[Isubu]] (Isuwu or Bimbians), the [[Limba people (Cameroon)|Limba]] (or Malimba), the [[Mungo people|Mungo]], and the [[Wovea]].\n\nThe Oroko may share ancestral and cultural relations with the [[Barombi]] and the [[Bakassi|Isangele]] (who live among them), as well as the [[Bafaw people|Balong]], [[Bafaw people|Bafaw]], and [[Bakossi people|Bakossi]].\n\n==Ethnicities== \n# Balondo ba Diko<br>\n# Balondo ba Nanga<br>\n# Balue<br>\n# Bakoko<br>\n# Bakundu<br>\n# Batanga<br>\n# Bima<br>\n# Ekombe<br>\n# Mbonge<br>\n# Ngolo<br>\n\n==Early History==\nEarly Oroko history is hard to find in written sources and so relies mostly on [[Oral history|oral historical]] accounts that have been handed down from generation to generation. While many Oroko do not claim their origins to a [[common ancestor]], most Oroko trace their [[ancestry]] to a man named [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafaka Ngoe], son of [[Mbongo|Nebongo]] (or Nambongo or Mbongo). Some versions of this history claim that Ngoe originally lived in Bakota, present-day [[Gabon]] and migrated with his brothers [[Mbedi]] and Ngasse to a place called Piti in Cameroon. Mbedi's sons, [[Ewale]] and Dibongo would later found the [[Duala people|Duala]] and [[Malimba people|Malimba]] nations and Ngoe's son's would found the various tribes occupying the slopes of [[Mount Cameroon]] towards the [[Rio del Rey]] and [[Rumpi Hills|Rombi Hills]].\n\nAnother version of this narrative holds that Ngoe appeared on the Mount Cameroon and founded the town of Batokki or Batekka. While on the mountain, Ngoe's descendants co-existed with the [[Boobee people|Boobees]] (today in [[Equatorial Guinea]]) and were forced to migrate towards the sea due to an [[eruption]] of the mountain. It is important to note that Ngoe appears in other origins narratives of the [[Bakossi people|Bakossi]] people as having appeared on a mountain after a global [[Flood|deluge]]. It is possible that Ngoe, like his supposed father Nebongo, is a [[Mythical|mythical figure]], as opined by [[Edwin Ardener|Ardener]]<ref>Ardener, Edwin (1996). Kingdom on Mount Cameroon: Studies in the History of the Cameroon Coast, 1500\u20131970. New York: Bergahn Books.</ref>.\n\nThe various [[tribes]] (sub ethnicities) of the Oroko ethnic group are, according to these versions of oral history, descended from the sons and grandsons of Ngoe, including Mokundu (father of the Bakundu), Muma (father of the Bima) and Elume (father of the Balue).\n\nAnother version of oral history, which seems more plausible, is that the Oroko are primarily descended from an earlier Batekka people who later became known as the Batanga. These Batanga were settled in areas close to present-day Isangele in the [[Bakassi]] peninsula. Probably in the [[15th century]], tensions between the Batanga and their [[Efik people|Efik]] neighbours began to heighten over trade, leading to what has come to be known as the [[Batanga Wars]]. The aftermath of this war saw seven families of the Batanga, from the Balondo clan, migrating into Efik territory in what is today [[Calabar]], [[Nigeria]]. That faction is now known as the [[Calabar|Efut]] people of Calabar. Successive waves of migration took place in small family groups, beginning probably with the Bima, then the Bakundu, Batanga, Ngolo, Balue and Balondo. It is believed that the Balue are directly descended from the Batanga and that the Ekombe and Mbonge are directly descended from the Balue<ref>Ngoe, Blessed (2019). \"The Oroko Nation: A Look into the Past. Njambae 1(1), 38-43</ref>. At least seven out of fifteen Balondo ba Nanga communities were founded by the Balue and the Ngolo, making the Balondo a plausible offshoot of their more populous Ngolo and Balue relatives. A list of about 250 Oroko villages and towns was published by the Oroko Cultural Association, USA on their website.\n\nThe Oroko occupy a region historically known as the [[Biafra|Kingdom of Biafra]]. If one turns to Knut Knutson's 1888 memoir, which recounts his experiences with the people around the Cameroon Mountain<ref>Ardener, Shirley (2002). Swedish Ventures in Cameroon; trade and travel; people and politics, 1883-1923, annotated edition of Knutson's memoirs. Berghahn Books</ref>, the possibility of a historical connection between the ancestors of the Oroko and the founders of the Kingdom of Biafra becomes clear. It is also probable that the ancestors of the Oroko were the same as either the [[Mbongo|Kalbongo]] or [[Ambas Bay|Ambozees]], described by early European explorers like [[Samuel Blommaert]], O. Dapper, and John Barbot. <br>\n\nWhatever the version, all Oroko sub clans agree that their most ancient migrations began from places around Mount Fako from where they migrated into the creeks of the Rio del Rey, following the routes of the Moko, Massaka and Meme rivers. After establishing several Batekka settlements, the people again migrated from the creeks back into the interior, following the Ndian, Moko, Massaka, and Meme rivers. <br>\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe Oroko occupy the [[Ndian]] and [[Meme]] [[mangrove]] plains as well as the most part of the [[Rumpi Hills]] towards the [[Bakossi Mountains]] to the northeast and the [[Ejagham forest]] to the northwest. The Ndian and Meme rivers, together with the Massaka and Makunge rivers form the major watersheds of the Cameroonian coast, northwest of the Cameroons River. All rivers played significant roles in the migration and settlement of the Oroko people. There are currently 250 known Oroko towns and villages, the largest semi-urban center being Ekondo Titi and the largest indigenously settled community being Dikome Balue. <br>\n\n== Culture ==\n\nVery few Oroko communities are urban or semi-urban. Hence, the majority of Oroko people live in rural areas with usually large villages of over 3000 people. So much of Oroko culture is shared with the ethnic groups that surround them. The Oroko claim to have founded the [[Ekpe]] secret society, a type of masonic organization which traditional kept the peace in the Bight of Biafra, and its secret writing system, [[Nsibidi]]. The word, ''nsibidi'', is possibly derived from the Oroko word, ''njibidi'', which means \"violence\" or \"chaos\". Today, Ekpe has been popularized by the Ejagham and Efik-speaking peoples of Cameroon and Nigeria, as well as their diasporic communities in the Caribbean, in the form of Abakua. Apart from Ekpe, the Oroko also share several cultural traits with, especially, the Bakweri and Bamboko. The [[Kwe people|Malle]] (or Elephant cult) and the Nganya are some of their most visibly shared cultural heirlooms<ref>Ngoh, Victor Julius (1996). History of Cameroon Since 1800. Limbe: Presbook.</ref>. <br>\n\nTraditional Oroko society was organized according to social castes. At the helm of the society were the ''Konja'' or freeborn natives. They possessed the right to own land and participate fully in the affairs of the community. Following that rank were the ''bafa'' (sing. ''mofa''), who were either foreigners living among the Oroko or descendants of formerly enslaved people. At the bottom of the social rung were the enslaved, also known as ''babo\u010fe\u010fi'' (sing. ''mobo\u010fe\u010fi''. Slaves were usually incorporated into their owners family and it was the duty of the master to provide, land and spouses for their slaves.<br>\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe Oroko speak the [[Oroko language]], a [[Narrow Bantu]] language which appears in Zone A.10 of [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie's classification]].<ref>Oroko at [[Ethnologue]] (18th ed., 2015)</ref> The Oroko language is a [[dialect cluster]] comprising nine dialects, namely: Londo, Lolue, Lokoko, Lotanga, Lokundu, Lokombe (Ekombe), Longolo, Loma (Bima), and Lombongi (Mbonge). Some [[linguists]] have treated these dialects as separate languages.<ref>Jouni Filip Maho, 2009. [https://web.archive.org/web/20180203191542/http://goto.glocalnet.net/mahopapers/nuglonline.pdf New Updated Guthrie List Online]</ref><br>\n\n=== Marriage and kinship === \n\nUnlike their closest kin, the Bakweri, the Oroko lean towards a matrilineal tradition of succession, which is common among many Bantu societies. While children can inherit their father upon his death, it is usually the children of a man's sister who inherit him after he dies. This implies that children inherit their mothers or their uncles from their mother's side. <br>\n\nPolygamy was common among the Oroko in the past. Although traces of polygamous relationships are still visible today, the acceptance of Christianity has discouraged the practice to a large extent. <br>\n\nAs a matrilineal society, the Oroko cannot marry among the extended relatives from the mother's side. Cousins, several generations removed, from the father's side are free to engage in matrimonial relationships, on the other hand.<br>\n\n=== Religion === \n\nThe [[traditional religion]] of the Oroko people centered around the belief in a Supreme Being, called ''Obas' a Loba'', a [[sky deity]] who supposedly created the world. Oroko scholars like [http://orokoentertainment.com/ Blessed E. Ngoe] believe that the earliest Oroko belief system venerated a [[fire deity]] called ''Erobe'' or ''Elobe'', from which the word, ''Loba'', originates. Among the Sawabantu, the term ''loba'' refers to both the [[sky]] and to [[God]]. It is also however used to describe the [[sun]]. <br>\n\nThe Oroko worshipped the [[Sky god]] through their [[ancestors]] by way of [https://theieca.org/sites/default/files/COCE2019/program/s203.html Molimi]. Molimi, according to Ngoe, derives from the term, ''molimo'', meaning \"a spirit\". Among the Oroko, Molimi is the way through which the Oroko commemorate their journey from the sea to the land. All secret societies and ancestral worship systems are incorporated into Molimi.<ref>Ngoe, B. & Morgan, E. (2019). O Madiba na o Mokondo (On Water and on Land): A Molimi Cultural Discourse of Place and Water. Conference paper presented at the Conference on Climate and Environment, Vancouver, Canada, June 17, 2019</ref>  <br>\n\n== Institutions == \n\nTraditional Oroko society was organized in various institutions of administrative, legal and judiciary importance. Most important among these institutions was the Etana (literally, ''the gathering''). The Etana served as the parliament for the deliberation of matters that affected the land and for the proposition of laws. In more organized communities like [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafaka Bafaka Balue], there was, in addition to the Etana, a Council of the oldest men, known as ''mak\u014dr\u014d na manei'' (or the Four Age Groups). This is still the ultimate law-making body of the society. <br>\n\nAt the [[judiciary]] level was the Ekpe. The head of the [[Ekpe]] was ultimately the head of the community, and, in most cases, the oldest man in the society. He was also, in most cases, the ''[[Nganga]] Molimi'' (or Priest of Molimi). He was therefore, the natural ''[https://blessedngoe.com/bafaka-balue-a-brief-history-c-14th-century-20th-century-ad/ Sango' a Mboka]'' (or [[Patriarch]] of the Community). In consultation with the Etana, the Sango' a Mboka directed the administrative, judicial and legislative affairs of the land. <br>\n\nLeading together with the Sango' a Mboka was the ''Nyango' a Mboka'' (or [[Matriarch]] of the Community), her most important honorific being ''Nyanger\u00f4m\u00f4''. She was the head of the Besambe (or Mosembe), a council of women who held the same status as Ekpe men. Among the Balue, this remains the only title inherited by people of the same lineage, usually, of the [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafaka Bareka] clan. <br>\n\nEveryone in the society was also a member of an age group. These age groups ensured the smooth functioning of the community through collaborative work. Younger [[age groups]] usually ran errands for the community that demanded energy. Older age groups involved in intercommunal diplomacy with other villages and ethnicities. <br>\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economic activities of the Oroko have always been diverse. The production of oil from palms (mostly ''[[Elaeis guineensis]]'') is an age-old economic activity of the Oroko people. For those dwelling on the coastal plains, the other economic activity has traditionally been artisanal fishing. For the Oroko who live in the forested highlands, the traditional economic activities centered around the cultivation of cocoyam, plantain, banana, and the gathering of forest products, including game. In recent times, the cultivation of cocoa, as a cash crop, has taken center stage among the Oroko. <br>\n\n== Notables == \n\n* [https://nanjecreativethinking.blogspot.com/2017/11/one-united-and-indivisible-cameroon.html Nakeli wa Embele]; Chieftain, Resistor of German Rule in Cameroon.<ref>Ngoe, Blessed (2015).

These include the [[Bakweri]] (Kwe), [[Bakole people|Bakole]], [[Duala people|Duala]], [[Duala language|Ewodi]], the [[Sawabantu languages|Bodiman]], the [[Pongo people|Pongo]], the [[Bamboko]], the [[Isubu]] (Isuwu or Bimbians), the [[Limba people (Cameroon)|Limba]] (or Malimba), the [[Mungo people|Mungo]], and the [[Wovea]].\n\nThe Oroko may share ancestral and cultural relations with the [[Barombi]] and the [[Bakassi|Isangele]] (who live among them), as well as the [[Bafaw people|Balong]], [[Bafaw people|Bafaw]], and [[Bakossi people|Bakossi]].\n\n==Ethnicities== \n# Balondo ba Diko<br>\n# Balondo ba Nanga<br>\n# Balue<br>\n# Bakoko<br>\n# Bakundu<br>\n# Batanga<br>\n# Bima<br>\n# Ekombe<br>\n# Mbonge<br>\n# Ngolo<br>\n\n==Early History==\nEarly Oroko history is hard to find in written sources and so relies mostly on [[Oral history|oral historical]] accounts that have been handed down from generation to generation. While many Oroko do not claim their origins to a [[common ancestor]], most Oroko trace their [[ancestry]] to a man named [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafaka Ngoe], son of [[Mbongo|Nebongo]] (or Nambongo or Mbongo). Some versions of this history claim that Ngoe originally lived in Bakota, present-day [[Gabon]] and migrated with his brothers [[Mbedi]] and Ngasse to a place called Piti in Cameroon. Mbedi's sons, [[Ewale]] and Dibongo would later found the [[Duala people|Duala]] and [[Malimba people|Malimba]] nations and Ngoe's son's would found the various tribes occupying the slopes of [[Mount Cameroon]] towards the [[Rio del Rey]] and [[Rumpi Hills|Rombi Hills]].\n\nAnother version of this narrative holds that Ngoe appeared on the Mount Cameroon and founded the town of Batokki or Batekka. While on the mountain, Ngoe's descendants co-existed with the [[Boobee people|Boobees]] (today in [[Equatorial Guinea]]) and were forced to migrate towards the sea due to an [[eruption]] of the mountain. It is important to note that Ngoe appears in other origins narratives of the [[Bakossi people|Bakossi]] people as having appeared on a mountain after a global [[Deluge|deluge]].{{dn|date=March 2020}} It is possible that Ngoe, like his supposed father Nebongo, is a [[Mythical|mythical figure]], as opined by [[Edwin Ardener|Ardener]]<ref>Ardener, Edwin (1996). Kingdom on Mount Cameroon: Studies in the History of the Cameroon Coast, 1500\u20131970. New York: Bergahn Books.</ref>.\n\nThe various [[tribes]] (sub ethnicities) of the Oroko ethnic group are, according to these versions of oral history, descended from the sons and grandsons of Ngoe, including Mokundu (father of the Bakundu), Muma (father of the Bima) and Elume (father of the Balue).\n\nAnother version of oral history, which seems more plausible, is that the Oroko are primarily descended from an earlier Batekka people who later became known as the Batanga. These Batanga were settled in areas close to present-day Isangele in the [[Bakassi]] peninsula. Probably in the [[15th century]], tensions between the Batanga and their [[Efik people|Efik]] neighbours began to heighten over trade, leading to what has come to be known as the [[Batanga Wars]]. The aftermath of this war saw seven families of the Batanga, from the Balondo clan, migrating into Efik territory in what is today [[Calabar]], [[Nigeria]]. That faction is now known as the [[Calabar|Efut]] people of Calabar. Successive waves of migration took place in small family groups, beginning probably with the Bima, then the Bakundu, Batanga, Ngolo, Balue and Balondo. It is believed that the Balue are directly descended from the Batanga and that the Ekombe and Mbonge are directly descended from the Balue<ref>Ngoe, Blessed (2019). \"The Oroko Nation: A Look into the Past. Njambae 1(1), 38-43</ref>. At least seven out of fifteen Balondo ba Nanga communities were founded by the Balue and the Ngolo, making the Balondo a plausible offshoot of their more populous Ngolo and Balue relatives. A list of about 250 Oroko villages and towns was published by the Oroko Cultural Association, USA on their website.\n\nThe Oroko occupy a region historically known as the [[Biafra|Kingdom of Biafra]]. If one turns to Knut Knutson's 1888 memoir, which recounts his experiences with the people around the Cameroon Mountain<ref>Ardener, Shirley (2002). Swedish Ventures in Cameroon; trade and travel; people and politics, 1883-1923, annotated edition of Knutson's memoirs. Berghahn Books</ref>, the possibility of a historical connection between the ancestors of the Oroko and the founders of the Kingdom of Biafra becomes clear. It is also probable that the ancestors of the Oroko were the same as either the [[Mbongo|Kalbongo]] or [[Ambas Bay|Ambozees]], described by early European explorers like [[Samuel Blommaert]], O. Dapper, and John Barbot. <br>\n\nWhatever the version, all Oroko sub clans agree that their most ancient migrations began from places around Mount Fako from where they migrated into the creeks of the Rio del Rey, following the routes of the Moko, Massaka and Meme rivers. After establishing several Batekka settlements, the people again migrated from the creeks back into the interior, following the Ndian, Moko, Massaka, and Meme rivers. <br>\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe Oroko occupy the [[Ndian]] and [[Meme]] [[mangrove]] plains as well as the most part of the [[Rumpi Hills]] towards the [[Bakossi Mountains]] to the northeast and the [[Ejagham forest]] to the northwest. The Ndian and Meme rivers, together with the Massaka and Makunge rivers form the major watersheds of the Cameroonian coast, northwest of the Cameroons River. All rivers played significant roles in the migration and settlement of the Oroko people. There are currently 250 known Oroko towns and villages, the largest semi-urban center being Ekondo Titi and the largest indigenously settled community being Dikome Balue. <br>\n\n== Culture ==\n\nVery few Oroko communities are urban or semi-urban. Hence, the majority of Oroko people live in rural areas with usually large villages of over 3000 people. So much of Oroko culture is shared with the ethnic groups that surround them. The Oroko claim to have founded the [[Ekpe]] secret society, a type of masonic organization which traditional kept the peace in the Bight of Biafra, and its secret writing system, [[Nsibidi]]. The word, ''nsibidi'', is possibly derived from the Oroko word, ''njibidi'', which means \"violence\" or \"chaos\". Today, Ekpe has been popularized by the Ejagham and Efik-speaking peoples of Cameroon and Nigeria, as well as their diasporic communities in the Caribbean, in the form of Abakua. Apart from Ekpe, the Oroko also share several cultural traits with, especially, the Bakweri and Bamboko. The [[Kwe people|Malle]] (or Elephant cult) and the Nganya are some of their most visibly shared cultural heirlooms<ref>Ngoh, Victor Julius (1996). History of Cameroon Since 1800. Limbe: Presbook.</ref>. <br>\n\nTraditional Oroko society was organized according to social castes. At the helm of the society were the ''Konja'' or freeborn natives. They possessed the right to own land and participate fully in the affairs of the community. Following that rank were the ''bafa'' (sing. ''mofa''), who were either foreigners living among the Oroko or descendants of formerly enslaved people. At the bottom of the social rung were the enslaved, also known as ''babo\u010fe\u010fi'' (sing. ''mobo\u010fe\u010fi''. Slaves were usually incorporated into their owners family and it was the duty of the master to provide, land and spouses for their slaves.<br>\n\n=== Language ===\n\nThe Oroko speak the [[Oroko language]], a [[Narrow Bantu]] language which appears in Zone A.10 of [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages|Guthrie's classification]].<ref>Oroko at [[Ethnologue]] (18th ed., 2015)</ref> The Oroko language is a [[dialect cluster]] comprising nine dialects, namely: Londo, Lolue, Lokoko, Lotanga, Lokundu, Lokombe (Ekombe), Longolo, Loma (Bima), and Lombongi (Mbonge). Some [[linguists]] have treated these dialects as separate languages.<ref>Jouni Filip Maho, 2009. [https://web.archive.org/web/20180203191542/http://goto.glocalnet.net/mahopapers/nuglonline.pdf New Updated Guthrie List Online]</ref><br>\n\n=== Marriage and kinship === \n\nUnlike their closest kin, the Bakweri, the Oroko lean towards a matrilineal tradition of succession, which is common among many Bantu societies. While children can inherit their father upon his death, it is usually the children of a man's sister who inherit him after he dies. This implies that children inherit their mothers or their uncles from their mother's side. <br>\n\nPolygamy was common among the Oroko in the past. Although traces of polygamous relationships are still visible today, the acceptance of Christianity has discouraged the practice to a large extent. <br>\n\nAs a matrilineal society, the Oroko cannot marry among the extended relatives from the mother's side. Cousins, several generations removed, from the father's side are free to engage in matrimonial relationships, on the other hand.<br>\n\n=== Religion === \n\nThe [[traditional religion]] of the Oroko people centered around the belief in a Supreme Being, called ''Obas' a Loba'', a [[sky deity]] who supposedly created the world. Oroko scholars like [http://orokoentertainment.com/ Blessed E. Ngoe] believe that the earliest Oroko belief system venerated a [[fire deity]] called ''Erobe'' or ''Elobe'', from which the word, ''Loba'', originates. Among the Sawabantu, the term ''loba'' refers to both the [[sky]] and to [[God]]. It is also however used to describe the [[sun]]. <br>\n\nThe Oroko worshipped the [[Sky god]] through their [[ancestors]] by way of [https://theieca.org/sites/default/files/COCE2019/program/s203.html Molimi]. Molimi, according to Ngoe, derives from the term, ''molimo'', meaning \"a spirit\". Among the Oroko, Molimi is the way through which the Oroko commemorate their journey from the sea to the land. All secret societies and ancestral worship systems are incorporated into Molimi.<ref>Ngoe, B. & Morgan, E. (2019). O Madiba na o Mokondo (On Water and on Land): A Molimi Cultural Discourse of Place and Water. Conference paper presented at the Conference on Climate and Environment, Vancouver, Canada, June 17, 2019</ref>  <br>\n\n== Institutions == \n\nTraditional Oroko society was organized in various institutions of administrative, legal and judiciary importance. Most important among these institutions was the Etana (literally, ''the gathering''). The Etana served as the parliament for the deliberation of matters that affected the land and for the proposition of laws. In more organized communities like [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafaka Bafaka Balue], there was, in addition to the Etana, a Council of the oldest men, known as ''mak\u014dr\u014d na manei'' (or the Four Age Groups). This is still the ultimate law-making body of the society. <br>\n\nAt the [[judiciary]] level was the Ekpe. The head of the [[Ekpe]] was ultimately the head of the community, and, in most cases, the oldest man in the society. He was also, in most cases, the ''[[Nganga]] Molimi'' (or Priest of Molimi). He was therefore, the natural ''[https://blessedngoe.com/bafaka-balue-a-brief-history-c-14th-century-20th-century-ad/ Sango' a Mboka]'' (or [[Patriarch]] of the Community). In consultation with the Etana, the Sango' a Mboka directed the administrative, judicial and legislative affairs of the land. <br>\n\nLeading together with the Sango' a Mboka was the ''Nyango' a Mboka'' (or [[Matriarch]] of the Community), her most important honorific being ''Nyanger\u00f4m\u00f4''. She was the head of the Besambe (or Mosembe), a council of women who held the same status as Ekpe men. Among the Balue, this remains the only title inherited by people of the same lineage, usually, of the [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bafaka Bareka] clan. <br>\n\nEveryone in the society was also a member of an age group. These age groups ensured the smooth functioning of the community through collaborative work. Younger [[age groups]] usually ran errands for the community that demanded energy. Older age groups involved in intercommunal diplomacy with other villages and ethnicities. <br>\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economic activities of the Oroko have always been diverse. The production of oil from palms (mostly ''[[Elaeis guineensis]]'') is an age-old economic activity of the Oroko people. For those dwelling on the coastal plains, the other economic activity has traditionally been artisanal fishing. For the Oroko who live in the forested highlands, the traditional economic activities centered around the cultivation of cocoyam, plantain, banana, and the gathering of forest products, including game. In recent times, the cultivation of cocoa, as a cash crop, has taken center stage among the Oroko. <br>\n\n== Notables == \n\n* [https://nanjecreativethinking.blogspot.com/2017/11/one-united-and-indivisible-cameroon.html Nakeli wa Embele]; Chieftain, Resistor of German Rule in Cameroon.<ref>Ngoe, Blessed (2015).

Two imperial families \u2013 the senior [[Northern Court]] and the junior [[Southern Court]] \u2013 had a claim to the throne. The problem was solved with the intercession of the Kamakura shogunate, who had the two lines alternate. This lasted until 1331, when [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (of the Southern Court) tried to overthrow the shogunate to stop the alternation. As a result, Daigo was exiled. Around 1334\u20131336, [[Ashikaga Takauji]] helped Daigo regain his throne.<ref name=\"sansom\">{{cite book |title=A History of Japan, 1134\u20131615 |first=George |last=Sansom |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/reviews/h/history-of-japan-1334-1615.html |year=1961 |location=United States |publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref>\n\nThe fight against the shogunate left the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] with too many people claiming a limited supply of land. Takauji turned against the Emperor when the discontent about the distribution of land grew great enough. In 1336 Daigo was banished again, in favor of a new Emperor.<ref name=\"sansom\" />\n\nDuring the [[Kenmu Restoration]], after the fall of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, another short-lived shogun arose. [[Prince Moriyoshi]] (Morinaga), son of Go-Daigo, was awarded the title of ''Sei-i Taish\u014dgun''. However, Prince Moriyoshi was later put under [[house arrest]] and, in 1335, killed by [[Ashikaga Tadayoshi]].\n\n===Ashikaga shogunate (1336\u20131573)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n{{Main|Ashikaga shogunate|Muromachi period}}\n[[File:Ashikaga_Takauji.JPG|thumb|left|[[Ashikaga Takauji]] (1338\u20131358) established the [[Ashikaga shogunate]]]]\n\nIn 1338, [[Ashikaga Takauji]], like Minamoto no Yoritomo, a descendant of the [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] princes, was awarded the title of ''sei-i taish\u014dgun'' and established the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], which nominally lasted until 1573. The Ashikaga had their headquarters in the Muromachi district of Kyoto, and the time during which they ruled is also known as the [[Muromachi period]].\n\n===Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period (1573\u20131600)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\n{{see|Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period}}\nWhile the title of shogun went into abeyance due to technical reasons, [[Oda Nobunaga]] and his successor, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], who later obtained the position of [[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|Imperial Regent]], gained far greater power than any of their predecessors had.

 barset:skip\n</timeline>\n\n==Shogunate==\nThe term {{Nihongo||\u5e55\u5e9c|bakufu|extra=\"tent government\"}} originally meant the dwelling and household of a shogun, but in time, became a [[metonym]] for the system of government of a feudal [[military dictatorship]], exercised in the name of the shogun or by the shogun himself. Therefore, various ''bakufu'' held absolute power over the country (territory ruled at that time) without pause from 1192 to 1867, glossing over actual power, clan and title transfers.\n\nThe shogunate system was originally established under the Kamakura shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. Although theoretically, the state (and therefore the Emperor) held ownership of all land in Japan. The system had some [[feudal]] elements, with lesser territorial lords pledging their allegiance to greater ones. [[Samurai]] were rewarded for their loyalty with agricultural surplus, usually rice, or labor services from peasants. In contrast to European feudal knights, samurai were not landowners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Jerry|title=Traditions and Encounters|isbn=978-0-07-325230-8|pages=301\u2013302}}</ref> The hierarchy that held this system of government together was reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', samurai and their subordinates.\n\nEach shogunate was dynamic, not static. Power was constantly shifting and authority was often ambiguous. The study of the ebbs and flows in this complex history continues to occupy the attention of scholars. Each shogunate encountered competition. Sources of competition included the Emperor and the court aristocracy, the remnants of the imperial governmental systems, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', the ''[[sh\u014den]]'' system, the great temples and shrines, the ''[[s\u014dhei]]'', the ''[[shugo]]'' and ''[[jit\u014d]]'', the ''[[jizamurai]]'' and early modern ''daimy\u014d''. Each shogunate reflected the necessity of new ways of balancing the changing requirements of central and regional authorities.<ref>Mass, J. et al., eds. (1985). ''The Bakufu in Japanese History'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n== Relationship with the emperor ==\n[[File:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|thumb|left|100px|Imperial Seal of Japan]]\n{{main|Emperor of Japan}}\n\nSince [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] turned the figure of the shogun into a permanent and hereditary position and until the [[Meiji Restoration]] there were two ruling classes in Japan: 1. the emperor or {{nihongo|''[[tenn\u014d]]''|\u5929\u7687|extra=lit. \"Heavenly Sovereign\"}},<ref name=\"Mitchelhill\">Mitchelhill & Green, 2003:59.</ref> who acted as \"chief priest\" of the official religion of the country, [[Shinto]], and 2. the shogun, head of the army who also enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority.<ref name=\"Kuno245\">Kuno, 2007:245.</ref> Although in theory the shogun was an emperor's servant, it became the true power behind the throne.<ref>Davis, 2001:205.</ref>\n\nNo shogun tried to usurp the throne, even when they had at their disposal the military power of the territory. There were two reasons primarily:<ref>Roth, 2007:103.</ref>\n\n*Theoretically the shogun received the power of the emperor, so this was his symbol of authority.\n*There was a sentimentalist tradition created by priests and religious who traced the imperial line from the \"age of the gods\" into an \"eternal line unbroken by the times.\" According to Japanese mythology, the emperor was a direct descendant of [[Amaterasu]], goddess of the [[sun]].\n\nUnable to usurp the throne, the shoguns sought throughout history to keep the emperor away from the country's political activity, relegating them from the sphere of influence. One of the few powers that the imperial house could retain was that of being able to \"control time\" through the designation of the Japanese [[Neng\u014d]] or Eras and the issuance of calendars.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:235.</ref>\n\nThis is a highlight of two historical attempts of the emperor to recover the power they enjoyed before the establishment of the shogunate. In 1219 the [[Emperor Go-Toba]] accused the H\u014dj\u014d as outlaws. Imperial troops mobilized, leading to the [[J\u014dky\u016b War]] (1219-1221), which would culminate in the third [[Battle of Uji (1221)]]. During this, the imperial troops were defeated and the emperor Go-Toba was exiled.<ref name=\"Pag41\">Turnbull, 2006a:41.</ref> With the defeat of Go-Toba, the samurai government over the country was confirmed.<ref name=\"Pag41\" /> At the beginning of the fourteenth century the [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] decided to rebel, but the H\u014dj\u014d, who were then regents, sent an army from Kamakura. The emperor fled before the troops arrived and took the imperial insignia.<ref name=\"Pag43\">Turnbull, 2006a:43.</ref> The shogun named his own emperor, giving rise to the era {{nihongo|''[[Nanbokuch\u014d]]''|\u5357\u5317\u671d|extra=lit. \"Southern and Northern Courts\"}}.\n\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, the shogunate was severely pressured both abroad and by foreign powers. It was then that various groups angry with the shogunate for the concessions made to the various European countries found in the figure of the emperor an ally through which they could expel the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] from power. The motto of this movement was {{nihongo|''[[Sonn\u014d j\u014di]]''|\u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937|extra=\"Revere the Emperor, Eject the Barbarians\"}} and they finally succeeded in 1868, when imperial power was restored after centuries of being in the shadow of the country's political life.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:236.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nUpon Japan's surrender after World War II, American Army General [[Douglas MacArthur]] became Japan's ''de facto'' ruler during the years of occupation.

The Taira family seized control from 1160 to 1185, but was defeated by the Minamoto in the [[Battle of Dan-no-ura]]. [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] seized power from the central government and aristocracy and established a [[feudal system]] based in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] in which the private military, the [[samurai]], gained some political powers while the Emperor and the [[aristocracy]] remained the ''[[de jure]]'' rulers. In 1192, Yoritomo was awarded the title of ''Sei-i Taish\u014dgun'' by [[Emperor Go-Toba]] and the political system he developed with a succession of shoguns as the head became known as a shogunate.

Two imperial families \u2013 the senior [[Northern Court]] and the junior [[Southern Court]] \u2013 had a claim to the throne. The problem was solved with the intercession of the Kamakura shogunate, who had the two lines alternate. This lasted until 1331, when [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (of the Southern Court) tried to overthrow the shogunate to stop the alternation. As a result, Daigo was exiled. Around 1334\u20131336, [[Ashikaga Takauji]] helped Daigo regain his throne.<ref name=\"sansom\">{{cite book |title=A History of Japan, 1134\u20131615 |first=George |last=Sansom |url=http://www.gotterdammerung.org/books/reviews/h/history-of-japan-1334-1615.html |year=1961 |location=United States |publisher=Stanford University Press}}</ref>\n\nThe fight against the shogunate left the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] with too many people claiming a limited supply of land.

[[Prince Moriyoshi]] (Morinaga), son of Go-Daigo, was awarded the title of ''Sei-i Taish\u014dgun''.

 barset:skip\n</timeline>\n\n==Shogunate==\nThe term {{Nihongo||\u5e55\u5e9c|bakufu|extra=\"tent government\"}} originally meant the dwelling and household of a shogun, but in time, became a [[metonym]] for the system of government of a feudal [[military dictatorship]], exercised in the name of the shogun or by the shogun himself. Therefore, various ''bakufu'' held absolute power over the country (territory ruled at that time) without pause from 1192 to 1867, glossing over actual power, clan and title transfers.\n\nThe shogunate system was originally established under the Kamakura shogunate by [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]]. Although theoretically, the state (and therefore the Emperor) held ownership of all land in Japan. The system had some [[feudal]] elements, with lesser territorial lords pledging their allegiance to greater ones. [[Samurai]] were rewarded for their loyalty with agricultural surplus, usually rice, or labor services from peasants. In contrast to European feudal knights, samurai were not landowners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=Jerry|title=Traditions and Encounters|isbn=978-0-07-325230-8|pages=301\u2013302}}</ref> The hierarchy that held this system of government together was reinforced by close ties of loyalty between the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', samurai and their subordinates.\n\nEach shogunate was dynamic, not static. Power was constantly shifting and authority was often ambiguous. The study of the ebbs and flows in this complex history continues to occupy the attention of scholars. Each shogunate encountered competition. Sources of competition included the Emperor and the court aristocracy, the remnants of the imperial governmental systems, the ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'', the ''[[sh\u014den]]'' system, the great temples and shrines, the ''[[s\u014dhei]]'', the ''[[shugo]]'' and ''[[jit\u014d]]'', the ''[[jizamurai]]'' and early modern ''daimy\u014d''. Each shogunate reflected the necessity of new ways of balancing the changing requirements of central and regional authorities.<ref>Mass, J. et al., eds. (1985). ''The Bakufu in Japanese History'', p. 189.</ref>\n\n== Relationship with the emperor ==\n[[File:Imperial Seal of Japan.svg|thumb|left|100px|Imperial Seal of Japan]]\n{{main|Emperor of Japan}}\n\nSince [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] turned the figure of the shogun into a permanent and hereditary position and until the [[Meiji Restoration]] there were two ruling classes in Japan: 1. the emperor or {{nihongo|''[[tenn\u014d]]''|\u5929\u7687|extra=lit. \"Heavenly Sovereign\"}},<ref name=\"Mitchelhill\">Mitchelhill & Green, 2003:59.</ref> who acted as \"chief priest\" of the official religion of the country, [[Shinto]], and 2. the shogun, head of the army who also enjoyed civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority.<ref name=\"Kuno245\">Kuno, 2007:245.</ref> Although in theory the shogun was an emperor's servant, it became the true power behind the throne.<ref>Davis, 2001:205.</ref>\n\nNo shogun tried to usurp the throne, even when they had at their disposal the military power of the territory. There were two reasons primarily:<ref>Roth, 2007:103.</ref>\n\n*Theoretically the shogun received the power of the emperor, so this was his symbol of authority.\n*There was a sentimentalist tradition created by priests and religious who traced the imperial line from the \"age of the gods\" into an \"eternal line unbroken by the times.\" According to Japanese mythology, the emperor was a direct descendant of [[Amaterasu]], goddess of the [[sun]].\n\nUnable to usurp the throne, the shoguns sought throughout history to keep the emperor away from the country's political activity, relegating them from the sphere of influence. One of the few powers that the imperial house could retain was that of being able to \"control time\" through the designation of the Japanese [[Neng\u014d]] or Eras and the issuance of calendars.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:235.</ref>\n\nThis is a highlight of two historical attempts of the emperor to recover the power they enjoyed before the establishment of the shogunate. In 1219 the [[Emperor Go-Toba]] accused the H\u014dj\u014d as outlaws. Imperial troops mobilized, leading to the [[J\u014dky\u016b War]] (1219-1221), which would culminate in the third [[Battle of Uji (1221)]]. During this, the imperial troops were defeated and the emperor Go-Toba was exiled.<ref name=\"Pag41\">Turnbull, 2006a:41.</ref> With the defeat of Go-Toba, the samurai government over the country was confirmed.<ref name=\"Pag41\" /> At the beginning of the fourteenth century the [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] decided to rebel, but the H\u014dj\u014d, who were then regents, sent an army from Kamakura. The emperor fled before the troops arrived and took the imperial insignia.<ref name=\"Pag43\">Turnbull, 2006a:43.</ref> The shogun named his own emperor, giving rise to the era {{nihongo|''[[Nanbokuch\u014d]]''|\u5357\u5317\u671d|extra=lit. \"Southern and Northern Courts\"}}.\n\nDuring the 1850s and 1860s, the shogunate was severely pressured both abroad and by foreign powers. It was then that various groups angry with the shogunate for the concessions made to the various European countries found in the figure of the emperor an ally through which they could expel the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] from power. The motto of this movement was {{nihongo|''[[Sonn\u014d j\u014di]]''|\u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937|extra=\"Revere the Emperor, Eject the Barbarians\"}} and they finally succeeded in 1868, when imperial power was restored after centuries of being in the shadow of the country's political life.<ref>Fi\u00e9v\u00e9 & Waley, 2003:236.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nUpon Japan's surrender after World War II, American Army General [[Douglas MacArthur]] became Japan's ''de facto'' ruler during the years of occupation. So great was his influence in Japan that he has been dubbed the {{Nihongo||\u5916\u4eba\u5c06\u8ecd|Gaijin Sh\u014dgun}}.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Valley|first1=David J.|title=Gaijin Shogun : Gen.

He was the last [[pope]] to seek the consent of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[exarch of Ravenna]] for his election.\n\n==Election==\nGregory was the son of a Syrian named John.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios726.htm|title= The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church|accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> He was [[papal selection before 1059|elected pope]] by popular acclamation on 11 February 731, but was not formally [[episcopal consecration|consecrated]] as [[bishop of Rome]] until 18 March,<ref>Mann, p. 204</ref> after having received the approval of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[exarch of Ravenna]]. He was the last pope to seek the exarch\u2019s ratification of a papal election.<ref>Levillain, p. 643</ref>\n\n==Iconoclasm==\nImmediately upon his accession, Gregory appealed to [[Emperor Leo III]] to moderate his position on the [[iconoclasm]]. When Gregory's representative was arrested on the orders of the emperor, Gregory called a [[Synods of Rome (731)|synod]] in November 731, which condemned iconoclasm outright.<ref>Treadgold, p. 354; Mann, p. 205</ref> Leo responded by trying to bring the pope under control, but the fleet he sent to enforce the imperial will was shipwrecked in the [[Adriatic Sea]].<ref>Levillain, p. 644; Mann, p. 206</ref> He then proceeded to appropriate papal territories in [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]], and transferred ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the former [[praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]] to the [[patriarch of Constantinople]].<ref>Duffy, p. 64; Mann, p. 207</ref> However, his attempt to force the [[duke of Naples]] to enforce an imperial decree to confiscate papal territory in the duchy failed, as the duke was supportive of the pope\u2019s stand.<ref>Mann, p. 208</ref>\n\nGregory, in the meantime, demonstrated his opposition to iconoclasm by emphasising his veneration of icons and relics. He repaired or beautified numerous churches, which involved their decoration with icons and images of [[Jesus Christ]], the [[Virgin Mary]] and the saints.<ref>Mann, pp. 208-209</ref> He ordered to be erected in the heart of [[St. Peter\u2019s Basilica]] an ''[[iconostasis]]'', situated between six [[onyx]] and [[marble]] columns which had been sent to Gregory as a gift from the exarch [[Eutychius (exarch)|Eutychius]].<ref>Duffy, p. 63; Mann, p. 210</ref> He built a new oratory in St. Peter's Basilica to house the relics of a number of saints, convoking a [[Synod of Rome (732)|synod in 732]] in order to regulate the prayers and masses to be said there.<ref>Mann, p. 209</ref> Gregory was an enthusiastic supporter of [[monasticism]]; he established the monastery of [[San Crisogono|St. Chrysogonus]] and rebuilt the hospice of [[Saints Sergius and Bacchus]], near St. Peter's, endowing it for the support of the poor.<ref>Mann, pp. 210-211</ref>\n\n==Ecclesiastical policy==\nA temporary lull in the conflict between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and the [[Lombards]] allowed Gregory to deal with some longstanding internal issues, in particular the ongoing jurisdictional dispute between the patriarchs of [[Patriarch of Grado|Grado]] and [[Patriarch of Aquileia|Aquileia]]. Although the Synod of 731 had adjudicated in this matter in favour of Grado, Gregory was forced to reprimand the patriarch of Aquileia, Calixtus, who had attempted to gain possession of the island of [[Barbana, Italy|Barbana]] from Grado\u2019s jurisdiction.<ref>Mann, pp. 211-212</ref> In 731, he approved the election of [[Tatwine]] as [[archbishop of Canterbury]], after the latter came to Rome in person to ask for the [[pallium]].

A second was addressed to the nobles and people of Germany, urging them to obey Boniface. A third, addressed to the bishops in [[Alamannia]] and Bavaria, confirmed Boniface\u2019s status as the [[papal vicar]], ordering them to assemble in a council twice a year at [[Augsburg]] under Boniface\u2019s authority.<ref>Mann, pp. 214-215</ref> Gregory promoted the mission of [[Willibald]] in Germany.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15644c.htm Mershman, Francis. \"Sts.

Thrasimund was forced to flee Spoleto, seeking refuge in Rome, where he was welcomed by Gregory.<ref>Treadgold, p. 355; Mann, pp. 217-218</ref>\n\nBy the middle of 739, Liutprand was encroaching once again on the Exarchate and threatening Rome.

They have seized the very means set aside to furnish funds for the lights ever kept burning at St. Peter s tomb, and they have carried off offerings that have been made by you and by those who have gone before you. And because, after God, we have turned to you, the Lombards deride and oppress us. Hence the Church of St. Peter has been stripped and reduced to the last straits. We have put into the mouth of the bearer of this letter, your faithful servant all our woes, which he will be able to unfold to you. Please come at once, to show your love towards St. Peter, and us, his own people.\"<ref>Mann, pp. 219-220</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis time Charles Martel did send an embassy to Rome, and this implicit support, together with the beginnings of fever running through his troops, forced Liutprand to march back to [[Pavia]] by the end of August 739.<ref>Mann, p. 220</ref> Taking advantage of this withdrawal, Gregory agreed to support Thrasimund II's return to Spoleto.

In desperation, Gregory sent ambassadors to [[Charles Martel]], the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[mayor of the Palace]], begging him to intervene on the pope\u2019s behalf.<ref>Duffy, p. 68</ref> Although Gregory stated that he was willing to give up his allegiance to the Eastern Empire and place himself under the protection of the Franks, Charles made no promise to assist, since he was fully occupied by the [[Umayyad invasion of Gaul]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Michael Collins|title=The Fisherman's Net: The Influence of the Popes on History|date=1 Aug 2005|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=9781587680335|page=[https://archive.org/details/fishermansnet00mich/page/85 85]|edition=reprint, revised|url=https://archive.org/details/fishermansnet00mich/page/85}}</ref><ref>Mann, pp. 218-219</ref> Gregory himself referred to these [[Saracen]] Muslims as ''gens ferocissima'' or \"that most fierce nation\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Irfan Shah\u00eed|title=Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century|date=1984|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|isbn=9780884021162|page=187|edition=illustrated, reprint}}</ref> The Lombard capture of the towns of [[Amelia, Umbria|{{not a typo|Ameria}}]], [[Orte|Ortas]], [[Bomarzo|Polimartium]] and [[Blera]] once again caused Gregory to write to Charles, this time in even greater tones of despair, beseeching his aid:<ref>Mann, p. 219</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Our affliction moves us to write to you once again, trusting that you are a loving son of St. Peter and of us, and that, from respect for him, you will come and defend the Church of God and His peculiar people, who are now unable to endure the persecution and oppression of the Lombards. They have seized the very means set aside to furnish funds for the lights ever kept burning at St. Peter s tomb, and they have carried off offerings that have been made by you and by those who have gone before you. And because, after God, we have turned to you, the Lombards deride and oppress us. Hence the Church of St. Peter has been stripped and reduced to the last straits. We have put into the mouth of the bearer of this letter, your faithful servant all our woes, which he will be able to unfold to you. Please come at once, to show your love towards St. Peter, and us, his own people.\"<ref>Mann, pp. 219-220</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis time Charles Martel did send an embassy to Rome, and this implicit support, together with the beginnings of fever running through his troops, forced Liutprand to march back to [[Pavia]] by the end of August 739.<ref>Mann, p. 220</ref> Taking advantage of this withdrawal, Gregory agreed to support Thrasimund II's return to Spoleto. Thrasimund II forced his way back in by December 739 with Roman armed support, but refused to hand over the four captured towns he had promised in exchange for papal support.<ref>Levillain, p. 644; Mann, p. 222</ref> Learning that Charles Martel was sick, Liutprand once again returned to attacking the Exarchate in 740, forcing Gregory yet again to appeal to the Franks, who again refused to become involved.<ref>Levillain; p. 644; Mann, pp. 221-222</ref>\n\n==Death==\nUnsuccessful at stopping the Lombard advance, Gregory III died on 28 November 741.<ref>Mann, p. 223</ref> He was succeeded by [[Pope Zachary]].

The top {{convert|40|ft|m}} is an octagonal lantern.\n\nThe [[listed building|Grade I listed]] tower was badly damaged in the [[Great Storm of 1987]], and the lantern was removed in 1996.<ref name=Folly>[http://www.follytowers.com/hadlow.html Folly Towers]</ref> The tower's condition then worsened rapidly. The cost of repairs was estimated at [[Pound Sterling|\u00a3]]4 million. In July 2006, [[Tonbridge and Malling|Tonbridge and Malling borough council]] announced that it would issue a [[compulsory purchase order]] (CPO) on the tower in an effort to save it.<ref name=Telegraph>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=3B2N005U5MSNNQFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2006/07/24/nfolly24.xml Daily Telegraph, 24 July 2006]</ref> This CPO was confirmed in March 2008 by the [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport]], with plans for the council to take possession of the Tower and transfer it to the Vivat Trust in late 2009, so that the necessary repair and restoration work can be undertaken; plans included short-term holiday accommodation, with a separate exhibition centre on part of the ground floor.<ref>[http://vivat-trust.org/hadlow-tower.aspx Vivat Trust website]</ref>\n\nIn January 2011, it was announced that the tower had been compulsorily purchased by Tonbridge and Malling District Council; the council sold it to the Vivat Trust for \u00a31. Restoration of the tower, including the replacement of the lantern commenced in February 2011, with completion then scheduled for September 2012. The project was funded by grants from [[English Heritage]] and the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]].<ref name=KSC140111>{{cite news|title=Restoration of historic tower gets go-ahead |first=Lee |last=Moran |newspaper=Kent and Sussex Courier |date=14 January 2011 |page=8}}</ref> The latter granted \u00a32,000,000 of the estimated \u00a34,000,000 restoration cost.
