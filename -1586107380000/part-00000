{"title_page": "Micaela Bastidas", "text_new": "'''Micaela Bastidas Puyucahua''' (born in [[Tamburco District|Tamburco]], 1744; died in [[Cusco]], May 18, 1781), was a pioneering [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] leader against [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] in [[South America]], and a [[martyr]] for [[Peruvian]] independence. With her husband [[T\u00fapac Amaru II]], she led a rebellion against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and like him, suffered martyrdom of execution by the Spaniards when the revolt failed. She was a full partner in her husband's enterprises before the revolt, and \"an exceptionally able leader of the rebellion.\"<ref>Charles F. Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', Cambridge MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2014, p. 21</ref> She has been described as the \"celebrated wife of Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Condorcanqui (T\u00fapac Amaru II)... who played a paramount role in the logistics of the rebel army in Cuzco in 1780 and 1781.<ref>Cecilia M\u00e9ndez, ''The Plebeian Republic: The Huant Rebellion and the Making of the Peruvian State, 1820-1850''. Durham: Duke University Press 2005, pp. 174-75.</ref>  \n\n==Biography==\nThe documentation on the life of Micaela Bastidas is not ample in comparison to that of her husband, but the historical record documents her birth, marriage, and death.<ref>Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', pp. 20-21, 289.</ref> Micaela was born in Pampamarca province of Canas (laqaymarca annexed iromocco community of Pabellones, of the district of Pampamarca, of the province of Canas in 1744). She was the natural daughter of Manuel Bastidas (d. 1746) (perhaps of [[African descent]] or a priest) and Josefa Puyucahua Sisa. Given her status as an illegitimate child perhaps either of a priest or a black, she was marginalized in the overwhelmingly indigenous Andean highlands. Micaela spoke Quechua better than Spanish. She was a devout Catholic, but had little formal schooling.<ref>Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 21.</ref> An account describes her as being  \"a beautiful Indian girl.\"<ref>Clements R. Markham, ''Travels in Peru and India''. London: John Murray 1862, pp. 135-36 cited in Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 289.</ref>  It is unclear whether she was of African descent, since virtually nothing is known about her father, but some documents refer to her as a [[zambo|Zamba]], a name given during the [[castas|colonial-era racial hierarchy]] for those of [[Multiracial|mixed race]], African and indigenous.  Her marriage certificate listed her parents as both being \"Spaniards\" (''espa\u00f1oles''), but there was considerable fluidity in the system of racial classification, and such a designation may have been a \"sign of respectability.\"<ref name=\":0\">Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 21</ref>\n\nOn May 25, 1760, before her sixteenth birthday, Micaela married Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Condorcanqui, who later used the name [[T\u00fapac Amaru II]], in the church of Our Lady of Purification in the city of [[Surimana]]. Jos\u00e9 Gabriel was a young mixed-race descendant of an important figure in [[History of Peru|Peruvian history]], of the Inca [[Tupac Amaru]] I, executed by the Spanish in 1572. In 1764, he was named the ''[[cacique]]'' or ''[[kuraka]]'' of the territories corresponding with his legacy: [[Pampamarca District, Canas|Pampamarca]], [[Tunka Suka|Tungasuca]], and [[Surimana]]. The title and perquisites of power were hereditary. He fixed his residency with Micaela in Tinta, a region of [[Cusco]]. The couple produced three sons, Hip\u00f3lito (1761), Mariano (1762), and Fernando (1768), baptized by the same priest that married them.<ref>Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 21.</ref>\n\nJos\u00e9 Gabriel had received a privileged education in the school of [[Jesuits]] in [[Lima]] and [[Cusco]] at a school for the sons of indigenous lords. He spoke and wrote [[Spanish language|Spanish]], spoke [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], and knew some [[Latin]] from his Jesuit education.  He was the owner of large extensions of land and riches, having many roles of administration of their property. As a chief, he would mediate between the chief magistrate and indigenous people and their crime charges. As he prospered, he saw how the rest of the population was affected due to the physical revolts and creation of internal customs.  As a regional trader over an extensive network, with 350 mules to carry trade-goods, he was in an excellent position to forge relationships with those he traded with and gather information about local conditions and concerns. As a person of mixed roots, he felt that he touched all of the injustices to his people firsthand. He came up with strategies and official applications to the authorities of Tinta [[Cusco]] and [[Lima]] so that indigenous people were freed from obligatory work in the mines and exonerated from compliance with forced labor. He usually met with negativity and indifference, but began to develop a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[ideology]] based on the defense of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]], [[Slavery|slaves]], [[creole peoples|creoles]], and people of mixed races, while guiding the independence of the territory and commerce from the decisions of the [[Monarchy of Spain|crown of Spain]].\n\nThe marriage was a happy one and a full partnership. An important series of letters in Spanish exchanged between them during the early period of the rebellion include endearments and pet names for each other, as well as concerns about the other's safety.<ref>Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 99. Walker cites letters published in the ''Colecci\u00f3n Documental del de la Independencia del Per\u00fa'', II, 2.</ref>\n\nAfter that she was captured in a failed uprising. She had joined her spouse in leading the rebellion, leading [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] men and women in a battle for independence as well as organizing supplies and recruiting forces.<ref>{{cite book|last=Uglow|first=Jennifer|title=The Northeastern Dictionary of Women's Biography|year=1999|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-421-9|author2=Maggy Hendry|editor=Frances Hinton|page=[https://archive.org/details/northeasterndict0000uglo/page/75 75]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/northeasterndict0000uglo/page/75}}</ref>\n\nShe was [[executed]] by the Spanish very painfully on May 18, 1781, at 36 years of age. The Spanish attempted to use a hand-cranked garrote on her that had been designed for the occasion and first used on fellow rebel [[Tomasa Tito Condemayta]], but because her neck was so slender she was instead strangled with a rope.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her son Hip\u00f3lito was also executed by the Spanish, both of them in front of [[Tupac Amaru II]], who himself was then quartered and beheaded by the Spanish.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bartolina Sisa]]\n* [[Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II]]\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Campbell, Leon G. \"The Army of Peru and the T\u00fapac Amaru Revolt, 1780-1783\".

With her husband [[T\u00fapac Amaru II]], she led a rebellion against the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and like him, suffered martyrdom of execution by the Spaniards when the revolt failed. She was a full partner in her husband's enterprises before the revolt, and \"an exceptionally able leader of the rebellion.\"<ref>Charles F. Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', Cambridge MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press 2014, p. 21</ref> She has been described as the \"celebrated wife of Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Condorcanqui (T\u00fapac Amaru II)... who played a paramount role in the logistics of the rebel army in Cuzco in 1780 and 1781.<ref>Cecilia M\u00e9ndez, ''The Plebeian Republic: The Huant Rebellion and the Making of the Peruvian State, 1820-1850''.

She was the natural daughter of Manuel Bastidas (d. 1746) (perhaps of [[African descent]] or a priest) and Josefa Puyucahua Sisa. Given her status as an illegitimate child perhaps either of a priest or a black, she was marginalized in the overwhelmingly indigenous Andean highlands. Micaela spoke Quechua better than Spanish. She was a devout Catholic, but had little formal schooling.<ref>Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 21.</ref> An account describes her as being  \"a beautiful Indian girl.\"<ref>Clements R. Markham, ''Travels in Peru and India''. London: John Murray 1862, pp. 135-36 cited in Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 289.</ref>  It is unclear whether she was of African descent, since virtually nothing is known about her father, but some documents refer to her as a [[zambo|Zamba]], a name given during the [[castas|colonial-era racial hierarchy]] for those of [[Multiracial|mixed race]], African and indigenous.  Her marriage certificate listed her parents as both being \"Spaniards\" (''espa\u00f1oles''), but there was considerable fluidity in the system of racial classification, and such a designation may have been a \"sign of respectability.\"<ref name=\":0\">Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 21</ref>\n\nOn May 25, 1760, before her sixteenth birthday, Micaela married Jos\u00e9 Gabriel Condorcanqui, who later used the name [[T\u00fapac Amaru II]], in the church of Our Lady of Purification in the city of [[Surimana]]. Jos\u00e9 Gabriel was a young mixed-race descendant of an important figure in [[History of Peru|Peruvian history]], of the Inca [[Tupac Amaru]] I, executed by the Spanish in 1572. In 1764, he was named the ''[[cacique]]'' or ''[[kuraka]]'' of the territories corresponding with his legacy: [[Pampamarca District, Canas|Pampamarca]], [[Tunka Suka|Tungasuca]], and [[Surimana]]. The title and perquisites of power was hereditary. He fixed his residency with Micaela in Tinta, a region of [[Cusco]]. The couple produced three sons, Hip\u00f3lito (1761), Mariano (1762), and Fernando (1768), baptized by the same priest that married them.<ref>Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 21.</ref>\n\nJos\u00e9 Gabriel had received a privileged education in the school of [[Jesuits]] in [[Lima]] and [[Cusco]] at a school for the sons of indigenous lords. He spoke and wrote [[Spanish language|Spanish]], spoke [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], and knew some [[Latin]] from his Jesuit education.  He was the owner of large extensions of land and riches, having many roles of administration of their property. As a chief, he would mediate between the chief magistrate and indigenous people and their crime charges. As he prospered, he saw how the rest of the population was affected due to the physical revolts and creation of internal customs.  As a regional trader over an extensive network, with 350 mules to carry trade-goods, he was in an excellent position to forge relationships with those he traded with and gather information about local conditions and concerns. As a person of mixed roots, he felt that he touched all of the injustice with his people firsthand. He came up with strategies and official applications to the authorities of Tinta, [[Cusco]] and [[Lima]] so that indigenous people were freed from obligatory work in the mines and were exonerated with compliance of forced labor. He always got negativity and indifference, but began to develop a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[ideology]] based on the defense of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous people]], [[Slavery|slaves]], [[creole peoples|creoles]], and people of mixed races, while guiding the independence of the territory and commerce from the decisions of the [[Monarchy of Spain|crown of Spain]].\n\nThe marriage was a happy one and a full partnership. An important series of letters in Spanish exchanged between them during the early period of the rebellion include endearments and pet names for each other, as well as concerns about the other's safety.<ref>Walker, ''The Tupac Amaru Rebellion'', p. 99. Walker cites letters published in the ''Colecci\u00f3n Documental del de la Independencia del Per\u00fa'', II, 2.</ref>\n\nAfter that she was captured in a failed uprising. She had joined her spouse in leading the rebellion, leading [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] men and women in a battle for independence as well as organizing supplies and recruiting forces.<ref>{{cite book|last=Uglow|first=Jennifer|title=The Northeastern Dictionary of Women's Biography|year=1999|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-421-9|author2=Maggy Hendry|editor=Frances Hinton|page=[https://archive.org/details/northeasterndict0000uglo/page/75 75]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/northeasterndict0000uglo/page/75}}</ref>\n\nShe was [[executed]] by the Spanish very painfully on May 18, 1781, at 36 years of age. The Spanish attempted to use a hand-cranked garrote on her that had been designed for the occasion and first used on fellow rebel [[Tomasa Tito Condemayta]], but because her neck was so slender she was instead strangled with a rope.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her son Hip\u00f3lito was also executed by the Spanish, both of them in front of [[Tupac Amaru II]], who himself was then quartered and beheaded by the Spanish.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bartolina Sisa]]\n* [[Rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II]]\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Campbell, Leon G. \"The Army of Peru and the T\u00fapac Amaru Revolt, 1780-1783\".
