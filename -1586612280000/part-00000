Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Keir Starmer]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

However, the [[Kong River]] (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and [[rhododendrons]] at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of [[bear]]s, [[serow]], large antlered [[muntjac]], large number of [[gaur]]s and tigers.

The Lao government classifies them as \u201c[[Lao Theung]]\u201d (mid-slope Lao), but an ethno-linguistic categorization, based on [[language families]], places them under the Austroasiatic family.  Within this broad family, the ethnic groups of Sekong fall into two linguistic branches: the [[Katuic]] (including the Katu and the Nge/Krieng) and the Bahnaric (Alak and Tarieng). Approximately 14,700 Katu live in the province.{{sfn|Tagwerker|2009|p=73}}\n\n==Economy==\nSekong Province is one of the poorest provinces in Laos, second to only Houphanh Province.

Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade in the province. There is tremendous and growing pressure on Sekong to log its forests \u2013 both from Vietnamese interests (where the wood furniture sector averaged 70% growth per year during 2000\u20132004) and from Lao companies (who face wood shortages because of dwindling stocks in lowland forests).\n{{sfn|Wittmer|Gundimeda|2012|p=69}} The economic return from the forest resources of the province, as of 2003, was estimated to be in the range of US$398 to 525 per household, and more than the agricultural income. The revenue to the state from sale of timber was also very substantial, estimated to be US$10.35 per ha. The natural forests in the province are also helpful in carbon sequestration benefits estimated to be US$124 per ha and also in watershed improvements, by way of avoiding erosion and reducing flood incidence.<ref name=\"Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR\">{{cite book|title=Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwUkX-QRrR0C&pg=PA33|accessdate=10 December 2012|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-955-8177-47-1|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\nCorruption of the provincial level authorities in Sekong province is a problem, and they have reportedly \"actively undermined a successful donor-funded village participatory sustainable forest management initiative.\"{{sfn|Snelder|Lasco|2008|p=266}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Laos Lawae082122a.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Laos Katoo081999a.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Bru and Katu locals of Sekong Province wearing stripped line clothing.\n}}\nThe cultural values in the province relate to: The indigenous Lao Teung culture with spiritual links to the land, five different \"[[Lao Teung]]\" languages with one becoming extinct, several funeral and sacred forests, [[Indochina War]] relics, and a stretch of the [[Ho Chi Min Trail]].<ref name=Sap/> [broken link] To ward off falling bombs during the Indochina War, some [[Animism|animist]] tribal people placed [[talisman]] above their huts.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2011|p=257}} Weaving activity in Sekong City has unique textile designs (in mulicoloured lines) and is aided by a back-tensioned loom called the \"[[hip loom]]\".

However, the [[Kong River]] (or Xe Kong, or Sekong) and its two tributaries Xe Sap and Xe Lon provide access to the reserve by boats. The reserve has many water falls, rocky cliffs and [[rhododendrons]] at higher elevations. There are 43 mammals (including 18 key species), 178 birds (18 are key species), 48 reptiles and 33 amphibians; the notable species of wildlife are two species of [[bear]]s, [[serow]], large antlered [[muntjac]], large number of [[gaur]]s and tigers.

The Lao government classifies them as \u201c[[Lao Theung]]\u201d (mid-slope Lao), but an ethno-linguistic categorization, based on [[language families]], places them under the Austroasiatic family.  Within this broad family, the ethnic groups of Sekong fall into two linguistic branches: the [[Katuic]] (including the Katu and the Nge/Krieng) and the Bahnaric (Alak and Tarieng). Approximately 14,700 Katu live in the province.{{sfn|Tagwerker|2009|p=73}}\n\n==Economy==\nSekong Province is one of the poorest provinces in Laos, second to only Houphanh Province.

Much of the natural forest in Sekong has never been subject to commercial logging, but this is changing fast. Commercial timber extraction has been expanding rapidly over the past decade in the province. There is tremendous and growing pressure on Sekong to log its forests \u2013 both from Vietnamese interests (where the wood furniture sector averaged 70% growth per year during 2000\u20132004) and from Lao companies (who face wood shortages because of dwindling stocks in lowland forests).\n{{sfn|Wittmer|Gundimeda|2012|p=69}} The economic return from the forest resources of the province, as of 2003, was estimated to be in the range of US$398 to 525 per household, and more than the agricultural income. The revenue to the state from sale of timber was also very substantial, estimated to be US$10.35 per ha. The natural forests in the province are also helpful in carbon sequestration benefits estimated to be US$124 per ha and also in watershed improvements, by way of avoiding erosion and reducing flood incidence.<ref name=\"Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR\">{{cite book|title=Balancing the returns to catchment management : the economic value of conserving natural forests in Sekong, Lao PDR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwUkX-QRrR0C&pg=PA33|accessdate=10 December 2012|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-955-8177-47-1|pages=33\u2013}}</ref>\nCorruption of the provincial level authorities in Sekong province is a problem, and they have reportedly \"actively undermined a successful donor-funded village participatory sustainable forest management initiative.\"{{sfn|Snelder|Lasco|2008|p=266}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Laos Lawae082122a.jpg\n| width1 = 200\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Laos Katoo081999a.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Bru and Katu locals of Sekong Province wearing stripped line clothing.\n}}\nThe cultural values in the province relate to: The indigenous Lao Teung culture with spiritual links to the land, five different \"[[Lao Teung]]\" languages with one becoming extinct, several funeral and sacred forests, [[Indochina War]] relics, and a stretch of the [[Ho Chi Min Trail]].<ref name=Sap/> [broken link] To ward off falling bombs during the Indochina War, some [[Animism|animist]] tribal people placed [[talisman]] above their huts.{{sfn|Rough Guides|2011|p=257}} Weaving activity in Sekong City has unique textile designs (in mulicoloured lines) and is aided by a back-tensioned loom called the \"[[hip loom]]\".
