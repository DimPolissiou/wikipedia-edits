Written and composed by its lead singer, [[Ray Dorset]], it celebrates the carefree days of summer. In 1970, it reached number one in charts around the world, including seven weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]], two weeks on one of the [[RPM (magazine)|Canadian charts]], and number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart in the US. It became one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles of all-time]], eventually selling 30 million copies.<ref>{{cite web|first= Craig |last= Harris |title= Ray Dorset \u2013 Artist Biography |website= [[AllMusic]] |accessdate= 20 January 2019 |url= https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ray-dorset-mn0000345252/biography}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= The essential summer mix |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 29 July 2006 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2006/jul/29/culturaltrips.pop}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Laura |last= Nightingale |title= Mungo Jerry celebrates 45 years of In the Summertime at Camberley Theatre |newspaper= [[Surrey Advertiser|Get Surrey]] |date= 7 October 2015 |accessdate= 10 February 2019 |url= https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/mungo-jerry-celebrates-45-years-10201428}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nDorset has said that the song only took ten minutes to write, which he did using a second-hand [[Fender Stratocaster]] while he was taking time off work from his regular job, working in a lab for [[Timex Group|Timex]].<ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Robertson |title= Whatever happened to In The Summertime singer Mungo Jerry |newspaper= [[Daily Express]] |date= 26 April 2014 |accessdate= 9 July 2014 |url= http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/472160/Mungo-Jerry-sang-In-The-Summertime}}</ref>\n\nThe initial UK release was on [[Dawn Records]], a new label launched by [[Pye Records|Pye]]. It was unusual in that it was a [[maxi single]], playing at 33-1/3 rpm, whereas singles generally played at 45 rpm. It included an additional song also written and composed by Dorset, \"Mighty Man,\" on the A-side, and a much longer track, the [[Woody Guthrie]] song \"Dust Pneumonia Blues,\" on the B-side. As the record was sold in a picture sleeve, also not standard at the time, and only sold at a few pence more than the normal 45 rpm two-track single, it was considered value for money. A small quantity of 45 rpm discs on the Pye record label, with \"Mighty Man\" on the B-side, and without a picture sleeve, were pressed for use in [[jukebox]]es. These are now rare collector's items.\n\nIn 2012, Dorset sued his former management company Associated Music International, run by his former friend and business manager Eliot Cohen, claiming over \u00a32 million in [[royalties]] from the song that he believed had been withheld from him.<ref>{{cite web|title= Mungo Jerry Star Suing Over Alleged Unpaid Royalties |website= [[Contactmusic.com]] |date= 22 January 2012 |accessdate= 25 May 2014 |url= http://www.contactmusic.com/news/mungo-jerry-star-suing-over-alleged-unpaid-royalties_1285706}}</ref><!-- outcome unclear, so assuming out-of-court settlement with reporting restrictions-->\n\nIn an interview with Gary James, Dorset explained the origin of the \"motorcycle\" sound towards the false ending in the middle of the song: \"I said, 'We'll just get a recording of a motorcycle, stick it on the end of the song and then re-edit the front and then put the front off to the motorcycle so it starts up again.' But I couldn't find a motorcycle. Howard Barry, the engineer had an old, well, it wasn't old then, a [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]] sports car, which he drove past the studio while Barry Marrit was holding the microphone. So, he got the stereo effects from left to right or right to left, whatever.

Written and composed by its lead singer, [[Ray Dorset]], it celebrates the carefree days of summer. In 1970, it reached number one in charts around the world, including seven weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]], two weeks on one of the [[RPM (magazine)|Canadian charts]], and number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart in the US.

It was unusual in that it was a [[maxi single]], playing at 33-1/3 rpm, whereas singles generally played at 45 rpm. It included an additional song also written and composed by Dorset, \"Mighty Man,\" on the A-side, and a much longer track, the [[Woody Guthrie]] song \"Dust Pneumonia Blues,\" on the B-side. As the record was sold in a picture sleeve, also not standard at the time, and only sold at a few pence more than the normal 45 rpm two-track single, it was considered value for money. A small quantity of 45 rpm discs on the Pye record label, with \"Mighty Man\" on the B-side, and without a picture sleeve, were pressed for use in [[jukebox]]es. These are now rare collector's items.\n\nIn 2012, Dorset sued his former management company Associated Music International, run by his former friend and business manager Eliot Cohen, claiming over \u00a32 million in [[royalties]] from the song that he believed had been withheld from him.<ref>{{cite web|title= Mungo Jerry Star Suing Over Alleged Unpaid Royalties |website= [[Contactmusic.com]] |date= 22 January 2012 |accessdate= 25 May 2014 |url= http://www.contactmusic.com/news/mungo-jerry-star-suing-over-alleged-unpaid-royalties_1285706}}</ref><!-- outcome unclear, so assuming out-of-court settlement with reporting restrictions-->\n\nIn an interview with Gary James, Dorset explained the origin of the \"motorcycle\" sound towards the false ending in the middle of the song: \"I said, 'We'll just get a recording of a motorcycle, stick it on the end of the song and then re-edit the front and then put the front off to the motorcycle so it starts up again.' But I couldn't find a motorcycle. Howard Barry, the engineer had an old, well, it wasn't old then, a [[Triumph Motor Company|Triumph]] sports car, which he drove past the studio while Barry Marrit was holding the microphone. So, he got the stereo effects from left to right or right to left, whatever.

In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]], but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the [[Russian Republic]], known as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]]. In February 1918, the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], which in 1924 established, within the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], a [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian autonomous republic]] (MASSR) on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Romania was [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|compelled to cede Bessarabia]] to the [[Soviet Union]], leading to the creation of the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR (east of the [[Dniester River]]).\n\nOn 27 August 1991, as the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] was underway, the Moldavian SSR [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] and took the name Moldova.<ref>http://www.natura2000oltenita-chiciu.ro/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Moldova-Pitoreasca-Picturesque-Moldavia-pdf-Vladimir-Toncea.pdf</ref> The [[constitution of Moldova]] was adopted in 1994. The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester has been under the ''[[de facto]]'' control of the breakaway government of [[Transnistria]] since 1990.\n\nDue to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the [[service sector]] has grown to dominate [[Economy of Moldova|Moldova's economy]] and is over 60% of the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]. Its economy is the poorest in Europe in per capita terms<ref name=\"CIA_World_Factbook_Moldova\"/> and has the lowest [[Human Development Index]] in the continent.\n\nMoldova is a [[parliamentary republic]] with a [[President of Moldova|president]] as [[head of state]] and a [[List of Prime Ministers of Moldova|prime minister]] as [[head of government]].

Drago\u0219 established a [[polity]] there as a vassal to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 1350s. The independence of the [[Principality]] of [[Moldavia]] was gained when [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]], another Vlach voivode from Maramure\u0219 who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. The Principality of [[Moldavia]] was bounded by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, the [[Dniester]] River in the east, and the Danube River and [[Black Sea]] to the south. Its territory comprised the present-day territory of the Republic of Moldova, the [[Western Moldavia|eastern eight counties]] of Romania, and parts of the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and [[Budjak]] region of Ukraine. Like the present-day republic and Romania's north-eastern region, it was known to the locals as ''Moldova''.\n\n===Between Poland and Hungary===\n[[File:Polska 1386 - 1434.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of the [[Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] between 1386 and 1434 showing the [[Principality of Moldavia]] as a Polish [[fief]].]]\n\nThe history of what is today Moldova has been intertwined with that of Poland for centuries. The Polish chronicler [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] mentioned Moldavians (under the name ''Wallachians'') as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|Ladislaus I]], against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].<ref>''The Annals of Jan D\u0142ugosz'', p. 273</ref> The Polish state was powerful enough to counter the [[Hungarian Kingdom]] which was consistently interested in bringing the area that would become Moldova into its political orbit.\n\nTies between Poland and Moldavia expanded after the founding of the Moldavian state by [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], a Vlach [[voivode]] from [[Maramure\u0219]] who had fallen out with the Hungarian king. Crossing the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359, the voivode took control of Moldavia and succeeded in creating Moldavia as an independent political entity. Despite being disfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[La\u021bcu of Moldavia|La\u021bcu]], the Moldavian ruler also likely allied himself with the [[Poles]]. La\u021bcu also accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences.\n\n[[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I]] profited from the end of the Polish-Hungarian union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of king [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|Jogaila of Poland]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Alb\u0103]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[Ghind\u0103oani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.\n\nAlthough [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), this ruler shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history.\n\n===The Ottomans===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical \n| alt1      = \n| image1   = \u0421\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c Cetatea Soroca Soroca Fortress (44738813601).jpg\n| alt2      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = The Soroca fortress.jpg\n| footer    = Built during the reign of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ''(pictured above)'', several authors believed the [[Soroca Fort]] was constructed on the site of a former [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] fortress named ''Olhionia''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.istoria.md/articol/103/Cetatea_Soroca_a_Moldovei| title=Cetatea Soroca a Moldovei (1499 \u2013 prezent)|publisher=Istoria.md| last=Bulat| first=Nicolae| language=Romanian}}</ref>\n| footer_align = left\n}}\nFor all of his success, it was under the reign of Alexander I that the very first confrontation with the [[Ottoman Turks]] took place at Cetatea Alb\u0103 in 1420. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] and the ascension of [[Peter III Aaron]] in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[Alex\u0103ndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].\n\nDuring this time, Moldavia was invaded repeatedly by Crimean [[Tatars]] and, beginning in the 15th century, by the Turks. In 1538, the principality became a [[tribute|tributary]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]], but it retained internal and partial external autonomy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/moldova/3.htm|title=Moldova: Early History|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=June 1995|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref> In May 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] removed [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]] from Moldavia's throne by winning the battle of [[Bac\u0103u]], briefly reuniting under his rule [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], and [[Transylvania]]. A Polish army led by [[Jan Zamoyski]] drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and reinstalled Ieremia Movil\u0103 to the throne, who put the country under the vassalage of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Moldavia finally returned to Ottoman vassalage in 1621.\n\nWhile the region of [[Transnistria (geographical region)|Transnistria]] was never politically part of the Principality of Moldavia, there were sizable areas which were owned by Moldavian boyars and given by the Moldavian rulers.

[[Ruxandra Lupu]], the daughter of Moldavian voivode [[Vasile Lupu]] who married [[Tymish Khmelnytsky]], lived in [[Ra\u0219cov]] according to Ukrainian tradition.\n\nWhile most of today's Moldova came into the Ottoman orbit in the 16th century, a substantial part of Transnistria remained a part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793.\n\n===Modern history===\n\n====Russian Empire====\nIn accordance with the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1812|Treaty of Bucharest of 1812]], and despite numerous protests by Moldavian nobles on behalf of the sovereignty of their principality, the [[Ottoman Empire]] (of which Moldavia was a [[Vassal state|vassal]]) ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] the [[Bessarabia|eastern half of the territory]] of the Principality of Moldavia along with [[Khotyn]] and old Bessarabia (modern [[Budjak]]), which Russia had already conquered and annexed. The new Russian province was called [[Bessarabia Governorate|Oblast of Moldavia and Bessarabia]], and initially enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. After 1828 this autonomy was progressively restricted and in 1871 the Oblast was transformed into the Bessarabia Governorate, in a process of [[Forced assimilation|state-imposed assimilation]], [[Russification]]. As part of this process, the [[Tsarist]] administration in Bessarabia gradually removed the [[Romanian language]] from official and religious use.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_10.shtml#bc_10| title=Bessarabia, Chapter X: The Survival of Roumanian| first=Charles Upson| last=Clark| year=1927| publisher=Dodd, Mead & Company| website=Depts.washington.edu| accessdate=9 October 2013| quote=Naturally, this system resulted not in acquisition of Russian by the Moldavians, but in their almost complete illiteracy in any language.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] returned the [[South Bessarabia|southern part of Bessarabia]] (later organised as the [[Cahul County|Cahul]], Bolgrad and Ismail counties) to Moldavia, which remained an autonomous principality and, in 1859, [[Moldavia and Wallachia|united]] with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]].

As a part of an ambitious economic liberalization effort, Moldova introduced a convertible currency, liberalized all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and liberalized interest rates. The government entered into agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to promote growth. \nThe economy reversed from decline in the late 1990s. Since 1999 the GDP (PPP) has had a steady growth as follows:<ref name=\"CIA_World_Factbook_Moldova\"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=md&v=65| title=Moldova \u2013 GDP (purchasing power parity) \u2013 Historical Data Graphs per Year| website=Indexmundi.com}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 2005 !! 2006 !! 2007 !! 2008 !! 2009 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015\n|-\n|8.41% || 9.07% || 9.76% || 10.67% || 10.13% || 10.99% || 6.80% || \u22120.70% || 8.90% || 1.80% || \u22121.10%\n|}\n\nAlthough estimates point to possible modest overvaluation of the real exchange rate, external competitiveness appears broadly adequate as reflected in strong sustained export performance.<ref name=\"imf.org\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14190.pdf |title=2014 Article IV consultation and first post-program monitoring discussions \u2013 Staff report; press release; and statement by the Executive Director for the Republic of Moldova |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] |issue=IMF Country Report No. 14/190 |date=July 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> However, the near-term economic outlook is weak. Main risks to the near-term outlook relate to serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the banking sector, policy slippages in the run up to the elections, intensification of geopolitical tensions in the region, and a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners.\n\nMoldova remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in remittances from workers abroad (24 percent of GDP), exports to the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and [[European Union]] (EU) (88 per cent of total exports), and donor support (about 10 per cent of government spending). The main transmission channels through which adverse exogenous shocks could impact the Moldovan economy are: remittances (also due to potentially returning migrants), external trade, and capital flows.\n\nMoldova largely achieved the main objectives of the combined ECF/EFF (IMF financial credit) supported program. The economy recovered from the drought-related contraction in 2012.\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n! Year\n! Economic<br />growth\n! Year\n! Economic<br />growth\n! Year\n!

In line with FSAP recommendations, significant weaknesses in the legal and regulatory frameworks must be urgently addressed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial sector. Moldova has achieved a substantial degree of fiscal consolidation in recent years, but this trend is now reversing. Resisting pre-election pressures for selective spending increases and returning to the path of fiscal consolidation would reduce reliance on exceptionally-high donor support. Structural fiscal reforms would help safeguard sustainability.<ref name=\"imf.org\"/> Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining inflation within the NBM's target range. The implementation of structural reforms outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) Moldova 2020\u2014especially in the business environment, physical infrastructure, and human resources development areas\u2014would help boost potential growth and reduce poverty.<ref name=\"imf.org\"/> Moldova's remarkable recovery from the severe recession of 2009 was largely the result of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and structural reforms. Despite a small contraction in 2012, Moldova's economic performance was among the strongest in the region during 2010\u201313. Economic activity grew cumulatively by about 24 percent; consumer price inflation was brought under control; and real wages increased cumulatively by about 13 percent. This expansion was made possible by adequate macroeconomic stabilization measures and ambitious structural reforms implemented in the wake of the crisis under a Fund-supported program. In November 2013, Moldova initialed an Association Agreement with the EU which includes provisions establishing a [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]] (DCFTA).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!The country\n!Average monthly salary (euro) 2018\n|-\n|Moldova<ref name=\"Monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html_2018-09-28\">{{Citation | url=https://monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html| title=Salariului mediu lunar pe economie in anul 2018 este de 6150 lei / Editorial / Monitorul fiscal FISC.md| newspaper=Monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html| date= | author=| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|298\n|-\n|Romania<ref name=\"Mediafax_2018-08-07\">{{Citation | url=https://www.mediafax.ro/social/ins-salariul-mediu-pe-economie-in-crestere-in-iunie-17388668| title=INS: Salariul mediu pe economie, \u00een cre\u015ftere \u00een iunie| newspaper=Mediafax| date= 7 August 2018| author=Dan Straut| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|966\n|-\n|Ukraine<ref name=\"Index.minfin.com_2018-09-28\">{{Citation | url=https://index.minfin.com.ua/ua/labour/salary/average/2018-01| title=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0456\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 (\u0441\u0456\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c 2018)| newspaper=Index.minfin.com| date= | author=| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|276\n|-\n|Russia<ref>[http://reconomica.ru/\u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0430/\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430/\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f-\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430-\u0432-\u0440\u0444-2018/ C\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f 2018]</ref>\n|534\n|}\n\nA political crisis in early 2013 led to policy slippages in the fiscal and financial areas. The political crisis that broke out in early 2013 was resolved with the appointment of a government supported by a pro-European center-right/center coalition in May 2013. However, delays in policy implementation prevented completion of the final reviews under the ECF/EFF arrangements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Moldova-chisineu-Mall-Dova.jpg|thumb|[[Malldova|MallDova]] shopping centre in Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]\nDespite a sharp decline in poverty in recent years, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe and structural reforms are needed to promote sustainable growth. Based on the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional poverty line of US$5/day (PPP), 55 percent of the population was poor in 2011. While this was significantly lower than 94 percent in 2002, Moldova's poverty rate is still more than double the ECA average of 25 percent. The NDS\u2014Moldova (National Development System) 2020, which was published in November 2012, focuses on several critical areas to boost economic development and reduce poverty. These include education, infrastructure, financial sector, business climate, energy consumption, pension system, and judicial framework. Following the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|regional financial crisis in 1998]], Moldova has made significant progress towards achieving and retaining macroeconomic and financial stabilization. It has, furthermore, implemented many structural and institutional reforms that are indispensable for the efficient functioning of a market economy. These efforts have helped maintain macroeconomic and financial stability under difficult external circumstances, enabled the resumption of economic growth and contributed to establishing an environment conducive to the economy's further growth and development in the medium term.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe government's goal of [[Moldova\u2013European Union relations|EU integration]] has resulted in some market-oriented progress.

In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]], but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the [[Russian Republic]], known as the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]]. In February 1918, the Moldavian Democratic Republic declared independence and then integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], which in 1924 established, within the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], a [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian autonomous republic]] (MASSR) on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of Bessarabia. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Romania was [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|compelled to cede Bessarabia]] to the [[Soviet Union]], leading to the creation of the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR (east of the [[Dniester River]]).\n\nOn 27 August 1991, as the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] was underway, the Moldavian SSR [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] and took the name Moldova.<ref>http://www.natura2000oltenita-chiciu.ro/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Moldova-Pitoreasca-Picturesque-Moldavia-pdf-Vladimir-Toncea.pdf</ref> The [[constitution of Moldova]] was adopted in 1994.

Drago\u0219 established a [[polity]] there as a vassal to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 1350s. The independence of the [[Principality]] of [[Moldavia]] was gained when [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]], another Vlach voivode from Maramure\u0219 who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. The Principality of [[Moldavia]] was bounded by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, the [[Dniester]] River in the east, and the Danube River and [[Black Sea]] to the south. Its territory comprised the present-day territory of the Republic of Moldova, the [[Western Moldavia|eastern eight counties]] of Romania, and parts of the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and [[Budjak]] region of Ukraine. Like the present-day republic and Romania's north-eastern region, it was known to the locals as ''Moldova''.\n\n===Between Poland and Hungary===\n[[File:Polska 1386 - 1434.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of the [[Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] between 1386 and 1434 showing the [[Principality of Moldavia]] as a Polish [[fief]].]]\n\nThe history of what is today Moldova has been intertwined with that of Poland for centuries. The Polish chronicler [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] mentioned Moldavians (under the name ''Wallachians'') as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|Ladislaus I]], against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].<ref>''The Annals of Jan D\u0142ugosz'', p. 273</ref> The Polish state was powerful enough to counter the [[Hungarian Kingdom]] which was consistently interested in bringing the area that would become Moldova into its political orbit.\n\nTies between Poland and Moldavia expanded after the founding of the Moldavian state by [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], a Vlach [[voivode]] from [[Maramure\u0219]] who had fallen out with the Hungarian king. Crossing the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359, the voivode took control of Moldavia and succeeded in creating Moldavia as an independent political entity. Despite being disfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[La\u021bcu of Moldavia|La\u021bcu]], the Moldavian ruler also likely allied himself with the [[Poles]]. La\u021bcu also accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences.\n\n[[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I]] profited from the end of the Polish-Hungarian union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of king [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|Jogaila of Poland]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Alb\u0103]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[Ghind\u0103oani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.\n\nAlthough [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), this ruler shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia.

Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[Alex\u0103ndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].\n\nDuring this time, Moldavia was invaded repeatedly by Crimean [[Tatars]] and, beginning in the 15th century, by the Turks. In 1538, the principality became a [[tribute|tributary]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]], but it retained internal and partial external autonomy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/moldova/3.htm|title=Moldova: Early History|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=June 1995|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref> In May 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] removed [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]] from Moldavia's throne by winning the battle of [[Bac\u0103u]], briefly reuniting under his rule [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], and [[Transylvania]]. A Polish army led by [[Jan Zamoyski]] drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and reinstalled Ieremia Movil\u0103 to the throne, who put the country under the vassalage of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Moldavia finally returned to Ottoman vassalage in 1621.\n\nWhile the region of [[Transnistria (geographical region)|Transnistria]] was never politically part of the Principality of Moldavia, there were sizable areas which were owned by Moldavian boyars and given by the Moldavian rulers.

The new Russian province was called [[Bessarabia Governorate|Oblast of Moldavia and Bessarabia]], and initially enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. After 1828 this autonomy was progressively restricted and in 1871 the Oblast was transformed into the Bessarabia Governorate, in a process of [[Forced assimilation|state-imposed assimilation]], [[Russification]].

Moldova received official recognition on 25 December. On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Declaring itself a [[neutral state]], Moldova did not join the military branch of the CIS. Three months later, on 2 March 1992, the country gained formal recognition as an independent state at the United Nations.

The government entered into agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to promote growth. \nThe economy reversed from decline in the late 1990s.

Main risks to the near-term outlook relate to serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the banking sector, policy slippages in the run up to the elections, intensification of geopolitical tensions in the region, and a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners.\n\nMoldova remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in remittances from workers abroad (24 percent of GDP), exports to the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and [[European Union]] (EU) (88 per cent of total exports), and donor support (about 10 per cent of government spending). The main transmission channels through which adverse exogenous shocks could impact the Moldovan economy are: remittances (also due to potentially returning migrants), external trade, and capital flows.\n\nMoldova largely achieved the main objectives of the combined ECF/EFF (IMF financial credit) supported program.

In line with FSAP recommendations, significant weaknesses in the legal and regulatory frameworks must be urgently addressed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial sector. Moldova has achieved a substantial degree of fiscal consolidation in recent years, but this trend is now reversing. Resisting pre-election pressures for selective spending increases and returning to the path of fiscal consolidation would reduce reliance on exceptionally-high donor support. Structural fiscal reforms would help safeguard sustainability.<ref name=\"imf.org\"/> Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining inflation within the NBM's target range. The implementation of structural reforms outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) Moldova 2020\u2014especially in the business environment, physical infrastructure, and human resources development areas\u2014would help boost potential growth and reduce poverty.<ref name=\"imf.org\"/> Moldova's remarkable recovery from the severe recession of 2009 was largely the result of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and structural reforms. Despite a small contraction in 2012, Moldova's economic performance was among the strongest in the region during 2010\u201313. Economic activity grew cumulatively by about 24 percent; consumer price inflation was brought under control; and real wages increased cumulatively by about 13 percent. This expansion was made possible by adequate macroeconomic stabilization measures and ambitious structural reforms implemented in the wake of the crisis under a Fund-supported program. In November 2013, Moldova initialed an Association Agreement with the EU which includes provisions establishing a [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]] (DCFTA).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!The country\n!Average monthly salary (euro) 2018\n|-\n|Moldova<ref name=\"Monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html_2018-09-28\">{{Citation | url=https://monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html| title=Salariului mediu lunar pe economie in anul 2018 este de 6150 lei / Editorial / Monitorul fiscal FISC.md| newspaper=Monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html| date= | author=| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|298\n|-\n|Romania<ref name=\"Mediafax_2018-08-07\">{{Citation | url=https://www.mediafax.ro/social/ins-salariul-mediu-pe-economie-in-crestere-in-iunie-17388668| title=INS: Salariul mediu pe economie, \u00een cre\u015ftere \u00een iunie| newspaper=Mediafax| date= 7 August 2018| author=Dan Straut| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|966\n|-\n|Ukraine<ref name=\"Index.minfin.com_2018-09-28\">{{Citation | url=https://index.minfin.com.ua/ua/labour/salary/average/2018-01| title=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0456\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 (\u0441\u0456\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c 2018)| newspaper=Index.minfin.com| date= | author=| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|276\n|-\n|Russia<ref>[http://reconomica.ru/\u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0430/\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430/\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f-\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430-\u0432-\u0440\u0444-2018/ C\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f 2018]</ref>\n|534\n|}\n\nA political crisis in early 2013 led to policy slippages in the fiscal and financial areas. The political crisis that broke out in early 2013 was resolved with the appointment of a government supported by a pro-European center-right/center coalition in May 2013. However, delays in policy implementation prevented completion of the final reviews under the ECF/EFF arrangements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Moldova-chisineu-Mall-Dova.jpg|thumb|[[Malldova|MallDova]] shopping centre in Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]\nDespite a sharp decline in poverty in recent years, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe and structural reforms are needed to promote sustainable growth. Based on the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional poverty line of US$5/day (PPP), 55 percent of the population was poor in 2011. While this was significantly lower than 94 percent in 2002, Moldova's poverty rate is still more than double the ECA average of 25 percent. The NDS\u2014Moldova (National Development System) 2020, which was published in November 2012, focuses on several critical areas to boost economic development and reduce poverty. These include education, infrastructure, financial sector, business climate, energy consumption, pension system, and judicial framework. Following the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|regional financial crisis in 1998]], Moldova has made significant progress towards achieving and retaining macroeconomic and financial stabilization. It has, furthermore, implemented many structural and institutional reforms that are indispensable for the efficient functioning of a market economy. These efforts have helped maintain macroeconomic and financial stability under difficult external circumstances, enabled the resumption of economic growth and contributed to establishing an environment conducive to the economy's further growth and development in the medium term.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe government's goal of [[Moldova\u2013European Union relations|EU integration]] has resulted in some market-oriented progress. Moldova experienced better than expected economic growth in 2013 due to increased agriculture production, to economic policies adopted by the Moldovan government since 2009, and to the receipt of EU trade preferences connecting Moldovan products to the world's largest market.

Groundbreaking for the project took place on September 14, 1985. It was completed a year later, on September 14, 1986. From this Center, which serves as the headquarters of the Metropolis, many programs emanate which serve and enlighten the faithful and share [[Orthodoxy]] with the public-at-large. These programs include the Marriage Preparation Seminars, instituted by Metropolitan Methodios in 1987, for all couples who are getting married in the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston.\n\nIn 1986 Metropolitan Methodios established the [[Philoxenia House]] which offers hospitality to patients and those who accompany them who come to Boston for medical reasons and cannot afford to stay in hotels. Guests to the Philoxenia House have come from [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]], [[Russia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]] and from throughout the [[United States]]. Metropolitan Methodios is assisted by the [[Philoptochos]] Women and the faithful throughout the Metropolis in this ministry. \n[[File:Methodios (Tournas).jpg|thumb|Metropolitan Methodios (2012)]]\nIn the summer of 1998, the Diocese of Boston acquired [[Camp Merrimac]] in [[Contoocook, New Hampshire]], a large former summer camp which became the [[St. Methodios Faith and Heritage Center]], offering programs for youth and families.\n\nThe Bishop, who walks at the annual [[Walk for Hunger]] sponsored by [[Project Bread]], is a frequent visitor to area soup kitchens where he serves food to those who are in need. For his \"unique contribution in the crusade against hunger and homelessness,\" Metropolitan Methodios has been honored by the Quincy Community Action Organization Inc, in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]. He has also been awarded the \"Good Neighbor\" Award by the [[Brotherhood Mishkan Tefila]] in Chestnut Hill.\n\nIn late July 2017, Methodios gained local media attention after firing longtime priest Father Nicholas Kastanas of the St Athanasius the Great Greek Orthodox Church in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]]. While no specific reasons were stated in his letter to the community, Methodios cited \"turmoil\" for which Kastanas \"bears the greatest responsibility\".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/07/30/arlington-church-protests-ouster-beloved-priest/58HucHFaguMGJe2oF0xA7M/story.html |title=Arlington Church Protests Ouster of Beloved Priest |author=Catie Edmondson |date=July 31, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref> Following the notice of firing, the community banded together, creating a petition in the hope of reversing Methodios's decision and packed the church for the priest's last service as a show of solidarity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/07/30/arlington-church-priest-leaving-turmoil |title=Arlington Church Petitions To Keep Priest After Accusations Of Causing 'Turmoil' |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 30, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[CBS]]/[[WBZ-TV|WBZ]] |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref> It was later reported that the cause of the dismissal was Kastanas's failure to \"preserve the orderly life and unity of the parish\" as he was reportedly unable to control growing disputes between the Parish Council and a group of parishioners.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://arlington.wickedlocal.com/news/20170731/failure-to-preserve-orderly-life-reason-for-arlington-priests-removal |title=Failure to 'preserve orderly life' reason for Arlington priest's removal |author=Abbi Matheson |date=July 31, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[GateHouse Media|Arlington Advocate]] |access-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> On November 17, 2017 the Metropolis published \"A Message from the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston Concerning St. Athanasius the Great of Arlington, MA\" that included \"Frequently Asked Questions\" and an accompanying \"Timeline of Events,\" documents which detailed the events leading up to Father Kastanas' removal from his pastoral duties in Arlington.<ref>http://boston.goarch.org/news/metropolis_news/2017/message-concerning-saint-athanasius-of-arlington-ma.html</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2019, he was appointed to serve as the Archiepiscopal Vicar (Epitropos) and served in this position until [[Archbishop Elpidophoros of America|Archbishop Elpidophoros]] was enthroned on June 22, 2019.<ref name=locumtenens /><ref name=locumtenens />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston]]\n* [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]\n* [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.boston.goarch.org/about_us/metropolitan_methodios.html Metropolitan Methodios of Boston] from the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston's website\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Methodios}}\n[[Category:1946 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Hellenic College and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops]]\n[[Category:21st-century Eastern Orthodox bishops]]\n[[Category:Greek Orthodox bishops of Boston]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Bishop \n| honorific-prefix = \n| name = Methodios\n| honorific-suffix = \n| bishop_of = [[Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston|Metropolitan of Boston]]\n| image = Methodios of boston crop.jpg\n| caption = Metropolitan Methodios at [[Boston]]'s 2009 Greek Independence Day Parade.\n| archdiocese = [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|America]]\n| metropolis = \n| see = [[Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston|Boston]]\n| enthroned = April 8, 1984\n| ended = [[Incumbent]]\n| predecessor = Bishop Anthimos\n| successor = \n| ordination = July 18, 1982\n| consecration = \n| other_post = \n| birth_name = George Tournas\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|1946|11|19}}\n| birth_place = [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| buried = \n| nationality = \n| religion = [[Greek Orthodox]]\n| residence = \n| parents = \n| spouse = \n| children = \n| occupation =\n| profession =\n| alma_mater = [[Hellenic College|Hellenic College/Holy Cross]]<br/>[[Boston University]]\n| signature = \n}}\n'''Metropolitan Methodios''' (born George Tournas on November 19, 1946) is a [[metropolitan bishop]] and spiritual leader of the [[Greek Orthodox]] [[Metropolis of Boston]].

Metropolitan Methodios is a member of the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in the United States, served on the Executive Board of the [[National Council of Churches]] and is a member of the [[Massachusetts Commission on Christian Unity]] and the [[New England Consultation of Church Leaders]]. He is listed in ''Who is Who in Religion'', is a member of the [[SCOBA|Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas]] and serves on various other religious boards and organizations.\n\nMethodios was enthroned as the Bishop of Boston on April 8, 1984, following his election to that post by the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in [[Phanar]], [[Constantinople]], [[Turkey]]. In July 1989, Bishop Methodios assumed the presidency of [[Hellenic College]] and [[Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology]] in Brookline, Massachusetts, a position he held until 1995. In November 1997, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate elevated Bishop Methodios to the office of Metropolitan along with the other bishops of the Archdiocese of America.<ref>{{Citation | last =Ribadeneira  | first =Diego | title = Venerable Heston Still Goes By The Book  | newspaper =[[The Boston Globe]] | date =November 29, 1997 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADDCE04ECCBA46&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |accessdate=May 1, 2009}}</ref> His [[episcopal see|see]], however, remained a diocese until December 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wfn.org/2003/01/msg00192.html|title=New Charter for the Archdiocese Granted by the Ecumenical|last=Morrow|first=Rev.

Groundbreaking for the project took place on September 14, 1985. It was completed a year later, on September 14, 1986. From this Center, which serves as the headquarters of the Metropolis, many programs emanate which serve and enlighten the faithful and share [[Orthodoxy]] with the public-at-large. These programs include the Marriage Preparation Seminars, instituted by Metropolitan Methodios in 1987, for all couples who are getting married in the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston.\n\nIn 1986 Metropolitan Methodios established the [[Philoxenia House]] which offers hospitality to patients and those who accompany them who come to Boston for medical reasons and cannot afford to stay in hotels. Guests to the Philoxenia House have come from [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[South America]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]], [[Russia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Bulgaria]] and from throughout the [[United States]]. Metropolitan Methodios is assisted by the [[Philoptochos]] Women and the faithful throughout the Metropolis in this ministry. \n[[File:Methodios (Tournas).jpg|thumb|Metropolitan Methodios (2012)]]\nIn the summer of 1998, the Diocese of Boston acquired [[Camp Merrimac]] in [[Contoocook, New Hampshire]], a large former summer camp which became the [[St. Methodios Faith and Heritage Center]], offering programs for youth and families.\n\nThe Bishop, who walks at the annual [[Walk for Hunger]] sponsored by [[Project Bread]], is a frequent visitor to area soup kitchens where he serves food to those who are in need. For his \"unique contribution in the crusade against hunger and homelessness,\" Metropolitan Methodios has been honored by the Quincy Community Action Organization Inc, in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]]. He has also been awarded the \"Good Neighbor\" Award by the [[Brotherhood Mishkan Tefila]] in Chestnut Hill.\n\nIn late July 2017, Methodios gained local media attention after firing longtime priest Father Nicholas Kastanas of the St Athanasius the Great Greek Orthodox Church in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]]. While no specific reasons were stated in his letter to the community, Methodios cited \"turmoil\" for which Kastanas \"bears the greatest responsibility\".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/07/30/arlington-church-protests-ouster-beloved-priest/58HucHFaguMGJe2oF0xA7M/story.html |title=Arlington Church Protests Ouster of Beloved Priest |author=Catie Edmondson |date=July 31, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref> Following the notice of firing, the community banded together, creating a petition in the hope of reversing Methodios's decision and packed the church for the priest's last service as a show of solidarity.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://boston.cbslocal.com/2017/07/30/arlington-church-priest-leaving-turmoil |title=Arlington Church Petitions To Keep Priest After Accusations Of Causing 'Turmoil' |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 30, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[CBS]]/[[WBZ-TV|WBZ]] |access-date=July 31, 2017}}</ref> It was later reported that the cause of the dismissal was Kastanas's failure to \"preserve the orderly life and unity of the parish\" as he was reportedly unable to control growing disputes between the Parish Council and a group of parishioners.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://arlington.wickedlocal.com/news/20170731/failure-to-preserve-orderly-life-reason-for-arlington-priests-removal |title=Failure to 'preserve orderly life' reason for Arlington priest's removal |author=Abbi Matheson |date=July 31, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[GateHouse Media|Arlington Advocate]] |access-date=August 8, 2017}}</ref> On November 17, 2017 the Metropolis published \"A Message from the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston Concerning St. Athanasius the Great of Arlington, MA\" that included \"Frequently Asked Questions\" and an accompanying \"Timeline of Events,\" documents which detailed the events leading up to Father Kastanas' removal from his pastoral duties in Arlington.<ref>http://boston.goarch.org/news/metropolis_news/2017/message-concerning-saint-athanasius-of-arlington-ma.html</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2019, he was appointed to serve as the Archiepiscopal Vicar (Epitropos) and served in this position until [[Archbishop Elpidophoros of America|Archbishop Elpidophoros]] was enthroned on June 22, 2019.<ref name=locumtenens /><ref name=locumtenens />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston]]\n* [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]\n* [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.boston.goarch.org/about_us/metropolitan_methodios.html Metropolitan Methodios of Boston] from the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston's website\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Methodios}}\n[[Category:1946 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Hellenic College and Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox bishops]]\n[[Category:21st-century Eastern Orthodox bishops]]\n[[Category:Greek Orthodox bishops of Boston]]\n", "name_user": "Freddiem", "label": "safe", "comment": "appropriate link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodios_Tournas"}

Terfenol-D has a large [[Magnetostriction|magnetostriction force]], high [[energy density]], low [[sound velocity]], and a low [[Young's modulus|Young\u2019s Modulus]]. At its most pure form, it also has low ductility and a low fracture resistance. Terfenol-D is a gray alloy that has different possible ratios of its elemental components that always follow a formula of [[Terbium|Tb]]<sub>x</sub>[[Dysprosium|Dy]]<sub>1\u2212x</sub>[[Iron|Fe]]<sub>2</sub>. The addition of Dysprosium made it easier to induce magnetostrictive responses by making the alloy require a lower level of magnetic fields. When the ratio of Tb and Dy is increased, the resulting alloy's magnetostrictive properties will operate at temperatures as low as -200 \u00b0C, and when decreased it may operate at a max of 200 \u00b0C. The composition of Terfenol-D allows for it to have a large [[magnetostriction]] and [[magnetic flux]] when a [[magnetic field]] is applied to it. This case exists for a large range of [[Compressive stress|compressive stresses]], with a trend of decreasing magnetostriction as the compressive stress increases. There is also a relationship between the magnetic flux and compression in which when the compressive stress increases, the magnetic flux changes less drastically<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://tdvib.com/terfenol-d/|title=Terfenol-D - ETREMA Products, Inc.|work=TdVib, LLC|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-US}}</ref>.

Terfenol-D has a large [[Magnetostriction|magnetostriction force]], high [[energy density]], low [[sound velocity]], and a low [[Young's modulus|Young\u2019s Modulus]]. At its most pure form, it also has low ductility and a low fracture resistance. Terfenol-D is a gray alloy that has different possible ratios of its elemental components that always follow a formula of [[Terbium|Tb]]<sub>x</sub>[[Dysprosium|Dy]]<sub>1\u2212x</sub>[[Iron|Fe]]<sub>2</sub>. The addition of Dysprosium made it easier to induce magnetostrictive responses by making the alloy require a lower level of magnetic fields. When the ratio of Tb and Dy is increased, the resulting alloy's magnetostrictive properties will operate at temperatures as low as -200 \u00b0C, and when decreased it may operate at a max of 200 \u00b0C. The composition of Terfenol-D allows for it to have a large [[magnetostriction]] and [[magnetic flux]] when a [[magnetic field]] is applied to it. This case exists for a large range of [[Compressive stress|compressive stresses]], with a trend of decreasing magnetostriction as the compressive stress increases. There is also a relationship between the magnetic flux and compression in which when the compressive stress increases, the magnetic flux changes less drastically<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://tdvib.com/terfenol-d/|title=Terfenol-D - ETREMA Products, Inc.|work=TdVib, LLC|access-date=2018-12-01|language=en-US}}</ref>.

From May 2011 to December 2013 he was [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]].\n\n== Early life ==\nBahr was born the son of a policeman in [[Lahnstein]], Rhineland-Palatinate. He is the FDP's expert on health politics and was chairman of the party's youth organization, the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]], from 1999 to 2004.\n\nBahr joined the Young Liberals (the German short form is \"JuLis\" from [[Junge Liberale]]) at the age of 14 in 1990. Two years later he became a member of their mother party FDP.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBahr graduated from Immanuel-Kant High School, M\u00fcnster, in 1996. He subsequently went on to an apprenticeship as a [[bank clerk]] at [[Dresdner Bank]] in [[Schwerin]] and [[Hamburg]]. In the winter of 1998 Bahr began studying economics at the [[University of M\u00fcnster]], graduating with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Economics. In 2008 he completed another course of study, focusing on international healthcare and hospital management, graduating with a [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA).\n\n== Political career ==\nAfter joining JuLis in 1990, Bahr became a member of the FDP in 1992. From 1994 to 1996 he was chairman of the JuLis in the district of [[M\u00fcnster (region)|M\u00fcnster]]. In 1999, he was elected national chairman of the JuLis, an office he held until 2004.\n\nBahr became a member of the FDP's federal executive board in 2001. In 2003, he became chairman of the party's \"Zukunftsforum\" (Future Forum) on \"Frauen, kinderfreundliches Deutschland, Generationengerechtigkeit\" (\"Women, Child-friendly Germany, a Generation Fairness\").\n\nHe was the chairman of the FDP in the M\u00fcnsterland district in 2006, and led the party's opposition against the [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]]'s health sector reform. On 27 November 2010 he was elected at the state convention of the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP to the state chairman.\n\nIn the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] of the FDP and the Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]) following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], Bahr was part of the FDP delegation in the working group on health policy, led by [[Ursula von der Leyen]] and [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]].\n\nOn 12 May 2011 Bahr was appointed by the [[President of Germany|Federal President]] to become the Federal Minister of Health in Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s second government. His predecessor, Philipp R\u00f6sler, moved on to become Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Vice-Chancellor. On the same day his swearing-in ceremony was held in the German Bundestag.

From May 2011 to December 2013 he was [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Minister of Health]].\n\n== Early life ==\nBahr was born the son of a policeman in [[Lahnstein]], Rhineland-Palatinate. He is the FDP's expert on health politics and was chairman of the party's youth organization, the [[Young Liberals (Germany)|Young Liberals]], from 1999 to 2004.\n\nBahr joined the Young Liberals (the German short form is \"JuLis\" from [[Junge Liberale]]) at the age of 14 in 1990. Two years later he became a member of their mother party FDP.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nBahr graduated from Immanuel-Kant High School, M\u00fcnster, in 1996. He subsequently went on to an apprenticeship as a [[bank clerk]] at [[Dresdner Bank]] in [[Schwerin]] and [[Hamburg]]. In the winter of 1998 Bahr began studying economics at the [[University of M\u00fcnster]], graduating with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Economics. In 2008 he completed another course of study, focussing on international healthcare and hospital management, graduating with a [[Masters of Business Administration|Master of Business Administration]] (MBA).\n\n== Political career ==\nAfter joining JuLis in 1990, Bahr became a member of the FDP in 1992. From 1994 to 1996 he was chairman of the JuLis in the district of [[M\u00fcnster (region)|M\u00fcnster]]. In 1999, he was elected national chairman of the JuLis, an office he held until 2004.\n\nBahr became a member of the FDP's federal executive board in 2001. In 2003, he became chairman of the party's \"Zukunftsforum\" (Future Forum) on \"Frauen, kinderfreundliches Deutschland, Generationengerechtigkeit\" (\"Women, Child-friendly Germany, a Generation Fairness\").\n\nHe was the chairman of the FDP in the M\u00fcnsterland district in 2006, and led the party's opposition against the [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]]'s health sector reform. On 27 November 2010 he was elected at the state convention of the North Rhine-Westphalian FDP to the state chairman.\n\nIn the negotiations to form a [[coalition government]] of the FDP and the Christian Democrats (CDU together with the Bavarian [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]]) following the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal elections]], Bahr was part of the FDP delegation in the working group on health policy, led by [[Ursula von der Leyen]] and [[Philipp R\u00f6sler]].\n\nOn 12 May 2011 Bahr was appointed by the [[President of Germany|Federal President]] to become the Federal Minister of Health in Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]'s second government. His predecessor, Philipp R\u00f6sler, moved on to become Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Vice-Chancellor. On the same day his swearing-in ceremony was held in the German Bundestag.

The lyrics are adapted from the texts of [[Psalms]] [[Psalm 19|19]] and [[Psalm 137|137]] in the Hebrew [[Tanakh|Bible]]. The Melodians' original version of the song appeared on the soundtrack album for the 1972 movie ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', which made it internationally known.\n\nThe song was popularized in Europe by the 1978 [[Boney M.]] cover version, which was awarded a [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] disc and is one of the top-ten all-time best-selling singles in the UK. The B-side of the single, \"[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]\", also became a hit.\n\n==Background==\n===Biblical psalms===\nThe song is based on the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Psalm 137]]:1-4, a hymn expressing the lamentations of the [[Babylonian captivity|Jewish people in exile]] following the Babylonian conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BC:<ref>{{cite web|title= Psalms 137. The Holy Bible: King James Version |url= http://www.bartleby.com/108/19/137.html |publisher= [[Bartleby.com]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013}}</ref> Previously the Kingdom of Judah, after being united under Kings [[David]] and [[Solomon]], had been split in two, with the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the north, conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] in 722 BC which caused the dispersion of 10 of the [[Israelites|12 tribes of Israel]]. The southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] (hence the name Jews), home of the tribe of Judah and part of the tribe of Levi, was free from foreign domination until the Babylonian conquest to which Rivers of Babylon refers.\n\n{{bquote|By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered [[Zion]] ... They carried us away in captivity requiring of us a song ... Now how shall we sing the {{LORD}}'s song in a strange land?}}\n\nThe namesake rivers of [[Babylon]] (in present-day [[Iraq]]) are the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers. The song also has words from {{bibleverse||Psalm|19:14|KJV}}:<ref>{{cite web|title= Psalms 19. The Holy Bible: King James Version |publisher= Bartleby.com |url= http://www.bartleby.com/108/19/137.html |accessdate= 14 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{bquote|Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight...}}\n\nIt is one of a few pop songs whose lyrics come directly from the Bible (See also \"[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]\" by [[Pete Seeger]], \"[[40 (song)|40]]\" by [[U2]], and \"[[The Lord's Prayer (Sister Janet Mead song)|The Lord's Prayer]]\" by [[Janet Mead|Sister Janet Mead]]). The melody bears a strong resemblance to \"[[The Near Future|How Dry I Am]]\".\n\n===Rastafari===\nIn the Rastafarian faith, the term \"Babylon\" is used for any governmental system which is either oppressive or unjust. In [[Jamaica]], Rastafarians also use \"Babylon\" to refer to the police, often seen as a source of oppression because they arrest members for the use of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] (which is sacramental for Rastafarians). Therefore, \"By the rivers of Babylon\" refers to living in a repressive society and the longing for freedom, just like the Israelites in captivity. Rastafarians also identify themselves as belonging to the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]]. The original version specifically refers to Rastafarian belief in [[Haile Selassie]], by changing references to \"the Lord\" in the Biblical text to \"Far-I\" and \"King Alpha\". Both terms refer to Selassie (Selassie's wife [[Menen Asfaw]] is known as ''Queen Omega'').<ref name=\"ras\">{{cite news|first= Nathaniel Samuel |last= Murrell |title= Tuning Hebrew Psalms to Reggae Rhythms: Rastas' Revolutionary Lamentations for Social Change |url= http://www.crosscurrents.org/murrell.htm |work= [[CrossCurrents]] |year= 2000}}</ref> In addition, the term \"the wicked\" replaces the neutral \"they\" of Psalm 137 in the line \"they that carried us away captive required of us a song...\".<ref name=\"wdse\"/> According to David Stowe,\n\n<blockquote>Brent Dowe, the lead singer of the Melodians, told Kenneth Bilby that he had adapted Psalm 137 to the new reggae style because he wanted to increase the public's consciousness of the growing Rastafarian movement and its calls for black liberation and social justice. Like the Afro-Protestant Revival services, traditional Rastafarian worship often included psalm singing and hymn singing, and Rastas typically modified the words to fit their own spiritual conceptions; Psalm 137 was among their sacred chants.<ref name=\"wdse\">{{cite journal|first= David W. |last= Stowe |title= Babylon Revisited: Psalm 137 as American Protest Song |journal= Black Music Research Journal |volume= 32 |issue= 1 |date= Spring 2012 |pages= 95 and 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Melodians version==\nAfter its release in 1970, the song quickly became well known in Jamaica. According to Brent Dowe, the song was initially banned by the Jamaican government because \"its overt Rastafarian references ('King Alpha' and 'O Far-I') were considered subversive and potentially inflammatory\".<ref name=\"wdse\"/> Leslie Kong, the group's producer, attacked the government for banning a song with words taken almost entirely from the Bible, stating that the Psalms had been \"sung by Jamaican Christians since time immemorial\".<ref name=\"wdse\"/> The government lifted the ban.

Boney M.'s version of the song remains one of the [[List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom|top ten all-time best-selling singles in the UK]], where it is one of only seven songs to have sold over 2 million copies.<ref name=\"UK sales\"/> In Canada, the song was a top 25 hit on the [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'']] magazine's Top 100 singles chart and reached no. 9 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary chart]]. The song also reached No. 1 on the South African Springbok chart, where it remained for a total of 11 weeks, making it the No. 1 song on that country's year end charts. The song was the first single from the band's equally successful 1978 album, ''[[Nightflight to Venus]]''. Some controversy arose when the first single pressings only credited Frank Farian and Reyam (aka Hans-J\u00f6rg Mayer) of Boney M.; after an agreement with Dowe and McNaughton, these two were also credited on later pressings.\n\nThe Rastafarian language was excised from the lyrics for the Boney M. version. Although the group performed an early mix of the song on a German TV show and sang \"How can we sing King Alpha's song\" as in the Melodians version, it was changed to \"the Lord's song\", restoring the original, biblical words, in the versions that were to be released.<ref name=\"ras\"/> To fit the meter, \"O Far-I\" became \"here tonight\" rather than the original, biblical \"O Lord\".\n\n===Different versions===\nAlong with \"[[Ma Baker]]\", \"Rivers of Babylon\" helped establish what was to become a habit of Boney M. singles \u2013 namely that the original pressings featured an early version that was soon replaced by a more widely available mix.\n\nThe initial single mix of \"Rivers of Babylon\" is most notable for lead singer [[Liz Mitchell]]'s ad-libs (\"Dark tears of Babylon, you got to sing a song, sing a song of love, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\") between the two verses. On subsequent single pressings, only the 'yeah's were retained. However, the full ad-libs re-emerged in the US-only 12\" version.\n\nThe single mix differs from the album version by having Liz Mitchell singing all of the verse \"''Let the words of our mouth ...''\" with [[Frank Farian]]; on the LP, Farian sings the first half of this as a solo part. Additionally, the single version edits out the instrumental passage before the last \"humming\" part and fades out a little later (\"''Oooooh, have the power... yeah yeah yeah yeah\"'' can only be heard in full in the single mix) despite being slightly shorter overall.\n\n===\"Brown Girl in the Ring\"===\nThe single's B-side, \"[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]\", was a traditional Caribbean nursery rhyme. When \"Rivers of Babylon\" had slipped to no. 20 in the UK charts, radio stations suddenly flipped the single, causing \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" to go all the way to no. 2 and become a hit in its own right. Early single pressings feature the full-length, 4:18 version, whose final chorus has a section that was later edited out. The single mix is also slightly different from the album version in that the latter features steel drums on the outro riff of the song, while the single mix doesn't.\n\n\"Brown Girl in the Ring\" was also issued separately in [[Canada]] as an A-side in the summer of 1979. It reached no. 8 on the Canadian AC chart in July 1979, becoming the third Boney M. song to reach the top 10 on that chart after \"Rivers of Babylon\" and \"[[Rasputin (song)|Rasputin]]\". On ''RPM'''s Top 100 singles chart, the song stalled at no. 79.\n\nLiz Mitchell had previously recorded \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" in 1975 with the group Malcolm's Locks, which had her ex-boyfriend Malcolm Magaron as the lead singer. Arranger Peter Herbolzheimer accused Frank Farian of stealing his arrangement for the song.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lizmitchellfanclub.com/malcolm.html |title= Malcolm's Locks |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030501110118/http://www.lizmitchellfanclub.com/malcolm.html |archivedate= 1 May 2003}}.

The lyrics are adapted from the texts of [[Psalms]] [[Psalm 19|19]] and [[Psalm 137|137]] in the Hebrew [[Tanakh|Bible]]. The Melodians' original version of the song appeared on the soundtrack album for the 1972 movie ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', which made it internationally known.\n\nThe song was popularized in Europe by the 1978 [[Boney M.]] cover version, which was awarded a [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] disc and is one of the top-ten all-time best-selling singles in the UK. The B-side of the single, \"[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]\", also became a hit.\n\n==Background==\n===Biblical psalms===\nThe song is based on the [[Bible|Biblical]] [[Psalm 137]]:1-4, a hymn expressing the lamentations of the [[Babylonian captivity|Jewish people in exile]] following the Babylonian conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in 586 BC:<ref>{{cite web|title= Psalms 137. The Holy Bible: King James Version |url= http://www.bartleby.com/108/19/137.html |publisher= [[Bartleby.com]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013}}</ref> Previously the Kingdom of Judah, after being united under Kings [[David]] and [[Solomon]], had been split in two, with the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] in the north, conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] in 722 BC which caused the dispersion of 10 of the [[Israelites|12 tribes of Israel]]. The southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] (hence the name Jews), home of the tribe of Judah and part of the tribe of Levi, was free from foreign domination until the Babylonian conquest to which Rivers of Babylon refers.\n\n{{bquote|By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered [[Zion]] ... They carried us away in captivity requiring of us a song ... Now how shall we sing the {{LORD}}'s song in a strange land?}}\n\nThe namesake rivers of [[Babylon]] (in present-day [[Iraq]]) are the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers. The song also has words from {{bibleverse||Psalm|19:14|KJV}}:<ref>{{cite web|title= Psalms 19. The Holy Bible: King James Version |publisher= Bartleby.com |url= http://www.bartleby.com/108/19/137.html |accessdate= 14 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{bquote|Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight...}}\n\nIt is one of a few pop songs whose lyrics come directly from the Bible (See also \"[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]\" by [[Pete Seeger]], \"[[40 (song)|40]]\" by [[U2]], and \"[[The Lord's Prayer (Sister Janet Mead song)|The Lord's Prayer]]\" by [[Janet Mead|Sister Janet Mead]]). The melody bears a strong resemblance to \"[[The Near Future|How Dry I Am]]\".\n\n===Rastafari===\nIn the Rastafarian faith, the term \"Babylon\" is used for any governmental system which is either oppressive or unjust. In [[Jamaica]], Rastafarians also use \"Babylon\" to refer to the police, often seen as a source of oppression because they arrest members for the use of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] (which is sacramental for Rastafarians). Therefore, \"By the rivers of Babylon\" refers to living in a repressive society and the longing for freedom, just like the Israelites in captivity. Rastafarians also identify themselves as belonging to the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]]. The original version specifically refers to Rastafarian belief in [[Haile Selassie]], by changing references to \"the Lord\" in the Biblical text to \"Far-I\" and \"King Alpha\". Both terms refer to Selassie (Selassie's wife [[Menen Asfaw]] is known as ''Queen Omega'').<ref name=\"ras\">{{cite news|first= Nathaniel Samuel |last= Murrell |title= Tuning Hebrew Psalms to Reggae Rhythms: Rastas' Revolutionary Lamentations for Social Change |url= http://www.crosscurrents.org/murrell.htm |work= [[CrossCurrents]] |year= 2000}}</ref> In addition, the term \"the wicked\" replaces the neutral \"they\" of Psalm 137 in the line \"they that carried us away captive required of us a song...\".<ref name=\"wdse\"/> According to David Stowe,\n\n<blockquote>Brent Dowe, the lead singer of the Melodians, told Kenneth Bilby that he had adapted Psalm 137 to the new reggae style because he wanted to increase the public's consciousness of the growing Rastafarian movement and its calls for black liberation and social justice. Like the Afro-Protestant Revival services, traditional Rastafarian worship often included psalm singing and hymn singing, and Rastas typically modified the words to fit their own spiritual conceptions; Psalm 137 was among their sacred chants.<ref name=\"wdse\">{{cite journal|first= David W. |last= Stowe |title= Babylon Revisited: Psalm 137 as American Protest Song |journal= Black Music Research Journal |volume= 32 |issue= 1 |date= Spring 2012 |pages= 95 and 2008}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Melodians version==\nAfter its release in 1970, the song quickly became well known in Jamaica. According to Brent Dowe, the song was initially banned by the Jamaican government because \"its overt Rastafarian references ('King Alpha' and 'O Far-I') were considered subversive and potentially inflammatory\".<ref name=\"wdse\"/> Leslie Kong, the group's producer, attacked the government for banning a song with words taken almost entirely from the Bible, stating that the Psalms had been \"sung by Jamaican Christians since time immemorial\".<ref name=\"wdse\"/> The government lifted the ban. After that, it took only three weeks to become a number-one hit in the Jamaican charts.<ref name=\"wdse\"/>\n\nIt reached an international audience thanks to [[The Harder They Come (soundtrack)|the soundtrack album]] of the 1972 film ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', which is credited with having \"brought reggae to the world\".<ref>{{cite news|first= Dennis |last= McLellan |title= Perry Henzell, 70; his movie `The Harder They Come' brought reggae to the world |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 12 January 2006 |accessdate= 13 April 2011 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2006/dec/02/local/me-henzell2}}</ref> The song was later used in the 1999 Nicolas Cage movie ''[[Bringing Out the Dead]]'' and the 2010 [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] film ''[[Jack Goes Boating (film)|Jack Goes Boating]]''.\n\nAn early reggae classic, \"Rivers of Babylon\" was remixed in 1970 in typical Jamaican dub fashion. One variation of the recording became \"Sound of Babylon\", another reggae classic featuring DJ/rapper Samuel The First, one of the Jamaican deejays who pioneered rap as early as the 1950s. \"Sound of Babylon\" includes several samples of the Melodians' original vocal as well as overdubbed mystical Rastafarian comments by Samuel The First. His version can be found on the 1988 CD ''Jamaican Deejay Music 1969-1973 \u2013 Keep On Coming Through the Door\u2026'' (Trojan CDTRL255).\n\n==Boney M. version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Rivers of Babylon\n| cover      = Boney_M._-_Rivers_of_Babylon_(1978_single).jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Boney M.]]\n| album      = [[Nightflight to Venus]]\n| B-side     = [[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]\n| released   = {{unbulleted list|3 April 1978|14 April 1978 <small>([[United Kingdom|UK]])</small>}}\n| format     = {{hlist|[[7\" single]]|[[12-inch single|12\" single]]}}\n| recorded   = 1978\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Disco]]|[[rocksteady]]|[[reggae]]}}\n| length     = 4:16\n| label      = {{unbulleted list|[[Hansa Records]] <small>([[West Germany|FRG]])</small>|[[Sire Records]] <small>([[United States|USA]])</small>|[[Atlantic Records]] <small>([[United Kingdom|UK]]/[[Australia|AUS]])</small>}}\n| writer     = {{hlist|Brent Dowe|Trevor McNaughton|Frank Farian|Reyam}}\n| producer   = [[Frank Farian]]\n| prev_title = [[Belfast (Boney M. song)|Belfast]]\n| prev_year  = 1977\n| title      =\n| title2     = [[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]\n| next_title = [[Rasputin (song)|Rasputin]]\n| next_year  = 1978\n| misc       = {{External music video|{{YouTube|Wt3-ASjBofE|\"Rivers of Babylon\" (''TopPop'', 1978)}}}}\n}}\n\n\"Rivers of Babylon\" was covered in 1978 by Germany-based disco band [[Boney M.]], with a version that was released as a single. Boney M.'s release stayed at the no. 1 position in the UK for five weeks and was also the group's only significant US chart entry, peaking at no. 30 in the Pop charts. Boney M.'s version of the song remains one of the [[List of best-selling singles in the United Kingdom|top ten all-time best-selling singles in the UK]], where it is one of only seven songs to have sold over 2 million copies.<ref name=\"UK sales\"/> In Canada, the song was a top 25 hit on the [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'']] magazine's Top 100 singles chart and reached no. 9 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary chart]]. The song also reached No. 1 on the South African Springbok chart, where it remained for a total of 11 weeks, making it the No. 1 song on that country's year end charts. The song was the first single from the band's equally successful 1978 album, ''[[Nightflight to Venus]]''. Some controversy arose when the first single pressings only credited Frank Farian and Reyam (aka Hans-J\u00f6rg Mayer) of Boney M.; after an agreement with Dowe and McNaughton, these two were also credited on later pressings.\n\nThe Rastafarian language was excised from the lyrics for the Boney M. version. Although the group performed an early mix of the song on a German TV show and sang \"How can we sing King Alpha's song\" as in the Melodians version, it was changed to \"the Lord's song\", restoring the original, biblical words, in the versions that were to be released.<ref name=\"ras\"/> To fit the meter, \"O Far-I\" became \"here tonight\" rather than the original, biblical \"O Lord\".\n\n===Different versions===\nAlong with \"[[Ma Baker]]\", \"Rivers of Babylon\" helped establish what was to become a habit of Boney M. singles \u2013 namely that the original pressings featured an early version that was soon replaced by a more widely available mix.\n\nThe initial single mix of \"Rivers of Babylon\" is most notable for lead singer [[Liz Mitchell]]'s ad-libs (\"Dark tears of Babylon, you got to sing a song, sing a song of love, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\") between the two verses. On subsequent single pressings, only the 'yeah's were retained. However, the full ad-libs re-emerged in the US-only 12\" version.\n\nThe single mix differs from the album version by having Liz Mitchell singing all of the verse \"''Let the words of our mouth ...''\" with [[Frank Farian]]; on the LP, Farian sings the first half of this as a solo part. Additionally, the single version edits out the instrumental passage before the last \"humming\" part and fades out a little later (\"''Oooooh, have the power... yeah yeah yeah yeah\"'' can only be heard in full in the single mix) despite being slightly shorter overall.\n\n===\"Brown Girl in the Ring\"===\nThe single's B-side, \"[[Brown Girl in the Ring (song)|Brown Girl in the Ring]]\", was a traditional Caribbean nursery rhyme. When \"Rivers of Babylon\" had slipped to no. 20 in the UK charts, radio stations suddenly flipped the single, causing \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" to go all the way to no. 2 and become a hit in its own right. Early single pressings feature the full-length, 4:18 version, whose final chorus has a section that was later edited out. The single mix is also slightly different from the album version in that the latter features steel drums on the outro riff of the song, while the single mix doesn't.\n\n\"Brown Girl in the Ring\" was also issued separately in [[Canada]] as an A-side in the summer of 1979. It reached no. 8 on the Canadian AC chart in July 1979, becoming the third Boney M. song to reach the top 10 on that chart after \"Rivers of Babylon\" and \"[[Rasputin (song)|Rasputin]]\". On ''RPM'''s Top 100 singles chart, the song stalled at no. 79.\n\nLiz Mitchell had previously recorded \"Brown Girl in the Ring\" in 1975 with the group Malcolm's Locks, which had her ex-boyfriend Malcolm Magaron as the lead singer. Arranger Peter Herbolzheimer accused Frank Farian of stealing his arrangement for the song.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lizmitchellfanclub.com/malcolm.html |title= Malcolm's Locks |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20030501110118/http://www.lizmitchellfanclub.com/malcolm.html |archivedate= 1 May 2003}}.
