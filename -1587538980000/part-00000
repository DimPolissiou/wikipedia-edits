This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, which continued into the 1980s when the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the Venezuelan economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in February 1983 to face its financial obligations, Venezuelans' real standards of living fell dramatically. A number of failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.<ref name=\"Schuyler_2001_10\">{{cite journal |last=Schuyler |first=George W. |journal=The Policy Studies Organization |title=Health and Neoliberalism: Venezuela and Cuba |year=2001 |page=10}}</ref>\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Luis Herrera Campins]] (1979\u20131984), important infrastructure works were completed, such as the Parque Central Complex (which became the largest housing complex and the tallest towers in Latin America), Teresa Carre\u00f1o Cultural Complex (the largest cultural center in South America at that time), the Br\u00edgido Iriarte Stadium and the United Nations Park. Most of these works had been previously planned.<ref name=\":152\"/> Until the mid-eighties, the Venezuelan economy showed a very positive behavior, characterized by the absence of internal or external imbalances, high economic growth, largely due to the sustained and very high gross fixed investment of those years, 10 under unemployment and great price stability.

It has a total area of {{convert|916445|km2|abbr=on}} and a land area of {{convert|882050|km2|abbr=on}}, making Venezuela the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|33rd largest country in the world]]. The territory it controls lies between latitudes [[equator|0\u00b0]] and [[13th parallel north|13\u00b0N]] and longitudes [[59th meridian west|59\u00b0]] and [[74th meridian west|74\u00b0W]].\n\nShaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a {{convert|2800|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well defined [[topography|topographical]] regions: the [[Maracaibo Basin|Maracaibo lowlands]] in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east\u2013west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the [[Guiana Highlands]] in the southeast.\n\nThe northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America's Andes mountain range. [[Pico Bol\u00edvar]], the nation's highest point at {{convert|4979|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, lies in this region. To the south, the dissected [[Guayana Region|Guiana Highlands]] contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and [[Angel Falls]], the world's highest waterfall, as well as ''[[tepui]]s'', large table-like mountains. The country's center is characterized by the ''llanos'', which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River [[river delta|delta]] in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich [[alluvium|alluvial soils]], binds the largest and most important [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|river system]] of the country; it originates in one of the largest [[drainage basin|watersheds]] in Latin America. The [[Caron\u00ed River (Venezuela)|Caron\u00ed]] and the [[Apure River|Apure]] are other major rivers.\n\nVenezuela borders [[Colombia]] to the west, [[Guyana]] to the east, and [[Brazil]] to the south. Caribbean islands such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Aruba]], and the [[Leeward Antilles]] lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly [[United Kingdom]], largely concerning the [[Guayana Esequiba|Essequibo area]] and with Colombia concerning the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]. In 1895, after years of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, the dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up. It was submitted to a \"neutral\" commission (composed of British, American, and Russian representatives and without a direct Venezuelan representative), which in 1899 decided mostly against Venezuela's claim.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/venezuela1895.htm|title=Venezuela Boundary Dispute, 1895\u20131899|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}</ref>\n\nVenezuela's most significant natural resources are [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], [[iron ore]], [[gold]], and other minerals.

The precipitation level is lower in the period from August through April. These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons. Another characteristic of the climate is this variation throughout the country by the existence of a mountain range called \"Cordillera de la Costa\" which crosses the country from east to west.

Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis which resulted in hundreds dead in the Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and impeachment of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez for corruption in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who had led the first of the 1992 coup attempts, and the launch of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\", beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela.\n\nThe opposition's attempts to unseat Ch\u00e1vez included the 2002 Venezuelan ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' attempt, the Venezuelan general strike of 2002\u20132003, and the Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004, all of which failed. Ch\u00e1vez was re-elected in December 2006 but suffered a significant defeat in 2007 with the narrow rejection of the [[2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum]], which had offered two packages of constitutional reforms aimed at deepening the Bolivarian Revolution.\n\nTwo major blocs of [[List of political parties in Venezuela|political parties]] are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies [[Fatherland for All]] (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition [[Mesa de la Unidad Democr\u00e1tica]]. This includes [[A New Era]] (UNT) together with allied parties [[Project Venezuela]], [[Justice First]], [[Movement for Socialism (Venezuela)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) and others. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political landscape since his election to the presidency in 1998 as a political outsider, died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (initially as interim president, before narrowly winning the [[2013 Venezuelan presidential election]]).\n\nThe Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and [[universal suffrage]], and is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections.\n\nThe president may ask the National Assembly to pass an [[Enabling act#In Venezuela|enabling act]] granting the ability to [[rule by decree]] in specified policy areas; this requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers.\n\nThe [[unicameral]] Venezuelan [[parliament]] is the ''Asamblea Nacional'' (\"National Assembly\").

The first two cultures were in turn differentiated according to their tribes. Acculturation and assimilation, typical of a cultural syncretism, led to the Venezuelan culture of the present day, which is similar in many ways to the culture of the rest of Latin America, but still has its own unique characteristics.\n\nThe indigenous and African influence is limited to a few words, food names, and place names. However, the Africans also brought in many musical influences, especially introduction of the drum. The Spanish influence predominantes due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created, and in particular came from the regions of [[Andalusia]] and [[Extremadura]] (the places of origin of most of the settlers in the Caribbean during the colonial era). Spanish influences can be seen in the country's architecture, music, religion, and language.\n\nSpanish influences can also be seen in the bullfights that take place in Venezuela, and in certain gastronomical features. Venezuela was also enriched by immigration streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. Most recently, immigration from the United States, Spain, Italy, and Portugal has further enriched the already complex cultural mosaic (especially in large oil-producing cities).\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align  =right\n | footer = \n | image1 = Catedral Metropolitana de Barquisimeto.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Barquisimeto Cathedral|Barquisimeto Metropolitan Cathedral]], [[Lara (state)|Lara]] state\n | image2 = Parque Cristal, Caracas.JPG\n | caption2 = Crystal Park, [[Caracas]]\n }}\n[[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a [[World Heritage Site]]) and its Aula Magna.

Following the rise of political literature during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan [[Romanticism]], notably expounded by Juan Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on [[narrative]] writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as [[Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco]] and [[Ferm\u00edn Toro]].\n\nMajor writers and novelists include [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]], [[Teresa de la Parra]], [[Arturo Uslar Pietri]], [[Adriano Gonz\u00e1lez Le\u00f3n]], [[Miguel Otero Silva]], and [[Mariano Pic\u00f3n Salas]].

The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt suffered an attack planned by the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an armed insurgency by organizing themselves in the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and Fidel Castro. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts in Car\u00fapano and Puerto Cabello. At the same time, Betancourt promoted an international doctrine in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.{{Request quotation|date=April 2018}}\n\nAs a result of the debt that Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez had left, an economic adjustment program was necessary in Venezuela. The Economic Recovery Plan of 1960 was formulated by Tom\u00e1s Enrique Carrillo Batalla. The construction industry was revitalized through the \"rediscount\" of the Central Bank of Venezuela. The Economic Recovery Plan fulfilled its objectives and in 1964, Venezuela was able to return to an anchored exchange rate, with free purchase and sale of foreign currency.

As the government started to devalue the currency in February 1983 to face its financial obligations, Venezuelans' real standards of living fell dramatically.

It has a total area of {{convert|916445|km2|abbr=on}} and a land area of {{convert|882050|km2|abbr=on}}, making Venezuela the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|33rd largest country in the world]]. The territory it controls lies between latitudes [[equator|0\u00b0]] and [[13th parallel north|13\u00b0N]] and longitudes [[59th meridian west|59\u00b0]] and [[74th meridian west|74\u00b0W]].\n\nShaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a {{convert|2800|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well defined [[topography|topographical]] regions: the [[Maracaibo Basin|Maracaibo lowlands]] in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east\u2013west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the [[Guiana Highlands]] in the southeast.\n\nThe northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America's Andes mountain range. [[Pico Bol\u00edvar]], the nation's highest point at {{convert|4979|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, lies in this region. To the south, the dissected [[Guayana Region|Guiana Highlands]] contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and [[Angel Falls]], the world's highest waterfall, as well as ''[[tepui]]s'', large table-like mountains. The country's center is characterized by the ''llanos'', which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River [[river delta|delta]] in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich [[alluvium|alluvial soils]], binds the largest and most important [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|river system]] of the country; it originates in one of the largest [[drainage basin|watersheds]] in Latin America. The [[Caron\u00ed River (Venezuela)|Caron\u00ed]] and the [[Apure River|Apure]] are other major rivers.\n\nVenezuela borders [[Colombia]] to the west, [[Guyana]] to the east, and [[Brazil]] to the south. Caribbean islands such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Grenada]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Aruba]], and the [[Leeward Antilles]] lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly [[United Kingdom]], largely concerning the [[Guayana Esequiba|Essequibo area]] and with Colombia concerning the [[Gulf of Venezuela]].

Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis which resulted in hundreds dead in the Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and impeachment of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez for corruption in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who had led the first of the 1992 coup attempts, and the launch of a \"Bolivarian Revolution\", beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela.\n\nThe opposition's attempts to unseat Ch\u00e1vez included the 2002 Venezuelan ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' attempt, the Venezuelan general strike of 2002\u20132003, and the Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004, all of which failed. Ch\u00e1vez was re-elected in December 2006 but suffered a significant defeat in 2007 with the narrow rejection of the [[2007 Venezuelan constitutional referendum]], which had offered two packages of constitutional reforms aimed at deepening the Bolivarian Revolution.\n\nTwo major blocs of [[List of political parties in Venezuela|political parties]] are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies [[Fatherland for All]] (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition [[Mesa de la Unidad Democr\u00e1tica]]. This includes [[A New Era]] (UNT) together with allied parties [[Project Venezuela]], [[Justice First]], [[Movement for Socialism (Venezuela)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) and others. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political landscape since his election to the presidency in 1998 as a political outsider, died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (initially as interim president, before narrowly winning the [[2013 Venezuelan presidential election]]).\n\nThe Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and [[universal suffrage]], and is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections.\n\nThe president may ask the National Assembly to pass an [[Enabling act#In Venezuela|enabling act]] granting the ability to [[rule by decree]] in specified policy areas; this requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers.\n\nThe [[unicameral]] Venezuelan [[parliament]] is the ''Asamblea Nacional'' (\"National Assembly\").

The first two cultures were in turn differentiated according to their tribes. Acculturation and assimilation, typical of a cultural syncretism, led to the Venezuelan culture of the present day, which is similar in many ways to the culture of the rest of Latin America, but still has its own unique characteristics.\n\nThe indigenous and African influence is limited to a few words, food names, and place names. However, the Africans also brought in many musical influences, especially introduction of the drum. The Spanish influence predominantes due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created, and in particular came from the regions of [[Andalusia]] and [[Extremadura]] (the places of origin of most of the settlers in the Caribbean during the colonial era). Spanish influences can be seen in the country's architecture, music, religion, and language.\n\nSpanish influences can also be seen in the bullfights that take place in Venezuela, and in certain gastronomical features. Venezuela was also enriched by immigration streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. Most recently, immigration from the United States, Spain, Italy, and Portugal has further enriched the already complex cultural mosaic (especially in large oil-producing cities).\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align  =right\n | footer = \n | image1 = Catedral Metropolitana de Barquisimeto.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Barquisimeto Cathedral|Barquisimeto Metropolitan Cathedral]], [[Lara (state)|Lara]] state\n | image2 = Parque Cristal, Caracas.JPG\n | caption2 = Crystal Park, [[Caracas]]\n }}\n[[Carlos Ra\u00fal Villanueva]] was the most important Venezuelan architect of the modern era; he designed the Central University of Venezuela, (a [[World Heritage Site]]) and its Aula Magna.

Following the rise of political literature during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan [[Romanticism]], notably expounded by Juan Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez, emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on [[narrative]] writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as [[Andr\u00e9s Eloy Blanco]] and [[Ferm\u00edn Toro]].\n\nMajor writers and novelists include [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]], [[Teresa de la Parra]], [[Arturo Uslar Pietri]], [[Adriano Gonz\u00e1lez Le\u00f3n]], [[Miguel Otero Silva]], and [[Mariano Pic\u00f3n Salas]].

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1972.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970 |first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi |url-access=registration |title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital |work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395 |oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19 |quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

A common feature of the Australian home is the use of [[fence|fencing]] in front gardens, also common in both the UK and the US.\n\n[[Climate of Australia|Climate]] has also influenced housing styles, with [[balconies]] and [[veranda]] spaces being more prevalent in subtropical [[Queensland]] due to the mild, generally warm winters experienced in the state. For many years, Australian homes were built with little understanding of the [[Climate of Australia|Australian climate]] and were widely dependent on European styles that were unsympathetic to Australian landscapes. In recent times, modern Australian residential architecture has reflected the climatic conditions of the country, with adaptations such as double and triple [[Insulated glazing|glazing]] on windows, coordination considerations, use of east and west shade, sufficient [[Building insulation|insulation]], strongly considered to provide comfort to the dweller.\n\nAnother aspect of Australian suburbia is that the suburbs tend to have a combination of both [[upper middle class]] and [[middle class]] housing in the same neighbourhood. In [[Melbourne]], for instance, one early observer noted that \"a poor house stands side by side with a good house.\"<ref name=dav>Davison, Graeme.  \"The Past & Future of the Australian Suburb.\"  Australian Planner (Dec. 1994): 63\u201369.</ref> This is somewhat less common today, with home renovations, [[gentrification]] and the [[teardown (real estate)|teardown]] (\"knock down, rebuild\") method becoming more and more common in affluent suburbs, giving a broader distinction between wealthy and lower class areas. However, the teardown technique has led to home buyers purchasing land or older homes in poorer metropolitan areas and building extravagant homes on the land, which look out of place and excessive, failing to match with the remaining houses in the street.<ref name=\"dav\" />\n\n==Variation of styles==\n\nBecause architectural styles have varied in Australia over the years (from villas to bungalows and brick renders), there is a slight inconsistency in the architectural flow of the suburban streets, with one writer noting that Australian housing styles tend to comingle and coexist awkwardly.<ref name=\"Troy 2000\">{{cite book|last=Troy|first=Patrick|title=A History of European Housing in Australia|isbn=9780521777339|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000}}</ref> This is less common in the United States of America and England, because most of the homes had been long established well into the 19th century and reflect a similar style in both regions.

Sydney was a tent settlement. Building anything more substantial was made unnecessarily difficult by the poor quality of spades and axes that had been provided and the shortage of nails.\n\nThe convicts adapted simple country techniques commonly used for animal shelters and the locally available materials to create huts with [[wattle-and-daub]] walls. So useful were the local [[acacia]] trees for weaving shelters that they were given the name ''Wattle''. Some pipe clay was obtained from the coves around [[Port Jackson]]. Bricks were fired in wood fires and were therefore soft. Lime for cement was obtained by burning oyster shells.\n\nThe first imported roofing material was [[corrugated iron]] sheeting. Roofs of this type were to become part of the Australian vernacular. For many years imported roofing was in very short supply. Two local roofing materials were available- there were extensive reed beds near the Cook's river for thatching. There was also bark which could be peeled off a number of the indigenous trees in large sheets. Methods of heating and flattening the bark were used by the Aboriginal people and these were quickly assimilated by the convict builders.\n\nThe two most significant trees, both of which grew in the Sydney area, were the Melaleuca and the Iron Bark. The Melaleuca bark, having the texture of paper, could be peeled off the tree in layers up to 2&nbsp;cm thick, a metre long and perhaps half a metre wide without serious damage to the tree. Although not particularly durable as exterior roofing, the material provided excellent insulation and was used for ceilings and lining the walls.\n\nThe resilient bark from the Iron-bark tree was adapted as a major building material everywhere that such trees grew. It was widely used as a roofing material, was weatherproof, insulating and could last for thirty years. [[Slab Hut|Houses of axe-hewn slabs]] with Iron-bark roofs continued to be built in rural Australia until WWII.\n\nAs better tools became available the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber of the native hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of split logs rather than sawn timber. The technique employed for the construction of a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the foundation. Split logs that had been adzed flat at the ends were then stood in the groove and another groove log was placed on top and slotted into place in a circular corner post. The gaps between the split logs were either packed with clay and animal hair or had narrow strips of metal cut from kerosene tins tacked over them. The interior could be plastered with clay, lined with paperbark or papered with newspaper, wrapping paper or calico. Cards, photographs, news clippings and commemorative items were often stuck directly onto the walls.\n\nThe technique of making durable hardwood roofing shingles was also developed. Where these shingles have been applied to brick houses, they have sometimes survived to the 21st century, covered by subsequent corrugated iron roofs.\n\nIn the earliest houses windows were usually small, and multi-paned with cylinder glass. When the cost of glass put it beyond reach of the home-owner, blinds of oiled calico were tacked across window openings in the winter months.\n\n'''Types of buildings'''\n\nThe simplest houses were of a single room, which, if the bread-winner prospered, became the kitchen to a more substantial residence, or conversely, became the living room with a lean-to kitchen added. Houses that grew piecemeal were generally asymmetrical, with the door leading into the original room.\n\nHouses that were planned were generally symmetrical, and very simple, usually containing 2 to 4 rooms around a central hallway. The kitchen was frequently detached and entered from a rear verandah or covered breezeway where pantry or [[scullery (room)|scullery]] might also be located. Fireplaces projected outwards from the walls of the house. Except in the case of some small inner-city Georgian row houses built of brick, houses generally had a verandah added to them, often on three sides.\n\nOne class of people who maintained the tradition of wattle and daub, with a bark roof was the [[Squatting#Squatting in Australia|squatters]] who did not have title to their land, and potentially had to move on every two years.\n\nVery few 19th-century houses of wattle and daub or split timber have survived. A small number of split-timber cottages which later became kitchens may be seen adjacent to more substantial homes, generally painted to match the house and barely recognizable.\n\nMost buildings erected in the first 50 years of Australian settlement were simple and plain. Convict huts, marine barracks, government stores and houses for officials were simple rectangular prisms covered with hipped or gabled roofs often with verandahs supported on wooden columns in the Classical manner. They were influenced in particular by the regulation British military buildings in India and other tropical locations.\n\nAt the time of the first settlement, [[Georgian architecture]] was the architectural vernacular in Britain. Craftsmen, including carpenters and plasterers were trained in the classic proportions associated with the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]] fashionable across Europe. Palladian ideals reveal themselves in some of the few larger homes of the Regency period such as \u201cElizabeth Bay House\u201d. [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassism]] incorporating not only [[Greeks|Greek]] but also sometimes [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Motif (art)|motifs]], beginning in Europe about 1760, also influenced Australian architectural style.  \u201cFernhill\u201d at Mulgoa with its wide colonnaded verandah shows the influence of Neoclassicism.\nAs the Australian economy developed and settlements became more established, more sophisticated buildings emerged.\n\n===Old Colonial Georgian Style===\n<gallery>\nFile:Elizabeth Farm-1.jpg|[[Elizabeth Farm|Elizabeth Farm cottage]], [[Parramatta|Parramatta, New South Wales.]] Built 1793.

Thus, while a local [[magnate]] may have built his home in a classical style, he would potentially fund a church in the Gothic style. Thus, during the 19th century, when Australia was expanding rapidly, two forms of architecture were very evident: Gothic and the Classical styles. Originally Gothic was for God, and the Classical for the man. Later a new \"self-made\" Australian began to emerge, unhindered by a classical British education dictating classical gentlemanly interests. This \"new\" [[self-made man]] (like his contemporaries in Britain) would often choose Gothic as the design for his home.\n\nThe great cathedrals of the [[Middle Ages]] during the Gothic period of [[ecclesiastical architecture]] formed the inspiration for this particular architectural style; not only in residential buildings, but in many commercial structures, churches and cathedrals built during this time. St. Paul's and St. Patrick's Cathedrals in [[Melbourne]] are excellent examples of the Gothic Revival period, often referred to as Victorian Gothic. Characteristics were: steeply pitched roofs often made of slate, narrow doors and windows resolving in a Gothic pointed arch at their height (known as [[lancet window]]s), diamond pane glazing to windows imitating a stained glass affect, and intricate parapets, often of a religious nature, with a cross. In non-terrace houses, the drawing room was often pulled forward, adding a bay window to the front of the dwelling.\n\n[[File:Singapore Cottage, Collingwood.jpg|thumb|right|Prefabricated Victorian workers cottages were among the simple residences to appear in the slums of major cities in the 1850s.  Rare examples like this one in [[Collingwood, Victoria]] still remain today.]]\nThe [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style in Australia can be divided into 3 periods: Early, Mid and Late. The period in its entirety stretches from 1837 to 1901 and was named after the then Queen, [[Queen Victoria]]. Early styles featured symmetrical layouts and fa\u00e7ades, a centrally located front door and a hipped roof of corrugated iron, leading to a veranda on the fa\u00e7ade. During the 1850s cast-iron lacework came to Australia, where it made its way on to Mid and Late Victorian Homes with much the same floor plan as the Colonial Style, a central hallway with a standard 4 rooms. [[Weatherboard]]s were often used, although larger homes used red brick and blue stone. In the Mid Victorian Style, decoration began to gain popularity. The bullnosed veranda roof was introduced, sidelights were added either side of the front door, and [[terrace house|terraced houses]] were springing up everywhere, containing parapets and detailed dividing walls between the property boundaries. Late Victorian Style homes had perhaps the most decorative features in all of the known architectural styles to date, which is often referred to as Boom Style. Towards the end of the Victorian era, timber fretwork was being used more and more, which led into the Edwardian/Federation Styles.\n\n=== Queenslander style ===\n{{main|Queenslander (architecture)}}\nThe Queenslander style house is characterized by an all timber painted exterior, a timber stud frame, and a floor raised on piles for air flow in hot climate. They have wide verandahs (often the length of the house and enclosed by shutters, and roofs are gabled and corrugated iron. The street facing view is often symmetrical. The NSW Queenslander is often smaller than the original classic Queenslander and is less decorative probably due to limited supply of delicate timber detail and trades-people to build them. It is sometimes combined with the Ranch style house.\n\nFrom the 1840s, a specific style of building emerged in [[Queensland]]. The [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] style of houses are identifiable by large verandahs and large double doors which open onto these verandahs, stilts rising the house above ground level (particularly in older houses), metal roofs typically of corrugated design and the houses are always constructed of mostly wood.\n<gallery>\nFile:Queenslander1.JPG|Federation-style Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander2.JPG|Inter-war Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander.jpg|Victorian era Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander House Brisbane1.jpg|A typical 'Queenslander' style house in [[Brisbane]]\nFile:Kilcoy Old Queenslander-01+ (374769341).jpg|An old Queenslander in [[Kilcoy]]\n</gallery>\n\n*'''Early, Mid and Late Victorian'''\n'''1845\u20131900'''\nThe styles during this period were: Georgian, Regency, Egyptian, Academic Classical, Free Classical, Filligree, Mannerist, Second Empire, Italianate, Romanesque, Academic Gothic, Free Gothic, Tudor, Rustic Gothic and Carpenter Gothic. Of these fifteen styles, the following seven were normally used for residential architecture:\n\n===Georgian Revival===\n{{main|Georgian architecture}}\nA typical Victorian Georgian house of the 19th century was simple, elegant and formal in style. The style is sometimes called Georgian Revival to avoid confusion with Old Colonial Georgian architecture.\n<gallery>\n197, 199, 201 Albion Street, Surry Hills, New South Wales.jpg|Terrace houses, [[197, 199, 201 Albion Street, Surry Hills|197-201 Albion Street]], Surry Hills, New South Wales, {{circa|1845-47}}\n1_Cleveland_House-D.JPG|Cleveland House, Bedford Street, Surry Hills, New South Wales, possibly designed by [[Francis Greenway]]\n1_Durham_Hall1.JPG|[[Durham Hall, Surry Hills|Durham Hall]], Albion Street, Surry Hills, New South Wales\n1 Juniper Hall-1.jpg|[[Juniper Hall, Paddington|Juniper Hall]], Oxford Street, Paddington, New South Wales; built 1824-25<ref name=nswshr-268>{{cite NSW SHR|5045231|Juniper Hall|hr=00268|fn=EF11/18062; S90/6057; HC 32229|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n(1)Waimea_in_Waimea_Avenue_Woollahra.jpg|[[Waimea House|Waimea]], {{circa|1856}}, Waimea Avenue, Woollahra, New South Wales\n(1)Grandview.jpg|Grandview, Pacific Highway, Pymble, New South Wales\n1_Sandgate2.jpg|[[Sandgate, Randwick|''Sandgate'']], {{circa|1879}}, Belmore Road, Randwick, New South Wales\n</gallery>\n\n===Regency===\n{{main|Regency architecture}}\nThe Regency style was a refinement of Georgian, with elaborations like a portico with columns at the front of the house.\n<gallery>\nFile:Clarendon house evandale tasmania.jpg|Clarendon House.

From the mid-19th century in particular, as people became more affluent, they built more elaborate homes, and one of the favoured elaborations was the filigree, or screen, of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]. This developed to the point where it has become one of the major features of Australian architecture. Many homes with this feature are also considered [[Italianate architecture]], the filigree element being the wrought iron balcony.\n<gallery>\nFile:Holcombe Terrace drummond street carlton.jpg|''Holcombe Terrace''.

Their influence was long-lasting and eventually led to the Italianate architectural style of the 19th century. The style featured asymmetry and, usually, a tower of varying size. In Australia, the addition of the verandah, sometimes arcaded but later in Filigree (wrought iron), gave a regional flavour to the style.\n<gallery>\nFile:Bishopscourt east melbourne.jpg|''Bishopscourt'', {{VICcity|East Melbourne}}, Victoria;  completed in 1853\nFile:Epworth repatriation mansion richmond victoria.jpg|''Epworth'', {{VICcity|Richmond}}, Victoria\nFile:Eynesbury House, Adelaide-1.jpg|[[Eynesbury Senior College|''Eynesbury House'']], [[Adelaide]]; completed in 1881<ref>{{cite web |author=Iwanicki, Iris; Register Historian |url=https://data.environment.sa.gov.au/Content/Publications/11526_Research.pdf |title=Eynesbury House |work=Register of State Heritage Items: Item Evaluation Sheet |publisher=Environment South Australia |date=8 June 1982 |access-date=22 April 2020 }}</ref>\nFile:GovernmentHouseMelbourne1 gobeirne.jpg|[[Government House, Melbourne]];  completed in 1876\nFile:Heritage Kamesburgh Gardens in Brighton.jpg|''Kamesburgh'', North Road, {{VICcity|Brighton}}, Victoria\nFile:Myrnong Hall Acland Street St Kilda.jpg|''Myrnong Hall'', Acland Street, {{VICcity|St Kilda}}, Victoria\nFile:Rippon Lea.jpg|''Rippon Lea'', {{VICcity|Elsternwick}}, Victoria\nFile:Werribeepark.jpg|''Werribee Park'', {{VICcity|Werribee}}, Victoria; completed in 1877\nFile:Winsbury Terrace 75-79 Kent Street Millers Point.jpg|Winsbury Terrace, [[Millers Point, Sydney]]\nFile:(1)Italianate home Dutruc Street Randwick-1.jpg|Earlswood; [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick, Sydney]]\nFile:Randwick hotel 1.JPG|Avonmore Terrace, [[Randwick, New South Wales]]\nFile:(1)Italianate house Avoca Street.jpg|Italianate Terraces, [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick, Sydney]]\nFile:Jesmond House.jpg|''Jesmond House'', {{NSWcity|The Hill}}, {{NSWcity|Newcastle}}, New South Wales\nFile:1 Toxteth Park.jpg|''[[Toxteth Park, Glebe|Toxteth Park]]'', Glebe, New South Wales, completed in 1829<ref>{{cite NSW HD|2427721|Toxteth Heritage Conservation Area|fn=C34|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref>\nFile:Croydon Shubra Hall PLC.JPG|Shruba Hall, [[Croydon, New South Wales]]\nFile:Kenilworth1.JPG|Kenilworth, [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale, Sydney]]\nFile:Italianate home, Lang Road, Centennial Park, Sydney - Wiki0123.jpg|Italianate home, [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park, Sydney]]\nFile:(1)Woollahra terrace-4.jpg|Terraces; [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra, Sydney]] \n</gallery>\n\n===Free Gothic===\n{{main|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nThe Gothic style gained favour from the early days of Queen Victoria's reign. Free Gothic became a popular choice for architects and their clients because it was not concerned with historical correctness and therefore gave them greater freedom in their designs. The style was much in vogue for religious buildings but was sometimes used in residential architecture as well.\n<gallery>\nFile:The Abbey j street.jpg|[[The Abbey, Annandale]], New South Wales.<ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/35</ref>\nFile:AshfieldNSWAmbleside.jpg|Ashfield Castle, {{NSWcity|Ashfield}}, New South Wales, is heritage-listed<ref>{{cite NSW SHR|1020628|Ashfield Castle}}</ref>\nFile:Cloncorrick.JPG|Cloncorrick, [[Darling Point, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tudor===\n{{main|Jacobethan}}\nThe Tudor style grew out of a nostalgia for older English concepts, particularly focused on the days of Queen Elizabeth I and Henry VIII. Its role in Australia began when the English architect Edward Blore designed Government House in Sydney in 1834. The style spread all over Australia and also influenced later styles like [[Federation Queen Anne]] and Inter-War Old English.\n<gallery>\nImage:Swifts.jpg|Swifts, Darling Point, New South Wales. Designed in 1882, this house later became the official residence of the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney.\n</gallery>\n\n===Rustic Gothic===\n{{see also|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nThe Rustic Gothic style developed out of a \"cult of the picturesque\" which largely focused on rural images and especially the picturesque \"rustic house\", which became known as the ''cottage orne''. In Australia, this style had a great appeal to British settlers who still carried with them a hankering for things English.\n<gallery>\nFile:13 James Street Richmond.jpg|13 & 15 James Street, [[Richmond, Victoria]].

For the rich, particularly in the wealthier parts of the larger metropolitan areas, the style evoked images of French aristocracy. Although rare, examples can be found in the bigger cities. Distinctive features include towers, quoining, mansard and slate roofs, square domes dormer windows, iron cresting and rich classical details. In the Australian setting, domestic interpretations of the style often combined filigree elements such as cast iron verandahs.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Labassa.jpg|Labassa.

The style draws on elements of the Victorian era and the earlier [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne style]] of the early 18th century. The Edwardian style coincided with the [[Federation of Australia]]. Thus, the Federation style was, broadly speaking, the Australian version of the Edwardian, but differed from the Edwardian in the use of Australian motifs, like [[kangaroo]]s, the rising sun (of Federation), and [[emu]]s, Australian flora and geometric designs. Some of the most recognisable Federation/Edwardian features include red brick exteriors with embellished wood detail known as [[fretwork]]. Cream painted decorative timber features, tall chimneys were all common. Stained glass windows towards the front of the home became increasingly popular during this period. Internally, Victorian-era features were still evident, including plaster ceiling roses and cornices and timber skirting and architraves. Federation style depicted a [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]] type look, especially on [[gable]]s, and Edwardian gave a simpler cottage look. Terracotta tiles or galvanised iron are generally used for roofing, which is designed with a steep pitch. The gable ends and roof eaves often feature ornate timber brackets, and timber detailing and fretwork are a common inclusion on verandahs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.domain.com.au/advice/edwardian-architecture-in-australia/ |title=Edwardian architecture in Australia |author=Thompson, Jacqui |work=domain.com.au |publisher= |date= |access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome{{who|date=September 2017}} consider that this style was the Federation version of the Queen Anne style. Other styles during this period were Federation Academic Classical, Federation Free Classical, Federation Filligree, Federation Anglo-Dutch, Federation Romanesque, Federation Gothic, Federation Carpenter Gothic, Federation Warehouse, Federation Free Style, [[Federation Arts and Crafts]] and [[Federation Bungalow]]. The names all indicated very similar styles with features so minute separating them. Out of the twelve Federation styles, however, only the following four were normally used{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} in residential architecture:\n\n===Federation Queen Anne===\n{{main|Queen Anne Style architecture}}\n<gallery>\nFile:(1)Caerleon.jpg|[[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill]], [[New South Wales]], the first Queen Anne home in Australia\nFile:Federation style mansion in domain street south yarra.jpg|Federation mansion in [[South Yarra, Victoria]]\nFile:Landmark edwardian home on canterbury road middle park.jpg|Landmark Edwardian home in [[Albert Park, Victoria]]\nFile:Queen Anne style house in Ivanhoe, Victoria.jpg|A Queen Anne residence in [[Ivanhoe, Victoria]]\nFile:Edwardian style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Edwardian house, [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nFile:Queens Bess.jpg|Queen Bess Row in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]] is Melbourne's largest Queen Anne styled terrace\nFile:Burwood Appian Way 3.JPG|House in [[Appian Way, Burwood|Appian Way]] in [[Burwood, New South Wales]]\nFile:Penshurst Church 2.JPG|West Maling, [[Penshurst, New South Wales]]\nFile:Edwardian terraces in park street south yarra.jpg|Federation terraces.

The architectural style was characterised by rough-cast walls, shingles, faceted bay windows, stone bases, tall chimneys, high-pitched roofs and overhanging eaves. It was widely used in Australia during the Federation period.\n<gallery>\nImage:15 Arnold Street, Killara, New South Wales (2010-12-04).jpg|Home, Arnold Street, {{NSWcity|Killara}}\nImage:17 Waimea Road, Lindfield, New South Wales (2011-04-28).jpg|Waimea Road, {{NSWcity|Lindfield}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0124.jpg|Home, Burwood Road, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0125.jpg|''St Ellero'', Appian Way, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0126.jpg|''Erica'', Appian Way, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:ArtsAndCraftsHome.JPG|''Devon'', Martin Road, {{NSWcity|Centennial Park}}\nFile:(1) Hastings1.jpg|[[Hastings (Neutral Bay)|''Hastings'']], {{NSWcity|Neutral Bay}}\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Bungalow===\n{{main|Bungalow}}\nThe bungalow style was usually a single-storey house with a prominent veranda, especially with the roof covering the veranda. It is seen as a transition phase between the Federation period and the California bungalow.\n<gallery>\nImage:SydneyBuilding0127.jpg|Casa Tasso, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0128.jpg|Ostia, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0129.jpg|Home, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0130.jpg|Home, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:Bungalow667.JPG|Bungalow, Shaftsbury Road, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0159.jpg|Arundel, Harrow Road, [[Bexley, New South Wales]]\nImage:RangersCottage.JPG|Ranger's cottage, [[Centennial Park, New South Wales]], designed by government architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Filigree===\nThe filigree style was characterised by the creation of a screen as a prominent style at the front of the house. In the Victorian period, the screen was made of wrought iron, but in the Federation period it was made of wooden fretwork, which could be quite elaborate. It was widely used in Queensland as a way of providing shade and circulation of air for a home.\n<gallery>\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0013.jpg|Home, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0015.jpg|Building, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0017.jpg|Home, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:High Street, Millers Point, Sydney, NSW Federation home 0007.jpg|Homes, [[Millers Point, New South Wales]]\nImage:Timber terraces in madden street albert park.jpg|Timber fretwork terraces.  Madden Street, [[Albert Park, Victoria]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Inter-War Period c. 1915 \u2013 c. 1940==\nStyles which existed during the 1915-40 period include Edwardian, Georgian Revival, Academic Classical, Free Classical, Bungalow, Mediterranean, Spanish Mission, Art-Deco, Skyscraper Gothic, Romanesque, Gothic and Old English.\n\n===Californian Bungalow===\n{{main|Californian Bungalow}}\n'''1915\u20131940'''\nThis style can almost instantly be recognised by the columns holding up a front veranda area. The name is almost self-explanatory: bungalow, a rugged type of home. This led to the belief that picket fences looked appropriate at the front fence, although originally they were not used. Darker colours were originally used but, as the years went by, new brighter paint served as a welcoming change to open up the spaces and brighten up the homes. Stone, brick and timber, earthy materials were used. A gable roof faced either the front or side always.\n<gallery>\nImage:Californian Bungalow style house in Preston, Victoria.jpg|Californian Bungalow, [[Preston, Victoria]]\nImage:Belmont flats st kilda.jpg|Belmont Flats.

A staircase almost always dominated the front yard leading to the verandah.\n\n===Spanish Mission===\n{{main|Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture}}\n'''1925\u20131939'''\n\nDistinctly recognised by twisted pylons to a porch area covering the front door, usually windows grouped in threes to the side of the front door area on simpler homes. The style was influenced by the American Spanish inhabitant influenced American Architectural styles. Walls were brick in accordance with council regulations at the time, with white or cream yellowish cream [[stucco]] finish and Spanish terra cotta tiles.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Spanish Mission style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Spanish Mission home in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nImage:Belvedere flats St Kilda.jpg|Belvedere Flats.

It had a certain appeal for what was still a predominantly Anglo-Saxon population at the time.\n<gallery>\nImage:SydneyBuilding0150.jpg|Home, Bexley Road, Bexley, New South Wales\nImage:OldEnglish.JPG|Home, Robertson Road, Centennial Park, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0180.jpg|Deanbury, Billyard Avenue, Wahroonga, New South Wales\nImage:Bonnington.JPG|Bonnington, Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill, New South Wales\nFile:Tudor Revival house, Adelaide (03).jpg|Unley Park, South Australia\n</gallery>\n\n===Early Moderne===\n{{see also|Streamline Moderne}}\n'''1930\u20131940'''\nA very modern looking style at the time, inspired by a German movement known as [[Bauhaus]], representing functional and clinical architecture. Red or cream brick walls and concrete was also first seen. Steel-framed casement sashes, with larger panes of glass and [[terra cotta]] tiled roofs with a moderate pitch. The only featured part of the house included matching decorative front fences, and a featured roof affect.\n\nThe Streamline Moderne style was a late branch of the [[Art Deco]] style. The style emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements, such as railings and porthole windows. This style was adopted into suburban architecture, most notably in the Waterfall style.\n<gallery>\nImage:BurnhamBeeches1947.jpg|[[Burnham Beeches (Australia)|Burnham Beeches]] mansion in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne, completed 1933 in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style.

By the 1940s these details were entrenched into suburban designs. The 'Waterfall' or 'Waterfall Front' style came to be known as such from the use of descending curves in chimneys, fence pillars and other vertical elements. [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]], the Australian architect and writer, noted that three was 'the key to decorative smartness'; three steps usually being used for the waterfall effect and featured parallel lines were often in threes.\n\nDefining features of houses from this period are curved corner windows, including Venetian blinds, some rare examples of which are curved. With a slightly steeper pitched roof than the Early Modern Style, this style was generally of brick veneer cream brick but also could have dark brown glazed feature brickwork incorporated into the external walls, and under windowsills. Chimneys were either stepped or plain, and together with the round windows perhaps gave meaning to the \"Waterfall\" name.\n\nEcclesiastical, International, Melbourne Regional, Brisbane Regional and American Colonial were also styles which existed in the period 1940\u20131960.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Waterfall (Art Deco) style house in Eaglemont, Victoria.jpg|The Waterfall style and Art Deco combined, [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nFile:204 Monaro Crescent Red Hill ACT.jpg|House in [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory]], designed by [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]]. Typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style: long unbroken roof line, wide eaves, extensive windows.\n</gallery>\n\n===International style===\n{{main|International style (architecture)}}\nThe [[Rose Seidler House]] built by [[Harry Seidler]] for his parents between 1948 and 1950 in Sydney incorporated Modernist features of open planning, a minimal colour scheme, and labour saving devices that were new to Australia at the time. The house won the [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] in 1951 and is today preserved as a museum as a very influential house.<ref name=nswshr-261>{{cite NSW SHR|5045033|Rose Seidler House|hr=00261|fn=S90/05313; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[World War II|second World War]], architects in Australia were influenced by the development of the International style of architecture. Some regional variations developed. In Melbourne, [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] and [[Roy Grounds]] articulated a Melbourne interpretation of the modern style. Boyd's book ''Victorian Modern'' (1947) traced the history of architecture in the state of Victoria and described a style of architecture that he hoped would be a response to local surroundings as well as the popular international style. In particular he nominated the work of Roy Grounds and in some outer suburban bush houses of the 1930s as being the early stages of such a style. Grounds and Boyd later worked in partnership.\n\nThe houses were typically narrow, linear, and single storey with a low pitched gable roof. They had exposed rafters and wide eaves. Walls were generally bagged or painted brick and windows were large areas of glass with regularly spaced timber mullions.<ref>{{cite web | author=Martin Miles | year=2006 | url=http://www.canberrahouse.com.au/pwmelbourne.html | title=The post-war Melbourne regional style | work=Modernist residential architecture in Canberra | publisher=canberrahouse.com | accessdate=2006-02-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060225055330/http://canberrahouse.com.au/pwmelbourne.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-02-25}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RoseSeidlerHouseSulmanPrize.jpg|[[Rose Seidler House]] in the northern Sydney suburb of [[Wahroonga, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===L-Shape 1945 \u2013 1955===\nThis style represented a change in the overall floor plan, the plan resembling a large \"L\" Shape. Usually with gabled ends to the L, with [[terra cotta]] tiles still being used, as [[concrete]] tiles didn't appear until the late 1960s. Timber or steel framed windows were used, and front-facing fences resembled the house, much the same as had been seen since the Early Modern Period.\n\n=== Dutch Colonial ===\n<gallery>\nFile:1967 Adelaide Dutch Colonial House.jpg|[[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial]] home in [[Adelaide]] (1950s).\nFile:Dutch_Colonial_Revival_house_in_Adelaide.jpg|Dutch Colonial house in [[Mitcham, South Australia]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Timber and fibro fisherman's cottage===\n\nThe original fisherman's cottage was built in many coastal towns between the 1930s and 1950s. It was originally a simple timber framed structure of one or two rooms and a verandah which was clad with asbestos sheeting. The floors were generally raised on piles. The verandah sometimes had handsome wooden balustrade that was sometimes enclosed to make an additional room or sleep-out. Timber detail around windows and gables were often painted- cheery red being one of the most popular traditional colours.\n\nThe original cottages, being relatively cheap to purchase, are now popular for renovation. Construction is easy and owner-building is common. The older buildings require insulation in the ceiling and walls. Timber and fiber cement sheeting now replaces the original asbestos and often the interior is completed gutted to create a modern open plan style of living. Timber strap-work can be used and windows frames painted for effect.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RenovatedFishermansCottage.jpg|Renovated fisherman's cottage.\n</gallery>\n\n===Triple front (cream brick) 1950 \u2013 1960s===\nDistinctly recognisable by their front-facing walls have 3 and sometimes even 4 front-facing walls. This led to the front entrance sometimes brought round to the side within one of the alcoves created by the multiple fronts. Roofs were medium pitched and hipped with [[concrete]] tiles being used towards the end of the style in the late 60s. Front fences had a [[castellated]] top and feature piers raised above the top of the rest of the brick fence. Decorative [[iron]] was used very minimally, in gates to driveways, and balustrades to entrances.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Triple Front (With 4 Fronts) style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Triple Front (With 4 Fronts), [[Heidelberg, Victoria]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Late twentieth century 1960 \u2013 2000==\nStyles of the late 20th century have largely been derived from the current world architectural trends, or have been imitative of previous Australian styles. These styles include Stripped Classical, Ecclesiastical, International, Organic, Sydney Regional, Perth Regional, Adelaide Regional, Tropical, Brutalist, Structural, Late Modern, Post Modern, Australian Nostalgic and Immigrants' Nostalgic. In the 1980s and 1990s most parts of Australia had a building boom which strained building supplies, so many buildings from this era are characterised by cheap and low quality materials.\n\nA good cross section of Australian residential architectural styles from this period, although not necessarily falling into one of the categories above, follows. Almost all of the houses shown in this section were built after 1960 and photographed just North of Sydney on the Central Coast of NSW.\n\nEach of these styles has a different emphasis to practicality (physical needs, layout, and views), land and environmental considerations (structural requirements for foundations, design for weather protection) and aesthetic considerations (planar, volumetric, and sculptural form, emotional and spiritual qualities.) All of these requirements and qualities should be considered when designing a house.\n\n=== Painted and rendered triple fronted brick veneer ===\n\nThis style of house has a brick facade (exterior) with timber frames supporting interior walls, usually of gyprock. Roofs are always hipped or gabled and tiled. As mentioned previously in this article, this style, without the painted and rendered brick facade, dominated suburban architecture in the 1950s \u2013 1960s. In its basic form it is a bland and unimaginative style which has been propagated by developers.\n\nDue to its familiar and cheap construction, it still is the dominant style in housing estates and many consider the style the scourge of Australian domestic architecture. The basic style has been made more interesting by rendering and painting, adding more angles, variations in roofing, porticos, verandahs, and [[bay window]]s. Large homes, two-story homes of this style have often been described as \"[[McMansion]]s\".\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PaintedMacMansion.jpg|Painted McMansion style\n</gallery>\n\n===Regional gabled cottage===\n\nThis popular style has emerged from the triple fronted brick veneer. While the house footprint and floor plan may be quite similar, the gabled cottage has a very different feel. In this style the distinctive gabled roof is a dominant design element, and a practical means of providing shade and entertaining space. Constructions can be entirely of brick (often painted), entirely timber, or a combination of brick on the lower part of the house and timber on the upper. Some houses of brick construction have featured verandahs and porticos. Roofs are usually galvanized iron and windows metal framed.\n\nWhile it is well suited to sloping blocks, this style can also be built on a slab. The use of timber cladding greatly reduces weight and construction costs\n\n<gallery>\nFile:TimberGabledRegional.jpg|Timber regional gabled style architecture\n</gallery>\n\n===Ranch\u2013style===\nThe [[ranch-style house|ranch-style]] became popular in the nineties. With conception in the [[United States]], it originated in suburban Adelaide and subsequently became popular in regional and coastal New South Wales. The floor plan is simple and footprint (of at least the street facing section) is often rectangular. Walls are usually brick, or brick and timber, and windows are often colonial style floor-to-ceiling. Roofs usually tiled with extended eaves. The garage was often integrated into the house. Some ranch style houses were boomerang shaped, others were L shaped for corner allotments.\n\nRanch style houses can be readily combined with the Murcutt/Drew style (timber and galvanized iron). These smaller ranch style houses often have balconies the width of the house.\n\n===Murcutt/Drew steel and corrugated iron house===\n\nA number of styles have emerged from the influence of architects Phillip Drew and [[Glenn Murcutt]]. The geometric play of angles is often a signature, likewise the (sometimes exposed) steel framing and corrugated iron cladding which is available in a variety of colours. Fiber cement and timber cladding is often used with the iron to create a sympathetic blend of textures.\n\nBeing of light weight construction, the steel and corrugated iron approach is relatively cheap and suitable for both flat and steeply inclined land. Interior cladding is most often gyprock but can be timber or even plywood. Butterfly roofs can also be employed quite successfully in this design. This style of house is suited for steel framed pole houses on steep slopes.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:MurcuttDrewStyle.jpg|Murcutt Drew style architecture.\n</gallery>\n\n===Pavilion style===\n\nThe Pavilion style house is characterized by a simple rectangular, box shaped volumetric style, open plan interior with glass replacing much of the wall space. Windows are often also steel framed. The transparency of the walls makes it well suited for blocks with privacy and/or views. Open patios are an integral part of living area, and like the rooms, they are orientated according to the aspect. Roofs are often low pitched roof and skillion.\n\nThe style was a favorite of architect Harry Seidler who favoured walls of rendered brick however it is also well suited to a steel, fiber cement, and corrugated iron treatment. This approach often requires the thinness of steel framing to create the desired look.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:11-13 Elvina Street, Dover Heights, New South Wales (2011-01-12).jpg|Cement rendered pavilion style architecture\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation revival===\nDuring the early-1990s, many of the design elements that characterised the Federation architecture of old were popularised in mainstream architecture. This Federation revival form is also known as \"mock Federation\" or \"faux Federation\". The style was widespread within the realm of residential housing (especially in new development suburbs) and for apartment buildings; however, smaller shopping centres and other public buildings also made use of the revival style that retained widespread popularity until the early 2000s. Suburbs of Sydney that developed in the 1990s\u2014such as [[Cherrybrook, New South Wales|Cherrybrook]], [[Wetherill Park]], [[Green Valley, New South Wales|Green Valley]], [[Cecil Hills]], [[Edensor Park]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], and [[Menai, New South Wales|Menai]]\u2014are notable in the sense that large tracts of these developments contain almost exclusively Federation revival homes.\n\nThe construction of Federation revival architecture varied little from that of other basic styles, with the Federation elements merely forming the facade and decorating elements of the building. For example, the typical brick and roof tile construction, hexagonal [[turret]]s, ornate [[gable]] work, [[finial]]s, prominent [[verandah]], steep pitched roofs, and faceted [[bay window]]s served to parallel the traditional Federation architecture.\n<gallery>\nFile:(1)Field Place house.jpg|Federation revival home in [[Wahroonga, New South Wales|Wahroonga, Sydney]]\nFile:34 Dudley Avenue, Roseville, New South Wales (2011-07-17).jpg|Federation revival home in [[Roseville, New South Wales|Roseville, Sydney]]\nFile:Apartments, 8-10 Russell Avenue, Lindfield, New South Wales (2011-07-17).jpg|Federation revival apartments in [[Lindfield, New South Wales|Lindfield, Sydney]]\nFile:Apartments, Kingsway, Miranda, New South Wales (2010-07-25) 02.jpg|Federation revival apartments in [[Miranda, New South Wales|Miranda, Sydney]] (c. 1995)\nFile:(1)house_Kingsford_Sydney-3.jpg|Federation revival house in [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford, Sydney]]\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Kensington.jpg|Federation revival house in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], Sydney\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Gordon Street Blacktown.jpg|A house in [[Blacktown]], [[Greater Western Sydney]]\nFile:(1)house High Street Glenbrook.jpg|[[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]], Blue Mountains\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Frederick Street.jpg|[[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], Sydney\n</gallery>\n\n==Contemporary styles==\nContemporary styles from 2000 onwards include post modernism, modernism and pop architecture.\n<gallery>\nFile:Pamela anderson house st kilda.jpg|\"Newman House\" in [[St Kilda, Victoria]]; completed 2000.

A common feature of the Australian home is the use of [[fence|fencing]] in front gardens, also common in both the UK and the US.\n\n[[Climate of Australia|Climate]] has also influenced housing styles, with [[balconies]] and [[veranda]] spaces being more prevalent in subtropical [[Queensland]] due to the mild, generally warm winters experienced in the state. For many years, Australian homes were built with little understanding of the [[Climate of Australia|Australian climate]] and were widely dependent on European styles that were unsympathetic to Australian landscapes. In recent times, modern Australian residential architecture has reflected the climatic conditions of the country, with adaptations such as double and triple [[Insulated glazing|glazing]] on windows, coordination considerations, use of east and west shade, sufficient [[Building insulation|insulation]], strongly considered to provide comfort to the dweller.\n\nAnother aspect of Australian suburbia is that the suburbs tend to have a combination of both [[upper middle class]] and [[middle class]] housing in the same neighbourhood. In [[Melbourne]], for instance, one early observer noted that \"a poor house stands side by side with a good house.\"<ref name=dav>Davison, Graeme.  \"The Past & Future of the Australian Suburb.\"  Australian Planner (Dec. 1994): 63\u201369.</ref> This is somewhat less common today, with home renovations, [[gentrification]] and the [[teardown (real estate)|teardown]] (\"knock down, rebuild\") method becoming more and more common in affluent suburbs, giving a broader distinction between wealthy and lower class areas. However, the teardown technique has led to home buyers purchasing land or older homes in poorer metropolitan areas and building extravagant homes on the land, which look out of place and excessive, failing to match with the remaining houses in the street.<ref name=\"dav\" />\n\n==Variation of styles==\n\nBecause architectural styles have varied in Australia over the years (from villas to bungalows and brick renders), there is a slight inconsistency in the architectural flow of the suburban streets, with one writer noting that Australian housing styles tend to comingle and coexist awkwardly.<ref name=\"Troy 2000\">{{cite book|last=Troy|first=Patrick|title=A History of European Housing in Australia|isbn=9780521777339|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2000}}</ref> This is less common in the United States of America and England, because most of the homes had been long established well into the 19th century and reflect a similar style in both regions. Home planners and architects in Australia have suggested adapting similar styles of new homes with the surrounding established homes to create a sense of uniformity.\n\n{{Quote|text=\"In Australia, the artificial background of life is all highs and lows.

Sydney was a tent settlement. Building anything more substantial was made unnecessarily difficult by the poor quality of spades and axes that had been provided and the shortage of nails.\n\nThe convicts adapted simple country techniques commonly used for animal shelters and the locally available materials to create huts with [[wattle-and-daub]] walls. So useful were the local [[acacia]] trees for weaving shelters that they were given the name ''Wattle''. Some pipe clay was obtained from the coves around [[Port Jackson]]. Bricks were fired in wood fires and were therefore soft. Lime for cement was obtained by burning oyster shells.\n\nThe first imported roofing material was [[corrugated iron]] sheeting. Roofs of this type were to become part of the Australian vernacular. For many years imported roofing was in very short supply. Two local roofing materials were available- there were extensive reed beds near the Cook's river for thatching. There was also bark which could be peeled off a number of the indigenous trees in large sheets. Methods of heating and flattening the bark were used by the Aboriginal people and these were quickly assimilated by the convict builders.\n\nThe two most significant trees, both of which grew in the Sydney area, were the Melaleuca and the Iron Bark. The Melaleuca bark, having the texture of paper, could be peeled off the tree in layers up to 2&nbsp;cm thick, a metre long and perhaps half a metre wide without serious damage to the tree. Although not particularly durable as exterior roofing, the material provided excellent insulation and was used for ceilings and lining the walls.\n\nThe resilient bark from the Iron-bark tree was adapted as a major building material everywhere that such trees grew. It was widely used as a roofing material, was weatherproof, insulating and could last for thirty years. [[Slab Hut|Houses of axe-hewn slabs]] with Iron-bark roofs continued to be built in rural Australia until WWII.\n\nAs better tools became available the Colonial builders became adept at working the extremely hard and durable timber of the native hardwood forests. The majority of houses were built of split logs rather than sawn timber. The technique employed for the construction of a wall was to chisel out a deep groove in a straight log, preferably of the local termite-resistant Cyprus pine which became the foundation. Split logs that had been adzed flat at the ends were then stood in the groove and another groove log was placed on top and slotted into place in a circular corner post. The gaps between the split logs were either packed with clay and animal hair or had narrow strips of metal cut from kerosene tins tacked over them. The interior could be plastered with clay, lined with paperbark or papered with newspaper, wrapping paper or calico. Cards, photographs, news clippings and commemorative items were often stuck directly onto the walls.\n\nThe technique of making durable hardwood roofing shingles was also developed. Where these shingles have been applied to brick houses, they have sometimes survived to the 21st century, covered by subsequent corrugated iron roofs.\n\nIn the earliest houses windows were usually small, and multi-paned with cylinder glass. When the cost of glass put it beyond reach of the home-owner, blinds of oiled calico were tacked across window openings in the winter months.\n\n'''Types of buildings'''\n\nThe simplest houses were of a single room, which, if the bread-winner prospered, became the kitchen to a more substantial residence, or conversely, became the living room with a lean-to kitchen added. Houses that grew piecemeal were generally asymmetrical, with the door leading into the original room.\n\nHouses that were planned were generally symmetrical, and very simple, usually containing 2 to 4 rooms around a central hallway. The kitchen was frequently detached and entered from a rear verandah or covered breezeway where pantry or [[scullery (room)|scullery]] might also be located. Fireplaces projected outwards from the walls of the house. Except in the case of some small inner-city Georgian row houses built of brick, houses generally had a verandah added to them, often on three sides.\n\nOne class of people who maintained the tradition of wattle and daub, with a bark roof was the [[Squatting#Squatting in Australia|squatters]] who did not have title to their land, and potentially had to move on every two years.\n\nVery few 19th-century houses of wattle and daub or split timber have survived. A small number of split-timber cottages which later became kitchens may be seen adjacent to more substantial homes, generally painted to match the house and barely recognizable.\n\nMost buildings erected in the first 50 years of Australian settlement were simple and plain. Convict huts, marine barracks, government stores and houses for officials were simple rectangular prisms covered with hipped or gabled roofs often with verandahs supported on wooden columns in the Classical manner. They were influenced in particular by the regulation British military buildings in India and other tropical locations.\n\nAt the time of the first settlement, [[Georgian architecture]] was the architectural vernacular in Britain. Craftsmen, including carpenters and plasterers were trained in the classic proportions associated with the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]] fashionable across Europe. Palladian ideals reveal themselves in some of the few larger homes of the Regency period such as \u201cElizabeth Bay House\u201d. [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassism]] incorporating not only [[Greeks|Greek]] but also sometimes [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Motif (art)|motifs]], beginning in Europe about 1760, also influenced Australian architectural style.  \u201cFernhill\u201d at Mulgoa with its wide colonnaded verandah shows the influence of Neoclassicism.\nAs the Australian economy developed and settlements became more established, more sophisticated buildings emerged.\n\n===Old Colonial Georgian Style===\n<gallery>\nFile:Elizabeth Farm-1.jpg|[[Elizabeth Farm|Elizabeth Farm cottage]], [[Parramatta|Parramatta, New South Wales.]] Built 1793.

Thus, while a local [[magnate]] may have built his home in a classical style, he would potentially fund a church in the Gothic style. Thus, during the 19th century, when Australia was expanding rapidly, two forms of architecture were very evident: Gothic and the Classical styles. Originally Gothic was for God, and the Classical for the man. Later a new \"self-made\" Australian began to emerge, unhindered by a classical British education dictating classical gentlemanly interests. This \"new\" [[self-made man]] (like his contemporaries in Britain) would often choose Gothic as the design for his home.\n\nThe great cathedrals of the [[Middle Ages]] during the Gothic period of [[ecclesiastical architecture]] formed the inspiration for this particular architectural style; not only in residential buildings, but in many commercial structures, churches and cathedrals built during this time. St. Paul's and St. Patrick's Cathedrals in [[Melbourne]] are excellent examples of the Gothic Revival period, often referred to as Victorian Gothic. Characteristics were: steeply pitched roofs often made of slate, narrow doors and windows resolving in a Gothic pointed arch at their height (known as [[lancet window]]s), diamond pane glazing to windows imitating a stained glass affect, and intricate parapets, often of a religious nature, with a cross. In non-terrace houses, the drawing room was often pulled forward, adding a bay window to the front of the dwelling.\n\n[[File:Singapore Cottage, Collingwood.jpg|thumb|right|Prefabricated Victorian workers cottages were among the simple residences to appear in the slums of major cities in the 1850s.  Rare examples like this one in [[Collingwood, Victoria]] still remain today.]]\nThe [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style in Australia can be divided into 3 periods: Early, Mid and Late. The period in its entirety stretches from 1837 to 1901 and was named after the then Queen, [[Queen Victoria]]. Early styles featured symmetrical layouts and fa\u00e7ades, a centrally located front door and a hipped roof of corrugated iron, leading to a veranda on the fa\u00e7ade. During the 1850s cast-iron lacework came to Australia, where it made its way on to Mid and Late Victorian Homes with much the same floor plan as the Colonial Style, a central hallway with a standard 4 rooms. [[Weatherboard]]s were often used, although larger homes used red brick and blue stone. In the Mid Victorian Style, decoration began to gain popularity. The bullnosed veranda roof was introduced, sidelights were added either side of the front door, and [[terrace house|terraced houses]] were springing up everywhere, containing parapets and detailed dividing walls between the property boundaries. Late Victorian Style homes had perhaps the most decorative features in all of the known architectural styles to date, which is often referred to as Boom Style. Towards the end of the Victorian era, timber fretwork was being used more and more, which led into the Edwardian/Federation Styles.\n\n=== Queenslander style ===\n{{main|Queenslander (architecture)}}\nThe Queenslander style house is characterized by an all timber painted exterior, a timber stud frame, and a floor raised on piles for air flow in hot climate. They have wide verandahs (often the length of the house and enclosed by shutters, and roofs are gabled and corrugated iron. The street facing view is often symmetrical. The NSW Queenslander is often smaller than the original classic Queenslander and is less decorative probably due to limited supply of delicate timber detail and trades-people to build them. It is sometimes combined with the Ranch style house.\n\nFrom the 1840s, a specific style of building emerged in [[Queensland]]. The [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] style of houses are identifiable by large verandahs and large double doors which open onto these verandahs, stilts rising the house above ground level (particularly in older houses), metal roofs typically of corrugated design and the houses are always constructed of mostly wood.\n<gallery>\nFile:Queenslander1.JPG|Federation-style Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander2.JPG|Inter-war Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander.jpg|Victorian era Queenslander\nFile:Queenslander House Brisbane1.jpg|A typical 'Queenslander' style house in [[Brisbane]]\nFile:Kilcoy Old Queenslander-01+ (374769341).jpg|An old Queenslander in [[Kilcoy]]\n</gallery>\n\n*'''Early, Mid and Late Victorian'''\n'''1845\u20131900'''\nThe styles during this period were: Georgian, Regency, Egyptian, Academic Classical, Free Classical, Filligree, Mannerist, Second Empire, Italianate, Romanesque, Academic Gothic, Free Gothic, Tudor, Rustic Gothic and Carpenter Gothic. Of these fifteen styles, the following seven were normally used for residential architecture:\n\n===Georgian Revival===\n{{main|Georgian architecture}}\nA typical Victorian Georgian house of the 19th century was simple, elegant and formal in style. The style is sometimes called Georgian Revival to avoid confusion with Old Colonial Georgian architecture.\n<gallery>\n197, 199, 201 Albion Street, Surry Hills, New South Wales.jpg|Terrace houses, [[197, 199, 201 Albion Street, Surry Hills|197-201 Albion Street]], Surry Hills, New South Wales, {{circa|1845-47}}\n1_Cleveland_House-D.JPG|Cleveland House, Bedford Street, Surry Hills, New South Wales, possibly designed by [[Francis Greenway]]\n1_Durham_Hall1.JPG|[[Durham Hall, Surry Hills|Durham Hall]], Albion Street, Surry Hills, New South Wales\n1 Juniper Hall-1.jpg|[[Juniper Hall, Paddington|Juniper Hall]], Oxford Street, Paddington, New South Wales; built 1824-25<ref name=nswshr-268>{{cite NSW SHR|5045231|Juniper Hall|hr=00268|fn=EF11/18062; S90/6057; HC 32229|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n(1)Waimea_in_Waimea_Avenue_Woollahra.jpg|[[Waimea House|Waimea]], {{circa|1856}}, Waimea Avenue, Woollahra, New South Wales\n(1)Grandview.jpg|Grandview, Pacific Highway, Pymble, New South Wales\n1_Sandgate2.jpg|[[Sandgate, Randwick|''Sandgate'']], {{circa|1879}}, Belmore Road, Randwick, New South Wales\n</gallery>\n\n===Regency===\n{{main|Regency architecture}}\nThe Regency style was a refinement of Georgian, with elaborations like a portico with columns at the front of the house.\n<gallery>\nFile:Clarendon house evandale tasmania.jpg|Clarendon House.

From the mid-19th century in particular, as people became more affluent, they built more elaborate homes, and one of the favoured elaborations was the filigree, or screen, of [[cast iron]] or [[wrought iron]]. This developed to the point where it has become one of the major features of Australian architecture. Many homes with this feature are also considered [[Italianate architecture]], the filigree element being the wrought iron balcony.\n<gallery>\nFile:Holcombe Terrace drummond street carlton.jpg|''Holcombe Terrace''.

Their influence was long-lasting and eventually led to the Italianate architectural style of the 19th century. The style featured asymmetry and, usually, a tower of varying size. In Australia, the addition of the verandah, sometimes arcaded but later in Filigree (wrought iron), gave a regional flavour to the style.\n<gallery>\nFile:Bishopscourt east melbourne.jpg|''Bishopscourt'', {{VICcity|East Melbourne}}, Victoria;  completed in 1853\nFile:Epworth repatriation mansion richmond victoria.jpg|''Epworth'', {{VICcity|Richmond}}, Victoria\nFile:Eynesbury House, Adelaide-1.jpg|''Eynesbury House'', [[Adelaide]], South Australia\nFile:GovernmentHouseMelbourne1 gobeirne.jpg|[[Government House, Melbourne]];  completed in 1876\nFile:Heritage Kamesburgh Gardens in Brighton.jpg|''Kamesburgh'', North Road, {{VICcity|Brighton}}, Victoria\nFile:Myrnong Hall Acland Street St Kilda.jpg|''Myrnong Hall'', Acland Street, {{VICcity|St Kilda}}, Victoria\nFile:Rippon Lea.jpg|''Rippon Lea'', {{VICcity|Elsternwick}}, Victoria\nFile:Werribeepark.jpg|''Werribee Park'', {{VICcity|Werribee}}, Victoria; completed in 1877\nFile:Winsbury Terrace 75-79 Kent Street Millers Point.jpg|Winsbury Terrace, [[Millers Point, Sydney]]\nFile:(1)Italianate home Dutruc Street Randwick-1.jpg|Earlswood; [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick, Sydney]]\nFile:Randwick hotel 1.JPG|Avonmore Terrace, [[Randwick, New South Wales]]\nFile:(1)Italianate house Avoca Street.jpg|Italianate Terraces, [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick, Sydney]]\nFile:Jesmond House.jpg|''Jesmond House'', {{NSWcity|The Hill}}, {{NSWcity|Newcastle}}, New South Wales\nFile:1 Toxteth Park.jpg|''[[Toxteth Park, Glebe|Toxteth Park]]'', Glebe, New South Wales, completed in 1829<ref>{{cite NSW HD|2427721|Toxteth Heritage Conservation Area|fn=C34|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=11 October 2019}}</ref>\nFile:Croydon Shubra Hall PLC.JPG|Shruba Hall, [[Croydon, New South Wales]]\nFile:Kenilworth1.JPG|Kenilworth, [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale, Sydney]]\nFile:Italianate home, Lang Road, Centennial Park, Sydney - Wiki0123.jpg|Italianate home, [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park, Sydney]]\nFile:(1)Woollahra terrace-4.jpg|Terraces; [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra, Sydney]] \n</gallery>\n\n===Free Gothic===\n{{main|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nThe Gothic style gained favour from the early days of Queen Victoria's reign. Free Gothic became a popular choice for architects and their clients because it was not concerned with historical correctness and therefore gave them greater freedom in their designs. The style was much in vogue for religious buildings but was sometimes used in residential architecture as well.\n<gallery>\nFile:The Abbey j street.jpg|[[The Abbey, Annandale]], New South Wales.<ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/35</ref>\nFile:AshfieldNSWAmbleside.jpg|Ashfield Castle, {{NSWcity|Ashfield}}, New South Wales, is heritage-listed<ref>{{cite NSW SHR|1020628|Ashfield Castle}}</ref>\nFile:Cloncorrick.JPG|Cloncorrick, [[Darling Point, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tudor===\n{{main|Jacobethan}}\nThe Tudor style grew out of a nostalgia for older English concepts, particularly focused on the days of Queen Elizabeth I and Henry VIII. Its role in Australia began when the English architect Edward Blore designed Government House in Sydney in 1834. The style spread all over Australia and also influenced later styles like [[Federation Queen Anne]] and Inter-War Old English.\n<gallery>\nImage:Swifts.jpg|Swifts, Darling Point, New South Wales. Designed in 1882, this house later became the official residence of the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney.\n</gallery>\n\n===Rustic Gothic===\n{{see also|Gothic Revival architecture}}\nThe Rustic Gothic style developed out of a \"cult of the picturesque\" which largely focused on rural images and especially the picturesque \"rustic house\", which became known as the ''cottage orne''. In Australia, this style had a great appeal to British settlers who still carried with them a hankering for things English.\n<gallery>\nFile:13 James Street Richmond.jpg|13 & 15 James Street, [[Richmond, Victoria]].

For the rich, particularly in the wealthier parts of the larger metropolitan areas, the style evoked images of French aristocracy. Although rare, examples can be found in the bigger cities. Distinctive features include towers, quoining, mansard and slate roofs, square domes dormer windows, iron cresting and rich classical details. In the Australian setting, domestic interpretations of the style often combined filigree elements such as cast iron verandahs.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Labassa.jpg|Labassa.

[[Queenscliff, Victoria]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Federation period c. 1890 \u2013 c. 1915 ==\n{{main|Federation architecture}}\n\nThe [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]] was named after [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward]] (1901\u20131910) at the time, and was the predominant style in the United Kingdom and its colonies. The style draws on elements of the Victorian era and the earlier [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne style]] of the early 18th century. The Edwardian style coincided with the [[Federation of Australia]]. Thus, the Federation style was, broadly speaking, the Australian version of the Edwardian, but differed from the Edwardian in the use of Australian motifs, like [[kangaroo]]s, the rising sun (of Federation), and [[emu]]s, Australian flora and geometric designs. Some of the most recognisable Federation/Edwardian features include red brick exteriors with embellished wood detail known as [[fretwork]]. Cream painted decorative timber features, tall chimneys were all common. Stained glass windows towards the front of the home became increasingly popular during this period. Internally, Victorian-era features were still evident, including plaster ceiling roses and cornices and timber skirting and architraves. Federation style depicted a [[Tudorbethan architecture|Tudor]] type look, especially on [[gable]]s, and Edwardian gave a simpler cottage look. Terracotta tiles or galvanised iron are generally used for roofing, which is designed with a steep pitch. The gable ends and roof eaves often feature ornate timber brackets, and timber detailing and fretwork are a common inclusion on verandahs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.domain.com.au/advice/edwardian-architecture-in-australia/ |title=Edwardian architecture in Australia |author=Thompson, Jacqui |work=domain.com.au |publisher= |date= |access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome{{who|date=September 2017}} consider that this style was the Federation version of the Queen Anne style. Other styles during this period were Federation Academic Classical, Federation Free Classical, Federation Filligree, Federation Anglo-Dutch, Federation Romanesque, Federation Gothic, Federation Carpenter Gothic, Federation Warehouse, Federation Free Style, [[Federation Arts and Crafts]] and [[Federation Bungalow]]. The names all indicated very similar styles with features so minute separating them. Out of the twelve Federation styles, however, only the following four were normally used{{according to whom|date=September 2017}} in residential architecture:\n\n===Federation Queen Anne===\n{{main|Queen Anne Style architecture}}\n<gallery>\nFile:(1)Caerleon.jpg|[[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill]], [[New South Wales]], the first Queen Anne home in Australia\nFile:Federation style mansion in domain street south yarra.jpg|Federation mansion in [[South Yarra, Victoria]]\nFile:Landmark edwardian home on canterbury road middle park.jpg|Landmark Edwardian home in [[Albert Park, Victoria]]\nFile:Queen Anne style house in Ivanhoe, Victoria.jpg|A Queen Anne residence in [[Ivanhoe, Victoria]]\nFile:Edwardian style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Edwardian house, [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nFile:Queens Bess.jpg|Queen Bess Row in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]] is Melbourne's largest Queen Anne styled terrace\nFile:Burwood Appian Way 3.JPG|House in [[Appian Way, Burwood|Appian Way]] in [[Burwood, New South Wales]]\nFile:Penshurst Church 2.JPG|West Maling, [[Penshurst, New South Wales]]\nFile:Edwardian terraces in park street south yarra.jpg|Federation terraces.

The architectural style was characterised by rough-cast walls, shingles, faceted bay windows, stone bases, tall chimneys, high-pitched roofs and overhanging eaves. It was widely used in Australia during the Federation period.\n<gallery>\nImage:15 Arnold Street, Killara, New South Wales (2010-12-04).jpg|Home, Arnold Street, {{NSWcity|Killara}}\nImage:17 Waimea Road, Lindfield, New South Wales (2011-04-28).jpg|Waimea Road, {{NSWcity|Lindfield}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0124.jpg|Home, Burwood Road, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0125.jpg|''St Ellero'', Appian Way, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:SydneyBuilding0126.jpg|''Erica'', Appian Way, {{NSWcity|Burwood}}\nImage:ArtsAndCraftsHome.JPG|''Devon'', Martin Road, {{NSWcity|Centennial Park}}\nFile:(1) Hastings1.jpg|[[Hastings (Neutral Bay)|''Hastings'']], {{NSWcity|Neutral Bay}}\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Bungalow===\n{{main|Bungalow}}\nThe bungalow style was usually a single-storey house with a prominent veranda, especially with the roof covering the veranda. It is seen as a transition phase between the Federation period and the California bungalow.\n<gallery>\nImage:SydneyBuilding0127.jpg|Casa Tasso, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0128.jpg|Ostia, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0129.jpg|Home, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0130.jpg|Home, Appian Way, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:Bungalow667.JPG|Bungalow, Shaftsbury Road, Burwood, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0159.jpg|Arundel, Harrow Road, [[Bexley, New South Wales]]\nImage:RangersCottage.JPG|Ranger's cottage, [[Centennial Park, New South Wales]], designed by government architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation Filigree===\nThe filigree style was characterised by the creation of a screen as a prominent style at the front of the house. In the Victorian period, the screen was made of wrought iron, but in the Federation period it was made of wooden fretwork, which could be quite elaborate. It was widely used in Queensland as a way of providing shade and circulation of air for a home.\n<gallery>\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0013.jpg|Home, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0015.jpg|Building, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:QueenslandBuilding0017.jpg|Home, Rockhampton, Queensland\nImage:High Street, Millers Point, Sydney, NSW Federation home 0007.jpg|Homes, [[Millers Point, New South Wales]]\nImage:Timber terraces in madden street albert park.jpg|Timber fretwork terraces.  Madden Street, [[Albert Park, Victoria]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Inter-War Period c. 1915 \u2013 c. 1940==\nStyles which existed during the 1915-40 period include Edwardian, Georgian Revival, Academic Classical, Free Classical, Bungalow, Mediterranean, Spanish Mission, Art-Deco, Skyscraper Gothic, Romanesque, Gothic and Old English.\n\n===Californian Bungalow===\n{{main|Californian Bungalow}}\n'''1915\u20131940'''\nThis style can almost instantly be recognised by the columns holding up a front veranda area. The name is almost self-explanatory: bungalow, a rugged type of home. This led to the belief that picket fences looked appropriate at the front fence, although originally they were not used. Darker colours were originally used but, as the years went by, new brighter paint served as a welcoming change to open up the spaces and brighten up the homes. Stone, brick and timber, earthy materials were used. A gable roof faced either the front or side always.\n<gallery>\nImage:Californian Bungalow style house in Preston, Victoria.jpg|Californian Bungalow, [[Preston, Victoria]]\nImage:Belmont flats st kilda.jpg|Belmont Flats.

A staircase almost always dominated the front yard leading to the verandah.\n\n===Spanish Mission===\n{{main|Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture}}\n'''1925\u20131939'''\n\nDistinctly recognised by twisted pylons to a porch area covering the front door, usually windows grouped in threes to the side of the front door area on simpler homes. The style was influenced by the American Spanish inhabitant influenced American Architectural styles. Walls were brick in accordance with council regulations at the time, with white or cream yellowish cream [[stucco]] finish and Spanish terra cotta tiles.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Spanish Mission style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Spanish Mission home in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nImage:Belvedere flats St Kilda.jpg|Belvedere Flats.

It had a certain appeal for what was still a predominantly Anglo-Saxon population at the time.\n<gallery>\nImage:SydneyBuilding0150.jpg|Home, Bexley Road, Bexley, New South Wales\nImage:OldEnglish.JPG|Home, Robertson Road, Centennial Park, New South Wales\nImage:SydneyBuilding0180.jpg|Deanbury, Billyard Avenue, Wahroonga, New South Wales\nImage:Bonnington.JPG|Bonnington, Victoria Road, Bellevue Hill, New South Wales\nFile:Tudor Revival house, Adelaide (03).jpg|Unley Park, South Australia\n</gallery>\n\n===Early Moderne===\n{{see also|Streamline Moderne}}\n'''1930\u20131940'''\nA very modern looking style at the time, inspired by a German movement known as [[Bauhaus]], representing functional and clinical architecture. Red or cream brick walls and concrete was also first seen. Steel-framed casement sashes, with larger panes of glass and [[terra cotta]] tiled roofs with a moderate pitch. The only featured part of the house included matching decorative front fences, and a featured roof affect.\n\nThe Streamline Moderne style was a late branch of the [[Art Deco]] style. The style emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements, such as railings and porthole windows. This style was adopted into suburban architecture, most notably in the Waterfall style.\n<gallery>\nImage:BurnhamBeeches1947.jpg|[[Burnham Beeches (Australia)|Burnham Beeches]] mansion in the Dandenong Ranges outside Melbourne, completed 1933 in the [[Streamline Moderne]] style.

By the 1940s these details were entrenched into suburban designs. The 'Waterfall' or 'Waterfall Front' style came to be known as such from the use of descending curves in chimneys, fence pillars and other vertical elements. [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]], the Australian architect and writer, noted that three was 'the key to decorative smartness'; three steps usually being used for the waterfall effect and featured parallel lines were often in threes.\n\nDefining features of houses from this period are curved corner windows, including Venetian blinds, some rare examples of which are curved. With a slightly steeper pitched roof than the Early Modern Style, this style was generally of brick veneer cream brick but also could have dark brown glazed feature brickwork incorporated into the external walls, and under windowsills. Chimneys were either stepped or plain, and together with the round windows perhaps gave meaning to the \"Waterfall\" name.\n\nEcclesiastical, International, Melbourne Regional, Brisbane Regional and American Colonial were also styles which existed in the period 1940\u20131960.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Waterfall (Art Deco) style house in Eaglemont, Victoria.jpg|The Waterfall style and Art Deco combined, [[Heidelberg, Victoria]]\nFile:204 Monaro Crescent Red Hill ACT.jpg|House in [[Red Hill, Australian Capital Territory]], designed by [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]]. Typical of the post-war Melbourne regional style: long unbroken roof line, wide eaves, extensive windows.\n</gallery>\n\n===International style===\n{{main|International style (architecture)}}\nThe [[Rose Seidler House]] built by [[Harry Seidler]] for his parents between 1948 and 1950 in Sydney incorporated Modernist features of open planning, a minimal colour scheme, and labour saving devices that were new to Australia at the time. The house won the [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] in 1951 and is today preserved as a museum as a very influential house.<ref name=nswshr-261>{{cite NSW SHR|5045033|Rose Seidler House|hr=00261|fn=S90/05313; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[World War II|second World War]], architects in Australia were influenced by the development of the International style of architecture. Some regional variations developed. In Melbourne, [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] and [[Roy Grounds]] articulated a Melbourne interpretation of the modern style. Boyd's book ''Victorian Modern'' (1947) traced the history of architecture in the state of Victoria and described a style of architecture that he hoped would be a response to local surroundings as well as the popular international style. In particular he nominated the work of Roy Grounds and in some outer suburban bush houses of the 1930s as being the early stages of such a style. Grounds and Boyd later worked in partnership.\n\nThe houses were typically narrow, linear, and single storey with a low pitched gable roof. They had exposed rafters and wide eaves. Walls were generally bagged or painted brick and windows were large areas of glass with regularly spaced timber mullions.<ref>{{cite web | author=Martin Miles | year=2006 | url=http://www.canberrahouse.com.au/pwmelbourne.html | title=The post-war Melbourne regional style | work=Modernist residential architecture in Canberra | publisher=canberrahouse.com | accessdate=2006-02-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060225055330/http://canberrahouse.com.au/pwmelbourne.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-02-25}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RoseSeidlerHouseSulmanPrize.jpg|[[Rose Seidler House]] in the northern Sydney suburb of [[Wahroonga, New South Wales]]\n</gallery>\n\n===L-Shape 1945 \u2013 1955===\nThis style represented a change in the overall floor plan, the plan resembling a large \"L\" Shape. Usually with gabled ends to the L, with [[terra cotta]] tiles still being used, as [[concrete]] tiles didn't appear until the late 1960s. Timber or steel framed windows were used, and front-facing fences resembled the house, much the same as had been seen since the Early Modern Period.\n\n=== Dutch Colonial ===\n<gallery>\nFile:1967 Adelaide Dutch Colonial House.jpg|[[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial]] home in [[Adelaide]] (1950s).\nFile:Dutch_Colonial_Revival_house_in_Adelaide.jpg|Dutch Colonial house in [[Mitcham, South Australia]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Timber and fibro fisherman's cottage===\n\nThe original fisherman's cottage was built in many coastal towns between the 1930s and 1950s. It was originally a simple timber framed structure of one or two rooms and a verandah which was clad with asbestos sheeting. The floors were generally raised on piles. The verandah sometimes had handsome wooden balustrade that was sometimes enclosed to make an additional room or sleep-out. Timber detail around windows and gables were often painted- cheery red being one of the most popular traditional colours.\n\nThe original cottages, being relatively cheap to purchase, are now popular for renovation. Construction is easy and owner-building is common. The older buildings require insulation in the ceiling and walls. Timber and fiber cement sheeting now replaces the original asbestos and often the interior is completed gutted to create a modern open plan style of living. Timber strap-work can be used and windows frames painted for effect.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:RenovatedFishermansCottage.jpg|Renovated fisherman's cottage.\n</gallery>\n\n===Triple front (cream brick) 1950 \u2013 1960s===\nDistinctly recognisable by their front-facing walls have 3 and sometimes even 4 front-facing walls. This led to the front entrance sometimes brought round to the side within one of the alcoves created by the multiple fronts. Roofs were medium pitched and hipped with [[concrete]] tiles being used towards the end of the style in the late 60s. Front fences had a [[castellated]] top and feature piers raised above the top of the rest of the brick fence. Decorative [[iron]] was used very minimally, in gates to driveways, and balustrades to entrances.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Triple Front (With 4 Fronts) style house in Heidelberg, Victoria.jpg|Triple Front (With 4 Fronts), [[Heidelberg, Victoria]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Late twentieth century 1960 \u2013 2000==\nStyles of the late 20th century have largely been derived from the current world architectural trends, or have been imitative of previous Australian styles. These styles include Stripped Classical, Ecclesiastical, International, Organic, Sydney Regional, Perth Regional, Adelaide Regional, Tropical, Brutalist, Structural, Late Modern, Post Modern, Australian Nostalgic and Immigrants' Nostalgic. In the 1980s and 1990s most parts of Australia had a building boom which strained building supplies, so many buildings from this era are characterised by cheap and low quality materials.\n\nA good cross section of Australian residential architectural styles from this period, although not necessarily falling into one of the categories above, follows. Almost all of the houses shown in this section were built after 1960 and photographed just North of Sydney on the Central Coast of NSW.\n\nEach of these styles has a different emphasis to practicality (physical needs, layout, and views), land and environmental considerations (structural requirements for foundations, design for weather protection) and aesthetic considerations (planar, volumetric, and sculptural form, emotional and spiritual qualities.) All of these requirements and qualities should be considered when designing a house.\n\n=== Painted and rendered triple fronted brick veneer ===\n\nThis style of house has a brick facade (exterior) with timber frames supporting interior walls, usually of gyprock. Roofs are always hipped or gabled and tiled. As mentioned previously in this article, this style, without the painted and rendered brick facade, dominated suburban architecture in the 1950s \u2013 1960s. In its basic form it is a bland and unimaginative style which has been propagated by developers.\n\nDue to its familiar and cheap construction, it still is the dominant style in housing estates and many consider the style the scourge of Australian domestic architecture. The basic style has been made more interesting by rendering and painting, adding more angles, variations in roofing, porticos, verandahs, and [[bay window]]s. Large homes, two-story homes of this style have often been described as \"[[McMansion]]s\".\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PaintedMacMansion.jpg|Painted McMansion style\n</gallery>\n\n===Regional gabled cottage===\n\nThis popular style has emerged from the triple fronted brick veneer. While the house footprint and floor plan may be quite similar, the gabled cottage has a very different feel. In this style the distinctive gabled roof is a dominant design element, and a practical means of providing shade and entertaining space. Constructions can be entirely of brick (often painted), entirely timber, or a combination of brick on the lower part of the house and timber on the upper. Some houses of brick construction have featured verandahs and porticos. Roofs are usually galvanized iron and windows metal framed.\n\nWhile it is well suited to sloping blocks, this style can also be built on a slab. The use of timber cladding greatly reduces weight and construction costs\n\n<gallery>\nFile:TimberGabledRegional.jpg|Timber regional gabled style architecture\n</gallery>\n\n===Ranch\u2013style===\nThe [[ranch-style house|ranch-style]] became popular in the nineties. With conception in the [[United States]], it originated in suburban Adelaide and subsequently became popular in regional and coastal New South Wales. The floor plan is simple and footprint (of at least the street facing section) is often rectangular. Walls are usually brick, or brick and timber, and windows are often colonial style floor-to-ceiling. Roofs usually tiled with extended eaves. The garage was often integrated into the house. Some ranch style houses were boomerang shaped, others were L shaped for corner allotments.\n\nRanch style houses can be readily combined with the Murcutt/Drew style (timber and galvanized iron). These smaller ranch style houses often have balconies the width of the house.\n\n===Murcutt/Drew steel and corrugated iron house===\n\nA number of styles have emerged from the influence of architects Phillip Drew and [[Glenn Murcutt]]. The geometric play of angles is often a signature, likewise the (sometimes exposed) steel framing and corrugated iron cladding which is available in a variety of colours. Fiber cement and timber cladding is often used with the iron to create a sympathetic blend of textures.\n\nBeing of light weight construction, the steel and corrugated iron approach is relatively cheap and suitable for both flat and steeply inclined land. Interior cladding is most often gyprock but can be timber or even plywood. Butterfly roofs can also be employed quite successfully in this design. This style of house is suited for steel framed pole houses on steep slopes.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:MurcuttDrewStyle.jpg|Murcutt Drew style architecture.\n</gallery>\n\n===Pavilion style===\n\nThe Pavilion style house is characterized by a simple rectangular, box shaped volumetric style, open plan interior with glass replacing much of the wall space. Windows are often also steel framed. The transparency of the walls makes it well suited for blocks with privacy and/or views. Open patios are an integral part of living area, and like the rooms, they are orientated according to the aspect. Roofs are often low pitched roof and skillion.\n\nThe style was a favorite of architect Harry Seidler who favoured walls of rendered brick however it is also well suited to a steel, fiber cement, and corrugated iron treatment. This approach often requires the thinness of steel framing to create the desired look.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:11-13 Elvina Street, Dover Heights, New South Wales (2011-01-12).jpg|Cement rendered pavilion style architecture\n</gallery>\n\n===Federation revival===\nDuring the early-1990s, many of the design elements that characterised the Federation architecture of old were popularised in mainstream architecture. This Federation revival form is also known as \"mock Federation\" or \"faux Federation\". The style was widespread within the realm of residential housing (especially in new development suburbs) and for apartment buildings; however, smaller shopping centres and other public buildings also made use of the revival style that retained widespread popularity until the early 2000s. Suburbs of Sydney that developed in the 1990s\u2014such as [[Cherrybrook, New South Wales|Cherrybrook]], [[Wetherill Park]], [[Green Valley, New South Wales|Green Valley]], [[Cecil Hills]], [[Edensor Park]], [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], and [[Menai, New South Wales|Menai]]\u2014are notable in the sense that large tracts of these developments contain almost exclusively Federation revival homes.\n\nThe construction of Federation revival architecture varied little from that of other basic styles, with the Federation elements merely forming the facade and decorating elements of the building. For example, the typical brick and roof tile construction, hexagonal [[turret]]s, ornate [[gable]] work, [[finial]]s, prominent [[verandah]], steep pitched roofs, and faceted [[bay window]]s served to parallel the traditional Federation architecture.\n<gallery>\nFile:(1)Field Place house.jpg|Federation revival home in [[Wahroonga, New South Wales|Wahroonga, Sydney]]\nFile:34 Dudley Avenue, Roseville, New South Wales (2011-07-17).jpg|Federation revival home in [[Roseville, New South Wales|Roseville, Sydney]]\nFile:Apartments, 8-10 Russell Avenue, Lindfield, New South Wales (2011-07-17).jpg|Federation revival apartments in [[Lindfield, New South Wales|Lindfield, Sydney]]\nFile:Apartments, Kingsway, Miranda, New South Wales (2010-07-25) 02.jpg|Federation revival apartments in [[Miranda, New South Wales|Miranda, Sydney]] (c. 1995)\nFile:(1)house_Kingsford_Sydney-3.jpg|Federation revival house in [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford, Sydney]]\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Kensington.jpg|Federation revival house in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], Sydney\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Gordon Street Blacktown.jpg|A house in [[Blacktown]], [[Greater Western Sydney]]\nFile:(1)house High Street Glenbrook.jpg|[[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]], Blue Mountains\nFile:(1)Federation Revival house Frederick Street.jpg|[[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], Sydney\n</gallery>\n\n==Contemporary styles==\nContemporary styles from 2000 onwards include post modernism, modernism and pop architecture.\n<gallery>\nFile:Pamela anderson house st kilda.jpg|\"Newman House\" in [[St Kilda, Victoria]]; completed 2000.

From the 17th century onwards the [[Ottomans]] began facing problems in the conduct of their foreign relations, and were having difficulties in dictating terms to their neighbours; the Porte was faced for the first time with the need of participating in diplomatic negotiations.\n\nGiven the Ottoman tradition of generally ignoring [[Western Europe]]an languages and cultures, officials found themselves unable to handle such affairs. The Porte subsequently assigned those tasks to the Greeks who had a long mercantile and educational tradition and could provide the necessary skills. As a result, the so\u2212called ''Phanariotes'', Greek and Hellenized families mostly native to [[Constantinople]], came to occupy high posts of secretaries and interpreters to Ottoman officials and officers.\n\nSome of the most influential Arab nationalists were [[Arab]] Christians, like [[George Habash]], founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and [[Syrian]] intellectual [[Constantin Zureiq]]. Many Palestinian Christians were also active in the formation and governing of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] since 1992.

The trade of this product was done by Persians to begin with, but during the 17th century the Christian [[Armenians]] became increasingly vital in the trade of this merchandise, as middlemen.<ref name=\"Blow; p. 213\">Blow; p. 213.</ref>\n\nWhereas domestic trade was largely in the hands of Persian and Jewish merchants, by the late 17th century, almost all foreign trade was controlled by the [[Armenians]].<ref>Savory; p. 195-8</ref> They were even hired by wealthy Persian merchants to travel to Europe when they wanted to create commercial bases there, and the Armenians eventually established themselves in cities like [[Bursa]], [[Aleppo]], Venice, Livorno, Marseilles and Amsterdam.<ref name=\"Blow; p. 213\"/> Realizing this, Shah Abbas resettled large numbers of Armenians from the [[Caucasus]] to his capital city and provided them with loans.<ref name=\"Blow; p. 213\"/> And as the shah realized the importance of doing trade with the Europeans, he assured that the Safavid society was one with religious tolerance. The Christian Armenians thus became a commercial elite in the Safavid society and managed to survive in the tough atmosphere of business being fought over by the British, Dutch, French, Indians and Persians, by always having large capital readily available and by managing to strike harder bargains ensuring cheaper prices than what, for instance, their British rivals ever were able to.<ref>Savory; p. 202.</ref>\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\nImmediately after the [[Conquest of Constantinople]], [[Mehmet II]] deported all the Christian population of the city, leaving only the Jewish inhabitants of Balat.<ref name=ma98>Mamboury (1953), p. 98</ref> Afterward, he repopulated the city bringing inhabitants  &ndash; both Christian and Muslim &ndash; from the whole empire and from the newly conquered territories.<ref name=ma98/> Phanar was then repopulated with Greeks deported from Mouchlion in the [[Peloponnese]] and, [[Trabzon#Ancient and medieval|after 1461]], with citizens of [[Trabzon|Trebizond]].<ref name=ma99>Mamboury (1953), p. 99</ref>\n\nThe roots of [[Greeks|Greek]] ascendancy can be traced to the need of the [[Ottomans]] for skilled and educated negotiators as the power of their empire declined and they were compelled to rely on treaties more than the force of arms. From the 17th century onwards the [[Ottomans]] began facing problems in the conduct of their foreign relations, and were having difficulties in dictating terms to their neighbours; the Porte was faced for the first time with the need of participating in diplomatic negotiations.\n\nGiven the Ottoman tradition of generally ignoring [[Western Europe]]an languages and cultures, officials found themselves unable to handle such affairs. The Porte subsequently assigned those tasks to the Greeks who had a long mercantile and educational tradition and could provide the necessary skills. As a result, the so\u2212called ''Phanariotes'', Greek and Hellenized families mostly native to [[Constantinople]], came to occupy high posts of secretaries and interpreters to Ottoman officials and officers.\n\nSome of the most influential Arab nationalists were [[Arab]] Christians, like [[George Habash]], founder of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and [[Syrian]] intellectual [[Constantin Zureiq]]. Many Palestinian Christians were also active in the formation and governing of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] since 1992. The suicide bomber [[Jules Jammal]], a Syrian military officer who blew himself up while ramming a French ship, was also an Arab Christian.

He has recorded five studio albums with them.\n\nFrusciante has an active solo career, having released twelve solo albums and seven EPs; his recordings include elements ranging from [[experimental rock]] and [[ambient music]] to [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[electronica]]. Frusciante also released two [[acid house]] albums and one [[Extended play|EP]] under his alias '''Trickfinger'''.

He became a recluse and entered a long period of drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: ''[[Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt]]'' (1994) and ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'' (1997).

Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked.<ref name=\"tgm2002\"/> Therefore, he accentuates the melodically driven technique of players such as [[Matthew Ashman]] of [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[Joy Division]] as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored.<ref name=\"tgm2002\"/> Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Steve Vai]], but represses an urge to emulate their style: \"People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s.\"<ref name=Kerrangspain/> Believing that focusing only on \"clean tones\" is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a \"grimy\" sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to \"mistreat\" his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> He also tries to break as many \"stylistic boundaries\" as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal and that many of his contemporaries \"follow the rules with no risk\".<ref name=Kerrangspain/>\n\nFrusciante has stated that he became serious about creating and engineering his electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques, he has stated that he felt comfortable with how [[R&B]] and [[Hip hop music]] integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP, ''Letur-Lefr''.<ref name=RecentHistory/> ''PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone'' was recorded while Frusciante looked to find new ways to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his blog post, \"My Recent History,\" he notes that \"Aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago, as potentials, but which I had no idea how to execute.\"<ref name=RecentHistory/>\n\nFrusciante's approach to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that \"even on [''To Record Only Water for Ten Days''] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars.\"<ref name=guitarplayer2006/> However, on later albums such as ''Shadows Collide With People'', he pursued the opposite: \"I just wanted everything to be perfect\u2014I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that.\"<ref name=guitarplayer2006>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|author=Cleveland, Barry|title=''Exclusive Outtakes from GP's Interview with John Frusciante!''|date=November 2006|accessdate=August 27, 2007|magazine=Guitar Player|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320091008/https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|archivedate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: \"If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it.\"<ref name=selvaggio/> Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar.<ref name=Acoustic>Di Perna, Alan.

He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism.<ref name=electronic/> With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques. He has noted that there has been a change in how he works on an album. In the past, he would work on one song at a time, but with the new \"Progressive Synth Pop\" that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole.<ref name=RecentHistory/> He currently uses the [[music tracker]] [[Renoise]] as his main [[Digital audio workstation]] along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his [[Doepfer]], Arp, and other modular synthesizers.<ref name=guitarplayer2014-04>{{cite magazine|url=http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-guitar-player|title=''John Frusciante reprograms himself, his music and Black Knights''|date=April 2014|accessdate=April 4, 2014|magazine=Guitar Player|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410031244/http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-04-guitar-player|archive-date=April 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nFrusciante's first major influence was [[Jimi Hendrix]].

When he returned to the Chili Peppers in 1998, Kiedis wanted the band to record \"Living in Hell\", a song Frusciante had written several years before. Frusciante refused, feeling that the creative freedom he needed for his solo projects would have conflicted with his role in the band.<ref name=radio/>\n\n===Technique===\nFrusciante's guitar playing employs emphasis on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.<ref name=Kerrangspain>''Kerrang!'' Issue #21; pp. 76\u201382</ref> He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked.<ref name=\"tgm2002\"/> Therefore, he accentuates the melodically driven technique of players such as [[Matthew Ashman]] of [[Bow Wow Wow]] and [[Bernard Sumner]] of [[Joy Division]] as much as possible because he thinks that their style has been overlooked and consequently underexplored.<ref name=\"tgm2002\"/> Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Steve Vai]], but represses an urge to emulate their style: \"People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s.\"<ref name=Kerrangspain/> Believing that focusing only on \"clean tones\" is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a \"grimy\" sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to \"mistreat\" his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing.<ref name=Kerrangspain/> He also tries to break as many \"stylistic boundaries\" as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal and that many of his contemporaries \"follow the rules with no risk\".<ref name=Kerrangspain/>\n\nFrusciante has stated that he became serious about creating and engineering his electronic music in 2007. As he progressed in enhancing his skills with electronic instruments and techniques, he has stated that he felt comfortable with how [[R&B]] and [[Hip hop music]] integrated into his work. He has noted that these and other new techniques were all influences on his EP, ''Letur-Lefr''.<ref name=RecentHistory/> ''PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone'' was recorded while Frusciante looked to find new ways to play the guitar with the new forms of music and production that he had been studying. In his blog post, \"My Recent History,\" he notes that \"Aspects of PBX are the realization of combinations of styles of music I saw in my head many years ago, as potentials, but which I had no idea how to execute.\"<ref name=RecentHistory/>\n\nFrusciante's approach to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that \"even on [''To Record Only Water for Ten Days''] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars.\"<ref name=guitarplayer2006/> However, on later albums such as ''Shadows Collide With People'', he pursued the opposite: \"I just wanted everything to be perfect\u2014I didn't want anything off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that.\"<ref name=guitarplayer2006>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|author=Cleveland, Barry|title=''Exclusive Outtakes from GP's Interview with John Frusciante!''|date=November 2006|accessdate=August 27, 2007|magazine=Guitar Player|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320091008/https://www.guitarplayer.com/article/exclusive-outtakes-from/Sep-06/23282|archivedate=March 20, 2008}}</ref> Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: \"If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it.\"<ref name=selvaggio/> Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar.<ref name=Acoustic>Di Perna, Alan. (April 2005). \"Basic Instinct\". ''Guitar World Acoustic''.</ref><ref>\"Me and My Friends\".

(July 2004). \"John Frusciante's Creative Explosion\". ''Electronic Musician''.</ref> This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency.<ref name=law1/> Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible because he thinks \"music comes alive when [you] are creating it fast\". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism.<ref name=electronic/> With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques. He has noted that there has been a change in how he works on an album. In the past, he would work on one song at a time, but with the new \"Progressive Synth Pop\" that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole.<ref name=RecentHistory/> He currently uses the [[music tracker]] [[Renoise]] as his main [[Digital audio workstation]] along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his [[Doepfer]], Arp, and other modular synthesizers.<ref name=guitarplayer2014-04>{{cite magazine|url=http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-guitar-player|title=''John Frusciante reprograms himself, his music and Black Knights''|date=April 2014|accessdate=April 4, 2014|magazine=Guitar Player|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410031244/http://invisible-movement.net/press/2014-04-guitar-player|archive-date=April 10, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\nFrusciante's first major influence was [[Jimi Hendrix]].
