In some instances, this repayment of financial debt with labor included the debtor's children, essentially condemning the debtor family to perpetual slavery. About one millennium after written debt contracts were created, the concept of [[debt relief|debt forgiveness]] appears in the Old Testament, called [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] ([[Leviticus]] 25), and in Greek law when Solon introduces [[Seisachtheia]].  Both of these historical examples of debt forgiveness involved freeing children from slavery caused by their parents' debt.\n\nWhile [[slavery]] is illegal in all countries today, [[North Korea]] has a policy called, \"Three Generations of Punishment\"<ref>[[Kaechon internment camp]]</ref> which has been documented by [[Shin Dong-hyuk]] and used as a moral paragon of punishing children for parents' mistakes.

This concept was originally set out in 1974 by [[economist]] [[James Tobin]], who wrote that, \"The trustees of endowed institutions are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present. Their task in managing the endowment is to preserve equity among generations.\"<ref>Tobin, James.  (1974) \"[http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v64y1974i2p427-32.html What is Permanent Endowment Income?]\"</ref>\nin terms of an economical context. ''Intergenerational equity'' refers to relationship that a particular family has on resources. An example is the forest-dwelling civilians in Papua New Guinea, who for generations have lived in a certain part of the forest which thus becomes their land. The adult population sell the trees for palm oil to make money. If they cannot make a sustainable development on managing their resources, their next or future generations will lose this resource.\n\n=== U.S. national debt ===\n{{See also|National debt of the United States}}\nOne debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity. For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to consider:\n*For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an asset by investors. Future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them, which by definition must correspond to the level of debt passed on.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/debt-is-mostly-money-we-owe-to-ourselves/|title=Debt Is (Mostly) Money We Owe to Ourselves|author=|date=28 December 2011|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n*As of 2010, approximately 72% of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest 5% of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html|title=Who Rules America: Wealth, Income, and Power|author=|date=|website=www2.ucsc.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> This presents a wealth and income distribution question, as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today. \n*To the extent the U.S. debt is owed to foreign investors (approximately half the \"debt held by the public\" during 2012), principal and interest are not directly received by U.S. heirs.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> \n*Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments, which create costs for future taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes, lower government benefits, higher inflation, or increased risk of fiscal crisis).<ref>Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010).

Adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations, via higher taxes or lower program spending.\n\nEconomist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: \"Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we should be ashamed of what we\u2019re doing to the next generation's economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much.\" Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/opinion/krugman-cheating-our-children.html|title=Opinion - Cheating Our Children|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=28 March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nAustralian politician [[Christine Milne]] made similar statements in the lead up to the 2014 Carbon Price Repeal Bill, naming the Liberal National Party (elected to parliament in 2013) and inherently its ministers, as intergenerational thieves; her statement was based on the party's attempts to roll back progressive carbon tax policy and the impact this would have on the intergenerational equity of future generations.\n\n=== U.S. Social Security ===\n{{See also|Social Security (United States)}}The U.S. Social Security system has provided a greater net benefit to those who reached retirement closest to the first implementation of the system. The system is unfunded, meaning the elderly who retired right after the implementation of the system did not pay any taxes into the social security system, but reaped the benefits. Professor Michael Doran estimates that cohorts born previous to 1938 will receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, while the reverse is true to cohorts born after. Further, he admits that the long-term insolvency of Social Security will likely lead to be further unintentional intergenerational transfers.<ref name=\":2\">Michael Doran (2008). \u201cIntergenerational Equity in Fiscal Policy Reform\u201d. Tax law Rewiew. 61: 241-293</ref> However, Broad concedes that other benefits have been introduced into U.S. society via the welfare system, like Medicare and government-financed medical research, that benefit current and future elderly cohorts.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Environmental usage ==\n[[File:Kids Want Climate Justice (34168280266).jpg|thumb|[[Global warming]] is an example of intergenerational inequity, see [[climate justice]]]] \nIntergenerational equity is often referred to in environmental contexts, as younger age cohorts will disproportionately experience the negative consequences of environmental damage. Two perspectives can be taken on what should be done to ameliorate environmental intergenerational equity: the \"[[Weak and strong sustainability|weak sustainability]]\" perspective and the \"strong sustainability\" perspective. From the \"weak\" perspective, intergenerational equity would be achieved if losses to the environment that future generations face were offset by gains in economic progress. From the \"strong\" perspective, no amount of economic progress can justify leaving future generations with a degraded environment. According to Professor Sharon Beder, the \"weak\" perspective is undermined by a lack of knowledge of the future, as we do not know which intrinsically valuable resources will not be able to be replaced by technology.<ref name=\":0\">Sharon Beder, 'Costing the Earth: Equity, Sustainable Development and Environmental Economics', New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law, 4, 2000, pp. 227-243.</ref> We also do not know to what extent environmental damage is irreversible. Further, more harm cannot be avoided to many species of plants and animals.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other scholars contest Beder's point of view. Professor Wilfred Beckerman insists that \"strong sustainability\" is \"morally repugnant\", particularly when it overrides other moral concerns about those alive today.<ref name=\":1\">Beckerman, Wilfred. \"'Sustainable Development': Is it a Useful Concept?\" Environmental Values 3, no. 3, (1994): 191\u2013209. {{doi|10.3197/096327194776679700}}.</ref> Beckerman insists that the optimal choice for society is to prioritize the welfare of current generations above future generations. He suggests placing a discount rate on outcomes for future generations when accounting for generational equity.<ref name=\":1\" /> Beckerman is extensively criticized by [[Brian Barry]]<ref>Brian Barry, 'Sustainability and Integenerational Justice', in Dobson (1999) (Ed) Fairness and Futurity.</ref> and [[Nicholas Vrousalis]].<ref>Nicholas Vrousalis, 'Integenerational Justice: A Primer', Institutions for Future Generations, Gosseries, A. & I.

Two perspectives on intergenerational equity in living standards have been distinguished by Rice, Temple and McDonald. The first perspective \u2013 a \"cross-sectional\" perspective \u2013 focuses on living standards at a particular point in time and how these living standards vary between people of different ages. The relevant issue is the degree to which, at a particular point in time, people of different ages enjoy equal living standards. The second perspective \u2013 a \"cohort\" perspective \u2013 focuses on living standards over a lifetime and how these living standards vary between people of different generations. For intergenerational equity, the relevant issue becomes the degree to which people of different generations enjoy equal living standards over their lifetimes.<ref name=\"RiceTempleMcDonald\" /> Three indicators of intergenerational equity in economic flows, such as income, have been proposed by D'Albis, Badji, El Mekkaoui and Navaux. Their first indicator originates from a cross-sectional perspective and describes the relative situation of an age group (retirees) with respect to the situation of another age group (younger people). Their second indicator originates from a cohort perspective and compares the standards of living of successive generations at the same age. D'Albis, Badji, El Mekkaoui and Navaux's third indicator is a combination of the two previous criteria and is both an inter-age indicator and an intergenerational indicator.<ref name=\"d'AlbisBadjiElMekkaouiNavaux\" />\n\nIn Australia, notable equality has been achieved in living standards, as measured by consumption, among people between the ages of 20 and 75 years. Substantial inequalities exist, however, between different generations, with older generations experiencing lower living standards in real terms at particular ages than younger generations. One way to illustrate these inequalities is to look at how long different generations took to achieve a level of consumption of $30,000 per year (2009-10 Australian dollars). At one extreme, people born in 1935 achieved this level of consumption when they were roughly 50 years of age, on average. At the other extreme, Millennials born in 1995 had achieved this level of consumption by the time they were around 10 years of age.<ref name=\"RiceTempleMcDonald\" />\n\nConsiderations such as this have led some scholars to argue that standards of living have tended to increase generation over generation in most countries, as development and technology have progressed. When taking this into account, younger generations may have inherent privileges over older generations, which may offset the redistribution of wealth towards older generations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Public Finance and Public Policy Fifth Edition (c) 2016|last=Gruber|first=Jonathan|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=2016|isbn=978-0716786559|location=Massachusetts, United States|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Elderly care usage ==\n\nSome scholars consider the changing cultural trends that move society away from the norm of adult children caring for elderly parents to be an intergenerational equity issue. The older generation had to care for their parents, as well as their own children, while the younger generation must only care for their children. This is especially true in countries with weak social security systems. Professor Sang-Hyop Lee describes the presence of this phenomenon in South Korea, explaining that the current elderly now have the highest poverty rate among any developed country. He notes that it is particularly frustrating because the elderly usually invest a lot in their children's education, and they now feel betrayed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Sang-Hyop Lee on the middle-income trap and demographic crisis in East Asia|last=Willian|first=Caroline|date=March 27, 2017|work=Asia Experts Forum}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars express different opinions on which generation is truly disadvantaged by elderly care. Professor Steven Wisensale describes the burden on current working age adults in developed economies, who must care for more elderly parents and relatives for a longer period of time. This problem is exacerbated by the increasing involvement of women in the workforce, and by the dropping fertility rate, leaving the burden for caring for parents, as well as aunts, uncles, and grandparents, on fewer children.<ref>Steven K.

In some instances, this repayment of financial debt with labor included the debtor's children, essentially condemning the debtor family to perpetual slavery. About one millennium after written debt contracts were created, the concept of [[debt relief|debt forgiveness]] appears in the Old Testament, called [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee]] ([[Leviticus]] 25), and in Greek law when Solon introduces [[Seisachtheia]].  Both of these historical examples of debt forgiveness involved freeing children from slavery caused by their parents' debt.\n\nWhile [[slavery]] is illegal in all countries today, North Korea has a policy called, \"Three Generations of Punishment\"<ref>[[Kaechon internment camp]]</ref> which has been documented by [[Shin Dong-hyuk]] and used as a moral paragon of punishing children for parents' mistakes.

This concept was originally set out in 1974 by [[economist]] [[James Tobin]], who wrote that, \"The trustees of endowed institutions are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present. Their task in managing the endowment is to preserve equity among generations.\"<ref>Tobin, James.  (1974) \"[http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v64y1974i2p427-32.html What is Permanent Endowment Income?]\"</ref>\nin terms of an economical context. ''Intergenerational equity'' refers to relationship that a particular family has on resources. An example is the forest-dwelling civilians in Papua New Guinea, who for generations have lived in a certain part of the forest which thus becomes their land. The adult population sell the trees for palm oil to make money. If they cannot make a sustainable development on managing their resources, their next or future generations will lose this resource.\n\n=== U.S. national debt ===\n{{See also|National debt of the United States}}\nOne debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity. For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to consider:\n*For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an asset by investors. Future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them, which by definition must correspond to the level of debt passed on.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/debt-is-mostly-money-we-owe-to-ourselves/|title=Debt Is (Mostly) Money We Owe to Ourselves|author=|date=28 December 2011|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref>\n*As of 2010, approximately 72% of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest 5% of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html|title=Who Rules America: Wealth, Income, and Power|author=|date=|website=www2.ucsc.edu|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> This presents a wealth and income distribution question, as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today. \n*To the extent the U.S. debt is owed to foreign investors (approximately half the \"debt held by the public\" during 2012), principal and interest are not directly received by U.S. heirs.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> \n*Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments, which create costs for future taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes, lower government benefits, higher inflation, or increased risk of fiscal crisis).<ref>Huntley, Jonathan (July 27, 2010).

The system is unfunded, meaning the elderly who retired right after the implementation of the system did not pay any taxes into the social security system, but reaped the benefits. Professor Michael Doran estimates that cohorts born previous to 1938 will receive more in benefits than they pay in taxes, while the reverse is true to cohorts born after. Further, he admits that the long-term insolvency of Social Security will likely lead to be further unintentional intergenerational transfers.<ref name=\":2\">Michael Doran (2008). \u201cIntergenerational Equity in Fiscal Policy Reform\u201d.

Two perspectives can be taken on what should be done to ameliorate environmental intergenerational equity: the \"[[Weak and strong sustainability|weak sustainability]]\" perspective and the \"strong sustainability\" perspective. From the \"weak\" perspective, intergenerational equity would be achieved if losses to the environment that future generations face were offset by gains in economic progress. From the \"strong\" perspective, no amount of economic progress can justify leaving future generations with a degraded environment. According to Professor Sharon Beder, the \"weak\" perspective is undermined by a lack of knowledge of the future, as we do not know which intrinsically valuable resources will not be able to be replaced by technology.<ref name=\":0\">Sharon Beder, 'Costing the Earth: Equity, Sustainable Development and Environmental Economics', New Zealand Journal of Environmental Law, 4, 2000, pp. 227-243.</ref> We also do not know to what extent environmental damage is irreversible. Further, more harm cannot be avoided to many species of plants and animals.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other scholars contest Beder's point of view. Professor Wilfred Beckerman insists that \"strong sustainability\" is \"morally repugnant\", particularly when it overrides other moral concerns about those alive today.<ref name=\":1\">Beckerman, Wilfred. \"'Sustainable Development': Is it a Useful Concept?\" Environmental Values 3, no. 3, (1994): 191\u2013209. {{doi|10.3197/096327194776679700}}.</ref> Beckerman insists that the optimal choice for society is to prioritize the welfare of current generations above future generations.

As such, they represent more than half of what now remains of the surviving sculptural decoration of the Parthenon.\n\nElgin's acquisitions also included objects from other buildings on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Athenian Acropolis]]: a [[Caryatid]] from [[Erechtheum]]; four slabs from the parapet frieze of the [[Temple of Athena Nike]]; and a number of other [[Architecture|architectural]] fragments of the Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheum, the Temple of Athene Nike, and the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\n==Legality of the removal from Athens==\nThe Acropolis was at that time an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] military fort, so Elgin required special permission to enter the site, the Parthenon, and the surrounding buildings. He stated that he had obtained a [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the [[Sultan]] which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an [[Italian language|Italian]] copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.<ref>St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, US, 3 edition (1998)</ref> Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that \"any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman\".<ref name=firman/> The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. [https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008272383/page/n40 <!-- pg=35 quote=lord elgin testified 1816 british parliamentary committee. --> 'The committee permission'] had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.newmentor.net/firman.htm|title=firman|work=newmentor.net}}</ref> in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that firmans, being official decrees by the Sultan, were meticulously recorded as a matter of procedure, and that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period.<ref name=Nation/>\n\nThe parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]]. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and \"vouches for the accuracy of the English translation\". The committee report states on page 69 \"(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan\" - however, the document presented to the committee was \"an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original ''firman''\",<ref>{{cite book |first=Kate Fitz |last=Gibbon |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |page=115 }}</ref> and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Rudenstine |title=Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? |journal=[[The Nation]]}}</ref> The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, ''Lord Elgin and the Marbles,'' stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon.

According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from [[Piraeus]].<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">{{cite book |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |chapter=Whither the Elgin Marbles? |title=Imperialism, Art And Restitution |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nMany have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor [[David Rudenstine]] of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, \"is certainly not established and may well be false\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rudenstine |first=David |title=The Legality of Elgin's Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles |journal=International Journal of Cultural Property |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=356\u2013376 }}</ref> Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads \"We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador\" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is \"We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.\". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of \"Mr. Philip Hunt\" with the initials \"N.N.\" can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, \"Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens\". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had \"retained none of them.\" Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was \"Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted [to Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?\" to which Hunt answered \"yes\", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" />\n\nEnglish travel writer [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], an eyewitness, wrote that the [[Dizdar]], the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue.<ref name=\"Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff\">{{Cite book|author=Edward Daniel Clarke |title= Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa Part the Second Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section the Second Fourth Edition Volume the Sixth |publisher=T. Cadell |location=London |year=1818 |page= 223ff}}</ref> \nIn contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] and also Professor of Art at [[Stanford University]], putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. [[Sultan]] [[Selim III]] was grateful to the British for repelling [[Napoleon]]ic expansion, and unlike his ancestor [[Mehmet II]], the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him.<ref name=\"guardian faq\"/> Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles \"is at best ambiguous\", adding that the document \"provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon&nbsp;...&nbsp;The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal.

''The Guardian'' has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon.<ref name=\"guardian faq\"/> However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens.

He stated that he had obtained a [[firman (decree)|firman]] from the [[Sultan]] which allowed his artists to access the site, but he was unable to produce the original documentation. However, Elgin presented a document claimed to be an English translation of an [[Italian language|Italian]] copy made at the time. This document is now kept in the British Museum.<ref>St Clair, William: Lord Elgin and the Marbles. Oxford University Press, US, 3 edition (1998)</ref> Its authenticity has been questioned, as it lacked the formalities characterising edicts from the sultan. Vassilis Demetriades, Professor of Turkish Studies at the University of Crete, has argued that \"any expert in Ottoman diplomatic language can easily ascertain that the original of the document which has survived was not a firman\".<ref name=firman/> The document was recorded in an appendix of an 1816 parliamentary committee report. [https://archive.org/details/gri_33125008272383/page/n40 <!-- pg=35 quote=lord elgin testified 1816 british parliamentary committee. --> 'The committee permission'] had convened to examine a request by Elgin asking the British government to purchase the Marbles. The report said that the document<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.newmentor.net/firman.htm|title=firman|work=newmentor.net}}</ref> in the appendix was an accurate translation, in English, of an Ottoman firman dated July 1801. In Elgin's view it amounted to an Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles. The committee was told that the original document was given to Ottoman officials in Athens in 1801. Researchers have so far failed to locate it despite the fact that firmans, being official decrees by the Sultan, were meticulously recorded as a matter of procedure, and that the Ottoman archives in Istanbul still hold a number of similar documents dating from the same period.<ref name=Nation/>\n\nThe parliamentary record shows that the Italian copy of the firman was not presented to the committee by Elgin himself but by one of his associates, the clergyman Rev. [[Philip Hunt (priest)|Philip Hunt]]. Hunt, who at the time resided in Bedford, was the last witness to appear before the committee and stated that he had in his possession an Italian translation of the Ottoman original. He went on to explain that he had not brought the document, because, upon leaving Bedford, he was not aware that he was to testify as a witness. The English document in the parliamentary report was filed by Hunt, but the committee was not presented with the Italian translation in Hunt's possession. William St. Clair, a contemporary biographer of Lord Elgin, said he possessed Hunt's Italian document and \"vouches for the accuracy of the English translation\". The committee report states on page 69 \"(Signed with a signet.) Seged Abdullah Kaimacan\" - however, the document presented to the committee was \"an English translation of this purported translation into Italian of the original ''firman''\",<ref>{{cite book |first=Kate Fitz |last=Gibbon |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |page=115 }}</ref> and had neither signet nor signature on it, a fact corroborated by St. Clair.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\">{{cite journal |first=David |last=Rudenstine |title=Did Elgin cheat the Marbles? |journal=[[The Nation]]}}</ref> The 1967 study by British historian William St. Clair, ''Lord Elgin and the Marbles,'' stated the sultan did not allow the removal of statues and reliefs from the Parthenon.

According to non-restitutionalists, further evidence that the removal of the sculptures by Elgin was approved by the Ottoman authorities is shown by a second firman which was required for the shipping of the marbles from [[Piraeus]].<ref name=\"autogenerated5\">{{cite book |first=John Henry |last=Merryman |chapter=Whither the Elgin Marbles? |title=Imperialism, Art And Restitution |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 }}</ref>\n\nMany have questioned the legality of Elgin's actions, including the legitimacy of the documentation purportedly authorising them. A study by Professor [[David Rudenstine]] of the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] concluded that the premise that Elgin obtained legal title to the marbles, which he then transferred to the British government, \"is certainly not established and may well be false\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rudenstine |first=David |title=The Legality of Elgin's Taking: A Review Essay of Four Books on the Parthenon Marbles |journal=International Journal of Cultural Property |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=356\u2013376 }}</ref> Rudenstine's argumentation is partly based on a translation discrepancy he noticed between the surviving Italian document and the English text submitted by Hunt to the parliamentary committee. The text from the committee report reads \"We therefore have written this Letter to you, and expedited it by Mr. Philip Hunt, an English Gentleman, Secretary of the aforesaid Ambassador\" but according to the St. Clair Italian document the actual wording is \"We therefore have written this letter to you and expedited it by N.N.\". In Rudenstine's view, this substitution of \"Mr. Philip Hunt\" with the initials \"N.N.\" can hardly be a simple mistake. He further argues that the document was presented after the committee's insistence that some form of Ottoman written authorisation for the removal of the marbles be provided, a fact known to Hunt by the time he testified. Thus, according to Rudenstine, \"Hunt put himself in a position in which he could simultaneously vouch for the authenticity of the document and explain why he alone had a copy of it fifteen years after he surrendered the original to Ottoman officials in Athens\". On two earlier occasions, Elgin stated that the Ottomans gave him written permissions more than once, but that he had \"retained none of them.\" Hunt testified on March 13, and one of the questions asked was \"Did you ever see any of the written permissions which were granted [to Lord Elgin] for removing the Marbles from the Temple of Minerva?\" to which Hunt answered \"yes\", adding that he possessed an Italian translation of the original firman. Nonetheless, he did not explain why he had retained the translation for 15 years, whereas Elgin, who had testified two weeks earlier, knew nothing about the existence of any such document.<ref name=\"autogenerated6\" />\n\nEnglish travel writer [[Edward Daniel Clarke]], an eyewitness, wrote that the [[Dizdar]], the Ottoman fortress commander on the scene, attempted to stop the removal of the metopes but was bribed to allow it to continue.<ref name=\"Edward Daniel Clarke 1818 223ff\">{{Cite book|author=Edward Daniel Clarke |title= Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia and Africa Part the Second Greece Egypt and the Holy Land Section the Second Fourth Edition Volume the Sixth |publisher=T. Cadell |location=London |year=1818 |page= 223ff}}</ref> \nIn contrast, John Merryman, Sweitzer Professor of Law at [[Stanford Law School]] and also Professor of Art at [[Stanford University]], putting aside the discrepancy presented by Rudenstine, argues that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable. [[Sultan]] [[Selim III]] was grateful to the British for repelling [[Napoleon]]ic expansion, and unlike his ancestor [[Mehmet II]], the Parthenon marbles had no sentimental value to him.<ref name=\"guardian faq\"/> Further, that written permission exists in the form of the firman, which is the most formal kind of permission available from that government, and that Elgin had further permission to export the marbles, legalises his (and therefore the British Museum's) claim to the Marbles.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\" /> He does note, though, that the clause concerning the extent of Ottoman authorisation to remove the marbles \"is at best ambiguous\", adding that the document \"provides slender authority for the massive removals from the Parthenon&nbsp;...&nbsp;The reference to 'taking away any pieces of stone' seems incidental, intended to apply to objects found while excavating. That was certainly the interpretation privately placed on the firman by several of the Elgin party, including Lady Elgin. Publicly, however, a different attitude was taken, and the work of dismantling the sculptures on the Parthenon and packing them for shipment to England began in earnest. In the process, Elgin's party damaged the structure, leaving the Parthenon not only denuded of its sculptures but further ruined by the process of removal. It is certainly arguable that Elgin exceeded the authority granted in the firman in both respects\".<ref name=\"NafzigerPaterson2010\">{{cite book|author1=James A. R.

''The Guardian'' has written that many among those who support repatriation imply that the marbles would be displayed in their original position on the Parthenon.<ref name=\"guardian faq\"/> However, the Greek plan is to transfer them from a museum in London to one in Athens. These arguments are perhaps complicated a little by the completion of the new [[Acropolis Museum]] in 2009, where the half not removed by Elgin is now displayed, aligned in orientation and within sight of the [[Parthenon]], with the position of the missing elements clearly marked and space left should they be returned to [[Athens]].<ref name=\"acrop museum\"/>\n\nThe Trustees of the British Museum make the following statement on the Museum website in response to arguments for the relocation of the Elgin Marbles to the Acropolis Museum: \"The Acropolis Museum allows the Parthenon sculptures that are in Athens to be appreciated against the backdrop of ancient Greek and Athenian history. This display does not alter the Trustees\u2019 view that the sculptures are part of everyone\u2019s shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries.

International organisations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[International Association for the Reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures]], as well as campaign groups such as, [[Marbles Reunited]], and stars of Hollywood, such as [[George Clooney]] and [[Matt Damon]], as well as Human Rights activists, lawyers, and the people of the arts, voiced their strong support for the return of the Elgin Marbles to Greece.\n\nAmerican actor George Clooney voiced his support for the return by the United Kingdom and reunification of the Parthenon Marbles in Greece, during his promotional campaign for his 2014 film ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' which retells the story of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] efforts to save important masterpieces of art and other culturally important items before their destruction by [[Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] during [[World War II]].

{"title_page": "Casey Hayden", "text_new": "{{short description|American civil rights activist}}\n\n'''Sandra Cason \"Casey\" Hayden''' (born October 31, 1937), American, was a radical student activist and civil rights worker in the 1960s. Recognized for her defense of [[direct action]] in the struggle against [[racial segregation]], in 1960 she was an early recruit to [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS). With [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) in Mississippi  Hayden was a strategist and organizer for the 1964 [[Freedom Summer]]. In the internal discussion that followed its uncertain outcome, she clashed with the SNCC national executive. Hayden's vision was of a \"radically democratic\" movement driven by organizers in the field. In defending grassroots organization she believed she was also advocating for the voice of women. In \"Sex and Caste\" (November 1965),<ref>Document 86A: Casey Hayden (aka Sandra Cason) and Mary King, \"Sex and Caste,\" 18 November 1965, ''Liberation Magazine'', April 1966, Elaine DeLott Baker Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. pp. 35-36. https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref> a reworking of an internal memo they had drafted with other SNCC women, Hayden and [[Mary King (political scientist)|Mary King]] drew  \"parallels\" with the experience of African-Americans to suggest that women are \"caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power.\"  Since regarded as a bridge connecting civil rights to women's liberation, Hayden describes its publication as her \"last action as a movement activist.\" In the decades since, she has continued to acknowledge the civil-rights struggle of the era as the forerunner for women, and for all those, who have taken up \"the idea of organising for themselves.\"\n\n[[File:Sandra Cason (\"Casey\" Hayden).jpg|thumb|Sandra Cason (\"Casey\" Hayden)]]\n\n== Early life ==\nCasey Hayden was born Sandra Cason on October 31, 1937, in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Texas]],<ref name=Smith>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Harold L. |editor-last1=Turner |editor-first1=Elizabeth Hayes |editor-last2=Cole |editor-first2=Stephanie |editor-last3=Sharpless |editor-first3=Rebecca |title=Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives. |publisher=University of Georgia Press |date=2015 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/texaswomentheirh0000turn/page/295 295\u2013318] |chapter=Casey Hayden: Gender and the Origins of SNCC, SDS, and the Women's Liberation Movement |isbn=9780820347905 |url=https://archive.org/details/texaswomentheirh0000turn/page/295 }}</ref> as a fourth-generation Texan.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt175758p|title=Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives|date=2015|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=9780820347202|editor-last=Turner|editor-first=Elizabeth Hayes|editor-last2=Cole|editor-first2=Stephanie|editor-last3=Sharpless|editor-first3=Rebecca|chapter=Their Histories, Their Lives}}</ref> She was raised in Victoria, Texas, in a \"\u201cmultigenerational matriarchal family\u201d<ref>Casey Hayden (2010). \"In the Attics of my Mind.\" Written for Hands on the Freedom Plow: Personal Accounts by Women in SNCC.

Dixon (2009) ''Women and the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1965''. University Press of Mississippi. p. 135</ref>\n\n== Campus activist  ==\nIn 1957 Cason enrolled as junior at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]]. She moved out of campus dorms into the [[Social Gospel]] and racially-integrated Christian Faith and Life Community, and as officer of [[Young Womens Christian Association]] and member of the Social Action Committee of the university's Religious Council was soon engaged in civil-rights education and protest. Continuing from 1959 as a UT English and philosophy graduate student, she participated in a successful sit-in campaign to desegregate Austin-area restaurants and theaters.\n\nIn a dramatic intervention at the [[National Student Association]] convention in Minneapolis in August 1960, Cason turned back a broadly-supported motion that, objecting to sit-ins, would have denied support to the fledgling [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). \u201cI cannot say to a person who suffers injustice, \u2018Wait,\u2019 And having decided that I cannot urge caution, I must stand with him.\u201d Among the delegates who, after a moments silence, gave her a standing ovation was SDS president [[Alan Haber]], whom, as she recalls, \"scooped\" her \"up,\" and [[Tom Hayden]] editor of University of Michigan student newspaper. Stirred by her \"ability to think morally [and] express herself poetically,\" he followed her into Haber's new left-wing grouping.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 365</ref>\n\nAt the SNCC second coordinating conference in Atlanta in October 1960, Cason reported herself transfixed by the idea of the Beloved Community as espoused by [[James Lawson (activist)|James Lawson]] and [[Diane Nash]] of the [[Nashville Student Movement]].<ref>Houck and Dixon (2009). p. 135</ref>\n\n== With the SNCC in the South==\nIn the summer of 1961 Cason moved to New York City and lived with Tom Hayden. In a ceremony invoking [[Albert Camus]]--\"I, on the other hand, choose justice in order to remain faithful to the world\"\u2014they  married in October, and then moved to Atlanta.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 369</ref>  \"Godmother of the SNCC\" [[Ella Baker]] had hired Cason (now Casey Hayden) for a YWCA special project, travelling to southern campuses to conduct integrated race-relations workshops (secretly in the case of some white schools). She also worked in the SNCC office on, among other projects, preparations for the [[Freedom Riders]] who were to challenge non-enforcement of the United States Supreme Court decision [[Boynton v. Virginia]] (1960). In December, as Freedom Riders themselves, the Haydens were arrested in Albany, Georgia.\n\nIt was from the jail cell that Tom Hayden began drafting what was to become the [[Port Huron Statement]], adopted by the SDS at its convention in June 1962 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  With Tom Hayden elected SDS president for the 1962\u20131963 academic year, and Casey Hayden heeding the SNCC call to return to Atlanta, they separated, divorcing in 1965. While she had had the reputation in the SDS of being \"one of the boys,\"  much of the discussion within the SDS inner circle struck her as young men posturing. Her heart was with the SNCC where, consistent with the focus on action, greater value was placed on building relationships, and where women, Black women, spoke out.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 372</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Casey Hayden moved to Mississippi where, along with [[Doris Derby]], she was asked to begin a literacy project at [[Tougaloo College]] in an all-black community outside Jackson. The comparative safety of the college was a consideration: out in the field the increased visibility she brought as a white woman was a risk not only to herself, but also to her comrades. But it was also important to Hayden that the \"request was specifically made\" because of her background in English education:\n\n<blockquote>As a Southerner, I considered the Southern Freedom Movement Against Segregation mine as much any one else's. I was working for my right to be with who I chose to be with as I chose to be with them. It was my freedom. However, when I worked full time in the black community I considered myself a guest of that community, which required decency and good manners, as every Southerner knows. I considered myself a support person; my appropriate role was to provide support from behind the lines, not to be a leader in any public way.</blockquote>\n\nIt was not that within SNCC she did not have a \"right to leadership\" but that \"it would have been counterproductive.\"<ref>https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref>  Not being \"a leader in any public way,\" however, did not leave Hayden feeling in any way excluded. Although she appears quicker to recognize the  advantage it was to her as a woman in the movement than to her as a \"guest\" in the community, Hayden noted that because of \"the participatory, town-hall, consensus-forming nature of the SNCC operation\" being \"on the Executive Committee or a project director didn't carry much weight anyway.\"<ref>Casey Hayden (2015), \"Only Love Is Radical.\" ''Inspiring Participatory Democracy: Student Movements from Port Huron to Today'', ed. Tom Hayden. New York: Routledge, 2015, p. 65.</ref> Her ability to make decisions and to control her own work was not a matter of formal position.\n\nIn 1964 she became organizer and strategist for [[Freedom Summer]] and for the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] in the challenge they were to mount to the seating of the all-white regulars at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]. She explains that in those roles:\n<blockquote>I did the work all the way up and down. That means I did my own typing and mimeographing and mailing and I also did my own research and analysis and writing and decision making, the latter usually in conversation with other staff. As we said at the time, both about our constituencies and ourselves, \"The people who do the work should make the decisions.\" There were no secretaries in SNCC, with the exception of Norma Collins in the Atlanta office, so there was no office hierarchy. I was at the center of the organization, unlimited except by my own choices and challenged at every turn to think and do and grow and care.<ref>Casey Hayden (1995). \"Feminists and Women,\" 12th Annual Fannie Lou Hamer Symposium Lecture Series, Jackson State University, 4\u20136 October. Document 89, Elaine DeLott Baker Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. p. 2 https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc89.htm</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, it is the recollection of Elaine DeLott Baker that when she joined Hayden in Jackson just the month before Freedom Summer, the era when \"the beloved community\"  operated \"in a space beyond race and gender\" was already being spoken of with nostalgia.<blockquote>There was a hierarchy in place that determined the definition of the \"people\" in the phrase, \"Let the people decide\". There was an unspoken understanding of who should speak up at meetings, who should propose ideas in public places, and who should remain silent. [It] was not the traditional hierarchy, it was a hierarchy based on considerations of race, the amount of time spent in the struggle, dangers suffered, and finally, of gender . . . \u2014black men at the top of the hierarchy, then black women, followed by white men, and at the bottom, white women.</blockquote> \"Women, black and white,\" still retained \"an enormous amount of operational freedom, they were indeed the ones that were keeping things moving.\" But as people began to debate the direction the movement should take \"in the post-freedom summer reality,\" there was \"little public recognition of that reality.\"<ref>Elaine DeLott Baker (2009).

Filmed interview conducted for ''Eyes on the Prize'' (May 15, 1986). Washington University in St Louis.</ref> She was not asked about the issues raised by ''Sex and Caste'' but was pressed on black-white division within the SNCC Mississippi operation, particularly in the light of calls for [[Black Power]] and black separatism. She allowed that there was an understandable degree of frustration, even resentment, felt by the local black staff, \"the backbone\" of the project, in having to deal \"with a lot of young white people who were intellectual and moneyed.\" Calls for Black Power only came later, after Freedom Summer, and were in great measure a reaction, she believed, to continued political exclusion, something which the refusal to accredit the MFDP at the Democratic convention had dramatically symbolized: \"it was like, if you won't let us in, we'll do our own thing.\"\n\nDivision of any kind, however, was not her abiding memory of the movement. Rather it was the feeling of being \"part of a visionary community which really transcended race and really was integrated,\" and whose later dissipation continued to be felt as \"a great loss.\" It was also \"a lot of fun.\" \"We were all out there doing whatever we thought up to do. We were totally self-directed people, and very few people have that experience.\"\n\nThe \"direction\" travelled with the movement in the South \"put a lot of people in touch with themselves and the idea of organizing for themselves, so it spun off into anti-war organizing, and women's organizing and so on.\" There was also what Hayden called \"the long suits of the black community in the South,\" the \"patience and spirituality.\" This was something she believed northern black intellectuals tried to \"tap into\" and that she felt she and others also \"picked up on.\"\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayden, Casey}}\n[[Category:American women activists]]\n[[Category:American civil rights activists]]\n[[Category:University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts alumni]]\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American civil rights activist}}\n\n'''Sandra Cason \"Casey\" Hayden''' (born October 31, 1937), American, was a radical student activist and civil rights worker in the 1960s.

In the internal discussion that followed its uncertain outcome, she clashed with the SNCC national executive.

University Press of Mississippi. p. 135</ref>\n\n== Campus activist  ==\nIn 1957 Cason enrolled as junior at [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas]]. She moved out of campus dorms into the [[Social Gospel]] and racially-integrated Christian Faith and Life Community, and as officer of [[Young Womens Christian Association]] and member of the Social Action Committee of the university's Religious Council was soon engaged in civil-rights education and protest. Continuing from 1959 as a UT English and philosophy graduate student, she participated in a successful sit-in campaign to desegregate Austin-area restaurants and theaters.\n\nIn a dramatic intervention at the [[National Student Association]] convention in Minneapolis in August 1960, Cason turned back a broadly-supported motion that, objecting to sit-ins, would have denied support to the fledgling [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). \u201cI cannot say to a person who suffers injustice, \u2018Wait,\u2019 And having decided that I cannot urge caution, I must stand with him.\u201d Among the delegates who, after a moments silence, gave her a standing ovation was SDS president [[Alan Haber]], whom, as she recalls, \"scooped\" her \"up,\" and [[Tom Hayden]] editor of University of Michigan student newspaper. Stirred by her \"ability to think morally [and] express herself poetically,\" he followed her into Haber's new left-wing grouping.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 365</ref>\n\nAt the SNCC second coordinating conference in Atlanta in October 1960, Cason reported herself transfixed by the idea of the Beloved Community as espoused by [[James Lawson (activist)|James Lawson]] and [[Diane Nash]] of the [[Nashville Student Movement]].<ref>Houck and Dixon (2009). p. 135</ref>\n\n== With the SNCC in the South==\nIn the summer of 1961 Cason moved to New York City and lived with Tom Hayden. In a ceremony invoking [[Albert Camus]]--\"I, on the other hand, choose justice in order to remain faithful to the world\"\u2014they  married in October, and then moved to Atlanta.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 369</ref>  \"Godmother of the SNCC\" [[Ella Baker]] had hired Cason (now Casey Hayden) for a YWCA special project, travelling to southern campuses to conduct integrated race-relations workshops (secretly in the case of some white schools). She also worked in the SNCC office on, among other projects, preparations for the [[Freedom Riders]] who were to challenge non-enforcement of the United States Supreme Court decision [[Boynton v. Virginia]] (1960). In December, as Freedom Riders themselves, the Haydens were arrested in Albany, Georgia.\n\nIt was from the jail cell that Tom Hayden began drafting what was to become the [[Port Huron Statement]], adopted by the SDS at its convention in June 1962 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  With Tom Hayden elected SDS president for the 1962\u20131963 academic year, and Casey Hayden heeding the SNCC call to return to Atlanta, they separated, divorcing in 1965. While she had had the reputation in the SDS of being \"one of the boys,\"  much of the discussion within the SDS inner circle struck her as young men posturing. Her heart was with the SNCC where, consistent with the focus on action, greater value was placed on building relationships, and where women, Black women, spoke out.<ref>Smith (2015). p. 372</ref>\n\nIn 1963, Casey Hayden moved to Mississippi where, along with [[Doris Derby]], she was asked to begin a literacy project at [[Tougaloo College]] in an all-black community outside Jackson. The comparative safety of the college was a consideration: out in the field the increased visibility she brought as a white woman was a risk not only to herself, but also to her comrades. But it was also important to Hayden that the \"request was specifically made\" because of her background in English education:\n\n<blockquote>As a Southerner, I considered the Southern Freedom Movement Against Segregation mine as much any one else's. I was working for my right to be with who I chose to be with as I chose to be with them. It was my freedom. However, when I worked full time in the black community I considered myself a guest of that community, which required decency and good manners, as every Southerner knows. I considered myself a support person; my appropriate role was to provide support from behind the lines, not to be a leader in any public way.</blockquote>\n\nIt was not that within SNCC she did not have a \"right to leadership\" but that \"it would have been counterproductive.\"<ref>https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref>  Not being \"a leader in any public way,\" however, did not leave Hayden feeling in any way excluded. Although she appears quicker to recognize the  advantage it was to her as a woman in the movement than to her as a \"guest\" in the community, Hayden noted that because of \"the participatory, town-hall, consensus-forming nature of the SNCC operation\" being \"on the Executive Committee or a project director didn't carry much weight anyway.\"<ref>Casey Hayden (2015), \"Only Love Is Radical.\" ''Inspiring Participatory Democracy: Student Movements from Port Huron to Today'', ed. Tom Hayden. New York: Routledge, 2015, p. 65.</ref> Her ability to make decisions and to control her own work was not a matter of formal position.\n\nIn 1964 she became organizer and strategist for [[Freedom Summer]] and for the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] in the challenge they were to mount to the seating of the all-white regulars at the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]]. She explains that in those roles:\n<blockquote>I did the work all the way up and down. That means I did my own typing and mimeographing and mailing and I also did my own research and analysis and writing and decision making, the latter usually in conversation with other staff. As we said at the time, both about our constituencies and ourselves, \"The people who do the work should make the decisions.\" There were no secretaries in SNCC, with the exception of Norma Collins in the Atlanta office, so there was no office hierarchy. I was at the center of the organization, unlimited except by my own choices and challenged at every turn to think and do and grow and care.<ref>Casey Hayden (1995). \"Feminists and Women,\" 12th Annual Fannie Lou Hamer Symposium Lecture Series, Jackson State University, 4\u20136 October.

There was an unspoken understanding of who should speak up at meetings, who should propose ideas in public places, and who should remain silent. [It] was not the traditional hierarchy, it was a hierarchy based on considerations of race, the amount of time spent in the struggle, dangers suffered, and finally, of gender . . . \u2014black men at the top of the hierarchy, then black women, followed by white men, and at the bottom, white women.</blockquote> \"Women, black and white,\" still retained \"an enormous amount of operational freedom, they were indeed the ones that were keeping things moving.\" But as people began to debate the direction the movement should take \"in the post-freedom summer reality,\" there was \"little public recognition of that reality.\"<ref>Elaine DeLott Baker (2009).

But in particular, women we've talked to who work in the movement seem to be caught up in a common-law caste system that operates, sometimes subtly, forcing them to work around or outside hierarchical structures of power which may exclude them. Women seem to be placed in the same position of assumed subordination in personal situations too. It is a caste system which, at its worst, uses and exploits women.</blockquote>\n\nIn November 1965, Hayden had the paper published in ''Liberation'', the bi-monthly of the [[War Resisters League]], the title Sex and Caste being suggested by the editor by David McReynolds.<ref>Document 86A: Casey Hayden (aka Sandra Cason) and Mary King, \"Sex and Caste,\" 18 November 1965, Liberation Magazine, April 1966, Elaine DeLott Baker Papers, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. pp. 35-36. https://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/SNCC/doc86A.htm</ref> It was, Hayden has pointed out, her \"last action as movement activist.\"<ref>Casey Hayden (2015), \"Only Love Is Radical.\" ''Inspiring Participatory Democracy: Student Movements from Port Huron to Today'', ed.

We had been flying by the seat of our pants for years.\" Through the committee Forman put forward a plan for a decision making structure that \"spoke to the structural needs of the Atlanta office.\" [[Bob Moses (activist)|Bob Moses]] countered with a paper that \"spoke to the structural needs of organizers.\"\n\nHayden's attempt, as she saw it, was \"to get us through the impasse.\" She agreed the need for structure, \"basically\" Forman's, while seeking to maintain \"both SNCC's central allegiance to programmatic control by organizers in the field and respect for the way we had organically developed, the ways we actually operated.\" Her plan went along with Forman's proposal to constitute the staff as the Coordinating Committee (the campus sit-in groups that comprised the original Committee had largely evaporated in the move to voter registration). But she hedged it round with various sub-committees and provisos to ensure that \"leadership for all our programs\" would continue to be driven from the field and not from central office \"which makes many program areas responsible to one person rather than to all of us.\"<ref>(Casey Hayden to Elaine DeLott Baker, 11 September 2014).

It was \"the most obvious example,\" she commented, of \"Fortress America, the right wing\u2019s answer to the real issues we all face: 'We\u2019ve got it and we are keeping it and we\u2019ll shoot you if you try to get any of it.'\"<ref>Casey Hayden (2010). \"Boycott Arizona: Church leaders call SB 1070 'racist and sinful'.\" The Rag Blog.

Washington University in St Louis. http://repository.wustl.edu/concern/videos/vm40xt43x</ref> She was not asked about the issues raised by ''Sex and Caste'' but was pressed on black-white division within the SNCC Mississippi operation, particularly in the light of calls for [[Black Power]] and black separatism. She allowed that there was an understandable degree of frustration, even resentment, felt by the local black staff, \"the backbone\" of the project, in having to deal \"with a lot of young white people who were intellectual and moneyed.\" Calls for Black Power only came later, after Freedom Summer, and were in great measure a reaction, she believed, to continued political exclusion, something which the refusal to accredit the MFDP at the Democratic convention had dramatically symbolized: \"it was like, if you won't let us in, we'll do our own thing\".\n\nDivision of any kind, however, was not her abiding memory of the movement. Rather it was the feeling of being \"part of a visionary community which really transcended race and really was integrated,\" and whose later dissipation continued to be felt as \"a great loss.\" It was also \"a lot of fun.\" \"We were all out there doing whatever we thought up to do. We were totally self-directed people, and very few people have that experience.\"\n\nThe \"direction\" travelled with the movement in the South \"put a lot of people in touch with themselves and the idea of organizing for themselves, so it spun off into anti-war organizing, and women's organizing and so on.\" There was also what Hayden called \"the long suits of the black community in the South,\" the \"patience and spirituality.\" This was something she believed northern black intellectuals tried to \"tap into\" and that she felt she and others also \"picked up on.\"\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hayden, Casey}}\n[[Category:American women activists]]\n[[Category:American civil rights activists]]\n[[Category:University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts alumni]]\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "name_user": "RHodnett", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReflections:Italicized title of PBS documentary.

The film stars [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Kristen Stewart]] as a mother and daughter whose new home is invaded by burglars, played by [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]]. The script was written by [[David Koepp]].\n\nKoepp's screenplay was inspired by news coverage in 2000 about [[panic room]]s. The film was Fincher's fifth feature film, following ''[[Fight Club]]'' (1999). Fincher and Koepp brought together a crew of people with whom each had worked before. The house and its panic room were built on a Raleigh Studios lot. [[Nicole Kidman]] was originally cast as the mother, but she left after aggravating a previous injury. Her departure threatened the completion of the film, but Foster quickly replaced Kidman. The filmmakers used computer-generated imagery to create the illusion of the film camera moving through the house's rooms. Foster became pregnant during the shooting schedule, so filming was suspended until after she gave birth. The film's production cost {{nowrap|$48 million}}.\n\nThe film was commercially released in the United States and Canada on {{nowrap|March 29}}, 2002. The film grossed {{nowrap|$30 million}} on its opening weekend. In the United States and Canada, it grossed {{nowrap|$96.4 million}}. In other territories, it grossed {{nowrap|$100 million}} for a worldwide total of {{nowrap|$196.4 million}}. Critics generally praised the film. ''Panic Room'' has been assessed for its portrayal of childhood and [[feminism]], the elements of [[video surveillance]] and [[diabetes]], and its thematic approach to mortality.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nRecently divorced Meg Altman, and her eleven-year-old daughter, Sarah, move into a four-story [[brownstone]] in  [[New York City]]'s [[Upper West Side]]. The house's previous owner, a reclusive millionaire, installed a \"[[safe room|panic room]]\" to protect the occupants from intruders. The room is protected by concrete and steel on all sides and a thick steel door and has an extensive security system with multiple [[surveillance cameras]], a public address (P.A.) system, and a separate phone line. On the night the two move into the house, Junior, the previous owner's grandson; Burnham, an employee of the residence's security company; and Raoul, a vicious hitman Junior recruited, break in. They are after $3&nbsp;million in [[bearer bond]]s locked inside a floor safe in the panic room.\n\nJunior has miscalculated when the new occupants would move in, but he convinces a reluctant Burnham to continue the heist. Meg wakes up and happens to see the three men on the panic room video monitors. Meg gets Sarah and they get into the panic room, barely locking the door in time. They are unable to call for help because the dedicated phone line is not hooked up. To force the two out, Burnham pumps propane gas into the room's air vents. However, a trigger-happy Raoul dangerously increases the amount. Unable to seal the vents, Meg ignites the gas, while she and Sarah cover themselves with fireproof blankets, causing an explosion which vents into the room outside and causes a fire, giving Junior a second-degree burn. The Altmans make several attempts to summon help, including unsuccessfully signaling a neighbor with a flashlight through a ventilation pipe. Meg taps into the main telephone line and calls her ex-husband, Stephen, but the intruders cut the main line, abruptly ending the call.\n\nAll attempts to get into the room fail, and Junior gives up on the robbery while letting slip that there is far more money in the safe than he indicated. As Junior is about to leave, Raoul fatally shoots him, then forces Burnham to finish the robbery. Stephen arrives and immediately is taken hostage. Raoul severely beats him, making sure Meg can see it on the security camera. Sarah, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], suffers a seizure. Her emergency [[glucagon]] syringes are kept in her bedroom. Knowing that Meg wants something outside, Raoul tricks Meg into thinking it is safe to temporarily leave the panic room. While she goes to get Sarah's med kit, Burnham finds Sarah nearly unconscious on the floor. After retrieving the med kit, Meg struggles briefly with Raoul, who is thrown into the panic room, his gun knocked from his hand. Meg throws the kit into the panic room just as Burnham locks himself, Raoul, and Sarah inside, crushing Raoul's fingers in the sliding steel door. Meg, who now has the gun, begs the intruders over the PA system to give Sarah the injection. Burnham, not wanting to hurt anyone, injects Sarah, telling her he only participated in the robbery to help his child. He informs Meg that Sarah is alright.\n\nFollowing up on Stephen's earlier 911 call, two policemen arrive at the door. To protect Sarah, Meg convinces the officers to leave. Burnham opens the safe and finds $22&nbsp;million in bearer bonds inside. As the burglars attempt to leave using Sarah as a hostage, Meg rigs booby traps, leading to an ambush where she knocks Raoul over a banister and into a stairwell with a sledgehammer. As Burnham flees, Raoul crawls back and overpowers Meg, preparing to bludgeon her with the sledgehammer. Burnham, hearing Sarah screaming, rushes back and shoots Raoul then runs off. The police, alerted by Meg's earlier odd behavior, arrive in force and apprehend Burnham, who drops the bearer bonds that scatter in the wind.\n\nLater, Meg and Sarah, recovered from their harrowing ordeal, search the newspaper for a new home.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n!

[[Nicole Kidman]] was originally cast as Meg,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> but she left the project due to a knee injury.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Foster, who almost joined the cast of Fincher's 1997 film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'', replaced Kidman. Fincher said Kidman's portrayal was \"about glamour and physicality\", while Foster's portrayal was \"more political\". Meg was originally written to be helpless, but with Foster's involvement, the character was revised to be stronger.<ref name=\"swallow153\" /> The casting change also led to Meg's being rewritten to be similar to her daughter, whereas Meg had been different from her before.<ref name=\"swallow153\" /> Foster became pregnant soon after she started filming. She told the filmmakers, and they decided to keep filming her scenes but with a wardrobe that would conceal her pregnancy.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> Studio executives did not like the dailies and suspended production until Foster gave birth and returned to perform re-shoots.<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> Foster was reportedly paid {{nowrap|$12 million}} for her role.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\n[[Kristen Stewart]] stars as Sarah, Meg's diabetic daughter. [[Hayden Panettiere]] was originally cast as Sarah,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> but when she left the project toward the end of 2000, Stewart was cast in the role.<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> ''Panic Room'' was Stewart's second feature film after ''[[The Safety of Objects]]'' (2001). <ref name=\"swallow161\" /> When Kidman was cast as Meg, Fincher said Stewart was \"to complement [Kidman's portrayal], to be her antithesis, tomboyish, androgynous, dismissive, a teenager at ten years old. It was about the daughter being a parent to her mother.\"<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> When Foster replaced Kidman, the character Meg was rewritten so she and Sarah would be similar.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\n[[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]] star as the film's burglars, Burnham, Junior, and Raoul, respectively. Whitaker's character Burnham was originally written to be \"a slick, technical type\" and the designer of the panic room in Meg and Sarah's home. Fincher did not think a designer could be persuaded to break into a home, so he rewrote the character to be a [[blue-collar worker]] who installs panic rooms for a living. The director told Whitaker to watch ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' (1948) and to emulate [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character. Whitaker said he liked Burnham's \"conflicted\" nature and preferred it over Raoul's villainy.<ref name=\"swallow162\" /> Raoul was originally written to be \"a giant scary hulking guy\", but Fincher rewrote him to be \"this wiry, mean kind of ex-con white trash guy\".<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> In one revised instance, Raoul punches Meg instead of slapping her to be reinforced as \"an appalling character\".<ref name=\"swallow168\" /> The role of Raoul was originally offered to [[Maynard James Keenan]], whom Fincher had directed in a music video for [[A Perfect Circle]]'s \"[[Judith (song)|Judith]]\". Keenan was too busy as the lead singer for [[Tool (band)|Tool]],<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> so Fincher then offered the role to Yoakam, knowing him from his performance in ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (1996). For the role of Junior, Fincher cast Leto, who was in the cast of Fincher's previous film ''Fight Club'' (1999).<ref name=\"swallow162\" /> As part of atypical class division, Junior is \"the uptown rich kid\", where Burnham is blue-collar, and Raoul is undefinable.<ref name=\"swallow167\" />\n\nPatrick Bauchau had a minor role as Meg's ex-husband Stephen. Kidman, though she left the primary role due to her knee injury, had an uncredited off-screen role as the voice of Stephen's supermodel girlfriend.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> Screenwriter [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], who was a credited writer for ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'' and an uncredited writer for ''Fight Club'', had a cameo in ''Panic Room'' as a sleepy neighbor.<ref name=\"swallow163\" />\n\n==Analysis==\n\n===Conspiracy thrillers and feminism===\nAcademic Jyotsna Kapur identifies ''Panic Room'' as one of several American conspiracy thrillers in the 2000s that re-cast the subject of childhood as \"one of horror and alarm\",{{#tag:ref|Kapur's other examples of such thrillers include: ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), ''[[The Forgotten (2004 film)|The Forgotten]]'' (2004), ''[[Flightplan]]'' (2005), ''[[Syriana]]'' (2005), ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' (2006), ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006), and ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"kapur44\" />|group=\"nb\"}} where it had previously been a subject of celebration in family films dating back to the early 1980s.<ref name=\"kapur44\" /> Kapur also says the depiction of paranoia in the decade's conspiracy thrillers is divided by gender. She describes the male protagonist as \"an idealized subject who thinks fast on his feet and cuts through fear to find the conspirators\". In contrast, the female protagonist \"gives in to her fear, turns delusional and vulnerable to suggestion\"; Kapur cites Meg Altman in ''Panic Room'' as such a depiction with her divorcee status and her residence in a home too big for her and her daughter Sarah. The academic says calling this depiction merely a sexist stereotype is too dismissive: \"It is logical that anxieties around the home and loss of children would privilege women because the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] has remained a gendered space.\" Kapur recalls 1940s films wherein a woman enters the husband's home as a stranger, with \"the house and the husband as sources of dependence and dread\".{{#tag:ref|Such 1940s films include ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Two Mrs. Carrolls]]'' (1947), ''[[Secret Beyond the Door]]'' (1948), and ''[[Caught (1949 film)|Caught]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"kapur47\u201349\" />|group=\"nb\"}} She contrasts them with films like ''Panic Room'', in which the female protagonists instead defend against dangerous intruders. She writes, \"They are not economically dependent on the marriage. Yet they portray for most of the film an image of feminized vulnerability, replaying the racist trope of diminutive white women in need of protection from outsider threats.\"<ref name=\"kapur47\u201349\" />\n\n===Medicine and technology as themes===\n''Panic Room'' is one of several films at the turn of the 21st century that use video surveillance as a key element.{{#tag:ref|Kammerer also references the following films: ''[[The End of Violence]]'' (1997), ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' (1998), ''[[Snake Eyes (film)|Snake Eyes]]'' (1998), and ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998). He also mentions older examples: ''[[Peeping Tom (1960 film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983).<ref name=\"kammerer468\" />|group=\"nb\"}} In particular, video surveillance is featured to illustrate aspects of a \"[[Mass surveillance|surveillance society]]\".<ref name=\"kammerer468\" /> The home is wired with a [[closed-circuit television]] system, and the images are displayed in the home's panic room. Since the burglars want to access the safe in the panic room where Meg and her daughter Sarah are hiding, there is an irreconcilable contradiction of freedom and safety. Dietmar Kammerer says there is no closed system within the home for the characters: \"There is always communication; every action provokes a reaction.\"<ref name=\"kammerer471\" /> In contrast, the film's \"camera eye\" can travel unimpeded throughout the home, passing through walls. The surveillance footage in the film is never the camera eye; the camera eye itself observes the footage on the monitors. Of the cameras, Kammerer says, they are \"Extremely mobile, but unstable: the surveillance technology in ''Panic Room'' is useful and harmful, good and evil at once.\" When the cameras are destroyed, Meg and Sarah are able to overcome the burglars. Kammerer says the cameras reflect ambivalence in the film, between \"freedom and security, openness and closedness\".<ref name=\"kammerer472\" />\n\nIn the film, Sarah is diabetic. Kevin L. Ferguson says, \"With diabetes, this self-aware focus on the ethics of the body is drawn sharply by films that also raise the older form of direct, punitive power. This is the reason why diabetics appear with frequency in films involving criminality and law.\" In a review of nearly forty films with diabetes as a key element,<ref name=\"ferguson192\u2013193\" /> ''Panic Room'' is one of the only three that shows a [[glucometer]] (a device diabetics use to measure their [[glucose]]; Sarah wears a glucometer as a watch.) Sarah's diabetes in the film is never explicitly outlined for audiences, but they hear dialogue about moderating beverage intake and see the glucometer count down. Ferguson says, \"The glucometer arranges the viewer's acknowledgement of diabetic selfcare, thus implicating the viewer in the process of control. The pure watchfulness of cinemagoers mimics the controlling relationship diabetic characters must endure.\"<ref name=\"ferguson194\u2013195\" /> Though mother and daughter bond in the film, the mother actively monitors her daughter's health. Ferguson says, \"''Panic Room''{{'}}s emphasis on vision and technology necessitates a paternalistic, monitoring attitude towards the diabetic character.\"<ref name=\"ferguson196\" /> He also notes that the glucometer parallels the overarching surveillance system in the film in being read \"excessively\".<ref name=\"ferguson200\u2013201\" />\n\n===Approach to mortality===\nAcademic John Kitterman says audiences see ''Panic Room'' as a way to confront their fears and to achieve catharsis, but he argues that the film cannot provide that experience authentically.<ref name=\"kitterman239\" /> He notes that the film's protagonist Meg Altman is reminded by the panic room of author [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who wrote several short stories related to [[premature burial]]. Kitterman highlights one story, \"[[The Premature Burial]]\", as synonymous with ''Panic Room''.<ref name=\"kitterman237\" /> He says, in both works, \"It is in the representing or acting out of such fears of being buried alive or being the victim of a home invasion that the protagonist actually calls for that trauma to happen.\"<ref name=\"kitterman238\u2013239\" /> He says that Meg's nervous recognition of the panic room guarantees that her fear will come to pass.<ref name=\"kitterman239\" /> Though the home \"looks like a mausoleum\", the combination of the panic room's being able to monitor all the rooms and the unbounded movement of the film's camera leads audiences to believe they have some control over confronting their fears.<ref name=\"kitterman240\" /> Kitterman says the confrontation is unauthentic because of the function of [[Jacques Lacan]]'s [[The Symbolic|symbolic order]], \"We can never find what we are looking for because truth and reality exist on a different plane of discovery... Truth is hidden in the symbolic order, and no panoptical vision is going to reveal it to us.\"<ref name=\"kitterman240\u2013241\" /> Kitterman says the film hides the truth of mortality, especially by making everywhere in the film visible to audiences. He concludes, \"[Fincher] hides the truth behind a veil of visibility, using the camera to create a hegemony of vision that brainwashes us all into believing that what we are seeing is real. But the real of death cannot be symbolized.\"<ref name=\"kitterman241\" />\n\n==Production==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[David Fincher]] \u2013 director\n*[[David Koepp]] \u2013 screenwriter, producer\n*[[Ce\u00e1n Chaffin]] \u2013 producer\n*Judy Hofflund \u2013 producer\n*[[Gavin Polone]] \u2013 producer\n*[[Howard Shore]] \u2013 composer\n*[[Conrad W.

Fincher included as producer Ce\u00e1n Chaffin, with whom he had worked on commercials and music videos. Fincher also included in his initial crew people with whom he had worked before: cinematographer Darius Khondji, production designer Arthur Max, costume designer Michael Kaplan, and editors James Haygood and Angus Wall.<ref name=\"swallow149\" />\n\nFincher envisioned ''Panic Room'' as a [[wikt:popcorn movie|popcorn movie]] about survival. His previous film ''Fight Club'' had 400 scenes and 100 locations, so he wanted to simplify the production of ''Panic Room''.<ref name=\"swallow148\" /> To this end, he wanted to focus production on a single set and to plan the scenes and shots thoroughly before the start of filming. Despite the preparation, he experienced difficulty in production with changes in the cast and the crew as well as the inherent inflexibility of his initial planning.<ref name=\"swallow145\" />\n\n===Development===\nScreenwriter David Koepp was inspired by news coverage in 2000 about how [[safe room]]s were becoming prevalent among the wealthy living in urban areas. He sold the script to [[Sony Pictures]] for {{nowrap|$4 million}}.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> Before Fincher's involvement, director [[Ridley Scott]] was briefly connected to the project,<ref name=\"swallow149\" /> and actor-director [[Forest Whitaker]] studied the script before declining the opportunity to direct.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> Fincher said he was interested in the script's omniscience and that he was reminded of \"the specific subjectivity\" of ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954).<ref name=\"swallow149\" /> He also saw ''Panic Room'' as a cross between ''Rear Window'' and ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), though he was concerned \"a modern audience\" would compare ''Panic Room'' more to ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990) than to ''Rear Window''.<ref name=\"swallow168\u2013169\" />\n\nFincher also saw ''Panic Room'' as a crime thriller similar to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), where money is \"an object that everyone's after for the wrong reasons\".<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> The director was also interested in the story's conciseness of happening in one place and in one night,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> and how the screenplay was well-laid out to let the director decide a variety of shots and use of set-pieces.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> Fincher also saw the project as a way to be \"in lock-step with the audience\" in a change of pace from his previous films.<ref name=\"swallow149\u2013150\" />\n\nKoepp's screenplay emphasized pace over exposition. Koepp and Fincher agreed to streamline the film so the opening would introduce the characters as soon as possible. Fincher also sought to lay out the film so audiences could see characters make plans and thus be ahead of them, calling the tense foresight \"a very cinematic notion\".<ref name=\"swallow166\" /> He wanted to track the different characters' agendas and to also keep scenes chronological, so he set up \"computer-generated motion-control shots\" to move the camera around the set. He planned scenes in which parallel scenes could be seen through the panic room's video monitors and also intercut between different characters.<ref name=\"swallow166\u2013167\" /> The final screenplay was similar in outline to the original one; there were minor changes in dialogue and specific moments, especially in the interaction between Meg and Sarah Altman due to Foster replacing Kidman.<ref name=\"swallow169\" /> Explicit mention of Sarah's diabetes, such as the emergency syringe containing [[glucagon]], were removed from the dialogue. Careful beverage intake, refrigerated medicine bottles, and Sarah's [[glucometer]] watch were intended as evidence of her diabetes.<ref name=\"swallow169\u2013170\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe house was built on a soundstage on a Raleigh Studios lot. The set was designed by production designer Arthur Max,<ref name=\"swallow158\" /> and it cost {{nowrap|$6 million}} to build.<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> The panic room was {{convert|6|ft|m}} by {{convert|14|ft|m}}. Three versions of the room were built so Fincher could film scenes from multiple angles.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> A 3D computer model of the set on the soundstage was designed. Fincher, who had done pre-visualization for ''Fight Club'', used the model to design shots and decide their sequence.<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> The computer model also enabled the camera to have \"total freedom to travel\" inside the house. Fincher said, \"What we were just trying to do with CG was to say, there's no camera operator, there's no crew, there's no track, and the camera can go everywhere.\"<ref name=\"swallow158\" /> The crew applied [[photogrammetry]]\u2014\"mapping still images over the surface of computer-generated 'sets'\".<ref name=\"swallow163\" /> The filming schedule was also shortened since camera setups could be evaluated and discarded virtually. Fincher had two-thirds of ''Panic Room''{{'}}s shots planned before the start of filming. Director [[Steven Soderbergh]] reviewed Fincher's test footage and warned him that excessive planning would make actual production difficult for him.<ref name=\"swallow151\" />\n\nFincher sought to light his film less than most other films; he believed darkness contributed to the scare factor. Entering production, he initially planned to film the first half of the film in near-total darkness but decided that it required too much patience from audiences. Instead, he chose a \"shadowy ambience\" as a backdrop for Meg and Sarah Altman.<ref name=\"swallow163\" />\n\n===Filming===\nCasting began in 2000, and [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]] were cast as Meg and Sarah Altman, the film's mother and daughter. [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]] were also cast as the film's burglars.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> In December 2000,<ref name=\"abcnews.go.com\">[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=110382 ABC News]</ref> before the start of filming, Panettiere left the project, and was replaced by [[Kristen Stewart]].<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> Filming began in January 2001.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Shortly after the start of filming, cinematographer Darius Khondji was fired from the film. Khondji said he was fired after a conflict with a crew member that he did not want to name, but David Fincher said he and Khondji could not agree \"on aspects of production\".<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> Much of the film was already planned in pre-production, and Khondji could not be given flexibility. Fincher replaced Khondji with Conrad Hall, Jr., with whom he found \"a balance\".<ref name=\"swallow157\" /> Khondji said he supported Hall as his replacement.<ref name=\"swallow156\" />\n\nAfter two weeks of filming, at the end of January 2001,<ref name=\"abcnews.go.com\"/> Kidman was injured on set. An x-ray revealed a hairline fracture underneath one of her knee joints. The fracture was an injury from Kidman's filming of ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), and the fracture had never fully healed. When Kidman left the project, Fincher continued filming scenes that did not include her character. During the same time of Kidman's departure, the [[Writers Guild of America]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] were threatening to strike over contractual disputes, so Fincher was pressured to re-cast the role of Meg Altman before it took place. Since the film was early in production, Fincher was ready to shut down, but the studio wanted to continue production and find a replacement. If the studio had shut down production permanently, it would have collected {{nowrap|$3 million}} from insurance. If production was shut down then restarted, it would cost the studio {{nowrap|$10 million}}, necessitating a quick replacement for Kidman.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Rumored actors included [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Angelina Jolie]], and [[Robin Wright]]. [[Jodie Foster]] was previously occupied with directing duties of ''Flora Plum'' before its star [[Russell Crowe]] was injured and left the project, leading to that production's shutdown.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> To join ''Panic Room'', Foster also stepped down as head of the awards jury at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"swallow152\u2013153\" />{{#tag:ref|James Swallow says Cannes festival organizers were reportedly unhappy with Foster's decision to step down and as a result, they removed ''[[The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys]]'', which she produced and starred in, from the festival schedule.<ref name=\"swallow152\u2013153\" />|group=\"nb\"}} Foster had a week to prepare for her role before filming resumed.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\nFive weeks after Foster began filming ''Panic Room'', she learned she was pregnant. She informed Fincher and his producer Chaffin of her pregnancy, and they decided to continue filming. Fincher did not want to rush production, so Foster changed her wardrobe from a tank top to a heavy sweater to disguise indications of her pregnancy. For action scenes, stunt double Jill Stokesberry replaced Foster.<ref name=\"swallow154\" />\n\nIn the film's progression, the house degrades in quality, so Fincher filmed scenes in continuity as the set changed.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> He also filmed many sequences twice due to their near-parallel appearance on the panic room's video monitors.<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> Editor Wall said there were {{nowrap|2,073 set-ups}} for the film with most set-ups having two cameras.<ref name=\"swallow160\" /> One repeated take was when Raoul attempts to break into the panic room through the plaster ceiling below it. The plaster took 45 minutes to replace, so combined with repeated takes, a scene that was an eighth of a page in the script took two days to film.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> Another repeated take was one five-second shot being filmed over a hundred times: Meg being attacked by Raoul and dropping Sarah's medical kit. The shot was repeated so it would look like Meg did not toss the kit but instead lost it. Simultaneously, the kit needed to land in frame and in focus for the audience. Fincher argued for repeated takes so he could combine performances by the actors for \"fluid\" scenes. He also repeated takes with Stewart to ensure that her acting would be comparable to Foster's veteran performance.<ref name=\"swallow155\" />\n\nThe studio planned to release ''Panic Room'' in February 2002, but it determined that production could not be completed by then.<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> Executives reviewed dailies of the film's opening scene and did not like Foster \"hiding her stomach under a coat and purse\".<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> (Foster was also suffering from a sprained hip from distended ligaments due to her pregnancy.)<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> The studio suspended production until after Foster's childbirth and rescheduled for the film to be released in March 2002. Foster gave birth in September 2001, and she returned to perform re-shoots, including the opening scene. She also returned two months later for additional filming.<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> Filming was completed in November 2001.<ref name=\"swallow170\" /> Columbia Pictures screened the film for test audiences, who rated poorly the ending with the SWAT raid and Burnham's capture. By the screening, the set had been deconstructed due to storage costs, and Fincher estimated that it would cost {{nowrap|$3 million}} to rebuild enough of the set to reshoot the ending. Instead, editors Haygood and Wall revisited Burnham's scenes and chose takes in which the character would appear less sympathetic. The final production budget for ''Panic Room'' was {{nowrap|$48 million}}.<ref name=\"swallow156\" />\n\n===Visual and practical effects===\n<!--{{Rquote|right|[The title sequence] was just graphic fun. I was playing around. For years we'd joke: 'When you see the credits for a movie, what is that type? Is it supposed to be a projection over the scene or is it supposed to be there? Let's ask that question.' So we started playing around with that idea. The sequence takes a trip up the island of Manhattan through quick shots of buildings to get the idea of, 'You're downtown, you're midtown, you're traversing the park, you're moving to the west side: here's where the story takes place.' This was the same idea as the title sequence to ''West Side Story'', so we had to do something a little different.|David Fincher<ref name=\"Perkins\"/> }}\n-->\nA seamless shot at the beginning of ''Panic Room'' took nine days to film on set but took several months to complete in post-production. The shot was a combination of camera footage and computer-generated effects. Koepp originally wrote the opening scene to be a series of shots that would zero in on the brownstone house, but Fincher instead chose a sequence of landmarks in New York City with credits hovering in front of them before the sequence transited seamlessly to introduce the film's main characters.<ref name=\"swallow164\" /> The opening titles were inspired by those seen in ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"swallow168\u2013169\" />\n\nThe scene of Burnham's arrest also used computer-generated effects. Several scenes also involved practical effects: Junior's injuries from a flaming gas burn and Stephen Altman's bloodied, beaten self. A team of puppeteers was used to move Stephen's sticking-out collarbone. Fincher also sent the film reel to be digitally color-corrected as he had done for ''Fight Club'' and ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''.<ref name=\"swallow165\" />\n\n==Theatrical run==\nColumbia Pictures marketed ''Panic Room'' as being produced by the same director who produced ''Seven'' and ''Fight Club''. Fincher disagreed with the approach because he believed that ''Panic Room'' did not match the tone of his previous two films and that it would not appeal to the same audiences. He believed ''Panic Room'' would appeal more to audiences who saw ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' (1999). He also disagreed with the studio's marketing materials for ''Panic Room'', which advertised it as \"the most terrifying movie ever made\". Fincher also argued with the studio about the poster design, which he believed reflected the film's themes, and the studio relented in publishing Fincher's poster.<ref name=\"swallow171\" />\n\n''Panic Room'' had its world premiere on {{nowrap|March 18}}, 2002 in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite web | author=Staff | url=http://www.life.com/celebrity-pictures/2254752/panic-room-premiere | title=Panic Room Premiere | work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] | date=March 18, 2002 }}</ref> Fincher refused to edit the film to receive a PG-13 rating (parental guidance for children under 13) from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]],<ref name=\"swallow170\" /> so the MPAA gave the film an R rating (restricted to filmgoers at least 17 years old) for violence and language.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.filmratings.com/filmRatings_cara/reports/s10637929.htm | title=Panic Room | work=filmratings.com | publisher=[[Motion Picture Association of America]] | accessdate=December 14, 2012 }}</ref> It was commercially released in the United States and Canada on March 29, 2002.

The film stars [[Jodie Foster]] and [[Kristen Stewart]] as a mother and daughter whose new home is invaded by burglars, played by [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]]. The script was written by [[David Koepp]].\n\nKoepp's screenplay was inspired by news coverage in 2000 about [[panic room]]s. The film was Fincher's fifth feature film, following ''[[Fight Club]]'' (1999). Fincher and Koepp brought together a crew of people with whom each had worked before. The house and its panic room were built on a Raleigh Studios lot. [[Nicole Kidman]] was originally cast as the mother, but she left after aggravating a previous injury. Her departure threatened the completion of the film, but Foster quickly replaced Kidman. The filmmakers used computer-generated imagery to create the illusion of the film camera moving through the house's rooms. Foster became pregnant during the shooting schedule, so filming was suspended until after she gave birth. The film's production cost {{nowrap|$48 million}}.\n\nThe film was commercially released in the United States and Canada on {{nowrap|March 29}}, 2002. The film grossed {{nowrap|$30 million}} on its opening weekend. In the United States and Canada, it grossed {{nowrap|$96.4 million}}. In other territories, it grossed {{nowrap|$100 million}} for a worldwide total of {{nowrap|$196.4 million}}. Critics generally praised the film. ''Panic Room'' has been assessed for its portrayal of childhood and [[feminism]], the elements of [[video surveillance]] and [[diabetes]], and its thematic approach to mortality.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nRecently divorced Meg Altman, and her eleven-year-old daughter, Sarah, move into a four-story [[brownstone]] in  [[New York City]]'s [[Upper West Side]]. The house's previous owner, a reclusive millionaire, installed a \"[[safe room|panic room]]\" to protect the occupants from intruders. The room is protected by concrete and steel on all sides and a thick steel door and has an extensive security system with multiple [[surveillance cameras]], a public address (P.A.) system, and a separate phone line. On the night the two move into the house, Junior, the previous owner's grandson; Burnham, an employee of the residence's security company; and Raoul, a vicious hitman Junior recruited, break in. They are after $3&nbsp;million in [[bearer bond]]s locked inside a floor safe in the panic room.\n\nJunior has miscalculated when the new occupants would move in, but he convinces a reluctant Burnham to continue the heist. Meg wakes up and happens to see the three men on the panic room video monitors. Meg gets Sarah and they get into the panic room, barely locking the door in time. They are unable to call for help because the dedicated phone line is not hooked up. To force the two out, Burnham pumps propane gas into the room's air vents. However, a trigger-happy Raoul dangerously increases the amount. Unable to seal the vents, Meg ignites the gas, while she and Sarah cover themselves with fireproof blankets, causing an explosion which vents into the room outside and causes a fire, giving Junior a 2nd-degree burn. The Altmans make several attempts to summon help, including unsuccessfully signaling a neighbor with a flashlight through a ventilation pipe. Meg taps into the main telephone line and calls her ex-husband, Stephen, but the intruders cut the main line, abruptly ending the call.\n\nAll attempts to get into the room fail, and Junior gives up on the robbery while letting slip that there is far more money in the safe than he indicated. As Junior is about to leave, Raoul fatally shoots him, then forces Burnham to finish the robbery. Stephen arrives and immediately is taken hostage. Raoul severely beats him, making sure Meg can see it on the security camera. Sarah, a [[diabetes|diabetic]], suffers a seizure. Her emergency [[glucagon]] syringes are kept in her bedroom. Knowing that Meg wants something outside, Raoul tricks Meg into thinking it is safe to temporarily leave the panic room. While she goes to get Sarah's med kit, Burnham finds Sarah nearly unconscious on the floor. After retrieving the med kit, Meg struggles briefly with Raoul, who is thrown into the panic room, his gun knocked from his hand. Meg throws the kit into the panic room just as Burnham locks himself, Raoul, and Sarah inside, crushing Raoul's fingers in the sliding steel door. Meg, who now has the gun, begs the intruders over the PA system to give Sarah the injection. Burnham, not wanting to hurt anyone, injects Sarah, telling her he only participated in the robbery to help his child. He informs Meg that Sarah is alright.\n\nFollowing up on Stephen's earlier 911 call, two policemen arrive at the door. To protect Sarah, Meg convinces the officers to leave. Burnham opens the safe and finds $22&nbsp;million in bearer bonds inside. As the burglars attempt to leave using Sarah as a hostage, Meg rigs booby traps, leading to an ambush where she knocks Raoul over a banister and into a stairwell with a sledgehammer. As Burnham flees, Raoul crawls back and overpowers Meg, preparing to bludgeon her with the sledgehammer. Burnham, hearing Sarah screaming, rushes back and shoots Raoul then runs off. The police, alerted by Meg's earlier odd behavior, arrive in force and apprehend Burnham, who drops the bearer bonds that scatter in the wind.\n\nLater, Meg and Sarah, recovered from their harrowing ordeal, search the newspaper for a new home.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n!

[[Nicole Kidman]] was originally cast as Meg,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> but she left the project due to a knee injury.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Foster, who almost joined the cast of Fincher's 1997 film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]'', replaced Kidman. Fincher said Kidman's portrayal was \"about glamour and physicality\", while Foster's portrayal was \"more political\". Meg was originally written to be helpless, but with Foster's involvement, the character was revised to be stronger.<ref name=\"swallow153\" /> The casting change also led to Meg's being rewritten to be similar to her daughter, whereas Meg had been different from her before.<ref name=\"swallow153\" /> Foster became pregnant soon after she started filming. She told the filmmakers, and they decided to keep filming her scenes but with a wardrobe that would conceal her pregnancy.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> Studio executives did not like the dailies and suspended production until Foster gave birth and returned to perform re-shoots.<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> Foster was reportedly paid {{nowrap|$12 million}} for her role.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\n[[Kristen Stewart]] stars as Sarah, Meg's diabetic daughter. [[Hayden Panettiere]] was originally cast as Sarah,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> but when she left the project toward the end of 2000, Stewart was cast in the role.<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> ''Panic Room'' was Stewart's second feature film after ''[[The Safety of Objects]]'' (2001). <ref name=\"swallow161\" /> When Kidman was cast as Meg, Fincher said Stewart was \"to complement [Kidman's portrayal], to be her antithesis, tomboyish, androgynous, dismissive, a teenager at ten years old. It was about the daughter being a parent to her mother.\"<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> When Foster replaced Kidman, the character Meg was rewritten so she and Sarah would be similar.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\n[[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]] star as the film's burglars, Burnham, Junior, and Raoul, respectively. Whitaker's character Burnham was originally written to be \"a slick, technical type\" and the designer of the panic room in Meg and Sarah's home. Fincher did not think a designer could be persuaded to break into a home, so he rewrote the character to be a [[blue-collar worker]] who installs panic rooms for a living. The director told Whitaker to watch ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'' (1948) and to emulate [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character. Whitaker said he liked Burnham's \"conflicted\" nature and preferred it over Raoul's villainy.<ref name=\"swallow162\" /> Raoul was originally written to be \"a giant scary hulking guy\", but Fincher rewrote him to be \"this wiry, mean kind of ex-con white trash guy\".<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> In one revised instance, Raoul punches Meg instead of slapping her to be reinforced as \"an appalling character\".<ref name=\"swallow168\" /> The role of Raoul was originally offered to [[Maynard James Keenan]], whom Fincher had directed in a music video for [[A Perfect Circle]]'s \"[[Judith (song)|Judith]]\". Keenan was too busy as the lead singer for [[Tool (band)|Tool]],<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> so Fincher then offered the role to Yoakam, knowing him from his performance in ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (1996). For the role of Junior, Fincher cast Leto, who was in the cast of Fincher's previous film ''Fight Club'' (1999).<ref name=\"swallow162\" /> As part of atypical class division, Junior is \"the uptown rich kid\", where Burnham is blue-collar, and Raoul is undefinable.<ref name=\"swallow167\" />\n\nPatrick Bauchau had a minor role as Meg's ex-husband Stephen. Kidman, though she left the primary role due to her knee injury, had an uncredited off-screen role as the voice of Stephen's supermodel girlfriend.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> Screenwriter [[Andrew Kevin Walker]], who was a credited writer for ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'' and ''The Game'' and an uncredited writer for ''Fight Club'', had a cameo in ''Panic Room'' as a sleepy neighbor.<ref name=\"swallow163\" />\n\n==Analysis==\n\n===Conspiracy thrillers and feminism===\nAcademic Jyotsna Kapur identifies ''Panic Room'' as one of several American conspiracy thrillers in the 2000s that re-cast the subject of childhood as \"one of horror and alarm\",{{#tag:ref|Kapur's other examples of such thrillers include: ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004), ''[[The Forgotten (2004 film)|The Forgotten]]'' (2004), ''[[Flightplan]]'' (2005), ''[[Syriana]]'' (2005), ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' (2006), ''[[Children of Men]]'' (2006), and ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"kapur44\" />|group=\"nb\"}} where it had previously been a subject of celebration in family films dating back to the early 1980s.<ref name=\"kapur44\" /> Kapur also says the depiction of paranoia in the decade's conspiracy thrillers is divided by gender. She describes the male protagonist as \"an idealized subject who thinks fast on his feet and cuts through fear to find the conspirators\". In contrast, the female protagonist \"gives in to her fear, turns delusional and vulnerable to suggestion\"; Kapur cites Meg Altman in ''Panic Room'' as such a depiction with her divorcee status and her residence in a home too big for her and her daughter Sarah. The academic says calling this depiction merely a sexist stereotype is too dismissive: \"It is logical that anxieties around the home and loss of children would privilege women because the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] has remained a gendered space.\" Kapur recalls 1940s films wherein a woman enters the husband's home as a stranger, with \"the house and the husband as sources of dependence and dread\".{{#tag:ref|Such 1940s films include ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), ''[[Gaslight (1944 film)|Gaslight]]'' (1944), ''[[The Two Mrs. Carrolls]]'' (1947), ''[[Secret Beyond the Door]]'' (1948), and ''[[Caught (1949 film)|Caught]]'' (1949).<ref name=\"kapur47\u201349\" />|group=\"nb\"}} She contrasts them with films like ''Panic Room'', in which the female protagonists instead defend against dangerous intruders. She writes, \"They are not economically dependent on the marriage. Yet they portray for most of the film an image of feminized vulnerability, replaying the racist trope of diminutive white women in need of protection from outsider threats.\"<ref name=\"kapur47\u201349\" />\n\n===Medicine and technology as themes===\n''Panic Room'' is one of several films at the turn of the 21st century that use video surveillance as a key element.{{#tag:ref|Kammerer also references the following films: ''[[The End of Violence]]'' (1997), ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), ''[[Enemy of the State (film)|Enemy of the State]]'' (1998), ''[[Snake Eyes (film)|Snake Eyes]]'' (1998), and ''[[The Truman Show]]'' (1998). He also mentions older examples: ''[[Peeping Tom (1960 film)|Peeping Tom]]'' (1960) and ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]'' (1983).<ref name=\"kammerer468\" />|group=\"nb\"}} In particular, video surveillance is featured to illustrate aspects of a \"[[Mass surveillance|surveillance society]]\".<ref name=\"kammerer468\" /> The home is wired with a [[closed-circuit television]] system, and the images are displayed in the home's panic room. Since the burglars want to access the safe in the panic room where Meg and her daughter Sarah are hiding, there is an irreconcilable contradiction of freedom and safety. Dietmar Kammerer says there is no closed system within the home for the characters: \"There is always communication; every action provokes a reaction.\"<ref name=\"kammerer471\" /> In contrast, the film's \"camera eye\" can travel unimpeded throughout the home, passing through walls. The surveillance footage in the film is never the camera eye; the camera eye itself observes the footage on the monitors. Of the cameras, Kammerer says, they are \"Extremely mobile, but unstable: the surveillance technology in ''Panic Room'' is useful and harmful, good and evil at once.\" When the cameras are destroyed, Meg and Sarah are able to overcome the burglars. Kammerer says the cameras reflect ambivalence in the film, between \"freedom and security, openness and closedness\".<ref name=\"kammerer472\" />\n\nIn the film, Sarah is diabetic. Kevin L. Ferguson says, \"With diabetes, this self-aware focus on the ethics of the body is drawn sharply by films that also raise the older form of direct, punitive power. This is the reason why diabetics appear with frequency in films involving criminality and law.\" In a review of nearly forty films with diabetes as a key element,<ref name=\"ferguson192\u2013193\" /> ''Panic Room'' is one of the only three that shows a [[glucometer]] (a device diabetics use to measure their [[glucose]]; Sarah wears a glucometer as a watch.) Sarah's diabetes in the film is never explicitly outlined for audiences, but they hear dialogue about moderating beverage intake and see the glucometer count down. Ferguson says, \"The glucometer arranges the viewer's acknowledgement of diabetic selfcare, thus implicating the viewer in the process of control. The pure watchfulness of cinemagoers mimics the controlling relationship diabetic characters must endure.\"<ref name=\"ferguson194\u2013195\" /> Though mother and daughter bond in the film, the mother actively monitors her daughter's health. Ferguson says, \"''Panic Room''{{'}}s emphasis on vision and technology necessitates a paternalistic, monitoring attitude towards the diabetic character.\"<ref name=\"ferguson196\" /> He also notes that the glucometer parallels the overarching surveillance system in the film in being read \"excessively\".<ref name=\"ferguson200\u2013201\" />\n\n===Approach to mortality===\nAcademic John Kitterman says audiences see ''Panic Room'' as a way to confront their fears and to achieve catharsis, but he argues that the film cannot provide that experience authentically.<ref name=\"kitterman239\" /> He notes that the film's protagonist Meg Altman is reminded by the panic room of author [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who wrote several short stories related to [[premature burial]]. Kitterman highlights one story, \"[[The Premature Burial]]\", as synonymous with ''Panic Room''.<ref name=\"kitterman237\" /> He says, in both works, \"It is in the representing or acting out of such fears of being buried alive or being the victim of a home invasion that the protagonist actually calls for that trauma to happen.\"<ref name=\"kitterman238\u2013239\" /> He says that Meg's nervous recognition of the panic room guarantees that her fear will come to pass.<ref name=\"kitterman239\" /> Though the home \"looks like a mausoleum\", the combination of the panic room's being able to monitor all the rooms and the unbounded movement of the film's camera leads audiences to believe they have some control over confronting their fears.<ref name=\"kitterman240\" /> Kitterman says the confrontation is unauthentic because of the function of [[Jacques Lacan]]'s [[The Symbolic|symbolic order]], \"We can never find what we are looking for because truth and reality exist on a different plane of discovery... Truth is hidden in the symbolic order, and no panoptical vision is going to reveal it to us.\"<ref name=\"kitterman240\u2013241\" /> Kitterman says the film hides the truth of mortality, especially by making everywhere in the film visible to audiences. He concludes, \"[Fincher] hides the truth behind a veil of visibility, using the camera to create a hegemony of vision that brainwashes us all into believing that what we are seeing is real. But the real of death cannot be symbolized.\"<ref name=\"kitterman241\" />\n\n==Production==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[David Fincher]] \u2013 director\n*[[David Koepp]] \u2013 screenwriter, producer\n*[[Ce\u00e1n Chaffin]] \u2013 producer\n*Judy Hofflund \u2013 producer\n*[[Gavin Polone]] \u2013 producer\n*[[Howard Shore]] \u2013 composer\n*[[Conrad W.

Fincher included as producer Ce\u00e1n Chaffin, with whom he had worked on commercials and music videos. Fincher also included in his initial crew people with whom he had worked before: cinematographer Darius Khondji, production designer Arthur Max, costume designer Michael Kaplan, and editors James Haygood and Angus Wall.<ref name=\"swallow149\" />\n\nFincher envisioned ''Panic Room'' as a [[wikt:popcorn movie|popcorn movie]] about survival. His previous film ''Fight Club'' had 400 scenes and 100 locations, so he wanted to simplify the production of ''Panic Room''.<ref name=\"swallow148\" /> To this end, he wanted to focus production on a single set and to plan the scenes and shots thoroughly before the start of filming. Despite the preparation, he experienced difficulty in production with changes in the cast and the crew as well as the inherent inflexibility of his initial planning.<ref name=\"swallow145\" />\n\n===Development===\nScreenwriter David Koepp was inspired by news coverage in 2000 about how [[safe room]]s were becoming prevalent among the wealthy living in urban areas. He sold the script to [[Sony Pictures]] for {{nowrap|$4 million}}.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> Before Fincher's involvement, director [[Ridley Scott]] was briefly connected to the project,<ref name=\"swallow149\" /> and actor-director [[Forest Whitaker]] studied the script before declining the opportunity to direct.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> Fincher said he was interested in the script's omniscience and that he was reminded of \"the specific subjectivity\" of ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954).<ref name=\"swallow149\" /> He also saw ''Panic Room'' as a cross between ''Rear Window'' and ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), though he was concerned \"a modern audience\" would compare ''Panic Room'' more to ''[[Home Alone]]'' (1990) than to ''Rear Window''.<ref name=\"swallow168\u2013169\" />\n\nFincher also saw ''Panic Room'' as a crime thriller similar to ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), where money is \"an object that everyone's after for the wrong reasons\".<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> The director was also interested in the story's conciseness of happening in one place and in one night,<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> and how the screenplay was well-laid out to let the director decide a variety of shots and use of set-pieces.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> Fincher also saw the project as a way to be \"in lock-step with the audience\" in a change of pace from his previous films.<ref name=\"swallow149\u2013150\" />\n\nKoepp's screenplay emphasized pace over exposition. Koepp and Fincher agreed to streamline the film so the opening would introduce the characters as soon as possible. Fincher also sought to lay out the film so audiences could see characters make plans and thus be ahead of them, calling the tense foresight \"a very cinematic notion\".<ref name=\"swallow166\" /> He wanted to track the different characters' agendas and to also keep scenes chronological, so he set up \"computer-generated motion-control shots\" to move the camera around the set. He planned scenes in which parallel scenes could be seen through the panic room's video monitors and also intercut between different characters.<ref name=\"swallow166\u2013167\" /> The final screenplay was similar in outline to the original one; there were minor changes in dialogue and specific moments, especially in the interaction between Meg and Sarah Altman due to Foster replacing Kidman.<ref name=\"swallow169\" /> Explicit mention of Sarah's diabetes, such as the emergency syringe containing [[glucagon]], were removed from the dialogue. Careful beverage intake, refrigerated medicine bottles, and Sarah's [[glucometer]] watch were intended as evidence of her diabetes.<ref name=\"swallow169\u2013170\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nThe house was built on a soundstage on a Raleigh Studios lot. The set was designed by production designer Arthur Max,<ref name=\"swallow158\" /> and it cost {{nowrap|$6 million}} to build.<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> The panic room was {{convert|6|ft|m}} by {{convert|14|ft|m}}. Three versions of the room were built so Fincher could film scenes from multiple angles.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> A 3D computer model of the set on the soundstage was designed. Fincher, who had done pre-visualization for ''Fight Club'', used the model to design shots and decide their sequence.<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> The computer model also enabled the camera to have \"total freedom to travel\" inside the house. Fincher said, \"What we were just trying to do with CG was to say, there's no camera operator, there's no crew, there's no track, and the camera can go everywhere.\"<ref name=\"swallow158\" /> The crew applied [[photogrammetry]]\u2014\"mapping still images over the surface of computer-generated 'sets'\".<ref name=\"swallow163\" /> The filming schedule was also shortened since camera setups could be evaluated and discarded virtually. Fincher had two-thirds of ''Panic Room''{{'}}s shots planned before the start of filming. Director [[Steven Soderbergh]] reviewed Fincher's test footage and warned him that excessive planning would make actual production difficult for him.<ref name=\"swallow151\" />\n\nFincher sought to light his film less than most other films; he believed darkness contributed to the scare factor. Entering production, he initially planned to film the first half of the film in near-total darkness but decided that it required too much patience from audiences. Instead, he chose a \"shadowy ambience\" as a backdrop for Meg and Sarah Altman.<ref name=\"swallow163\" />\n\n===Filming===\nCasting began in 2000, and [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]] were cast as Meg and Sarah Altman, the film's mother and daughter. [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Jared Leto]], and [[Dwight Yoakam]] were also cast as the film's burglars.<ref name=\"swallow150\" /> In December 2000,<ref name=\"abcnews.go.com\">[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=110382 ABC News]</ref> before the start of filming, Panettiere left the project, and was replaced by [[Kristen Stewart]].<ref name=\"swallow151\" /> Filming began in January 2001.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Shortly after the start of filming, cinematographer Darius Khondji was fired from the film. Khondji said he was fired after a conflict with a crew member that he did not want to name, but David Fincher said he and Khondji could not agree \"on aspects of production\".<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> Much of the film was already planned in pre-production, and Khondji could not be given flexibility. Fincher replaced Khondji with Conrad Hall, Jr., with whom he found \"a balance\".<ref name=\"swallow157\" /> Khondji said he supported Hall as his replacement.<ref name=\"swallow156\" />\n\nAfter two weeks of filming, at the end of January 2001,<ref name=\"abcnews.go.com\"/> Kidman was injured on set. An x-ray revealed a hairline fracture underneath one of her knee joints. The fracture was an injury from Kidman's filming of ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' (2001), and the fracture had never fully healed. When Kidman left the project, Fincher continued filming scenes that did not include her character. During the same time of Kidman's departure, the [[Writers Guild of America]] and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] were threatening to strike over contractual disputes, so Fincher was pressured to re-cast the role of Meg Altman before it took place. Since the film was early in production, Fincher was ready to shut down, but the studio wanted to continue production and find a replacement. If the studio had shut down production permanently, it would have collected {{nowrap|$3 million}} from insurance. If production was shut down then restarted, it would cost the studio {{nowrap|$10 million}}, necessitating a quick replacement for Kidman.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> Rumored actors included [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Angelina Jolie]], and [[Robin Wright]]. [[Jodie Foster]] was previously occupied with directing duties of ''Flora Plum'' before its star [[Russell Crowe]] was injured and left the project, leading to that production's shutdown.<ref name=\"swallow152\" /> To join ''Panic Room'', Foster also stepped down as head of the awards jury at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"swallow152\u2013153\" />{{#tag:ref|James Swallow says Cannes festival organizers were reportedly unhappy with Foster's decision to step down and as a result, they removed ''[[The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys]]'', which she produced and starred in, from the festival schedule.<ref name=\"swallow152\u2013153\" />|group=\"nb\"}} Foster had a week to prepare for her role before filming resumed.<ref name=\"swallow153\" />\n\nFive weeks after Foster began filming ''Panic Room'', she learned she was pregnant. She informed Fincher and his producer Chaffin of her pregnancy, and they decided to continue filming. Fincher did not want to rush production, so Foster changed her wardrobe from a tank top to a heavy sweater to disguise indications of her pregnancy. For action scenes, stunt double Jill Stokesberry replaced Foster.<ref name=\"swallow154\" />\n\nIn the film's progression, the house degrades in quality, so Fincher filmed scenes in continuity as the set changed.<ref name=\"swallow154\" /> He also filmed many sequences twice due to their near-parallel appearance on the panic room's video monitors.<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> Editor Wall said there were {{nowrap|2,073 set-ups}} for the film with most set-ups having two cameras.<ref name=\"swallow160\" /> One repeated take was when Raoul attempts to break into the panic room through the plaster ceiling below it. The plaster took 45 minutes to replace, so combined with repeated takes, a scene that was an eighth of a page in the script took two days to film.<ref name=\"swallow159\" /> Another repeated take was one five-second shot being filmed over a hundred times: Meg being attacked by Raoul and dropping Sarah's medical kit. The shot was repeated so it would look like Meg did not toss the kit but instead lost it. Simultaneously, the kit needed to land in frame and in focus for the audience. Fincher argued for repeated takes so he could combine performances by the actors for \"fluid\" scenes. He also repeated takes with Stewart to ensure that her acting would be comparable to Foster's veteran performance.<ref name=\"swallow155\" />\n\nThe studio planned to release ''Panic Room'' in February 2002, but it determined that production could not be completed by then.<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> Executives reviewed dailies of the film's opening scene and did not like Foster \"hiding her stomach under a coat and purse\".<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> (Foster was also suffering from a sprained hip from distended ligaments due to her pregnancy.)<ref name=\"swallow155\" /> The studio suspended production until after Foster's childbirth and rescheduled for the film to be released in March 2002. Foster gave birth in September 2001, and she returned to perform re-shoots, including the opening scene. She also returned two months later for additional filming.<ref name=\"swallow156\" /> Filming was completed in November 2001.<ref name=\"swallow170\" /> Columbia Pictures screened the film for test audiences, who rated poorly the ending with the SWAT raid and Burnham's capture. By the screening, the set had been deconstructed due to storage costs, and Fincher estimated that it would cost {{nowrap|$3 million}} to rebuild enough of the set to reshoot the ending. Instead, editors Haygood and Wall revisited Burnham's scenes and chose takes in which the character would appear less sympathetic. The final production budget for ''Panic Room'' was {{nowrap|$48 million}}.<ref name=\"swallow156\" />\n\n===Visual and practical effects===\n<!--{{Rquote|right|[The title sequence] was just graphic fun. I was playing around. For years we'd joke: 'When you see the credits for a movie, what is that type? Is it supposed to be a projection over the scene or is it supposed to be there? Let's ask that question.' So we started playing around with that idea. The sequence takes a trip up the island of Manhattan through quick shots of buildings to get the idea of, 'You're downtown, you're midtown, you're traversing the park, you're moving to the west side: here's where the story takes place.' This was the same idea as the title sequence to ''West Side Story'', so we had to do something a little different.|David Fincher<ref name=\"Perkins\"/> }}\n-->\nA seamless shot at the beginning of ''Panic Room'' took nine days to film on set but took several months to complete in post-production. The shot was a combination of camera footage and computer-generated effects. Koepp originally wrote the opening scene to be a series of shots that would zero in on the brownstone house, but Fincher instead chose a sequence of landmarks in New York City with credits hovering in front of them before the sequence transited seamlessly to introduce the film's main characters.<ref name=\"swallow164\" /> The opening titles were inspired by those seen in ''[[The Trouble with Harry]]'' (1955) and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959).<ref name=\"swallow168\u2013169\" />\n\nThe scene of Burnham's arrest also used computer-generated effects. Several scenes also involved practical effects: Junior's injuries from a flaming gas burn and Stephen Altman's bloodied, beaten self. A team of puppeteers was used to move Stephen's sticking-out collarbone. Fincher also sent the film reel to be digitally color-corrected as he had done for ''Fight Club'' and ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]''.<ref name=\"swallow165\" />\n\n==Theatrical run==\nColumbia Pictures marketed ''Panic Room'' as being produced by the same director who produced ''Seven'' and ''Fight Club''. Fincher disagreed with the approach because he believed that ''Panic Room'' did not match the tone of his previous two films and that it would not appeal to the same audiences. He believed ''Panic Room'' would appeal more to audiences who saw ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'' (1997) and ''[[The Bone Collector]]'' (1999). He also disagreed with the studio's marketing materials for ''Panic Room'', which advertised it as \"the most terrifying movie ever made\". Fincher also argued with the studio about the poster design, which he believed reflected the film's themes, and the studio relented in publishing Fincher's poster.<ref name=\"swallow171\" />\n\n''Panic Room'' had its world premiere on {{nowrap|March 18}}, 2002 in Los Angeles, California.<ref>{{cite web | author=Staff | url=http://www.life.com/celebrity-pictures/2254752/panic-room-premiere | title=Panic Room Premiere | work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] | date=March 18, 2002 }}</ref> Fincher refused to edit the film to receive a PG-13 rating (parental guidance for children under 13) from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]],<ref name=\"swallow170\" /> so the MPAA gave the film an R rating (restricted to filmgoers at least 17 years old) for violence and language.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.filmratings.com/filmRatings_cara/reports/s10637929.htm | title=Panic Room | work=filmratings.com | publisher=[[Motion Picture Association of America]] | accessdate=December 14, 2012 }}</ref> It was commercially released in the United States and Canada on March 29, 2002.
