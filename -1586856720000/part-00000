Before the show started, they were given seeds to grow and were told to bring them to the first filming day. They are also introduced to Mingki, the puppy that they have to take care of.\n\nThe PD gives them the show's rules, that are: besides rice, all other ingredients used must come from the farm; every meal would be made according to the production team's menu; preparation for winter will be undertaken during their free time; for the sake of integration into farming life, cell phones will be taken away.\n\nThe day after, Taecyeon tries to make [[sorghum]] rice for breakfast, but is unsuccessful because he missed one of the steps while making it. The guests are Seo-jin and Taecyeon's co-stars from ''Wonderful Days'' Youn Yuh-jung and Choi Hwa-jung. For the guests, Taecyeon and Seo-jin cook meat that they got from the production team.

They try to make egg rolls from an egg that one of the hens laid. They also build a hen house for the hens.\n\nIn the second segment of this episode, the guests are Seo-jin's co-stars from ''[[Grandpas Over Flowers]]'': Shin Goo and Baek Il-seob. Seo-jin and Taecyeon have to take care of them and cooked for them. They cook meat for them, so the harvesting sorghum debt is increasing.

They make [[bibimbap]] for lunch using three eggs that were laid by the hens.\n\nThey go to the market to buy jars for making [[kimchi]]. After they're done with the kimchi, they make roasted [[Gim (food)|laver]] and store some of them in the container.\n\nGuest star Kim Kwang-kyu arrives early in the morning; Seo-jin and Taecyeon are still sleeping and weren't able to welcome him properly. Kwang-kyu and Taecyeon harvest sorghum to pay Seo-jin and Taecyeon's meat debt, while Seo-jin washes dishes.
