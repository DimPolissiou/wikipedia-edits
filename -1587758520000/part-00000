The most notorious of all Legnica Piast rulers, thanks to his excellent financial politics his Duchy was expanded to the [[Oder River]], and he became the founder of the [[Duchy of Legnica-Wo\u0142\u00f3w-Brzeg]] ({{lang-de|Herzogtum Liegnitz-Wohlau-Brieg}}).\n\nHe was the second son of [[Frederick I of Legnica|Frederick I]], Duke of [[Chojn\u00f3w]]-[[O\u0142awa]]-[[Legnica]]-[[Brzeg]]-[[Lubin]], by his wife [[Ludmila of Pod\u011bbrady|Ludmila]], daughter of [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], King of [[Bohemia]].\n\n== Life ==\nA minor at the death of his father in 1488, Frederick II and his brothers John II and George I inherited Legnica, Chojn\u00f3w and Lubin under the regency of their mother, Dowager Duchess Ludmila, regnant Duchess of Brzeg and O\u0142awa as a [[dower]]. During his early years, the young Dukes spent some time in [[Prague]], at the court of King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II of Bohemia]].\n\nThe premature death of his older brother John II in 1495 left Frederick II as the Head of his house, but he remained under his mother's tutelage for another three years, until 1498, when he could take over by himself the government of Legnica. When George I also reached adulthood in 1505, both brothers decided to divide their domains. Frederick II kept Legnica and all the minor Duchies, and George I obtained Brzeg (which after the death of Ludmila in 1503 reverted to them with O\u0142awa) and Lubin.\n\nIn 1507, Frederick II made a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] where he is said to have been dubbed a [[Knight of the Holy Sepulchre]].\n\nDuring 1516-1526 he was [[Governor]] of [[Lower Silesia]].\n\nAfter George I's death in 1521 without issue, Frederick inherited Brzeg (Lubin was given to his sister-in-law as dower); this and the purchase of [[Wo\u0142\u00f3w]] in 1523 increased his finances and brought about in all his domains a time of prosperity. In the same year he mediated between the Teutonic Grand Master [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg]] and King [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]], for the possession of Prussia, which eventually became the secular Duchy of Prussia in 1525, with Albert as its Duke but under Polish sovereignty.\n\nFrom 1523 Frederick II was a strong supporter of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and founded in 1526 the first Protestant University in Legnica; however, because of the controversies between Luther and [[Caspar Schwenckfeld]], it wasn't until 1530 that the University finally opened. Despite his own conversion to Protestantism, Frederick II allowed his subjects to choose their own religion.\n\nDuring his reign, Frederick II worked for the order and cleanliness of his cities, established public lighting and paved streets.\n\nHis achievements also enhanced the defense of their Duchy. In his desire to change Legnica's layout he replaced numerous chapels and churches with city walls and fortress. Before the year 1521 there were in the suburbs about 15 churches and chapels, all these were demolished. Together with his wife Sophie, Frederick II also founded a bronze Army to defend the city.\n\nFrom 1540 to 1544 he obtained the Duchy of [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]] as a pledge. In 1542 his nephews Joachim, Henry II, John and George of Pod\u011bbrady pledged to him their [[Duchy of M\u00fcnsterberg|Duchy of Zi\u0119bice (M\u00fcnsterberg)]], which after Frederick II's death was taken by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Habsburg]].\n\nHe is one of the figures on the ''[[Prussian Homage (painting)|Prussian Homage]]'' painting by [[Jan Matejko]].\n\n== Marriages and Issue ==\nOn 21 November 1515 Frederick II married firstly Elisabeth (b. 13 November 1482 - 16 February 1517), daughter of King [[Casimir IV of Poland]]. They had one daughter:\n# Hedwig (b. and d. 2 February 1517).\n\nOn 14 November 1519 Frederick II married secondly [[Sophie of Brandenburg-Ansbach-Kulmbach]] (b. Ansbach, 10 March 1485 \u2013 d. Legnica, 14 May 1537), daughter of [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]] and niece of his first wife. They had three children:\n# [[Frederick III of Legnica|Frederick III]] (b. 22 February 1520 \u2013 d. Legnica, 15 December 1570).\n# [[George II the Pious]] (b. Legnica, 18 July 1523 \u2013 d.

The most notorious of all Legnica Piast rulers, thanks to his excellent financial politics his Duchy was expanded to the [[Oder River]], and he became the founder of the [[Duchy of Legnica-Wo\u0142\u00f3w-Brzeg]] ({{lang-de|Herzogtum Liegnitz-Wohlau-Brieg}}).\n\nHe was the second son of [[Frederick I of Legnica|Frederick I]], Duke of [[Chojn\u00f3w]]-[[O\u0142awa]]-[[Legnica]]-[[Brzeg]]-[[Lubin]], by his wife [[Ludmila of Pod\u011bbrady|Ludmila]], daughter of [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]], King of [[Bohemia]].\n\n== Life ==\nA minor at the death of his father in 1488, Frederick II and his brothers John II and George I inherited Legnica, Chojn\u00f3w and Lubin under the regency of their mother, Dowager Duchess Ludmila, regnant Duchess of Brzeg and O\u0142awa as a [[dower]]. During his early years, the young Dukes spent some time in [[Prague]], at the court of King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II of Bohemia]].\n\nThe premature death of his older brother John II in 1495 left Frederick II as the Head of his house, but he remained under his mother's tutelage for another three years, until 1498, when he could take over by himself the government of Legnica. When George I also reached adulthood in 1505, both brothers decided to divide their domains. Frederick II kept Legnica and all the minor Duchies, and George I obtained Brzeg (which after the death of Ludmila in 1503 reverted to them with O\u0142awa) and Lubin.\n\nIn 1507, Frederick II made a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]] where he is said to have been dubbed a [[Knight of the Holy Sepulchre]].\n\nDuring 1516-1526 he was [[Governor]] of [[Lower Silesia]].\n\nAfter George I's death in 1521 without issue, Frederick inherited Brzeg (Lubin was given to his sister-in-law as dower); this and the purchase of [[Wo\u0142\u00f3w]] in 1523 increased his finances and brought about in all his domains a time of prosperity. In the same year he mediated between the Teutonic Grand Master [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg]] and King [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund I of Poland]], for the possession of Prussia, which eventually became the secular Duchy of Prussia in 1525, with Albert as its Duke but under Polish sovereignty.\n\nFrom 1523 Frederick II was a strong supporter of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and founded in 1526 the first Protestant University in Legnica; however, because of the controversies between Luther and [[Caspar Schwenckfeld]], it wasn't until 1530 that the University finally opened. Despite his own conversion to Protestantism, Frederick II allowed his subjects to choose their own religion.\n\nDuring his reign, Frederick II worked for the order and cleanliness of his cities, established public lighting and paved streets.\n\nHis achievements also enhanced the defense of their Duchy. In his desire to change Legnica's layout he replaced numerous chapels and churches with city walls and fortress. Before the year 1521 there were in the suburbs about 15 churches and chapels, all these were demolished. Together with his wife Sophie, Frederick II also founded a bronze Army to defend the city.\n\nFrom 1540 to 1544 he obtained the Duchy of [[G\u0142og\u00f3w]] as a pledge. In 1542 his nephews Joachim, Henry II, John and George of Pod\u011bbrady pledged to him their [[Duchy of M\u00fcnsterberg|Duchy of Zi\u0119bice (M\u00fcnsterberg)]], which after Frederick II's death was taken by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Habsburg]].\n\nHe is one of the figures on the ''[[Prussian Homage (painting)|Prussian Homage]]'' painting by [[Jan Matejko]].\n\n== Marriages and Issue ==\nOn 21 November 1515 Frederick II married firstly Elisabeth (b. 13 November 1482 - 16 February 1517), daughter of King [[Casimir IV of Poland]]. They had one daughter:\n# Hedwig (b. and d. 2 February 1517).\n\nOn 14 November 1519 Frederick II married secondly [[Sophie of Brandenburg-Ansbach-Kulmbach]] (b. Ansbach, 10 March 1485 \u2013 d. Legnica, 14 May 1537), daughter of [[Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]] and niece of his first wife. They had three children:\n# [[Frederick III of Legnica|Frederick III]] (b. 22 February 1520 \u2013 d. Legnica, 15 December 1570).\n# [[George II the Pious]] (b. Legnica, 18 July 1523 \u2013 d.

{"title_page": "Explicit formulae for L-functions", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]]weogg bounding the [[discriminant of an algebraic number field]], and the [[conductor of a number field]]. \n\n==Riemann's explicit formula==\nIn his 1859 paper \"[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude]]\" Riemann sketched an explicit formula (it was not fully proven until 1895 by [[Hans Carl Friedrich von Mangoldt|von Mangoldt]], see below) for the normalized prime-counting function {{pi}}<sub>0</sub>(''x'') which is related to the [[prime-counting function]] {{pi}}(''x'') by\n:<math>\\pi_0(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{h\\to 0} (\\pi(x+h) + \\pi(x-h)),</math>\nwhich takes the arithmetic mean of the limit from the left and the limit from the right at discontinuities.  His formula was given in terms of the related function\n:<math>f(x) =\\pi_0(x)+\\frac{1}{2}\\pi_0(x^{1/2})+\\frac{1}{3}\\pi_0(x^{1/3})+\\cdots</math>\nin which a prime power ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> counts as 1/''n'' of a prime. The normalized prime-counting function can be recovered from this function by\n:<math>\\pi_0(x) = \\sum_n\\frac{1}{n}\\mu(n)f(x^{1/n}) = f(x) -\\frac{1}{2}f(x^{1/2})-\\frac{1}{3}f(x^{1/3})-\\frac{1}{5}f(x^{1/5})+\\frac{1}{6}f(x^{1/6}) - \\cdots,</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc''(''n'') is the [[M\u00f6bius function]].  Riemann's formula is then\n:<math>f(x) = \\operatorname{li}(x) - \\sum_\\rho \\operatorname{li}(x^\\rho) -\\log(2) +\\int_x^\\infty\\frac{dt}{t(t^2-1)\\log(t)}</math>\n\ninvolving a sum over the non-trivial zeros \u03c1 of the Riemann zeta function. The sum is not [[Absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]], but may be evaluated by taking the zeros in order of the absolute value of their imaginary part. The function li occurring in the first term is the (unoffset) [[logarithmic integral function]] given by the [[Cauchy principal value]] of the divergent integral\n:<math>\\operatorname{li}(x) = \\int_0^x\\frac{dt}{\\log(t)}.</math>\nThe terms li(''x''<sup>\u03c1</sup>) involving the zeros of the zeta function need some care in their definition as li has [[branch point]]s at 0 and 1, and are defined by [[analytic continuation]] in the complex variable \u03c1 in the region  ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 and Re(''\u03c1'')&nbsp;>&nbsp;0. The other terms also correspond to zeros: the dominant term li(''x'') comes from the pole at ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, considered as a zero of multiplicity &minus;1, and the remaining small terms come from the trivial zeros. This formula says that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function control the oscillations of primes around their \"expected\" positions. (For graphs of the sums of the first few terms of this series see {{harvnb|Zagier|1977}}.)\n\nThe first rigorous proof of the aforementioned formula was given by von Mangoldt in 1895: it started with a proof of the following formula for the [[Chebyshev's function]] \u03c8 <ref>Weisstein, Eric W. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExplicitFormula.html  Explicit Formula] on MathWorld.</ref> \n:<math>\\psi_0(x) = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{\\sigma-i \\infty}^{\\sigma+i \\infty}\\left(-\\dfrac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}\\right)\\dfrac{x^s}{s}ds=x-\\sum_\\rho\\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho} - \\log(2\\pi) -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\log(1-x^{-2})</math>\nwhere the LHS is an inverse Mellin transform with <math>\\sigma > 1</math>, <math>\\psi(x) = \\sum_{p^k \\le x} \\log p</math>, and \n<math>\\psi_0(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{h\\to 0} (\\psi(x+h) + \\psi(x-h))</math> and the RHS is obtained from the [[residue theorem]], and then converting it into the formula that Riemann himself actually sketched.\n\nThis series is also conditionally convergent and the sum over zeroes should again be taken in increasing order of imaginary part :<ref name=Ing77>Ingham (1990) p.77</ref> <math>\\sum_\\rho\\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho} = \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} S(x,T) \\ </math> where <math>S(x,T) = \\sum_{\\rho:|\\Im \\rho| \\le T} \\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho}</math>. The error involved in truncating the sum to ''S''(''x'',''T'') is always smaller than ln(''x'') in absolute value, and when divided by the [[natural logarithm]] of ''x'', has absolute value smaller than ''x''/''T'' divided by the distance from ''x'' to the nearest prime power.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/497949 Confused about the explicit formula for \u03c80(x)]</ref>\n\n==Weil's explicit formula ==\nThere are several slightly different ways to state the explicit formula. [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]]'s form of the explicit formula states\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\Phi(1)+\\Phi(0)-\\sum_\\rho\\Phi(\\rho) \\\\\n= {} & \\sum_{p,m} \\frac{\\log(p)}{p^{m/2}} \\Big ( F(\\log(p^m)) + F(-\\log(p^m)) \\Big ) - \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(t)\\Psi(t)\\,dt\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n*''\u03c1'' runs over the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function\n*''p'' runs over positive primes\n*''m'' runs over positive integers\n*''F'' is a smooth function all of whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing\n*<math>\\varphi</math> is a Fourier transform of ''F'':\n:: <math>\\varphi(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty F(x)e^{itx}\\,dx</math>\n*<math>\\Phi(1/2 + it) = \\varphi(t)</math>\n*<math>\\Psi(t) = - \\log( \\pi ) + \\operatorname{Re}(\\psi(1/4 + it/2))</math>, where <math>\\psi</math> is the [[digamma function]] \u0393<big>''&prime;''</big>/\u0393.\n\nRoughly speaking, the explicit formula says the Fourier transform of the zeros of the zeta function is the set of prime powers  plus some elementary factors. Once this is said, the formula comes from the fact that the Fourier transform is an unitary operator, so that a scalar product in time domain is equal to the scalar product of the Fourier transforms in the frequency domain.\n\nThe terms in the formula arise in the following way.\n*The terms on the right hand side come from the logarithmic derivative of\n:: <math>\\zeta^*(s)= \\Gamma(s/2)\\pi^{-s/2}\\prod_p \\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}</math>\n:with the terms corresponding to the prime ''p'' coming from the Euler factor of ''p'', and the term at the end involving &Psi; coming from the gamma factor (the Euler factor at infinity).\n*The left-hand side is a sum over all zeros of ''\u03b6''<sup>&nbsp;*</sup> counted with multiplicities, so the poles at 0 and 1 are counted as zeros of order &minus;1.\n\nWeil's explicit formula can be understood like this. The target is to be able to write that :\n\n: <math>\\frac{d}{du} \\left[ \\sum_{n \\le e^{|u|}} \\Lambda(n) + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(1-e^{-2|u|})\\right]  = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\Lambda(n) \\left[ \\delta(u+\\ln n) + \\delta(u-\\ln n) \\right] + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d\\ln(1-e^{-2|u|})}{du} = e^u - \\sum_\\rho e^{\\rho u} </math>\n\nSo that the Fourier transform of the non trivial zeros is equal to the primes power symmetrized  plus a minor term. Of course, the sum involved are not convergent, but the trick is to use the unitary property of Fourier transform which is that it preserves scalar product :\n\n: <math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(u) g^*(u) \\, du = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty F(t) G^*(t) \\, dt</math>\n\nwhere <math>F,G</math> are the Fourier transforms of <math>f,g</math>. \nAt a first look, it seems to be a formula for functions only, but in fact in many cases it also works when <math>g</math>  is a distribution. Hence, by setting <math>g(u) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\Lambda(n) \\left[ \\delta(u+\\ln n) + \\delta(u-\\ln n) \\right] </math>   (where <math>\\delta(u)</math> is the [[Dirac delta function|Dirac delta]]) and carefully choosing a function <math>f</math> and its Fourier transform, we get the formula above.\n\n==Explicit formulae for other arithmetical functions==\n\nRiemann-Weyl formula can be generalized to other arithmetical functions and not only for the Von-Mangoldt function, for example for the M\u00f6bius function we have\n\n: <math> \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mu(n)}{\\sqrt{n}}g(\\log n)=\\sum_{\\rho}\\frac{h( \\gamma)}{\\zeta '( \\rho )}+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\zeta ' (-2n)} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dxg(x)e^{-(2n+1/2)x} </math>\n\nAlso for the Liouville function  we have\n\n: <math> \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\lambda(n)}{\\sqrt{n}}g(\\log n) = \\sum_{\\rho}\\frac{h( \\gamma)\\zeta(2 \\rho )}{\\zeta'( \\rho)} + \\frac{1}{\\zeta (1/2)}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\, g(x) </math>\n\nFor the Euler-Phi function the explicit formula reads\n\n: <math> \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\varphi (n)}{\\sqrt{n}}g(\\log n)=  \\frac{6}{\\pi ^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\, g(x) e^{3x/2} + \\sum_\\rho \\frac{h( \\gamma)\\zeta(\\rho -1 )}{\\zeta '( \\rho)}+ \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\zeta (-2n-1)}{\\zeta'(-2n)} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\, g(x)e^{-x(2n+1/2)} </math>\n\nin all cases the sum is related to the imaginary part of the Riemann zeros <math> \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}+i \\gamma </math> and the test function ''f'' and ''g'' are related by a Fourier transform <math> g(u)= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty h(x)\\exp(-iux) </math>\n\nfor the divisor function of zeroth order <math> \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sigma_0 (n) f(n) = \\sum_ {m=-\\infty}^\\infty \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f(mn) </math>\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nThe Riemann zeta function can be replaced by a [[Dirichlet L-function]] of a [[Dirichlet character]] \u03c7. The sum over prime powers then gets extra\nfactors of ''\u03c7''(''p''<sup>&nbsp;''m''</sup>), and the terms \u03a6(1) and \u03a6(0) disappear because the L-series has no poles.\n\nMore generally, the Riemann zeta function and the L-series can be replaced by the [[Dedekind zeta function]] of an algebraic number field or a [[Hecke L-series]]. The sum over primes then gets replaced by a sum over prime ideals.\n\n==Applications==\nRiemann's original use of the explicit formula was to give an exact formula for the number of primes less than a given number. To do this, take ''F''(log(''y'')) to be ''y''<sup>1/2</sup>/log(''y'') for 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''x'' and 0 elsewhere. Then the main term of the sum on the right is the number of primes less than ''x''. The main term on the left is ''\u03a6''(1); which turns out to be the dominant terms of the [[prime number theorem]], and the main correction is the sum over non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. (There is a minor technical problem in using this case, in that the function ''F'' does not satisfy the smoothness condition.)\n\n==Hilbert&ndash;P\u00f3lya conjecture==\nAccording to the [[Hilbert&ndash;P\u00f3lya conjecture]],  the complex zeroes ''\u03c1'' should be the [[eigenvalue]]s of some [[linear operator]] ''T''. The sum over the zeros of the explicit formula is then (at least formally) given by a trace:\n\n:<math> \\sum_\\rho F(\\rho) = \\operatorname{Tr}(F(\\widehat T )).\\!</math>\n\nDevelopment of the explicit formulae for a wide class of L-functions was given by {{harvtxt|Weil|1952}}, who first extended the idea to [[local zeta-function]]s, and formulated a version of a [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] in this setting, as a positivity statement for a [[generalized function]] on a [[topological group]].  More recent work by [[Alain Connes]] has gone much further into the functional-analytic background, providing a trace formula the validity of which is equivalent to such a generalized Riemann hypothesis.

Such explicit formulae have been applied also to questions on bounding the [[discriminant of an algebraic number field]], and the [[conductor of a number field]]. \n\n==Riemann's explicit formula==\nIn his 1859 paper \"[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude]]\" Riemann sketched an explicit formula (it was not fully proven until 1895 by [[Hans Carl Friedrich von Mangoldt|von Mangoldt]], see below) for the normalized prime-counting function {{pi}}<sub>0</sub>(''x'') which is related to the [[prime-counting function]] {{pi}}(''x'') by\n:<math>\\pi_0(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{h\\to 0} (\\pi(x+h) + \\pi(x-h)),</math>\nwhich takes the arithmetic mean of the limit from the left and the limit from the right at discontinuities.  His formula was given in terms of the related function\n:<math>f(x) =\\pi_0(x)+\\frac{1}{2}\\pi_0(x^{1/2})+\\frac{1}{3}\\pi_0(x^{1/3})+\\cdots</math>\nin which a prime power ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> counts as 1/''n'' of a prime. The normalized prime-counting function can be recovered from this function by\n:<math>\\pi_0(x) = \\sum_n\\frac{1}{n}\\mu(n)f(x^{1/n}) = f(x) -\\frac{1}{2}f(x^{1/2})-\\frac{1}{3}f(x^{1/3})-\\frac{1}{5}f(x^{1/5})+\\frac{1}{6}f(x^{1/6}) - \\cdots,</math>\nwhere ''\u03bc''(''n'') is the [[M\u00f6bius function]].  Riemann's formula is then\n:<math>f(x) = \\operatorname{li}(x) - \\sum_\\rho \\operatorname{li}(x^\\rho) -\\log(2) +\\int_x^\\infty\\frac{dt}{t(t^2-1)\\log(t)}</math>\n\ninvolving a sum over the non-trivial zeros \u03c1 of the Riemann zeta function. The sum is not [[Absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]], but may be evaluated by taking the zeros in order of the absolute value of their imaginary part. The function li occurring in the first term is the (unoffset) [[logarithmic integral function]] given by the [[Cauchy principal value]] of the divergent integral\n:<math>\\operatorname{li}(x) = \\int_0^x\\frac{dt}{\\log(t)}.</math>\nThe terms li(''x''<sup>\u03c1</sup>) involving the zeros of the zeta function need some care in their definition as li has [[branch point]]s at 0 and 1, and are defined by [[analytic continuation]] in the complex variable \u03c1 in the region  ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 and Re(''\u03c1'')&nbsp;>&nbsp;0. The other terms also correspond to zeros: the dominant term li(''x'') comes from the pole at ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, considered as a zero of multiplicity &minus;1, and the remaining small terms come from the trivial zeros. This formula says that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function control the oscillations of primes around their \"expected\" positions. (For graphs of the sums of the first few terms of this series see {{harvnb|Zagier|1977}}.)\n\nThe first rigorous proof of the aforementioned formula was given by von Mangoldt in 1895: it started with a proof of the following formula for the [[Chebyshev's function]] \u03c8 <ref>Weisstein, Eric W. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExplicitFormula.html  Explicit Formula] on MathWorld.</ref> \n:<math>\\psi_0(x) = \\dfrac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int_{\\sigma-i \\infty}^{\\sigma+i \\infty}\\left(-\\dfrac{\\zeta'(s)}{\\zeta(s)}\\right)\\dfrac{x^s}{s}ds=x-\\sum_\\rho\\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho} - \\log(2\\pi) -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\log(1-x^{-2})</math>\nwhere the LHS is an inverse Mellin transform with <math>\\sigma > 1</math>, <math>\\psi(x) = \\sum_{p^k \\le x} \\log p</math>, and \n<math>\\psi_0(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\lim_{h\\to 0} (\\psi(x+h) + \\psi(x-h))</math> and the RHS is obtained from the [[residue theorem]], and then converting it into the formula that Riemann himself actually sketched.\n\nThis series is also conditionally convergent and the sum over zeroes should again be taken in increasing order of imaginary part :<ref name=Ing77>Ingham (1990) p.77</ref> <math>\\sum_\\rho\\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho} = \\lim_{T \\rightarrow \\infty} S(x,T) \\ </math> where <math>S(x,T) = \\sum_{\\rho:|\\Im \\rho| \\le T} \\frac{x^\\rho}{\\rho}</math>. The error involved in truncating the sum to ''S''(''x'',''T'') is always smaller than ln(''x'') in absolute value, and when divided by the [[natural logarithm]] of ''x'', has absolute value smaller than ''x''/''T'' divided by the distance from ''x'' to the nearest prime power.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/497949 Confused about the explicit formula for \u03c80(x)]</ref>\n\n==Weil's explicit formula ==\nThere are several slightly different ways to state the explicit formula. [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]]'s form of the explicit formula states\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\Phi(1)+\\Phi(0)-\\sum_\\rho\\Phi(\\rho) \\\\\n= {} & \\sum_{p,m} \\frac{\\log(p)}{p^{m/2}} \\Big ( F(\\log(p^m)) + F(-\\log(p^m)) \\Big ) - \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\varphi(t)\\Psi(t)\\,dt\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n*''\u03c1'' runs over the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function\n*''p'' runs over positive primes\n*''m'' runs over positive integers\n*''F'' is a smooth function all of whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing\n*<math>\\varphi</math> is a Fourier transform of ''F'':\n:: <math>\\varphi(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty F(x)e^{itx}\\,dx</math>\n*<math>\\Phi(1/2 + it) = \\varphi(t)</math>\n*<math>\\Psi(t) = - \\log( \\pi ) + \\operatorname{Re}(\\psi(1/4 + it/2))</math>, where <math>\\psi</math> is the [[digamma function]] \u0393<big>''&prime;''</big>/\u0393.\n\nRoughly speaking, the explicit formula says the Fourier transform of the zeros of the zeta function is the set of prime powers  plus some elementary factors. Once this is said, the formula comes from the fact that the Fourier transform is an unitary operator, so that a scalar product in time domain is equal to the scalar product of the Fourier transforms in the frequency domain.\n\nThe terms in the formula arise in the following way.\n*The terms on the right hand side come from the logarithmic derivative of\n:: <math>\\zeta^*(s)= \\Gamma(s/2)\\pi^{-s/2}\\prod_p \\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}</math>\n:with the terms corresponding to the prime ''p'' coming from the Euler factor of ''p'', and the term at the end involving &Psi; coming from the gamma factor (the Euler factor at infinity).\n*The left-hand side is a sum over all zeros of ''\u03b6''<sup>&nbsp;*</sup> counted with multiplicities, so the poles at 0 and 1 are counted as zeros of order &minus;1.\n\nWeil's explicit formula can be understood like this. The target is to be able to write that :\n\n: <math>\\frac{d}{du} \\left[ \\sum_{n \\le e^{|u|}} \\Lambda(n) + \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(1-e^{-2|u|})\\right]  = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\Lambda(n) \\left[ \\delta(u+\\ln n) + \\delta(u-\\ln n) \\right] + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d\\ln(1-e^{-2|u|})}{du} = e^u - \\sum_\\rho e^{\\rho u} </math>\n\nSo that the Fourier transform of the non trivial zeros is equal to the primes power symmetrized  plus a minor term. Of course, the sum involved are not convergent, but the trick is to use the unitary property of Fourier transform which is that it preserves scalar product :\n\n: <math>\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty f(u) g^*(u) \\, du = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty F(t) G^*(t) \\, dt</math>\n\nwhere <math>F,G</math> are the Fourier transforms of <math>f,g</math>. \nAt a first look, it seems to be a formula for functions only, but in fact in many cases it also works when <math>g</math>  is a distribution. Hence, by setting <math>g(u) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\Lambda(n) \\left[ \\delta(u+\\ln n) + \\delta(u-\\ln n) \\right] </math>   (where <math>\\delta(u)</math> is the [[Dirac delta function|Dirac delta]]) and carefully choosing a function <math>f</math> and its Fourier transform, we get the formula above.\n\n==Explicit formulae for other arithmetical functions==\n\nRiemann-Weyl formula can be generalized to other arithmetical functions and not only for the Von-Mangoldt function, for example for the M\u00f6bius function we have\n\n: <math> \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mu(n)}{\\sqrt{n}}g(\\log n)=\\sum_{\\rho}\\frac{h( \\gamma)}{\\zeta '( \\rho )}+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\zeta ' (-2n)} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dxg(x)e^{-(2n+1/2)x} </math>\n\nAlso for the Liouville function  we have\n\n: <math> \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\lambda(n)}{\\sqrt{n}}g(\\log n) = \\sum_{\\rho}\\frac{h( \\gamma)\\zeta(2 \\rho )}{\\zeta'( \\rho)} + \\frac{1}{\\zeta (1/2)}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\, g(x) </math>\n\nFor the Euler-Phi function the explicit formula reads\n\n: <math> \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\varphi (n)}{\\sqrt{n}}g(\\log n)=  \\frac{6}{\\pi ^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\, g(x) e^{3x/2} + \\sum_\\rho \\frac{h( \\gamma)\\zeta(\\rho -1 )}{\\zeta '( \\rho)}+ \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\zeta (-2n-1)}{\\zeta'(-2n)} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dx \\, g(x)e^{-x(2n+1/2)} </math>\n\nin all cases the sum is related to the imaginary part of the Riemann zeros <math> \\rho = \\frac{1}{2}+i \\gamma </math> and the test function ''f'' and ''g'' are related by a Fourier transform <math> g(u)= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty h(x)\\exp(-iux) </math>\n\nfor the divisor function of zeroth order <math> \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sigma_0 (n) f(n) = \\sum_ {m=-\\infty}^\\infty \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f(mn) </math>\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nThe Riemann zeta function can be replaced by a [[Dirichlet L-function]] of a [[Dirichlet character]] \u03c7. The sum over prime powers then gets extra\nfactors of ''\u03c7''(''p''<sup>&nbsp;''m''</sup>), and the terms \u03a6(1) and \u03a6(0) disappear because the L-series has no poles.\n\nMore generally, the Riemann zeta function and the L-series can be replaced by the [[Dedekind zeta function]] of an algebraic number field or a [[Hecke L-series]]. The sum over primes then gets replaced by a sum over prime ideals.\n\n==Applications==\nRiemann's original use of the explicit formula was to give an exact formula for the number of primes less than a given number. To do this, take ''F''(log(''y'')) to be ''y''<sup>1/2</sup>/log(''y'') for 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''x'' and 0 elsewhere. Then the main term of the sum on the right is the number of primes less than ''x''. The main term on the left is ''\u03a6''(1); which turns out to be the dominant terms of the [[prime number theorem]], and the main correction is the sum over non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. (There is a minor technical problem in using this case, in that the function ''F'' does not satisfy the smoothness condition.)\n\n==Hilbert&ndash;P\u00f3lya conjecture==\nAccording to the [[Hilbert&ndash;P\u00f3lya conjecture]],  the complex zeroes ''\u03c1'' should be the [[eigenvalue]]s of some [[linear operator]] ''T''. The sum over the zeros of the explicit formula is then (at least formally) given by a trace:\n\n:<math> \\sum_\\rho F(\\rho) = \\operatorname{Tr}(F(\\widehat T )).\\!</math>\n\nDevelopment of the explicit formulae for a wide class of L-functions was given by {{harvtxt|Weil|1952}}, who first extended the idea to [[local zeta-function]]s, and formulated a version of a [[generalized Riemann hypothesis]] in this setting, as a positivity statement for a [[generalized function]] on a [[topological group]].  More recent work by [[Alain Connes]] has gone much further into the functional-analytic background, providing a trace formula the validity of which is equivalent to such a generalized Riemann hypothesis. A slightly different point of view was given by {{harvtxt|Meyer|2005}}, who derived the explicit formula of Weil via harmonic analysis on adelic spaces.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Selberg trace formula]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Citation | authorlink=Albert Ingham | last1=Ingham | first1=A.E. | title=The Distribution of Prime Numbers | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-39789-6 | mr=1074573 | year=1990 | zbl=0715.11045 | edition=2nd | origyear=1932 | series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics and Mathematical Physics | volume=30 | others=reissued with a foreword by [[Robert Charles Vaughan (mathematician)|R.

The word \"nomad\" comes ultimately from the classical Greek word \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2 (''nom\u00e1s'', \"roaming, wandering, especially to find pasture\"), from Ancient Greek \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (''nom\u00f3s'', \"pasture\"). Most nomadic groups follow a not fixed annual or seasonal pattern of movements and settlements. Nomadic peoples traditionally travel by animal or canoe or on foot. Today, some nomads travel by motor vehicle. Most{{quantify|date=June 2019}} nomads live in tents or other portable shelters.\n\nNomads keep moving for different reasons. Nonmad foragers move in search of game, edible plants, and water. Aboriginal Australians, [[Negrito]]s of Southeast Asia, and [[San people|San]] of Africa, for example, traditionally move from camp to camp to hunt and gather wild plants. Some tribes of the Americas followed this way of life. Pastoral nomads make their living raising livestock such as camels, cattle, goats, horses, sheep or yaks; the [[Gaddi]] tribe of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in India is one such tribe. These nomads travel to find more camels, goats and sheep{{cn|date=June 2019}} through the deserts of Arabia and northern Africa. The [[Fula people| Fulani]] and their cattle travel through the grasslands of [[Niger]] in western Africa. Some nomadic peoples, especially herders, may also move to raid settled communities or to avoid enemies. Nomadic craftworkers and merchants travel to find and serve customers. They include the [[Lohar]] blacksmiths of India, the [[Romani people| Romani]] traders, and the [[Irish Travellers]].\n\nMost nomads travel in groups of families, bands or [[tribes]]. These groups are based on kinship and marriage ties or on formal agreements of cooperation. A council of adult males makes most of the decisions, though some tribes have chiefs.\n\nIn the case of Mongolian nomads, a family moves twice a year. These two movements generally occur during the summer and winter. The winter destination is usually located near mountains in a valley and most families already have fixed winter locations. Their winter locations have shelter for animals and are not used by other families while they are out. In the summer they move to a more open area that the animals can graze. Most nomads usually move in the same region and don't travel very far to a totally different region. Since they usually circle around a large area, communities form and families generally know where the other ones are. Often, families do not have the resources to move from one province to another unless they are moving out of the area permanently. A family can move on its own or with others; if it moves alone, they are usually no more than a couple of kilometers from each other. Nowadays there are no tribes and decisions are made among family members, although elders consult with each other on usual matters. The geographical closeness of families is usually for mutual support. Pastoral nomad societies usually do not have large population. One such society, the [[Mongols]], gave rise to the largest land empire in history. The Mongols originally consisted of loosely organized nomadic tribes in Mongolia, Manchuria, and Siberia. In the late 12th century, [[Genghis Khan]] united them and other nomadic tribes to found the [[Mongol Empire]], which eventually stretched the length of Asia.\n\nThe nomadic way of life has become increasingly rare. Many governments dislike nomads because it is difficult to control their movement and to obtain taxes from them. Nomadic migration across international boundaries confuses capital-city bureaucrats. Many countries have converted pastures into cropland and forced nomadic peoples into permanent settlements.\n\nAlthough (or because) \"[t]he sedentary man envies the nomadic existence, the heck for green pastures [...]\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Adorno\n | first1 = Theodor W.\n | author-link1 = Theodor W.

Some of the customary restrictions they explain as cultural saying only that ''drokha'' do not eat certain foods, even some that may be naturally abundant.

Some families do not eat until after the morning milking, while others may have a light meal with butter tea and ''tsampa''. In the afternoon, after the morning milking, the families gather and share a communal meal of tea, ''tsampa'' and sometimes [[yogurt]]. During winter months the meal is more substantial and includes meat. [[Herder]]s will eat before leaving the camp and most do not eat again until they return to camp for the evening meal. The typical evening meal may include thin stew with ''tsampa'', animal fat and dried [[radish]].

The word \"nomad\" comes ultimately from the classical Greek word \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2 (''nom\u00e1s'', \"roaming, wandering, especially to find pasture\"), from Ancient Greek \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 (''nom\u00f3s'', \"pasture\"). Most nomadic groups follow a fixed annual or seasonal pattern of movements and settlements. Nomadic peoples traditionally travel by animal or canoe or on foot. Today, some nomads travel by motor vehicle. Most{{quantify|date=June 2019}} nomads live in tents or other portable shelters.\n\nNomads keep moving for different reasons. Nomadic foragers move in search of game, edible plants, and water. Aboriginal Australians, [[Negrito]]s of Southeast Asia, and [[San people|San]] of Africa, for example, traditionally move from camp to camp to hunt and gather wild plants. Some tribes of the Americas followed this way of life. Pastoral nomads make their living raising livestock such as camels, cattle, goats, horses, sheep or yaks; the [[Gaddi]] tribe of [[Himachal Pradesh]] in India is one such tribe. These nomads travel to find more camels, goats and sheep{{cn|date=June 2019}} through the deserts of Arabia and northern Africa. The [[Fula people| Fulani]] and their cattle travel through the grasslands of [[Niger]] in western Africa. Some nomadic peoples, especially herders, may also move to raid settled communities or to avoid enemies. Nomadic craftworkers and merchants travel to find and serve customers. They include the [[Lohar]] blacksmiths of India, the [[Romani people| Romani]] traders, and the [[Irish Travellers]].\n\nMost nomads travel in groups of families, bands or [[tribes]]. These groups are based on kinship and marriage ties or on formal agreements of cooperation. A council of adult males makes most of the decisions, though some tribes have chiefs.\n\nIn the case of Mongolian nomads, a family moves twice a year. These two movements generally occur during the summer and winter. The winter destination is usually located near mountains in a valley and most families already have fixed winter locations. Their winter locations have shelter for animals and are not used by other families while they are out. In the summer they move to a more open area that the animals can graze. Most nomads usually move in the same region and don't travel very far to a totally different region. Since they usually circle around a large area, communities form and families generally know where the other ones are. Often, families do not have the resources to move from one province to another unless they are moving out of the area permanently. A family can move on its own or with others; if it moves alone, they are usually no more than a couple of kilometers from each other. Nowadays there are no tribes and decisions are made among family members, although elders consult with each other on usual matters. The geographical closeness of families is usually for mutual support. Pastoral nomad societies usually do not have large population. One such society, the [[Mongols]], gave rise to the largest land empire in history. The Mongols originally consisted of loosely organized nomadic tribes in Mongolia, Manchuria, and Siberia. In the late 12th century, [[Genghis Khan]] united them and other nomadic tribes to found the [[Mongol Empire]], which eventually stretched the length of Asia.\n\nThe nomadic way of life has become increasingly rare. Many governments dislike nomads because it is difficult to control their movement and to obtain taxes from them. Nomadic migration across international boundaries confuses capital-city bureaucrats. Many countries have converted pastures into cropland and forced nomadic peoples into permanent settlements.\n\nAlthough (or because) \"[t]he sedentary man envies the nomadic existence, the heck for green pastures [...]\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Adorno\n | first1 = Theodor W.\n | author-link1 = Theodor W.

Peddling and the sale of various goods was also practiced by men and women of various groups, such as the Jalali, the Pikraj, the Shadibaz, the Noristani, and the Vangawala. The latter and the Pikraj also worked as animal dealers. Some men among the Shadibaz and the Vangawala entertained as monkey or bear handlers and snake charmers; men and women among the Baluch were musicians and dancers. The Baluch men were warriors that were feared by neighboring tribes and often were used as mercenaries. Jogi men and women had diverse subsistence activities, such as dealing in horses, harvesting, [[fortune-telling]], [[bloodletting]], and [[begging]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn Iran the Asheq of Azerbaijan, the Challi of Baluchistan, the Luti of Kurdistan, Kerm\u0101nsh\u0101h, \u012al\u0101m, and Lorest\u0101n, the Mehtar in the Mamasani district, the Sazandeh of Band-i Amir and Marv-dasht, and the Toshmal among the Bakhtyari pastoral groups worked as professional musicians. The men among the Kowli worked as tinkers, smiths, musicians, and monkey and bear handlers; they also made baskets, sieves, and brooms and dealt in donkeys. Their women made a living from peddling, begging, and fortune-telling.\n\nThe Ghorbat among the Basseri were smiths and tinkers, traded in pack animals, and made sieves, reed mats, and small wooden implements. In the F\u0101rs region, the Qarbalband, the Kuli, and Luli were reported to work as smiths and to make baskets and sieves; they also dealt in pack animals, and their women peddled various goods among pastoral nomads. In the same region, the Changi and Luti were musicians and balladeers, and their children learned these professions from the age of 7 or 8 years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe nomadic groups in Turkey make and sell cradles, deal in animals, and play music. The men of the sedentary groups work in towns as scavengers and hangmen; elsewhere they are fishermen, smiths, basket makers, and singers; their women dance at feasts and tell fortunes. Abdal men played music and made sieves, brooms, and wooden spoons for a living. The Tahtac\u0131 traditionally worked as lumberers; with increased sedentarization, however, they have taken to agriculture and horticulture.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nLittle is known for certain about the past of these communities; the history of each is almost entirely contained in their oral traditions. Although some groups\u2014such as the Vangawala\u2014are of Indian origin, some\u2014like the Noristani\u2014are most probably of local origin; still others probably migrated from adjoining areas. The Ghorbat and the Shadibaz claim to have originally come from Iran and Multan, respectively, and Tahtac\u0131 traditional accounts mention either [[Baghdad]] or [[Greater Khorasan|Khor\u0101s\u0101n]] as their original home. The Baluch say they{{Clarify|reason=Who are the Baluch talking about?
