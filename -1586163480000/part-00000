He was [[Count of Provence]] (1246\u201385) and [[County of Forcalquier|Forcalquier]] (1246\u201348, 1256\u201385) in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Count of Anjou]] and [[Count of Maine|Maine]] (1246\u201385) in France; he was also [[King of Sicily]] (1266\u201385) and [[Prince of Achaea]] (1278\u201385). In 1272, he was proclaimed [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|King of Albania]]; and in 1277 he purchased a claim to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].\n\nThe youngest son of [[Louis VIII of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]], Charles was destined for a Church career until the early 1240s. He acquired Provence and Forcalquier through his marriage to their heiress, [[Beatrice of Provence|Beatrice]]. His attempts to secure comital rights brought him into conflict with his mother-in-law, [[Beatrice of Savoy]], and the nobility. He received Anjou and Maine from his brother, [[Louis IX of France]], in [[appanage]]. He accompanied Louis during the [[Seventh Crusade]] to [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]]. Shortly after he returned to Provence in 1250, Charles forced three wealthy autonomous cities{{mdash}}[[Marseilles]], [[Arles]] and [[Avignon]]{{mdash}}to acknowledge his suzerainty.\n\nCharles supported [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders and Hainaut]], against her eldest son, [[John I, Count of Hainaut|John]], in exchange for Hainaut in 1253. Two years later Louis IX persuaded him to renounce the county, but compensated him by instructing Margaret to pay him 160,000 marks. Charles forced the rebellious Proven\u00e7al nobles and towns into submission and expanded his suzerainty over a dozen towns and lordships in the [[Kingdom of Arles]]. In 1263, after years of negotiations, he accepted the offer of the [[Holy See]] to seize the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] from the [[Hohenstaufens]]. This kingdom included, in addition to the island of [[Sicily]], southern Italy to well north of Naples and was known as the ''Regno''. [[Pope Urban IV]] declared a crusade against the incumbent [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Sicily]] and assisted Charles to raise funds for the military campaign.\n\nCharles was crowned king in Rome on 5 January 1266. He [[Battle of Benevento|annihilated Manfred's army]] and occupied the ''Regno'' almost without resistance. His victory over Manfred's young nephew, [[Conradin]], at the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]] in 1268 strengthened his rule. In 1270 he took part in the [[Eighth Crusade]] (which had been organized by Louis IX) and forced the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid caliph of Tunis]] to pay a yearly tribute to him. Charles' victories secured his undisputed leadership among the popes' Italian partisans (known as [[Guelphs]]), but his influence on [[papal election]]s and his strong military presence in Italy disturbed the popes. They tried to channel his ambitions towards other territories and assisted him in acquiring claims to Achaea, Jerusalem and Arles through treaties. In 1281 [[Pope Martin IV]] authorised Charles to launch a crusade against the Byzantine Empire. Charles' ships were gathering at [[Messina]], ready to begin the campaign when a riot{{mdash}}known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]]{{mdash}}broke out on 30{{nbs}}March 1282. It put an end to Charles' rule on the island of Sicily, but he was able to defend the mainland territories (or the [[Kingdom of Naples]]) with the support of France and the Holy See.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\n\nCharles was the youngest child of [[Louis VIII of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]].{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=10\u201311}} The date of his birth was not recorded, but he was probably a [[posthumous birth|posthumous]] son, born in early 1227.<ref group=\"note\">Historian Peter Herde notes that Charles may have also been identical with the first son of Louis VIII and Blanche born in 1226, Stephen, or with the unnamed son who was born in late 1226. If Charles was identical with Stephen, he must have changed his name before the late 1230s. ''(Dunbabin (1998), p. 10.)''</ref>{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=10}}{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=71}} Charles was Louis's only surviving son to be \"[[born in the purple]]\" (after his father's coronation), a fact

education.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=10\u201311}} In reality, Blanche was fully engaged in state administration, and could likely spare little time for her youngest children.{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=71}}{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=11}} Charles lived at the court of a brother, [[Robert I, Count of Artois]], from 1237.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=11}} About four years later he was

protection of the [[Holy See]].{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=147}} Louis IX and Margaret suggested that Beatrice should be given in marriage to Charles.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=42}} To secure the support of France against Frederick II, [[Pope Innocent IV]] accepted their proposal.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=42}} Charles hurried to [[Aix-en-Provence]] at the head of an army to prevent other suitors from attacking.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=42}}{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=152}} He married Beatrice on 31{{nbs}}January 1246.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=42}}{{sfn|Cox|1974|p=153}} Provence was a part of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] and so of the [[Holy Roman Empire]],{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=73}} but Charles never swore fealty to the emperor.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=44}} He ordered a survey of the counts' rights and revenues,

church career, Charles had not received an [[appanage]] (a hereditary county or duchy) from his father.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=12}} Louis VIII had willed that his fourth son, John, should receive [[County of Anjou|Anjou]] and [[County of Maine|Maine]] upon reaching the age of majority, but John died in 1232.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=12\u201313}} Louis IX knighted Charles at [[Melun]] in May 1246 and three months later bestowed Anjou and Maine on him.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|Takayama|2004|p=78}} Charles rarely visited his two counties and appointed [[bailli]]es (or regents) to

prevent the marriage.{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=138}} Charles and his second wife, Margaret of Nevers, had children who did not survive to adulthood.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=186}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nThe works of [[Bartholomaeus of Neocastro]] and Saba Malaspina strongly influenced modern views about Charles, although they were biased.{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|p=97}}{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=70}} The former described Charles as a tyrant to justify the Sicilian Vespers, the latter argued for the cancellation of the crusade against Aragon in 1285.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=70}} Charles had continued his imperial predecessors' policies in several fields, including coinage, taxation, and the employment of unpopular officials from [[Amalfi]].{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|pp=96\u201397, 102\u2013103}} Nevertheless, the monarchy underwent a \"Frenchification\" or \"Proven\u00e7alistion\" during his reign.{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|p=104}} He donated estates in the ''Regno'' to about 700 noblemen from France or Provence.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=59}} He did not adopt the rich ceremonial robes, inspired by Byzantine and Islamic art, of earlier Sicilian kings, but dressed like other western European monarchs,{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|p=104}} or as \"a simple knight\", as it was observed by [[Thomas Tuscus]] in 1267.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Charles d'Anjou comte de Provence.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A middle aged man who wears a hauberk covered by coat and holds a sword|Charles as count of Provence (statue by [[Louis-Joseph Daumas]] in [[Hy\u00e8res]])]]\n\nAround 1310, [[Giovanni Villani]] stated that Charles had been the most powerful Christian monarch in the late 1270s.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=116}} [[Luchetto Gattilusio]] compared Charles directly with Charlemagne.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=116}} Both reports demonstrate that Charles was regarded almost as an emperor.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=116}} Among modern historians, Runciman says that Charles tried to build an empire in the eastern Mediterraneum;{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=255}} [[G\u00e9rard Siv\u00e9ry]] writes that he wanted to dominate the west; and [[Jean Dunbabin]] argues that his \"agglomeration of lands was in the process of forming an empire\".{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=114\u2013116}}\n\nHistorian Hiroshi Takayama concludes that Charles' dominion \"was too large to control\".{{sfn|Takayama|2004|p=79}} Nevertheless, economic links among his realms strengthened during his reign.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=119}} Proven\u00e7al salt was transported to his other lands, grain from the ''Regno'' was sold in Achaea, Albania, Acre and Tuscany, and Tuscan merchants settled in Anjou, Maine, Sicily and Naples.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} His highest-ranking officials were transferred from their homelands to represent him in other territories: his senechals in Provence were from Anjou; French and Proven\u00e7al noblemen held the highest offices in the ''Regno''; and he chose his vicars in Rome from among southern Italian and Proven\u00e7al nobles.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=121}} Although his empire collapsed before his death, his son retained southern Italy and Provence.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=125}}\n\nCharles always emphasised his royal rank, but did not adopt \"imperial rhetoric\".{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=114\u2013115}} His renowned justiciar, [[Marino de Caramanico]], developed a new political theory, which denied the emperors' monopoly on law-making and emphasised Charles' full competence to issue decrees.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=220}} To promote legal education Charles paid high salaries{{mdash}}20\u201350 ounces of gold in a year{{mdash}}to masters of law at the [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]].{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=215}} Masters of medicine received similar remunerations, and the university became a principal centre of medical science.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=215, 217}} Charles' personal interest in medicine grew during his life and he borrowed Arabic medical texts from the rulers of Tunis to have them translated.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=222}} He employed at least one Jewish scholar, Moses of Palermo, who could translate texts from Arabic to Latin.{{sfn|Patai|1977|p=156}} [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]]'s medical encyclopaedia, known as ''[[Al-Hawi|Kitab al-Hawi]]'', was one of the books translated at his order.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=222}}\n\nCharles was also a poet, which distinguished him from his Capetian relatives.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=203}} He composed lovesongs and a ''[[partimen]]'' (the latter with [[Pierre d'Angicourt]]).{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=203}} He was requested to judge at two poetic competitions in his youth, but modern scholars do not esteem his poetry.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=203\u2013204}} The Proven\u00e7al troubadours were mostly critical when writing of Charles, but French poets were willing to praise him.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=205, 207}} [[Bertran d'Alamanon]] wrote a poem against the salt tax and [[Raimon de Tors de Marseilha]] rebuked Charles for invading the ''Regno''. [[Adam de la Halle]] dedicated an unfinished epic poem to Charles and [[Jean de Meun]] glorified his victories.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=205, 208}} Dante described Charles{{mdash}}\"who bears a manly nose\"{{mdash}}singing peacefully together with his one-time rival, Peter III of Aragon, in [[Purgatory]].{{sfn|Hollander|2004|p=159}}\n\nCharles also showed interest in architecture.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=210\u2013211}} He designed a tower in Brindisi, but it soon collapsed.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=211}} He ordered the erection of the [[Castel Nuovo]] in Naples, of which only the palatine chapel survives.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=211}} He is also credited with the introduction of French-style glassed windows in southern Italy.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=212}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Abulafia |first=David |author-link=David Abulafia |title=Charles of Anjou reassessed |journal=Journal of Medieval History |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=93\u2013114 |year=2000 |issn=0304-4181 |ref=harv |doi=10.1016/s0304-4181(99)00012-3}}\n* {{cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |year=2012 |title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-84983-688-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=B\u00e1r\u00e1ny |first=Attila |editor1-last=Kord\u00e9 |editor1-first=Zolt\u00e1n |editor2-last=Petrovics |editor2-first=Istv\u00e1n |title=Diplomacy in the Countries of the Angevin Dynasty in the Thirteenth\u2013Fourteenth Centuries |publisher=Accademia d'Ungheria in Roma |year=2010 |pages=57\u201377 |chapter=The English relations of Charles II of Sicily and Maria of Hungary |isbn=978-963-315-046-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Casas Castells |first=Elena |year=2007 |title=Reyes de Espa\u00f1a: Desde los Primeros Reyes Godos hasta Hoy ''[The Kings of Spain: From the First Gothic Kings till Today]'' |publisher=LIBSA |language=es |isbn=978-84-662-1323-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Cox |first=Eugene L. |year=1974 |title=The Eagles of Savoy: The House of Savoy in Thirteenth-Century Europe |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-05216-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dunbabin |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Dunbabin |year=1998 |title=Charles I of Anjou.

1285), commonly called '''Charles of Anjou''', was a member of the royal [[Capetian dynasty]] and the founder of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|second House of Anjou]]. He was [[Count of Provence]] (1246\u201385) and [[County of Forcalquier|Forcalquier]] (1246\u201348, 1256\u201385) in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Count of Anjou]] and [[Count of Maine|Maine]] (1246\u201385) in France; he was also [[King of Sicily]] (1266\u201385) and [[Prince of Achaea]] (1278\u201385). In 1272, he was proclaimed [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|King of Albania]]; and in 1277 he purchased a claim to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].\n\nThe youngest son of [[Louis VIII of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]], Charles was destined for a Church career until the early 1240s. He acquired Provence and Forcalquier through his marriage to their heiress, [[Beatrice of Provence|Beatrice]]. His attempts to secure comital rights brought him into conflict with his mother-in-law, [[Beatrice of Savoy]], and the nobility. He received Anjou and Maine from his brother, [[Louis IX of France]], in [[appanage]]. He accompanied Louis during the [[Seventh Crusade]] to [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egypt]]. Shortly after he returned to Provence in 1250, Charles forced three wealthy autonomous cities{{mdash}}[[Marseilles]], [[Arles]] and [[Avignon]]{{mdash}}to acknowledge his suzerainty.\n\nCharles supported [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders and Hainaut]], against her eldest son, [[John I, Count of Hainaut|John]], in exchange for Hainaut in 1253. Two years later Louis IX persuaded him to renounce the county, but compensated him by instructing Margaret to pay him 160,000 marks. Charles forced the rebellious Proven\u00e7al nobles and towns into submission and expanded his suzerainty over a dozen towns and lordships in the [[Kingdom of Arles]]. In 1263, after years of negotiations, he accepted the offer of the [[Holy See]] to seize the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] from the [[Hohenstaufens]]. This kingdom included, in addition to the island of [[Sicily]], southern Italy to well north of Naples and was known as the ''Regno''. [[Pope Urban IV]] declared a crusade against the incumbent [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Sicily]] and assisted Charles to raise funds for the military campaign.\n\nCharles was crowned king in Rome on 5 January 1266. He [[Battle of Benevento|annihilated Manfred's army]] and occupied the ''Regno'' almost without resistance. His victory over Manfred's young nephew, [[Conradin]], at the [[Battle of Tagliacozzo]] in 1268 strengthened his rule. In 1270 he took part in the [[Eighth Crusade]] (which had been organized by Louis IX) and forced the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid caliph of Tunis]] to pay a yearly tribute to him. Charles' victories secured his undisputed leadership among the popes' Italian partisans (known as [[Guelphs]]), but his influence on [[papal election]]s and his strong military presence in Italy disturbed the popes. They tried to channel his ambitions towards other territories and assisted him in acquiring claims to Achaea, Jerusalem and Arles through treaties. In 1281 [[Pope Martin IV]] authorised Charles to launch a crusade against the Byzantine Empire. Charles' ships were gathering at [[Messina]], ready to begin the campaign when a riot{{mdash}}known as the [[Sicilian Vespers]]{{mdash}}broke out on 30{{nbs}}March 1282. It put an end to Charles' rule on the island of Sicily, but he was able to defend the mainland territories (or the [[Kingdom of Naples]]) with the support of France and the Holy See.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood===\n\nCharles was the youngest child of [[Louis VIII of France]] and [[Blanche of Castile]].{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=10\u201311}} The date of his birth was not recorded, but he was probably a [[posthumous birth|posthumous]] son, born in early 1227.<ref group=\"note\">Historian Peter Herde notes that Charles may have also been identical with the first son of Louis VIII and Blanche born in 1226, Stephen, or with the unnamed son who was born in late 1226. If Charles was identical with Stephen, he must have changed his name before the late 1230s. ''(Dunbabin (1998), p. 10.)''</ref>{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=10}}{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=71}} Charles was Louis's only surviving son to be \"[[born in the purple]]\" (after his father's coronation), a fact

education.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=10\u201311}} In reality, Blanche was fully engaged in state administration, and could likely spare little time for her youngest children.{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=71}}{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=11}} Charles lived at the court of a brother, [[Robert I, Count of Artois]], from 1237.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=11}} About four years later he was

of [[Bartholomaeus of Neocastro]] and Saba Malaspina strongly influenced modern views about Charles, although they were biased.{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|p=97}}{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=70}} The former described Charles as a tyrant to justify the Sicilian Vespers, the latter argued for the cancellation of the crusade against Aragon in 1285.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=70}} Charles had continued his imperial predecessors' policies in several fields, including coinage, taxation, and the employment of unpopular officials from [[Amalfi]].{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|pp=96\u201397, 102\u2013103}} Nevertheless, the monarchy underwent a \"Frenchification\" or \"Proven\u00e7alistion\" during his reign.{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|p=104}} He donated estates in the ''Regno'' to about 700 noblemen from France or Provence.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=59}} He did not adopt the rich ceremonial robes, inspired by Byzantine and Islamic art, of earlier Sicilian kings, but dressed like other western European monarchs,{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|p=104}} or as \"a simple knight\", as it was observed by [[Thomas Tuscus]] in 1267.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n[[File:Charles d'Anjou comte de

Charlemagne.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=116}} Both reports demonstrate that Charles was regarded almost as an emperor.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=116}} Among modern historians, Runciman says that Charles tried to build an empire in the eastern Mediterraneum;{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=255}} [[G\u00e9rard Siv\u00e9ry]] writes that he wanted to dominate the west; and [[Jean Dunbabin]] argues that his \"agglomeration

control\".{{sfn|Takayama|2004|p=79}} Nevertheless, economic links among his realms strengthened during his reign.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=119}} Proven\u00e7al salt was transported to his other lands, grain from the ''Regno'' was sold in Achaea, Albania, Acre and Tuscany, and Tuscan merchants settled in Anjou, Maine, Sicily and Naples.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=119\u2013120}} His highest-ranking officials were transferred from their homelands to represent him in other territories: his senechals in Provence were from Anjou; French and Proven\u00e7al noblemen held the highest offices in the ''Regno''; and he chose his vicars in Rome from among southern Italian and Proven\u00e7al nobles.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=121}} Although his empire collapsed before his death, his son retained southern Italy and Provence.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=125}}\n\nCharles always emphasised his royal rank, but did not adopt \"imperial rhetoric\".{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=114\u2013115}} His renowned justiciar, [[Marino de Caramanico]], developed a new political theory, which denied the emperors' monopoly on law-making and emphasised Charles' full competence to issue decrees.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=220}} To promote legal education Charles paid high salaries{{mdash}}20\u201350 ounces of gold in a year{{mdash}}to masters of law at the [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]].{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=215}} Masters of medicine received similar remunerations, and the university became a principal centre of medical science.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=215, 217}} Charles' personal interest in medicine grew during his life and he borrowed Arabic medical texts from the rulers of Tunis to have them translated.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=222}} He employed at least one Jewish scholar, Moses of Palermo, who could translate texts from Arabic to Latin.{{sfn|Patai|1977|p=156}} [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]]'s medical encyclopaedia, known as ''[[Al-Hawi|Kitab al-Hawi]]'', was one of the books translated at his order.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=222}}\n\nCharles was also a poet, which distinguished him from his Capetian relatives.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=203}} He composed lovesongs and a ''[[partimen]]'' (the latter with [[Pierre d'Angicourt]]).{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=203}} He was requested to judge at two poetic competitions in his youth, but modern scholars do not esteem his poetry.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=203\u2013204}} The Proven\u00e7al troubadours were mostly critical when writing of Charles, but French poets were willing to praise him.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=205, 207}} [[Bertran d'Alamanon]] wrote a poem against the salt tax and [[Raimon de Tors de Marseilha]] rebuked Charles for invading the ''Regno''. [[Adam de la Halle]] dedicated an unfinished epic poem to Charles and [[Jean de Meun]] glorified his victories.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=205, 208}} Dante described Charles{{mdash}}\"who bears a manly nose\"{{mdash}}singing peacefully together with his one-time rival, Peter III of Aragon, in [[Purgatory]].{{sfn|Hollander|2004|p=159}}\n\nCharles also showed interest in architecture.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|pp=210\u2013211}} He designed a tower in Brindisi, but it soon collapsed.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=211}} He ordered the erection of the [[Castel Nuovo]] in Naples, of which only the palatine chapel survives.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=211}} He is also credited with the introduction of French-style glassed windows in southern Italy.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=212}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Abulafia |first=David |author-link=David Abulafia |title=Charles of Anjou reassessed |journal=Journal of Medieval History |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=93\u2013114 |year=2000 |issn=0304-4181 |ref=harv |doi=10.1016/s0304-4181(99)00012-3}}\n* {{cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |year=2012 |title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-84983-688-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=B\u00e1r\u00e1ny |first=Attila |editor1-last=Kord\u00e9 |editor1-first=Zolt\u00e1n |editor2-last=Petrovics |editor2-first=Istv\u00e1n |title=Diplomacy in the Countries of the Angevin Dynasty in the Thirteenth\u2013Fourteenth Centuries |publisher=Accademia d'Ungheria in Roma |year=2010 |pages=57\u201377 |chapter=The English relations of Charles II of Sicily and Maria of Hungary |isbn=978-963-315-046-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Casas Castells |first=Elena |year=2007 |title=Reyes de Espa\u00f1a: Desde los Primeros Reyes Godos hasta Hoy ''[The Kings of Spain: From the First Gothic Kings till Today]'' |publisher=LIBSA |language=es |isbn=978-84-662-1323-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Cox |first=Eugene L. |year=1974 |title=The Eagles of Savoy: The House of Savoy in Thirteenth-Century Europe |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-05216-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dunbabin |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Dunbabin |year=1998 |title=Charles I of Anjou.

Kerr (1998) defined '''HARKing''' as \u201cpresenting a post hoc hypothesis in the introduction of a research report as if it were an a priori hypothesis\u201d (p.&nbsp;197). HARKing may also occur when researchers test an a priori hypothesis but then omit that hypothesis from their research reports after they find out the results of a test of that hypothesis.\n\n==Types of HARKing==\nSeveral types of HARKing have been distinguished, including:\n* <u>THARKing</u>: Transparently hypothesizing after the results are known, rather than the secretive HARKing that was first proposed by Kerr (1998). In this case, researchers openly declare that they developed their hypotheses after they observed their research results.<ref name=\"Hollenback & Wright (2017)\">{{cite journal |last1=Hollenbeck |first1=J.

Passive HARKing occurs when researchers HARK in response to requests by editors and reviewers during the [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]] process (Rubin, 2017, p.&nbsp;317).<ref name=\"Rubin (2017)\" />\n\n==Concerns About HARKing==\nConcerns about HARKing appear to be increasing in the scientific community, as shown by the increasing number of citations to Kerr's seminal (1998) article.<ref name=\"Rubin (2019)\" /> According to [https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=baugrlwAAAAJ Google Scholar], Kerr's article averaged 4.3 citations per year during the period 2000\u20132009. This figure increased to 90.5 citations per year during the period 2010\u20132019 and 224.5 citations per year during 2018\u20132019.\n[[File:Kerr_(1998).png|alt=|frameless|500x500px]]\n\n''Figure 1.''

In order to improve their chances of publishing their results, researchers may secretly suppress any a priori hypotheses that fail to yield significant results, construct or retrieve post hoc hypotheses that account for any unexpected significant results, and then present these new post hoc hypotheses in their research reports as if they are a priori hypotheses.<ref name=\"Kerr (1998)\" /><ref name=\"Mazzola & Deuling (2013)\">{{cite journal |last1=Mazzola |first1=J.

The kings, especially those of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], regarded the Jews as their property and it was in their own interest to protect them. During this time the Jews enjoyed relative political freedom, they had posts in the courts and were merchants and businessmen. The Jews used to live separately in ''juder\u00edas'' (Jewish neighborhoods).

It is noteworthy that the unfavorable attitudes towards Jews were at the same level as those regarding other groups addressed, including Orthodox Christians and Protestants. It is particularly significant that as a source of problems in Spain, Jews were considered to be at the same level as were Catholics. The results obtained from segmentation of the study population confirmed the existence of fairly homogeneous attitudes \u2013 both favorable and unfavorable \u2013 towards all religious groups in general, rather than any differentiated opinion with respect to the Jews.<ref>The only group to be negatively rated by a majority of the study population, in every case, was that of the Muslims, both as concerns the levels of unfavorable attitudes and of identification, and of the greater perception of problems created in Spain and throughout the world.</ref> Among the reasons cited by the respondents for expressing unfavorable attitudes towards Jews, 17.5% pointed to Israel\u2019s role in the Middle East conflict, while 31.3% pointed to this factor as the reason why Jews are perceived as creating problems in the world. These findings confirmed that a significant proportion of the negative evaluation of Jews and Jewishness among the Spanish population was due to a perceived association between Jews as a religious group and the State of Israel and its policies. Among the reasons cited by those who consider Jews to create problems in Spain, the most significant one (cited by 11.4% of respondents) was the association with issues that are characteristic of immigration in general. This confirmed that part of the population in Spain viewed the Jews as an alien group, and extended its negative perceptions of this group toward the difference in general, concerning both its origin and its religion. Regarding opinions on Israel and the Middle East, both Israel and Palestine were viewed unfavorably by the majority of the study population. Regarding the perception of the Middle East conflict, 67.2% of those interviewed held both parties to be responsible to some degree. Similarly, the questions on the Middle East conflict produced a majority of results clearly recognizing the legitimacy of the State of Israel.<ref name=CSI />\n\n== Antisemitism in the media ==\nSome important elements differentiate the Spanish media from its European counterparts:\n* Uniformity of opinion across ideological lines - There are few writers who consistently go beyond stereotypes or denounce manipulation.\n* [[Anti-Americanism]] - The level of intensity was higher in Spain, due to former Prime Minister Aznar's role in the war in Iraq, in comparison to the anti-Bush and antiwar policy of the Socialist government.\n* Intensity - Antisemitic discourse in the Spanish media has a long history and reaches levels of intensity that would be considered unacceptable elsewhere in Europe.

Likewise, this merges with newer stereotypes such as charges of sowing disorder, subjugation of others, and the analogies between Israelis and Nazis - sometimes through direct comparisons, while other times through indirect comparisons by referring to \"the Palestinian Holocaust\" or making an analogy between Gaza and concentration camps or the ghettos.<ref name=ADL2009a /><ref>{{cite web|last=Baer|first=Alejandro|title=Exclusive: Antisemitism in Spain.

During the [[Middle Ages]], Jews in Islamic-occupied Spain, [[Al-Andalus]], were designated as ''[[dhimmi]]s'', and, despite occasional violent outbursts such as the [[1066 Granada massacre]], they were granted protection to profess their religion in exchange of abiding to certain conditions that limited their rights in relation to Muslims.<ref name=gsanj>{{Cite journal|title=Tolerancia, convivencia y coexistencia en al-Andalus, \u00bfmito o realidad?|journal=Desperta Ferro|year=2001|issue=7|issn=2171-9276|last=Garc\u00eda Sanju\u00e1n|first=Alejandro|pages=42\u201345}}</ref> After the [[Almoravid Empire|Almoravid]] invasion (11th century), the situation of the Jewish population in Muslim territory aggravated,<ref name=gsanj /> and during the [[Almohad Empire|Almohad]] invasion of the peninsula many Jews fled to the northern Christian kingdoms, the eastern mediterranean and Africa.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Jos\u00e9|last=Hinojosa Montalvo|page=26|url=https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/13209/1/Hinojosa_Judios_Espa%C3%B1a.pdf|chapter=Los jud\u00edos en la Espa\u00f1a medieval: de la tolerancia a la expulsi\u00f3n|title=Los marginados en el mundo medieval y moderno : Almer\u00eda, 5 a 7 de noviembre de 1998|editor=M\u00aa Desamparados Mart\u00ednez San Pedro|year=2000|location=Almer\u00eda|publisher=Instituto de Estudios Almerienses|isbn=84-8108-206-6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Reconquista]] the Jews in Spain lived in relative peace next to their Christian neighbors. The kings, especially those of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], regarded the Jews as their property and it was in their own interest to protect them. During this time the Jews enjoyed relative political freedom, they had posts in the courts and were merchants and businessmen. The Jews used to live separately in ''juder\u00edas'' (Jewish neighborhoods). Although the good relations the Jews had with their Christian neighbors, especially in the 14th century antisemitism was rising. Blood libel accusations were spreading and decrees were imposed on the Jewish people.

It is noteworthy that the unfavorable attitudes towards Jews were at the same level as those regarding other groups addressed, including Orthodox Christians and Protestants. It is particularly significant that as a source of problems in Spain, Jews were considered to be at the same level as were Catholics. The results obtained from segmentation of the study population confirmed the existence of fairly homogeneous attitudes \u2013 both favorable and unfavorable \u2013 towards all religious groups in general, rather than any differentiated opinion with respect to the Jews.<ref>The only group to be negatively rated by a majority of the study population, in every case, was that of the Muslims, both as concerns the levels of unfavorable attitudes and of identification, and of the greater perception of problems created in Spain and throughout the world.</ref> Among the reasons cited by the respondents for expressing unfavorable attitudes towards Jews, 17.5% pointed to Israel\u2019s role in the Middle East conflict, while 31.3% pointed to this factor as the reason why Jews are perceived as creating problems in the world. These findings confirmed that a significant proportion of the negative evaluation of Jews and Jewishness among the Spanish population was due to a perceived association between Jews as a religious group and the State of Israel and its policies. Among the reasons cited by those who consider Jews to create problems in Spain, the most significant one (cited by 11.4% of respondents) was the association with issues that are characteristic of immigration in general. This confirmed that part of the population in Spain viewed the Jews as an alien group, and extended its negative perceptions of this group toward the difference in general, concerning both its origin and its religion. Regarding opinions on Israel and the Middle East, both Israel and Palestine were viewed unfavorably by the majority of the study population. Regarding the perception of the Middle East conflict, 67.2% of those interviewed held both parties to be responsible to some degree. Similarly, the questions on the Middle East conflict produced a majority of results clearly recognizing the legitimacy of the State of Israel.<ref name=CSI />\n\n== Antisemitism in the media ==\nSome important elements differentiate the Spanish media from its European counterparts:\n* Uniformity of opinion across ideological lines - There are few writers who consistently go beyond stereotypes or denounce manipulation.\n* [[Anti-Americanism]] - The level of intensity was higher in Spain, due to former Prime Minister Aznar's role in the war in Iraq, in comparison to the anti-Bush and antiwar policy of the Socialist government.\n* Intensity - Antisemitic discourse in the Spanish media has a long history and reaches levels of intensity that would be considered unacceptable elsewhere in Europe.

Likewise, this merges with newer stereotypes such as charges of sowing disorder, subjugation of others, and the analogies between Israelis and Nazis - sometimes through direct comparisons, while other times through indirect comparisons by referring to \"the Palestinian Holocaust\" or making an analogy between Gaza and concentration camps or the ghettos.<ref name=ADL2009a /><ref>{{cite web|last=Baer|first=Alejandro|title=Exclusive: Antisemitism in Spain.

Angry Spanish supporters created an expletive antisemitic hashtag in their messages after the match, which briefly became one of the most popular keywords on Twitter in Spain. Twelve Jewish associations filed a judicial complaint after seeing references in some messages to death camps and the mass murder of Jews in the Holocaust. The organizations singled out five people who were identified by their real names on Twitter, accusing them of \u201cincitement to hatred and discrimination\u201d \u2014 a crime punishable by up to three years\u2019 jail in Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.org.il/87476|title=Maccabi Tel Aviv Euroleague win leads to antisemitic tweets|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref>\n\nModern antisemitic-like attitudes in Spain are mostly related to the perceived abusive policies of the State of [[Israel]] against [[Palestinian territories|Palestinians]] and in the international scene,<ref name=\"elcano\" /><ref name=\"elpaisantisemitas\" /><ref name=EUMC2003 /> and it has been defined by Jewish authors as an \"antisemitism without antisemites.\"<ref name=\"elpaisantisemitas\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130926151250/http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/15spain.html Antisemitism and the Extreme Right in Spain (1962\u20131997)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121119102511/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/CR.htm#s Annual Country Reporta - Spain]\n* [http://wiki.vilaweb.cat/index.php/Catalanisme_i_semitisme_/_sionisme Antisemitism and anticatalanism (in catalan language)]\n\n{{Antisemitism topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{Europe in topic|Antisemitism in}}\n\n[[Category:Antisemitism in Spain| ]]\n[[Category:Antisemitism by country|Spain]]\n", "name_user": "Mozad655", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added detail.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Spain"}
