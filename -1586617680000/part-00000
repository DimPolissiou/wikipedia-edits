It provides services and support to practising and training solicitors, as well as serving as a sounding board for [[law reform]]. Members of the Society are often consulted when important issues are being debated in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] or by the executive. The Society was formed in 1825.\n\nThe Hall of The Law Society is in [[Chancery Lane]], London, but it also has offices in Cardiff to deal with the Wales jurisdiction and Assembly, and [[Brussels]], to deal with [[European Union law]].\n\nA president is elected annually to serve for one year. The current president is Simon Davis.<ref>[https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/press-releases/simon-davis-inaugurated/ Law Society Press Release, 4 July 2019]</ref>\n\n[[Barrister]]s in England and Wales have a similar professional body, the [[General Council of the Bar]], commonly known as the Bar Council.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Law Society Arms.jpg|thumb|The coat of arms of the Law Society.]]\n[[File:Law Society, Chancery Lane, London.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Law Society on Chancery Lane, London]]\nThe London Law Institution, the predecessor to the Law Society, was founded in 1823 when many London Solicitors came together to raise the reputation of the profession by setting standards and ensuring good practice. 'London' was dropped from the title in 1825 to reflect the fact that the Law Institution had national aspirations.\n\nThe Society was founded on 2 June 1825, when a committee of management was appointed. The Society acquired its first [[Royal Charter]] in 1831 as '''The Society of Attorneys, Solicitors, Proctors and others not being Barristers, practising in the Courts of Law and Equity of the United Kingdom'''.<ref>[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/royalcharters.pdf Law Society Royal Charters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121045420/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/royalcharters.pdf |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref> A new Charter in 1845 defined the Society as an independent, private body servicing the affairs of the profession like other professional, literary and scientific bodies. By further Royal Charter in 1903 the name of the Society was changed to simply \"The Law Society\"<nowiki/><nowiki/>. The Society first admitted women members in 1922.<ref name=\"lawsochistory\">[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/aboutlawsociety/whoweare/abouthistory.law Law Society Website History Section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227151942/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/aboutlawsociety/whoweare/abouthistory.law |date=27 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the Association of Women Solicitors (AWS), a national organisation working with and representing women solicitors in the United Kingdom, merged with the Law Society to form its Women Lawyers Division. Although merged, the AWS will operate separately from the Law Society.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/stories/law-society-women-lawyers-division-appoints-inaugural-council/ |title=Law Society Women Lawyers Division appoints inaugural council |date=17 July 2013 |publisher=lawsociety.org.uk |accessdate=November 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Discipline===\nIn 1834, the Society first initiated proceedings against dishonest practitioners. By 1907, the Society possessed a statutory disciplinary committee, and was empowered to investigate solicitors' accounts and to issue annual practising certificates. In 1983, the Society established the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors to deal with complaints about solicitors. Complaints regarding the conduct of solicitors are now dealt with by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). However complaints regarding poor service are the remit of the [[Legal Ombudsman]].<ref>http://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/problems/report-solicitor.page#legal-ombudsman</ref>\n\n===Legal education===\nThe [[Solicitors Act 1860]] enabled the Society to create a three-tier examination system.<ref name=\"lawsochistory\" /> In 1903, the Society established its own Law Society School of Law, which later merged with tutorial firm Gibson and Weldon to become the independent [[University of Law|College of Law]]. By 1922 The Law Society required a compulsory academic year for all clerks.\n\n==Regulatory body status==\nFollowing the recommendations of the [http://www.legal-services-review.org.uk/ Clementi Review] The Law Society split its representative and regulatory functions.\n\nComplaints from the public are handled by the [[Legal Ombudsman]] which is a single portal for complaints by the public made against all providers of legal services including the [[Bar of England and Wales|Bar]], [[licensed conveyancer]]s etc., but excluding unqualified will-writers.\n\nThe regulatory body for solicitors is the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]]. It is a Board of The Law Society although it regulates and enforces regulation completely independently of the Law Society. The Law Society remains the approved regulator, although following the [[Legal Services Act 2007]] a new body, the [[Legal Services Board]] (chaired by Sir Michael Pitt, a government appointee) oversees all the approved regulators including the [[Bar Council]], which has also divested its regulatory functions into the [[Bar Standards Board]].\n\nThe Law Society of England and Wales is a [[Designated Professional Body]] under the Financial Services & Markets Act 2000.\n\n==The Hall of The Law Society==\nLocated at 113 Chancery Lane The Hall of The Law Society is the principal building of the society. Built in 1832 the building is Grade II listed.

The current president is Simon Davis.<ref>[https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/press-releases/simon-davis-inaugurated/ Law Society Press Release, 4 July 2019]</ref>\n\n[[Barrister]]s in England and Wales have a similar professional body, the [[General Council of the Bar]], commonly known as the Bar Council.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Law Society Arms.jpg|thumb|The coat of arms of the Law Society.]]\n[[File:Law Society, Chancery Lane, London.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Law Society on Chancery Lane, London]]\nThe London Law Institution, the predecessor to the Law Society, was founded in 1823 when many London Solicitors came together to raise the reputation of the profession by setting standards and ensuring good practice. 'London' was dropped from the title in 1825 to reflect the fact that the Law Institution had national aspirations.\n\nThe Society was founded on 2 June 1825, when a committee of management was appointed. The Society acquired its first [[Royal Charter]] in 1831 as '''The Society of Attorneys, Solicitors, Proctors and others not being Barristers, practising in the Courts of Law and Equity of the United Kingdom'''.<ref>[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/royalcharters.pdf Law Society Royal Charters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121045420/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/documents/downloads/royalcharters.pdf |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref> A new Charter in 1845 defined the Society as an independent, private body servicing the affairs of the profession like other professional, literary and scientific bodies. By further Royal Charter in 1903 the name of the Society was changed to simply \"The Law Society\"<nowiki/><nowiki/>. The Society first admitted women members in 1922.<ref name=\"lawsochistory\">[http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/aboutlawsociety/whoweare/abouthistory.law Law Society Website History Section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227151942/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/aboutlawsociety/whoweare/abouthistory.law |date=27 December 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the Association of Women Solicitors (AWS), a national organisation working with and representing women solicitors in the United Kingdom, merged with the Law Society to form its Women Lawyers Division. Although merged, the AWS will operate separately from the Law Society.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/news/stories/law-society-women-lawyers-division-appoints-inaugural-council/ |title=Law Society Women Lawyers Division appoints inaugural council |date=17 July 2013 |publisher=lawsociety.org.uk |accessdate=November 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Discipline===\nIn 1834, the Society first initiated proceedings against dishonest practitioners. By 1907, the Society possessed a statutory disciplinary committee, and was empowered to investigate solicitors' accounts and to issue annual practising certificates. In 1983, the Society established the Office for the Supervision of Solicitors to deal with complaints about solicitors. Complaints regarding the conduct of solicitors are now dealt with by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). However complaints regarding poor service are the remit of the [[Legal Ombudsman]].<ref>http://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/problems/report-solicitor.page#legal-ombudsman</ref>\n\n===Legal education===\nThe [[Solicitors Act 1860]] enabled the Society to create a three-tier examination system.<ref name=\"lawsochistory\" /> In 1903, the Society established its own Law Society School of Law, which later merged with tutorial firm Gibson and Weldon to become the independent [[University of Law|College of Law]]. By 1922 The Law Society required a compulsory academic year for all clerks.\n\n==Regulatory body status==\nFollowing the recommendations of the [http://www.legal-services-review.org.uk/ Clementi Review] The Law Society split its representative and regulatory functions.\n\nComplaints from the public are handled by the [[Legal Ombudsman]] which is a single portal for complaints by the public made against all providers of legal services including the [[Bar of England and Wales|Bar]], [[licensed conveyancer]]s etc., but excluding unqualified will-writers.\n\nThe regulatory body for solicitors is the [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]]. It is a Board of The Law Society although it regulates and enforces regulation completely independently of the Law Society. The Law Society remains the approved regulator, although following the [[Legal Services Act 2007]] a new body, the [[Legal Services Board]] (chaired by Sir Michael Pitt, a government appointee) oversees all the approved regulators including the [[Bar Council]], which has also divested its regulatory functions into the [[Bar Standards Board]].\n\nThe Law Society of England and Wales is a [[Designated Professional Body]] under the Financial Services & Markets Act 2000.\n\n==The Hall of The Law Society==\nLocated at 113 Chancery Lane The Hall of The Law Society is the principal building of the society. Built in 1832 the building is Grade II listed. In addition to offices for its staff the building is used for Law Society conferences and events <ref>https://events.lawsociety.org.uk/</ref> and parts of the building are available on a private hire

In the late 1920s, the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] [[Ararat rebellion]] erupted in the vicinity of Mount Ararat.

The ARF specifically condemns the treaty as a \"gross violation of international law\" and argues that, because the three Transcaucasian republics were under the control of Moscow in 1921, their independent consent was questionable.<ref name=\"arf\">{{cite news |title= ARF Calls Kars Treaty Invalid, Urges End to Protocols |url= http://asbarez.com/94155/arf-calls-kars-treaty-invalid-urges-end-to-protocols |work= [[Asbarez]] |date= 15 March 2011 |accessdate= 24 March 2017}}</ref> The ARF also questions the validity of the treaty based on the authorities of the sides that concluded it. They contend that the Grand National Assembly of Turkey had no legal authority to sign international treaties.<ref name=\"arf\" />  In addition, they argue that because the USSR was not founded until 1922, and therefore not a recognized state, it was also \"not a subject of international law and, naturally, its government had no authority to enter into international treaties.\"<ref name=\"arf\"/>\n\n===Aftermath of the 2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown===\nFollowing the [[2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown|shootdown of the Russian Sukhoi Su-24]] over the [[Syria\u2013Turkey border]] in November 2015 and the rise of [[Russia\u2013Turkey relations|Russo-Turkish tensions]], members of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party of Russia]] proposed annulling the Treaty of Moscow and by extension the Kars treaty.<ref name=\"russia-direct\">{{cite news|last=Shakarian|first=Pietro A.|title=Will Russia cancel its 1921 friendship treaty with Turkey?|url=http://www.russia-direct.org/analysis/how-treaty-1921-could-determine-future-arc-russian-turkish-relations|work=Russia Direct|date=17 February 2016|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"eurasianet\">{{cite news|last=Lomsadze|first=Giorgi|title=Russian Communists Want to Scrap Historic Treaty with Turkey|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/77261|work=[[EurasiaNet]]|date=10 February 2016|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref> Initially, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]] considered this action in order to send a political message to the government of Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]].<ref name=\"russia-direct\"/> However, Moscow ultimately decided against it in its effort to de-escalate tensions with Ankara.<ref>{{cite news|title=RF MFA's letter on impossibility of dissolution of friendship Treaty with Turkey|url=http://rusarminfo.ru/rf-mfas-letter-on-impossibility-of-dissolution-of-friendship-treaty-with-turkey/|work=Russian-Armenian News Agency|date=16 March 2016|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Aftermath of World War I]]\n* [[Armenia\u2013Turkey border]]\n* [[Azerbaijan\u2013Turkey border]]\n* [[Georgia\u2013Turkey border]]\n* [[History of Adjara]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan relations}}\n{{Turkish War of Independence}}\n{{First World War treaties}}\n{{Treaties of Turkey}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Treaty Of Kars}}\n[[Category:1921 in Armenia]]\n[[Category:1921 in Azerbaijan]]\n[[Category:1921 in Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:1921 in Russia]]\n[[Category:1921 in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Armenia\u2013Turkey relations]]\n[[Category:Azerbaijan\u2013Turkey relations]]\n[[Category:Georgia (country)\u2013Turkey relations]]\n[[Category:History of Adjara]]\n[[Category:History of Kars]]\n[[Category:Modern history of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n[[Category:Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n[[Category:Iran\u2013Turkey relations]]\n[[Category:Russian Civil War]]\n[[Category:Russia\u2013Turkey relations]]\n[[Category:Soviet Union\u2013Turkey relations]]\n[[Category:Treaties concluded in 1921|Kars]]\n[[Category:Treaties entered into force in 1922|Kars]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Kars]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Kars]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Kars]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Kars]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Soviet Union|Kars]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Turkish War of Independence|Kars]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Turkey|Kars]]\n[[Category:World War I treaties|Kars]]\n[[Category:October 1921 events]]\n[[Category:Peace treaties of the Soviet Union]]\n", "name_user": "37.252.92.154", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Kars"}
