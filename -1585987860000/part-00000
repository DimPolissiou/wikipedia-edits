The composer wrote the [[libretto]], which is based on [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s [[The Fair at Sorochyntsi (short story)|short story of the same name]], from his early (1832) collection of Ukrainian stories ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka|Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka]]''. The opera remained unfinished and unperformed at Mussorgsky's death in 1881.\n\n==Composition history==\n[[File:N.Gogol by A.Ivanov (1841, Russian museum).jpg|thumb|125px|left|[[Nikolai Gogol|Nikolay Gogol]]<br>(1809\u20131852)]]\nMussorgsky worked on the opera between 1874 and 1880, in competition with his work on ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' (1872&ndash;1880); both were incomplete at the time of his death in 1881. He reused some music that he had written previously (such as the \"Market Scene\" from Act II of the ill-fated ''[[Mlada]]'' of 1872, used for the opening scene of ''Fair'').  Incorporation of the music of ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' as a dream sequence involving the hero was a late addition to the [[scenario]] in the course of composition, despite the fact that such an episode is not suggested by the original story.  Although Mussorgsky managed to complete some numbers and even some of the orchestration, significant portions of the [[scenario]] were left only in bare sketches, or without any music at all.\n\nSeveral subsequent composers and editors (cited below) played partial or maximal roles in bringing the work into a performable state. The first staged performance, with spoken sections, occurred on 8 October 1913 in Moscow under [[Konstantin Saradzhev]]. Beginning in 1917, the first of several fully-sung versions reached the stage.\n\n==Performance history==\nCompleted versions of the opera took place as follows:\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Cui]] version''': 13 October 1917 in [[Petrograd]]'s Theatre of Musical Drama under [[Grzegorz Fitelberg]].\n*'''[[Nikolai Tcherepnin]] version''': 17 March 1923 in [[Monte Carlo]] with Tcherepnin conducting\n*'''[[Nikolai Golovanov]] version''': 10 January 1925 in Moscow's [[Bolshoi Theatre]] with [[Yuri Sakhnovsky]] conducting.\n*'''[[Vissarion Shebalin]] version:''': 12 December 1931 in [[Leningrad]] at the [[Mikhaylovsky Theatre|Maly Opera Theatre]] conducted by [[Samuil Samosud]].\n*'''[[Emil Cooper]]'s version:''' on 3 November 1942 in New York\n\nThe opera was first performed in England on 24 November 1936 by the British Music Drama Opera Company at [[Covent Garden]], staged by [[Vladimir Rosing]], with [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]] conducting.\n\n''The Fair at Sorochyntsi'' is not a part of the standard operatic repertoire in the West.  The best-known numbers from ''Fair'' are the [[orchestra]]l Introduction and the closing [[Hopak|Gopak]]. Mussorgsky also arranged the Gopak and the market scene for piano solo.\n\n[[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] made an arrangement of the Gopak for piano.\n\n[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s version of ''Night on Bald Mountain'' is based mainly on the version included in this opera.\n\nTwo of the Ukrainian folk tunes that Mussorgsky incorporated into this opera (Act 1) were used also by Rimsky-Korsakov in his own ''[[Christmas Eve (opera)|Christmas Eve]]'', which was likewise based on a story by Gogol.\n\n==Roles==\nSource:<ref>[http://100oper.nm.ru/ 100 \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440]</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n!Voice type\n!Premiere Cast,<br>8 October 1913<br>Conductor: Konstantin Saradzhev)\n|-\n|Cherevik\n|[[bass (voice type)|bass]]\n|\n|-\n|Khivrya, ''Cherevik\u2019s wife''\n|[[mezzo-soprano]]\n|\n|-\n|Parasya, ''Cherevik\u2019s daughter, Khivrya\u2019s stepdaughter''\n|[[soprano]]\n|\n|-\n|Kum\n|[[bass-baritone]]\n|\n|-\n|Gritsko, ''a peasant lad''\n|[[tenor]]\n|\n|-\n|Afanasiy Ivanovich, ''a priest\u2019s son''\n|tenor\n|\n|-\n|The gypsy\n|bass\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|''Chorus, silent roles'': Market-women, merchants, [[Romani people|Gypsies]], Jews, [[Cossack]]s, lads, lasses, guests\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|<center>'''Intermezzo''' (Shebalin edition)</center>\n|-\n|[[Chernobog|Chornobog]]\n|bass\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|''Chorus, silent roles'':  [[Koshchei|Kashch\u00e9y]], Cherv' ([[Famine|Worm]]), Chum\u00e1 ([[Epidemic|Plague]]), Topelets, Smert' ([[Death (personification)|Death]]), [[demon]]s, [[witch]]es, [[dwarfism|dwarf]]s\n|-\n|}\n''Note'': The Shebalin edition incorporates the ''[[Night on Bald Mountain#Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad from Sorochints.C3.AF Fair .281880.29|Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043a\u0430|italic=yes}}).\n\n==Synopsis==\n:Time: Beginning of the 19th century\n:Place: The village of [[Velyki Sorochyntsi|Velikiye Sorochynts\u0456]], near [[Poltava]]\n\n===Act 1===\n''Scene 1: The Fair''\n\nMerchants peddle their wares to crowds of visitors arriving from all around. The Gypsy makes reference to a red jacket that the devil is looking for, while the lad Gritsko woos Parasya. Her father, Cherevik, at first is indignant at this forwardness, but, after realizing that Gritsko is the son of a close friend, he agrees to let Gritsko marry his daughter. The two men go into the tavern to celebrate, as evening settles and the people disperse.\n\nCherevik and his buddy, Kum, comes out of the tavern in a drunken state.  After they wander around in the dark, Khrivya, Cherevik's wife, comes out of their house, and he announces Parasya's engagement. But Khivrya objects, and, while Gritsko overhears, drunken Cherevik concedes that the wedding will not happen. Gritsko, alone, bemoans his sadness. The Gypsy enters, and the two make a pact: Gritsko will give the Gypsy his oxen for fifteen rubles if the latter can make Cherevik change his mind.\n\n''Scene 2: Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad (Intermezzo)''\n\nAlone, Gritsko falls asleep and has a dream involving witches and devils.  They are dispelled by church bells.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Kum's Hut''\n\nInside Kum's house, where they are lodging, Khivrya quarrels with Cherevik, getting him to leave, so that she may keep her secret rendezvous with Afanasy Ivanovich, the son of the village priest.  When the latter arrives, she offers him her culinary delicacies, which he devours.  In the midst of their amorous encounter a knock is heard at the door.  Afanasy hides on a shelf, and in walk Cherevik and Kum, with friends, alarmed by a rumor that someone has seen the red jacket and the devil.  Kum tells the full story of the red jacket, concluding with the remark that the devil appears every year at the fair with a pig's face, looking for the red jacket.  Suddenly a pig's snout is seen in the window, and everyone runs about in confusion.\n\n===Act 3===\n''Scene 1: The Street before Kum's Hut''\n\nOn a street, as a result of the superstitious confusion of the previous scene, Cherevik and Kum are being chased by the Gypsy and some lads. The latter accuse the two older men of stealing a mare, and tie them up. Gritsko enters, extracting a promise from Cherevik to have the wedding to Parasya the next day, and the two older men are released.\n\n''Scene 2: The Street before Kum's Hut''\n\nOn a street in front of Kum's house, Parasya at first is sad about Gritsko, but then cheers herself up with a little [[hopak]], in which Cherevik joins without her noticing. Kum and Gritsko enter, and Cherevik blesses the two lovers, only to be met by Khivrya's rage, which prompts the Gypsy to call on the lads to restrain her. The people celebrate the wedding with a hopak.\n\n==Principal arias and numbers==\n*Introduction: \"A Hot Day in Little Russia\" (Orchestra)\n*Aria: Parobok's Dumka (Gritsko)\n*Aria: Parasya's Dumka (Parasya)\n*Finale: [[Hopak]] (Chorus)\n\n==Versions by other hands==\nIn 1881 [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] suggested that [[Anatoly Lyadov]] finish the composition of the work, the libretto to be completed by Mussorgsky's old friend [[Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov]].  However, Lyadov orchestrated only five numbers (published in 1904) and did not finish the opera.  Vyacheslav Karatygin later edited some fragments of Mussorgsky's manuscripts, which were orchestrated by Lyadov and performed in 1911.  The next year Vladimir Senilov published his orchestration of Parasya's [[dumka]] from Act III.  Yury Sakhnovsky edited and orchestrated some fragments which, together with material edited by Lyadov, Karatygin, and Rimsky-Korsakov (i.e., the ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' music) constituted a staged \"premiere\" of sorts, performed at the Moscow Free Theatre on 8 October 1913 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]), with spoken dialogue inserted for scenes without music by Mussorgsky.\n\nIn commemoration of his late comrade from [[The Five (composers)|The Five]], [[C\u00e9sar Cui]] became the first to create a complete version of ''The Fair at Sorochyntsi'' during 1914\u20131916.  This fully sung version \u2013 but without the ''Night on Bald Mountain'' sequence \u2013 was staged on 13 October 1917 (Old Style) at the Theatre of Musical Drama in [[Petrograd]].  The foreword to Cui's edition, dated October 1916, explains the state of affairs at the time, and translates thus:\n\n:The comic opera ''Sorochyntsi Fair'' was begun by Mussorgsky in 1875 ''[sic]'', was composed slowly and in fragments, and after the composer's death in 1881 remained unfinished.  Originally only five excerpts were published:  the Introduction to the opera (adapted according to the preliminary draft by A.K. Lyadov), the Lad's Dumka (ed. by Lyadov), the Gopak, the Scene of Khivrya expecting Afanasiy Ivanovich, and Parasya's Dumka (the orchestral edition of all five numbers belongs to Lyadov).  Mussorgsky's manuscripts nevertheless still afforded a substantial quantity of musical material, namely, the \"scene of the fair\" which begins the opera and the first half of the second act.  This material was adapted by V.G. Karatygin, supplemented and orchestrated by C.A. Cui.  Nevertheless the remainder, in particular the scene of Cherevik and Khivrya and the scene of the Lad and the Gypsy in Act 1, 2nd half, and all of the third [act], with the exception of Parasya's Dumka and the Gopak, is added and orchestrated by C.A. Cui, and consequently Mussorgsky's posthumous labor is completed.\n\nHowever, Cui's version failed to find a permanent place in the repertory, and the opera was completed and orchestrated again by [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]] in 1923 and by [[Vissarion Shebalin]] in 1930. Shebalin's version became the standard since then. This also includes the ''Night on Bald Mountain'' as a prelude to the third act, instead of an interlude in act one (following Gritsko's Dumka), as Mussorgsky originally planned.\n\n==Recordings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Width=\"150\"|Cast:<br />(Cherevik,<br />Khivrya,<br />Parasya,<br/>Gritsko,<br />Afanasiy Ivanovich)\n!Conductor and Orchestra\n!Version\n!Label<ref>[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLMUSORO.HTM  Recordings source: operadis-opera-discography.org.uk]</ref>\n|-\n|1955\n|Latko Koroshetz<br />Bogdana Stritar<br />Vilma Bukovetz<br />Miro Branjnik<br />Slavko Shtrukel\n|Samo Hubad<br />Slovenian National Opera\n|Shebalin\n|LP: Philips,<br/>Cat: A 00329-00330 L\n|-\n|1969\n|Gennadiy Troytsky<br />Antonina Kleshchova<br />Lyudmila Belobragina<br />Aleksey Usmanov<br />Yuriy Yelnikov\n|Yuriy Aranovich<br />Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus\n|Shebalin\n|LP: Melodiya,<br>Cat: D 026823-28;<br>CD: Melodiya-Eurodisc,<br>Cat: GD 69126\n|-\n|1983\n|Vladimir Matorin<br />L.

The composer wrote the [[libretto]], which is based on [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s [[The Fair at Sorochyntsi (short story)|short story of the same name]], from his early (1832) collection of Ukrainian stories ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka|Evenings on a Farm near Dikanka]]''. The opera remained unfinished and unperformed at Mussorgsky's death in 1881.\n\n==Composition history==\n[[File:N.Gogol by A.Ivanov (1841, Russian museum).jpg|thumb|125px|left|[[Nikolai Gogol|Nikolay Gogol]]<br>(1809\u20131852)]]\nMussorgsky worked on the opera between 1874 and 1880, in competition with his work on ''[[Khovanshchina]]'' (1872&ndash;1880); both were incomplete at the time of his death in 1881. He reused some music that he had written previously (such as the \"Market Scene\" from Act II of the ill-fated ''[[Mlada]]'' of 1872, used for the opening scene of ''Fair'').  Incorporation of the music of ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' as a dream sequence involving the hero was a late addition to the [[scenario]] in the course of composition, despite the fact that such an episode is not suggested by the original story.  Although Mussorgsky managed to complete some numbers and even some of the orchestration, significant portions of the [[scenario]] were left without any music at all or only in bare sketches.\n\nSeveral subsequent composers and editors (cited below) played partial or maximal roles in bringing the work into a performable state.  The first staged performance, with spoken sections, occurred on 8 October 1913 in Moscow under [[Konstantin Saradzhev]]. Beginning in 1917, the first of several fully sung versions reached the stage.\n\n==Performance history==\nCompleted versions of the opera took place as follows:\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Cui]] version''': 13 October 1917 in [[Petrograd]]'s Theatre of Musical Drama under [[Grzegorz Fitelberg]].\n*'''[[Nikolai Tcherepnin]] version''': 17 March 1923 in [[Monte Carlo]] with Tcherepnin conducting\n*'''[[Nikolai Golovanov]] version''': 10 January 1925 in Moscow's [[Bolshoi Theatre]] with [[Yuri Sakhnovsky]] conducting.\n*'''[[Vissarion Shebalin]] version:''': 12 December 1931 in [[Leningrad]] at the [[Mikhaylovsky Theatre|Maly Opera Theatre]] conducted by [[Samuil Samosud]].\n*'''[[Emil Cooper]]'s version:''' on 3 November 1942 in New York\n\nThe opera was first performed in England on 24 November 1936 by the British Music Drama Opera Company at [[Covent Garden]], staged by [[Vladimir Rosing]], with [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]] conducting.\n\n''The Fair at Sorochyntsi'' is not a part of the standard operatic repertoire in the West.  The best-known numbers from ''Fair'' are the [[orchestra]]l Introduction and the closing [[Hopak|Gopak]]. Mussorgsky also arranged the Gopak and the market scene for piano solo.\n\n[[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] made an arrangement of the Gopak for piano.\n\n[[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s version of ''Night on Bald Mountain'' is based mainly on the version included in this opera.\n\nTwo of the Ukrainian folk tunes that Mussorgsky incorporated into this opera (Act 1) were used also by Rimsky-Korsakov in his own ''[[Christmas Eve (opera)|Christmas Eve]]'', which was likewise based on a story by Gogol.\n\n==Roles==\nSource:<ref>[http://100oper.nm.ru/ 100 \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440]</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n!Voice type\n!Premiere Cast,<br>8 October 1913<br>Conductor: Konstantin Saradzhev)\n|-\n|Cherevik\n|[[bass (voice type)|bass]]\n|\n|-\n|Khivrya, ''Cherevik\u2019s wife''\n|[[mezzo-soprano]]\n|\n|-\n|Parasya, ''Cherevik\u2019s daughter, Khivrya\u2019s stepdaughter''\n|[[soprano]]\n|\n|-\n|Kum\n|[[bass-baritone]]\n|\n|-\n|Gritsko, ''a peasant lad''\n|[[tenor]]\n|\n|-\n|Afanasiy Ivanovich, ''a priest\u2019s son''\n|tenor\n|\n|-\n|The gypsy\n|bass\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|''Chorus, silent roles'': Market-women, merchants, [[Romani people|Gypsies]], Jews, [[Cossack]]s, lads, lasses, guests\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|<center>'''Intermezzo''' (Shebalin edition)</center>\n|-\n|[[Chernobog|Chornobog]]\n|bass\n|\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\"|''Chorus, silent roles'':  [[Koshchei|Kashch\u00e9y]], Cherv' ([[Famine|Worm]]), Chum\u00e1 ([[Epidemic|Plague]]), Topelets, Smert' ([[Death (personification)|Death]]), [[demon]]s, [[witch]]es, [[dwarfism|dwarf]]s\n|-\n|}\n''Note'': The Shebalin edition incorporates the ''[[Night on Bald Mountain#Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad from Sorochints.C3.AF Fair .281880.29|Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad]]'' ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043a\u0430|italic=yes}}).\n\n==Synopsis==\n:Time: Beginning of the 19th century\n:Place: The village of [[Velyki Sorochyntsi|Velikiye Sorochynts\u0456]], near [[Poltava]]\n\n===Act 1===\n''Scene 1: The Fair''\n\nMerchants peddle their wares to crowds of visitors arriving from all around. The Gypsy makes reference to a red jacket that the devil is looking for, while the lad Gritsko woos Parasya. Her father, Cherevik, at first is indignant at this forwardness, but, after realizing that Gritsko is the son of a close friend, he agrees to let Gritsko marry his daughter. The two men go into the tavern to celebrate, as evening settles and the people disperse.\n\nCherevik and his buddy, Kum, comes out of the tavern in a drunken state.  After they wander around in the dark, Khrivya, Cherevik's wife, comes out of their house, and he announces Parasya's engagement. But Khivrya objects, and, while Gritsko overhears, drunken Cherevik concedes that the wedding will not happen. Gritsko, alone, bemoans his sadness. The Gypsy enters, and the two make a pact: Gritsko will give the Gypsy his oxen for fifteen rubles if the latter can make Cherevik change his mind.\n\n''Scene 2: Dream Vision of the Peasant Lad (Intermezzo)''\n\nAlone, Gritsko falls asleep and has a dream involving witches and devils.  They are dispelled by church bells.\n\n===Act 2===\n''Kum's Hut''\n\nInside Kum's house, where they are lodging, Khivrya quarrels with Cherevik, getting him to leave, so that she may keep her secret rendezvous with Afanasy Ivanovich, the son of the village priest.  When the latter arrives, she offers him her culinary delicacies, which he devours.  In the midst of their amorous encounter a knock is heard at the door.  Afanasy hides on a shelf, and in walk Cherevik and Kum, with friends, alarmed by a rumor that someone has seen the red jacket and the devil.  Kum tells the full story of the red jacket, concluding with the remark that the devil appears every year at the fair with a pig's face, looking for the red jacket.  Suddenly a pig's snout is seen in the window, and everyone runs about in confusion.\n\n===Act 3===\n''Scene 1: The Street before Kum's Hut''\n\nOn a street, as a result of the superstitious confusion of the previous scene, Cherevik and Kum are being chased by the Gypsy and some lads. The latter accuse the two older men of stealing a mare, and tie them up. Gritsko enters, extracting a promise from Cherevik to have the wedding to Parasya the next day, and the two older men are released.\n\n''Scene 2: The Street before Kum's Hut''\n\nOn a street in front of Kum's house, Parasya at first is sad about Gritsko, but then cheers herself up with a little [[hopak]], in which Cherevik joins without her noticing. Kum and Gritsko enter, and Cherevik blesses the two lovers, only to be met by Khivrya's rage, which prompts the Gypsy to call on the lads to restrain her. The people celebrate the wedding with a hopak.\n\n==Principal arias and numbers==\n*Introduction: \"A Hot Day in Little Russia\" (Orchestra)\n*Aria: Parobok's Dumka (Gritsko)\n*Aria: Parasya's Dumka (Parasya)\n*Finale: [[Hopak]] (Chorus)\n\n==Versions by other hands==\nIn 1881 [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] suggested that [[Anatoly Lyadov]] finish the composition of the work, the libretto to be completed by Mussorgsky's old friend [[Arseny Golenishchev-Kutuzov]].  However, Lyadov orchestrated only five numbers (published in 1904) and did not finish the opera.  Vyacheslav Karatygin later edited some fragments of Mussorgsky's manuscripts, which were orchestrated by Lyadov and performed in 1911.  The next year Vladimir Senilov published his orchestration of Parasya's [[dumka]] from Act III.  Yury Sakhnovsky edited and orchestrated some fragments which, together with material edited by Lyadov, Karatygin, and Rimsky-Korsakov (i.e., the ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' music) constituted a staged \"premiere\" of sorts, performed at the Moscow Free Theatre on 8 October 1913 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]]), with spoken dialogue inserted for scenes without music by Mussorgsky.\n\nIn commemoration of his late comrade from [[The Five (composers)|The Five]], [[C\u00e9sar Cui]] became the first to create a complete version of ''The Fair at Sorochyntsi'' during 1914\u20131916.  This fully sung version \u2013 but without the ''Night on Bald Mountain'' sequence \u2013 was staged on 13 October 1917 (Old Style) at the Theatre of Musical Drama in [[Petrograd]].  The foreword to Cui's edition, dated October 1916, explains the state of affairs at the time, and translates thus:\n\n:The comic opera ''Sorochyntsi Fair'' was begun by Mussorgsky in 1875 ''[sic]'', was composed slowly and in fragments, and after the composer's death in 1881 remained unfinished.  Originally only five excerpts were published:  the Introduction to the opera (adapted according to the preliminary draft by A.K. Lyadov), the Lad's Dumka (ed. by Lyadov), the Gopak, the Scene of Khivrya expecting Afanasiy Ivanovich, and Parasya's Dumka (the orchestral edition of all five numbers belongs to Lyadov).  Mussorgsky's manuscripts nevertheless still afforded a substantial quantity of musical material, namely, the \"scene of the fair\" which begins the opera and the first half of the second act.  This material was adapted by V.G. Karatygin, supplemented and orchestrated by C.A. Cui.  Nevertheless the remainder, in particular the scene of Cherevik and Khivrya and the scene of the Lad and the Gypsy in Act 1, 2nd half, and all of the third [act], with the exception of Parasya's Dumka and the Gopak, is added and orchestrated by C.A. Cui, and consequently Mussorgsky's posthumous labor is completed.\n\nHowever, Cui's version failed to find a permanent place in the repertory, and the opera was completed and orchestrated again by [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]] in 1923 and by [[Vissarion Shebalin]] in 1930. Shebalin's version became the standard since then. This also includes the ''Night on Bald Mountain'' as a prelude to the third act, instead of an interlude in act one (following Gritsko's Dumka), as Mussorgsky originally planned.\n\n==Recordings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Width=\"150\"|Cast:<br />(Cherevik,<br />Khivrya,<br />Parasya,<br/>Gritsko,<br />Afanasiy Ivanovich)\n!Conductor and Orchestra\n!Version\n!Label<ref>[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLMUSORO.HTM  Recordings source: operadis-opera-discography.org.uk]</ref>\n|-\n|1955\n|Latko Koroshetz<br />Bogdana Stritar<br />Vilma Bukovetz<br />Miro Branjnik<br />Slavko Shtrukel\n|Samo Hubad<br />Slovenian National Opera\n|Shebalin\n|LP: Philips,<br/>Cat: A 00329-00330 L\n|-\n|1969\n|Gennadiy Troytsky<br />Antonina Kleshchova<br />Lyudmila Belobragina<br />Aleksey Usmanov<br />Yuriy Yelnikov\n|Yuriy Aranovich<br />Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus\n|Shebalin\n|LP: Melodiya,<br>Cat: D 026823-28;<br>CD: Melodiya-Eurodisc,<br>Cat: GD 69126\n|-\n|1983\n|Vladimir Matorin<br />L.
