By far the most important cause is [[Smoking|cigarette smoking]], which contributes to approximately one-half of the [[disease burden]]. [[Chemical Exposure|Chemical exposure]], such as those sustained by workers in the [[petroleum industry]], the manufacture of paints and pigments (e.g., [[aniline]] dyes), and [[agrochemical]]s are known to predispose one to urothelial cancer. The risk is lowered by increased liquid consumption, presumably as a consequence of increased urine production and thus less dwell time on the urothelial surface. Conversely, risk is increased among long-haul truck drivers and others in whom long urine dwell-times are encountered. As with most [[epithelial cancers]], physical [[irritation]] has been associated with increased risk of [[malignant transformation]] of the urothelium. Thus, urothelial carcinomas are more common in the context of chronic [[Urinary stone|urinary stone disease]], chronic [[catheterization]] (as in patients with [[paraplegia]] or [[multiple sclerosis]]), and chronic [[infection]]s. Some particular examples are listed below:\n# Certain drugs, such as [[cyclophosphamide]], via the [[metabolite]]s [[acrolein]] and [[phenacetin]], are predispose to the development of transitional cell carcinomas (the latter especially with respect to the [[upper urinary tract]]).<ref name=\"pmid19689473\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Colin P, Koenig P, Ouzzane A, Berthon N, Villers A, Biserte J, Roupret M |title=Environmental factors involved in carcinogenesis of urothelial cell carcinomas of the upper urinary tract |journal=BJU International |volume=104 |issue=10 |pages=1436\u201340 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19689473 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2009.08838.x}}</ref>\n# [[Radiation]] exposure\n# [[Somatic mutation]], such as deletion of [[Chromosome 9q deletion syndrome|chromosome 9q]], [[Chromosome 9 (human)|9p]], [[Chromosome 11 (human)|11p]], [[Chromosome 17p deletion syndrome|17p]], [[13q deletion syndrome|13q]], [[Chromosome 14 (human)|14q]] and overexpression of [[Ras subfamily|RAS]] ([[oncogene]]) and [[epidermal growth factor receptor]] (EGFR).\n\n==Pathology==\nTransitional cell carcinomas are often multifocal, with 30\u201340% of patients having more than one [[tumor]] at diagnosis.

Treatment for localized stage transitional cell carcinomas is surgical resection of the tumor, but recurrence is common. Some patients are given [[mitomycin]] into the bladder either as a one-off dose in the immediate post-operative period (within 24 hrs) or a few weeks after the surgery as a six dose regimen.\n\nLocalized/early transitional cell carcinomas can also be treated with infusions of [[BCG as a treatment for bladder cancer|Bacille Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin]] into the bladder. These are given weekly for either 6 weeks (induction course) or 3 weeks (maintenance/booster dose). Side effects include a small chance of developing systemic [[tuberculosis]] or the patient becoming sensitized to BCG, causing severe intolerance and a possible reduction in bladder volume due to scarring.\n\nIn patients with evidence of early muscular invasion, radical curative surgery in the form of a cysto-prostatectomy usually with lymph node sampling can also be performed. In such patients, a bowel loop is often used to create either a \"neo-bladder\" or an \"ileal conduit\" which act as a place for the storage of urine before it is evacuated from the body either via the urethra or a urostomy respectively.\n\n===Advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinomas ===\nFirst-line [[chemotherapy]] regimens for advanced or metastatic transitional cell carcinomas consists of [[gemcitabine]] and [[cisplatin]]) or a combination of [[methotrexate]], [[vinblastine]], [[adriamycin]], and [[cisplatin]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=von der Maase|first=H|author2=Hansen, SW|author3=Roberts, JT|author4=Dogliotti, L|author5=Oliver, T|author6=Moore, MJ|author7=Bodrogi, I|author8=Albers, P|author9=Knuth, A|author10=Lippert, CM|author11=Kerbrat, P|author12=Sanchez Rovira, P|author13=Wersall, P|author14=Cleall, SP|author15=Roychowdhury, DF|author16=Tomlin, I|author17=Visseren-Grul, CM|author18=Conte, PF |title=Gemcitabine and cisplatin versus methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin in advanced or metastatic bladder cancer: results of a large, randomized, multinational, multicenter, phase III study. |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |date=September 2000 |volume=18|issue=17|pages=3068\u201377 |pmid=11001674 |doi=10.1200/jco.2000.18.17.3068}}</ref> \n\nTaxanes or [[vinflunine]] have been used as second-line therapy (after progression on a platinum containing chemotherapy).<ref>[http://www.oncnursingnews.com/web-exclusives/immunotherapy-proceeds-to-change-bladder-cancer-treatment ''Immunotherapy Proceeds to Change Bladder Cancer Treatment'' 2017]</ref>\n\n[[Immunotherapy]] such as [[pembrolizumab]] is often used as second-line therapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has progressed despite treatment with GC or MVAC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Syn|first=Nicholas L|last2=Teng|first2=Michele W L|last3=Mok|first3=Tony S K|last4=Soo|first4=Ross A|title=De-novo and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint targeting|url= |journal=The Lancet Oncology|language=en|volume=18|issue=12|pages=e731\u2013e741|doi=10.1016/s1470-2045(17)30607-1|pmid=29208439|year=2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016 FDA granted [[accelerated approval]] to [[atezolizumab]] for locally advanced or metastatic [[urothelial carcinoma]] treatment after failure of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.<ref name=FDA-BC-2016>{{cite news|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm501762.htm|title=FDA approves new, targeted treatment for bladder cancer|date=18 May 2016|publisher=FDA|access-date=20 May 2016}}</ref> The [[Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_IV|confirmatory trial]] (to convert the accelerated approval into a full approval) failed to achieve its [[primary endpoint]] of [[overall survival]].<ref>[https://www.healio.com/hematology-oncology/genitourinary-cancer/news/print/hemonc-today/%7B94ed7cf7-ff28-496d-8980-5e7618bf3e1b%7D/failed-confirmatory-trial-raises-questions-about-atezolizumab-for-advanced-urothelial-cancer Failed confirmatory trial raises questions about atezolizumab for advanced urothelial cancer.

Leadership of the conference essentially consists of 2 trained baboons with no knowledge of college sports. Its [[College football|football]] teams participate in the Division I [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS). The 12 member institutions of the Sun Belt are doomed and are located primarily across the [[southern United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sunbelt 2016.png|thumb|400px|Map of full member institutions of the Sun Belt Conference in 2016]]\n\nThe Sun Belt Conference was founded on August 4, 1976 with the [[University of New Orleans]], the [[University of South Alabama]], [[Georgia State University]], [[Jacksonville University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], and the [[University of South Florida]]. Over the next ten years the conference would add [[Western Kentucky University]], [[Old Dominion University]], the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], and [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. New Orleans was forced out of the league in 1980 due to its small on-campus gymnasium that the Conference did not deem suitable for Conference competition. UNO competed as an independent before joining the newly formed [[American South Conference]] in 1987.\n\nAfter the 1990\u201391 basketball season, all members of the Sun Belt, except Western Kentucky, South Alabama, and Jacksonville, departed for other conferences.

It originally consisted of seven football playing schools, three of which are still members of the conference.  Up until 2009, the conference only had a contract with one bowl, the [[New Orleans Bowl]].  Following the Sun Belt's improved football success and geographical membership changes, other bowls began to sign contracts with the Sun Belt Conference. {{as of|2019|11}}, the conference has six [[bowl game]] tie-ins.\n\nThroughout the years, the conference has experienced flux in membership changes, similar to many other FBS conferences.  The conference announced that beginning in 2018, the conference (10 teams after the departure of [[Idaho Vandals football|Idaho]] and [[New Mexico State Aggies football|New Mexico State]])<ref>{{cite press release|title=Sun Belt Football to Be 10 Teams in 2018|date=March 1, 2016|publisher=Sun Belt Conference|url=http://sunbeltsports.org/news/2016/3/1/FB_0301161055.aspx|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> will be divided into two divisions for football: East: [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]], [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers football|Coastal Carolina]], [[Georgia Southern Eagles football|Georgia Southern]], [[Georgia State Panthers football|Georgia State]], and [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]]; West: [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]], [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns football|Louisiana]], [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Louisiana\u2013Monroe]], [[South Alabama Jaguars football|South Alabama]], and [[Texas State Bobcats football|Texas State]].

Originally a non-football conference, the Sun Belt began sponsoring football in 2001. Its [[College football|football]] teams participate in the Division I [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS). The 12 member institutions of the Sun Belt are distributed primarily across the [[southern United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sunbelt 2016.png|thumb|400px|Map of full member institutions of the Sun Belt Conference in 2016]]\n\nThe Sun Belt Conference was founded on August 4, 1976 with the [[University of New Orleans]], the [[University of South Alabama]], [[Georgia State University]], [[Jacksonville University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]], and the [[University of South Florida]]. Over the next ten years the conference would add [[Western Kentucky University]], [[Old Dominion University]], the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], and [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. New Orleans was forced out of the league in 1980 due to its small on-campus gymnasium that the Conference did not deem suitable for Conference competition. UNO competed as an independent before joining the newly formed [[American South Conference]] in 1987.\n\nAfter the 1990\u201391 basketball season, all members of the Sun Belt, except Western Kentucky, South Alabama, and Jacksonville, departed for other conferences. The Sun Belt, including incoming member in the [[University of Arkansas at Little Rock]], then merged with the [[American South Conference]], made up of [[Arkansas State University]], [[Louisiana Tech University]], the University of Southwestern Louisiana (now the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]]), the [[University of Texas\u2013Pan American]] (now merged into the [[University of Texas Rio Grande Valley]]), New Orleans (re-joined), [[Lamar University]], and the [[University of Central Florida]]. Although the American South was the larger conference, the merged league retained the Sun Belt name. In 1991, the league first began to explore the idea of sponsoring football.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1991-07-03-9107030173-story.html|title=UCF HOPES TO FIND FAME IN EXPANDED SUN BELT|last=Staff|first=Russ White of The Sentinel|website=OrlandoSentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\nCentral Florida left the league following the 1991\u201392 academic year due to a dispute over television rights, among other reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2136&context=centralfloridafuture|title=UCF ends marriage with Sun Belt Conference|last=Meadows|first=Dave|date=May 20, 1992|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/231205544/|title=The Orlando Sentinel from Orlando, Florida on May 20, 1992 \u00b7 Page 70|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> Lamar, Texas\u2013Pan American, and Jacksonville departed at the end of the 1997\u201398 academic year.

These new members gave the Sun Belt seven football playing members in their first season, as Arkansas State and Louisiana\u2013Lafayette were already full members which sponsored football. Another Big West school, [[Utah State University]], was added as a \"football-only\" member in 2003, then departed in [[2005 in sports|2005]] with Idaho and New Mexico State for the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC).\n\nIn 2004, [[Troy University]] became a \"football-only\" member until the Trojans joined the conference in all sports, effectively in the 2005-06 academic year. In 2005, [[Florida Atlantic University|Florida Atlantic]] became a \"football-only\" member until the Owls joined the conference in all sports, effectively in the 2006-07 academic year. In 2006, Louisiana\u2013Monroe joined the conference as an all-sports full member when the Warhawks left their former home, the [[Southland Conference]].\n\nLongtime Sun Belt member [[Western Kentucky University|Western Kentucky]] joined the Sun Belt's football conference in 2009 after its Board of Regents voted to upgrade the school's football program to [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://wku.edu/news/releases06/november/football.html|publisher=[[Western Kentucky University]]|title=WKU Regents Approve Move To Division 1-A Football|date=November 2, 2006|access-date=November 3, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115123929/http://wku.edu/news/releases06/november/football.html|archive-date=January 15, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn November 11, 2009, New Orleans announced it was investigating a move from [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]].

It originally consisted of seven football playing schools, three of which are still members of the conference.  Up until 2009, the conference only had a contract with one bowl, the [[New Orleans Bowl]].  Following the Sun Belt's improved football success and geographical membership changes, other bowls began to sign contracts with the Sun Belt Conference. {{as of|2019|11}}, the conference has six [[bowl game]] tie-ins.\n\nThroughout the years, the conference has experienced flux in membership changes, similar to many other FBS conferences.  The conference announced that beginning in 2018, the conference (10 teams after the departure of [[Idaho Vandals football|Idaho]] and [[New Mexico State Aggies football|New Mexico State]])<ref>{{cite press release|title=Sun Belt Football to Be 10 Teams in 2018|date=March 1, 2016|publisher=Sun Belt Conference|url=http://sunbeltsports.org/news/2016/3/1/FB_0301161055.aspx|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> will be divided into two divisions for football: East: [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]], [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers football|Coastal Carolina]], [[Georgia Southern Eagles football|Georgia Southern]], [[Georgia State Panthers football|Georgia State]], and [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]]; West: [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]], [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns football|Louisiana]], [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Louisiana\u2013Monroe]], [[South Alabama Jaguars football|South Alabama]], and [[Texas State Bobcats football|Texas State]].

He writes to her son, Ryan, who is in fact his own son, telling him he intends to return. After years of raising horses and living a solitary life, Blackthorn sets off for [[Potos\u00ed]] to sell his horses. He tells his lover, Yana ([[Magaly Solier]]), that he will see her again before leaving Bolivia.\n\nAt Potos\u00ed, Blackthorn withdraws his savings from the bank, sells his horses, and then heads back to his village. Along the way, he is ambushed and nearly killed. He shoots his attacker, but not before Blackthorn's horse, Cinco, bolts off with his money. The shooter is Eduardo Apodaca ([[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]]), a [[Spaniard]] mining engineer who claims he was shooting at pursuers. He begs Blackthorn to save him, and offers to share part of the $50,000 he stole from [[Sim\u00f3n Pati\u00f1o]], a powerful Bolivian industrialist and mine owner. The money is hidden in an abandoned mine, and he will compensate Blackthorn for his help.\n\nBlackthorn and the Spaniard set out across the desert plateau with Pati\u00f1o's posse within a day's pursuit. They reach the abandoned mine and find the money, but the posse catches up with them. Following a shootout, Blackthorn and the Spaniard escape with the money. They make their way to Blackthorn's cabin, where the famous outlaw remembers his old friendships with the [[Sundance Kid]] and Etta Place, and how they escaped from Pinkerton Detective Mackinley ([[Stephen Rea]]). Yana joins the men at the cabin, and Blackthorn gives her a pocket watch he won in a card game. At first she rejects it as a \"gringo machine\", but then accepts the gift as something to remember him by.  Despite his asking her to spend one last night with him, she advises she must return to her own family.  Later that night, Yana returns to the cabin to stay with Blackthorn on his last night before leaving.\n\nThe next morning, two female members of the posse come to the cabin looking for the Spaniard, and in the ensuing gunfight, Blackthorn is wounded, and Yana is killed. A heartbroken Blackthorn and the Spaniard leave with the rest of the posse not far behind. They set out across the [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]] salt flats, hoping to reach the coast where Blackthorn can find a boat to take him home. Halfway across, the posse catches up to them, but Blackthorn and the Spaniard split up and are able to kill their pursuers and escape.\n\nWhen he reaches [[Tupiza]], Blackthorn is treated by a doctor, who notifies former Pinkerton Detective Mackinley\u2014now living a quiet life in Bolivia\u2014of his famous patient. Mackinley confirms the man's identity. For years Mackinley claimed that the two bandits killed at San Vincente were not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and now he will finally be proven correct. But after initially notifying the Bolivian army of the discovered outlaw, Mackinley changes his mind, returns Blackthorn's pistol, and helps him escape. When Mackinley later discovers that Blackthorn was involved with the Spaniard, he reveals the truth to him about the Spaniard and his pursuers. Apparently, the $50,000 the Spaniard stole was not from the powerful mine owner, Pati\u00f1o, but from the mining families who recently took control of the mines. The Spaniard stole the money from \"the people\"\u2014something Butch Cassidy would never have done. Although disgusted with Blackthorn's involvement, Mackinley does not betray him.\n\nIn flashbacks to those days when he and the Sundance Kid rode together, he recalls how his partner, being wounded and near death, asks for Butch to \"do it,\" and so Butch regretfully and lovingly takes the life of his best friend.\n\nIn the present, Blackthorn, distressed, tracks the Spaniard into the [[Andes]], with the Bolivian army not far behind. When Blackthorn catches up with him and confronts him with the truth, the Spaniard does not deny it, saying the money he stole was indeed from the mine owners\u2014just \"different owners.\" Blackthorn shoots the Spaniard in the leg and leaves him and the money for the Bolivian army, who soon arrive and kill the thief. The soldiers continue on with Mackinley until they reach a notoriously barren region, at which point the army commander leaves the detective alone and without a horse, as punishment for helping Blackthorn escape.\n\nIn the closing scene, Blackthorn, remembering his life and friends in better days, is last seen looking back over his shoulder and presumably escaping across the mountains.<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=Mateo Gil (Director) |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629705/ |title=Blackthorn |medium=DVD  |publisher= Magnolia Home Entertainment |location=Los Angeles |date=2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as James Blackthorn/[[Butch Cassidy]]\n* [[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]] as Ing.

He writes to her son, Ryan, who is in fact his own son, telling him he intends to return. After years of raising horses and living a solitary life, Blackthorn sets off for [[Potos\u00ed]] to sell his horses. He tells his lover, Yana ([[Magaly Solier]]), that he will see her again before leaving Bolivia.\n\nAt Potos\u00ed, Blackthorn withdraws his savings from the bank, sells his horses, and then heads back to his village. Along the way, he is ambushed and nearly killed. He shoots his attacker, but not before Blackthorn's horse, Cinco, bolts off with his money. The shooter is Eduardo Apodaca ([[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]]), a [[Spaniard]] mining engineer who claims he was shooting at pursuers. He begs Blackthorn to save him, and offers to share part of the $50,000 he stole from [[Sim\u00f3n Pati\u00f1o]], a powerful Bolivian industrialist and mine owner. The money is hidden in an abandoned mine, and he will compensate Blackthorn for his help.\n\nBlackthorn and the Spaniard set out across the desert plateau with Pati\u00f1o's posse within a day's pursuit. They reach the abandoned mine and find the money, but the posse catches up with them. Following a shootout, Blackthorn and the Spaniard escape with the money. They make their way to Blackthorn's cabin, where the famous outlaw remembers his old friendships with the [[Sundance Kid]] and Etta Place, and how they escaped from Pinkerton Detective Mackinley ([[Stephen Rea]]). Yana joins the men at the cabin, and Blackthorn gives her a pocket watch he won in a card game. At first she rejects it as a \"gringo machine\", but then accepts the gift as something to remember him by.  Despite his asking her to spend one last night with him, she advises she must return to her own family.  Later that night, Yana returns to the cabin to stay with Blackthorn on his last night before leaving.\n\nThe next morning, two female members of the posse come to the cabin looking for the Spaniard, and in the ensuing gunfight, Blackthorn is wounded, and Yana is killed. A heartbroken Blackthorn and the Spaniard leave with the rest of the posse not far behind. They set out across the [[Salar de Uyuni|Uyuni]] salt flats, hoping to reach the coast where Blackthorn can find a boat to take him home. Halfway across, the posse catches up to them, but Blackthorn and the Spaniard split up and are able to kill their pursuers and escape.\n\nWhen he reaches [[Tupiza]], Blackthorn is treated by a doctor, who notifies former Pinkerton Detective Mackinley\u2014now living a quiet life in Bolivia\u2014of his famous patient. Mackinley confirms the man's identity. For years Mackinley claimed that the two bandits killed at San Vincente were not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and now he will finally be proven correct. But after initially notifying the Bolivian army of the discovered outlaw, Mackinley changes his mind, returns Blackthorn's pistol, and helps him escape. When Mackinley later discovers that Blackthorn was involved with the Spaniard, he reveals the truth to him about the Spaniard and his pursuers. Apparently, the $50,000 the Spaniard stole was not from the powerful mine owner, Pati\u00f1o, but from the mining families who recently took control of the mines. The Spaniard stole the money from \"the people\"\u2014something Butch Cassidy would never have done. Although disgusted with Blackthorn's involvement, Mackinley does not betray him.\n\nIn flashbacks to those days when he and the Sundance Kid rode together, he recalls how his partner, being wounded and near death, asks for Butch to \"do it,\" and so Butch regretfully and lovingly takes the life of his best friend.\n\nIn the present, Blackthorn, distressed, tracks the Spaniard into the [[Andes]], with the Bolivian army not far behind. When Blackthorn catches up with him and confronts him with the truth, the Spaniard does not deny it, saying the money he stole was indeed from the mine owners\u2014just \"different owners.\" Blackthorn shoots the Spaniard in the leg and leaves him and the money for the Bolivian army, who soon arrive and kill the thief. The soldiers continue on with Mackinley until they reach a notoriously barren region, at which point the army commander leaves the detective alone and without a horse, as punishment for helping Blackthorn escape.\n\nIn the closing scene, Blackthorn, remembering his life and friends in better days, is last seen looking back over his shoulder and presumably escaping across the mountains.<ref name=\"dvd\">{{cite video |people=Mateo Gil (Director) |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1629705/ |title=Blackthorn |medium=DVD  |publisher= Magnolia Home Entertainment |location=Los Angeles |date=2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as James Blackthorn/[[Butch Cassidy]]\n* [[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]] as Ing.
