The Orinoco watershed covers an area of about 990000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, making it the third largest in South America, covering most of [[Venezuela]] and eastern part of [[Colombia]].\n\nThe Orinoco is one of the most important rivers in the world due to its length and flow (2140&nbsp;km and more than 30000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s),<ref>Historial del caudal del Orinoco desde 1969, en Musinacio {{cite web |url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/part%274/SOUTH_AMERICA/Venezuela/3vn%60or~2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193548/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/part'4/SOUTH_AMERICA/Venezuela/3vn%60or~2.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> the extent of its basin (1 million km<sup>2</sup>) and especially its historical importance and economic and the meaning it has had for Venezuela, where most of its basin is spread, with almost two-thirds of it. It is probably the largest river in the world in relation to its basin, similar in extent to that of the [[Danube]] but five times greater in volume.  Its discharge is the third largest of any river worldwide, after the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and the [[Congo River|Congo]], and much greater than that of many rivers of greater length and basin area.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Orinoco river basin synthesizes the three great forms of relief that exist in nature: ancient massifs and shields on the one hand, recently raised (that is the [[Cenozoic|Tertiary]]) ridges on the other and tectonic depressions and basins or accumulation plains, in third place. Each of these forms of relief has its own characteristics, but also its similarities with similar natural regions of other parts of the world. For any country, especially in the inter-tropical zone, it represents a great ecological and economic advantage to have represented in its territory these three forms of relief.  The only other countries in the Americas with a similar geological disposition are Canada and the United States.\n\nTo define the Orinoco basin as a natural region, it is necessary to establish the geographic characteristics that define it, such as extension, relief, [[climate]], [[hydrography]], [[vegetation]], soils, and mineral resources.\n\n== Extension ==\nThe Orinoco basin covers an area of almost 989000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of which 643480&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or slightly more than 65% remain in Venezuelan territory, while the remaining 35% is in Colombian territory in the Colombian Llanos and The eastern slope of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia, a stretch of the great mountain range of the Andes. This Colombian region is called [[Orinoqu\u00eda natural region|Orinoqu\u00eda]]. Of the part located in Venezuela, just over half extend from the Venezuelan Andes and the Cordillera de la Costa to the north-western bank of the Orinoco River (the left bank), forming most of the Venezuelan plains and the delta Orinoco. The southern part of the basin contains most of the waters that come from the [[Guayana venezolana|Venezuelan Guiana]].\n\n== Relief ==\n[[File:Roraima-Tepui Plateau.jpg|thumb|The top of Roraima, the highest Tepui of Venezuelan Guayana. The curious shapes have been produced by erosion.]]\n\nThe sources of the Orinoco River are located at Cerro [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], at 1047 meters above sea level, discovered in 1951 by the Franco-Venezuelan expedition that went back and explored the Upper Orinoco course to the [[Parima Mountains|Sierra Parima]], headed By Venezuelan army officer Frank Risquez Iribarren. The first reference to this expedition was that of Alberto Contramaestre Torres in 1954.<ref>Alberto Contramaestre Torres. Expedici\u00f3n a las fuentes del Orinoco. Caracas, 1954.</ref> And there are other references to this expedition, for example, that of Pablo J. Anduce.<ref>Pablo J. Anduce. ''Shailili-Ko. Descubrimiento de las fuentes del Orinoco''. Caracas: Talleres Gr\u00e1ficos Ilustraciones S. A., 1960</ref> From the birth of the Orinoco at the foot of the hill Delgado Chalbaud (02\u00ba19\u201905\u201d07 Of latitude north, 63\u00ba21\u201942\u201d63 of longitude west and 1047.35 meters of altitude) until its opening in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the Orinoco describes a great arc and its basin extends like fan, reason why the north-western part Of the basin is somewhat more extensive than the south-east.\n\nAs already indicated, the two sub-regions of the basin have quite different characteristics, due to differences in their geological constitution. The maximum height of the basin is located in the [[Sierra Nevada del Cocuy]], in Colombia (more than 5000 meters above sea level), which forms part of the Eastern Andean Cordillera of Colombia.\n\nThe north-western edge of the basin would consist of the Colombian-Venezuelan Andean slopes and the southern slopes of other mountainous reliefs of northern Venezuela, while the southern edge of the basin would be marked for the most part by the watershed between the Orinoco and the Amazon, which is located on the Guayan\u00e9s massif. Between the two sides extends the Venezuelan Guayana on the right bank of the Orinoco and the Llanos, both Colombian and Venezuelan on the left bank. As we see, the Orinoco river itself marks the natural boundary between these two regions; it could be said that the Orinoco is one of the most remarkable natural borders in the world, although this fact has a simple explanation: the rivers have little slope and have been building for millions of years a level of accumulation with the sediments that they carry from the mountain ranges where they are born. And it is these sediments that push the channel of the Orinoco against the Guayanese shield itself, to the point that in most of its course, the channel is riding on the rocks of the guayan\u00e9s shield, as can be seen in Piedra del Medium in front of [[Ciudad Bol\u00edvar]] (before Angostura). The ancient name of Bolivar City, Angostura of the Orinoco is due to the fact that the rocks of the shield are very resistant to the erosion and presented in that point, a narrowing of about 800 meters of width that gave origin to a species of imprisonment during, probably, millions of years, until the river was gradually excavating the channel on granite rocks.\n\n[[File:Orinocometer.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|The Piedra del Medio, located in front of Ciudad Bolivar is a kind of '' nilometer '' or '' orino-meter '' in this case, in which the lines of different coloration indicate the successive levels reached by the water.]]\n\nThus, the Venezuelan Guiana constitutes, unlike the Llanos, a surface of erosion. From the combination of these two forces that modify the relief, a constructive one, the sedimentation and another destructive one, the erosion, arises the current situation in which the river marks approximately the limit between the two regions. As can be seen from the above, this limit presents exceptions since, in some sections, rounded hills of granite origin (and therefore, Guayan reliefs) can be seen on the left bank of the Orinoco, that is, on the border of the Llanos. In the stone of the middle, you can see the different levels reached by the waters of the river, expressed in the different coloration of the granite, which explains the value of this granite island as \"nilometer\" - according to [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alejandro de Humboldt]]. These lines of distinct coloring should not be interpreted as a reduction of river flow over geological time, but as a descent of river level with sediment transport from the bottom to the sea: we recall that the river delta (almost 40000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was built with these sediments, while granitic rocks (such as Piedra del Medio) have been much more resistant to erosion.\n\nOn the other hand, the sandstones of the Venezuelan Guayana (of the Roraima formation) have been transformed into sand by the erosion that, although never very intense by the extra-ordinary resistance of the rocks, has been very durable (more than 1 billion of years), for which the sedimentary cover has been transformed into an inverted relief that forms the Tepuis. Moreover, were it not for the fact that the Guayanese Massif has been suffering a slow and long movement of ascent, in the present time it would have already become a penillanura in which almost all the sedimentary cover of sandstones would have disappeared. The sands coming from this erosive process have been deposited in the left bank of the river, especially in the low plains of Apure state, between the rivers [[Meta River|Meta]] and [[Apure]] itself. They were not deposited in the right border because there the relief is higher. And these sands could become over millions of years in strata of sandstones that could also become converted to rise and rejuvenate the relief on plateaus similar to those that now exist in Guyana. This would be a kind of example of the theory of the [[Ciclo geogr\u00e1fico|geographical cycle]].\n\nIn turn, these sands have come to create a unique eco-system in the world: an extensive dune field (occupies about 30,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) that has the peculiarity that it is not a desert climate but a savanna climate in a landscape of natural pastures that alternate with some gallery forests, flowing rivers and [[dune]]s of more than 100&nbsp;km in length and up to 20&nbsp;m in height.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magazine.com.ve/turismo/index.php?id=3303&idSec=8&accion=detalle |title= Ruta de Gallegos: para ver m\u00e9danos y playas de agua dulce en Apure Parte II|accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Magazine Digital |language= Spanish}}</ref> Some of these dunes are used by the [[Llanero]] to establish in them the cheese,<ref>Fernando Calzadilla Vald\u00e9s. ''Por los llanos de Apure''.

They also serve to protect the livestock from floods. Thus, this eco-system so curious and picturesque, is the result of wind modeling in a savannah climate. It is not, as stated in the Atlas of Venezuela. A spatial image (also known as the Atlas of [[PDVSA]],<ref>[[PDVSA]]. ''Atlas de Venezuela. Una visi\u00f3n espacial''. Caracas: Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda, 1992</ref> of a paleodunas eco-system formed in an environment with a climate much drier than the present one, but of a mechanism of formation of dunes that only acts during the dry season since. When the level of the waters of the Orinoco falls due to the drought of the rivers, especially those that come from the Llanos, they remain extensive beaches of very fine sand, that the trade winds soon transfer towards the south-east forming what now constitutes the [[Santos Luzardo National Park]], a name taken from one of the main characters in [[Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara]]'s novel by [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]].\n\nThe direction of the winds during the dry season (of the summer as it is said in the Llanos) is on average very constant and with a considerable speed, from the north-east to the south-west, as can be seen in the direction of the elongated dunes in satellite images. This address may vary for a short time but in the long run it is maintained exactly in that direction. In the rainy season (or winter) the direction changes slightly and proceeds practically from the free east. But this is not the most remarkable change, but the decrease of its speed. This is due to the greater humidity that the trade winds bring and to the consequent convection: as the wet winds advance on the savanna they increase of temperature by the heat of the ground due to the solar radiation. In turn, this warming gives rise to the rise of moist air (precisely what we know as convection) and this rise gives rise, in turn, to a decrease in the speed of the winds and the increase of precipitation. So the mechanism of the winds and that of the accumulation of the sands from the Guayanese Massif are almost opposite and this opposition has been favorable for the establishment of agricultural activities in the Llanos: the dunes can become covered with vegetation and serve. The basis for the establishment of houses, herds and roads, and this process becomes more noticeable to the west, not only by the decrease of the speed of the winds as they move in that direction but also because the sands they form. These dunes come from the beaches of the Orinoco and the transport of the same diminishes when the speed of the wind descends. Fernando Calzadilla Vald\u00e9s explains all this process in the central part of the [[Apure state]], where he begins what he calls the Alto Llano, although this concept is not established with a certain level that throughout the Apure is very low until reaching the true piedmont of the Andes (established modern, this yes, in the curve of level of the 200 altitude.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Klimadiagramm-metrisch-deutsch-Ciudad Bolivar.Venezuela.png|thumb|350px|right|Climograph of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar. Rains are indicated in mm and temperatures in \u00b0C.]]\n\nAcross the Orinoco basin, climates are isothermal, i.e, climates with few temperature variations throughout the year (the difference between the average temperature of the warmer months and the less warm months is only 3\u00b0C), as corresponds to the inter-tropical zone. Five major types of climate in the lowlands (up to 800 m above sea level, according to the considerations of [[Antonio W. Goldbrunner]]), which are the [[tropical rainforest climate|jungle climate]] (Af in the K\u00f6ppen classification), [[tropical savanna climate|savanna]] (Aw in the same climatic classification), the semi-desert and the desert proper. It is disputed whether there is a [[tropical monsoon climate|monsoon climate]] (according to the K\u00f6ppen nomenclature) in the Orinoco basin, which would become the fifth type of climate. In any case, the existence of this climate would be reduced to the Atlantic coast of the Orinoco delta, where the influence of the northern equatorial current (which here is practically a coastal drift) influences to make the rains much more important On the whole coast common to the Guianas and Venezuela, but that diminish abruptly in Venezuela when advancing inland. At higher altitudes four or five thermal, climatic, biotic or ecological floors can be distinguished according to criteria used by different authors and their interest in their field of research. Temperatures have a very limited annual amplitude (about 3\u00b0C or less), although their daily amplitude is much higher and around 10\u00b0C. Rainfall is high, especially in Venezuelan Guayana, where it reaches very high values (4000 mm or more) in some fairly extensive areas. In Los Llanos, rainfall is much lower (1500 to 2000 mm, with an elevation of this amount towards the foothills of the Andes) and gives rise to the presence of savanna vegetation, with gallery forests next to the rivers, and in the Andean piedmont, tropophile forests, which lose much of their leaves during the dry season. The climate chart of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar shows the behavior of rains (blue line) and temperature (red line). The shading in yellow indicates the season or season of drought (deficit of precipitations, according to the xerothermic index of Gaussen). However, Ciudad Bol\u00edvar's climate is not representative of the entire Orinoco basin, but is rather an anomaly, in the sense that, because of its location with respect to the prevailing winds (by the action of mountains north-eastern Venezuela and the plateaus of the south-east) and this city being somewhat distant from the sea (the influence of the rainfall of the coastal drift in the Venezuelan Atlantic coasts), the precipitations are quite smaller than they should be.\n\n==== Climate for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n ====\n* Current climate conditions for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n ([[Bol\u00edvar (state)|Bolivar state]]):\n** Location: latitude 4\u00ba36'N, longitude 61\u00ba06'W, altitude, 910 mm.\n** Temperature: January (21.6\u00b0C), February (22\u00b0C), March (22.5\u00b0C), April (22.3\u00b0C), May (22\u00b0C), June (21.5\u00b0C), July (21.5\u00b0C), August (21.5\u00b0C), September (22\u00b0C), October (22.1\u00b0C), November (22\u00b0C), December (21.8\u00b0C).

The two stripes can be seen by the different coloration of the two rivers.]]\n\nThe Orinoco, with its tributaries, constitutes an extensive hydrographic network with rivers very flowing and of considerable length. Of all its basin, the longest tributary is the Guaviare, longer (about 1550 km) than the Orinoco itself at the point of its confluence, while the largest is the Caroni. Many of its tributaries are navigable rivers, especially those on the left bank, which come from the Llanos, both Colombian and Venezuelan, while the Guayan rivers (tributaries on the right bank) are more flowing but with jumps and rains, which make them very useful in the production of hydro-electric energy, but without use as navigational routes, except for some very short stretches. There are numerous islands, both rocky (erosion reliefs) and sedimentary (sand and other sediments), as well as many pipes or arms, abandoned meanders and horseshoe lakes.\n\nThe main tributaries on the right bank are the Manaviche, Ocamo, Padamo (with its Matacuni tributary on its left bank), Cunucunuma, Ventuari (very flowing river, with its Manapiare tributary on the right), Sipapo with its tributaries Autana and Cuao, both on the right), Samariapo, Parguaza (with several tributaries with a curious bayonet drainage), Suapure, Cuchivero river (with its tributary Guaniamo, on the left bank, a river where the gold has been exploited for a long time), the Caura (with its Erebato tributary on its left bank), a very flowing river and with one of the most notable leaps of Guayana (not so much because of its height but Caudal), the Par\u00e1 jump, the Aro and finally the Caron\u00ed with its tributary the Paragua, dammed both rivers in the Necoima Canyon or Necuima, in a hydro-electric dam of more than 200 m of height that originates a reservoir, the Lake of Guri, with more than 4000 km<sup>2</sup> of surface and a production of about 10 million kW/hour, which defines it as one of the most valuable and productive rivers in the world: to date, the production of the Guri hydro-electric power station is only surpassed by the Itaip\u00fa hydro-electric power station, in the Paran\u00e1 River. In the Cuao river basin (except for the long, or horseshoe-shaped lagoons formed by some abandoned meanders), the only lagoon in the basin: the lagoon of King Leopold, so named because it was discovered during an expedition sponsored by King Leopold III Of Belgium a little more than 50 years ago (at the moment it is very easy to observe it through programs with satellite images, generally of free access in Internet). This lagoon has about 400 m of length by 270 of width, approximately. It is the only lagoon in Venezuelan Guiana, which confirms the irregular nature of the relief of this natural region, which is not favorable to them, and also contradicts the myth of the sixteenth century, of the existence of a huge lake (Lake Parima) from which the Orinoco and Amazon rivers were born, with almost all its tributaries.\n\nOn the left bank we can mention the Mavaca, the unique case in the Casiquiare world (which is not a tributary but, on the contrary, an effluent, that is to say, a derivation of the Orinoco that drains its waters towards the Amazon basin through the Negro River), the Atabapo, the four rivers that come from the Colombian territory, which are the Guaviare (with its tributary the In\u00edrida), Vichada, Tomo and Meta. And again in Venezuelan territory, the Apurean rivers to the north of the Meta: Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and Apure, the latter with numerous tributaries on its left bank gathered in two great rivers, the Portuguesa and Gu\u00e1rico. And some rivers also llaneros of minor importance and caudal, like the Manapire, Iguana, Zuata and Pao. Finally, the Ca\u00f1o [[Macareo (hidrograf\u00eda)|Manamo]] will end up in the Orinoco delta, the [[Taiga]] with its tributary by its right margin, the Long Morichal and the Guanipa with its tributary by its left bank, the Amana.\n\nEach of the named tributaries of the Orinoco River deserves a more detailed study. Also, some problems that are scarcely investigated, such as the different coloration of the waters of these tributaries, as seen in the image, the phenomenon of the lack of cloudiness in the mornings in the mountiest rivers (a phenomenon that is briefly explained in the articles on the Venezuelan Guayana, in the Amazon river and especially in the article on diathermy), the great extension of dunes or dunes in the Apure state, which is located between the Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and the own rivers Apure, the comparison of the flow between the different tributaries and between the Guaviare and the Orinoco and others, are also issues that deserve separate treatment, something more detailed than the one that is included later in the documentary study of the basin of the great river Columbia-Venezuelan.\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Matapalo o higuerote (Ficus el\u00e1stica).jpg|thumb|Matapalo or fig tree showing in an opening part of the trunk of the tree on which it supported. [[Parque del Este]], Caracas, Venezuela.]]\n\nIn the Guayana part of the Orinoco basin, the equatorial forests predominate, characterized by the existence of several levels of trees of very varied species, as a consequence of a high competition to obtain a sufficient supply of solar rays.\n\nThis struggle for sunlight is exemplified by the presence of matapalos, trees that originally have a creeping stalk that they use to lean around a large tree in order to reach sunlight. When they overcome the roof and increase the function of photosynthesis they begin to grow strangling the tree on which they had leaned (as well as blocking the sunlight). The most frequent matapalos belong to the genus Ficus, as is the case of natural rubber. The peculiar note of these jungles is the extra-ordinary variety of the vegetation: many vegetal species per hectare, but few copies of each one in that surface. The other distinguishing note is the enormous annual biomass production: about 500 t/yr/ha, against about 300 in the coniferous forests of the Taiga area in the northern hemisphere, under the most favorable conditions. And it is this extra-ordinary diversity that makes it the most useful type of vegetation that exists, especially for its possibilities and for the production of oxygen, although this diversity presents a limitation as far as its commercial exploitation is concerned.\n\nThe jungles of the inter-tropical zone constitute the biggest vegetable lung of the planet since all the vegetables need to absorb an enormous amount of water and CO<sub>2</sub> to produce, through [[photosynthesis]], the carbohydrates that they need for their growth, but they also leave an enormous amount of free oxygen that animals use for their respiration. In the very long term, the balance between production and consumption of both oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> tends to be balanced, according to [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] principle that matter is not created or destroyed, but only transformed. But for millions of years (since the primary era, when the first plant species appeared on our planet) has accumulated an enormous amount of biomass on the earth's surface (and also in the subsoil as hydrocarbons), where it usually there is a close correspondence between production and consumption that fluctuates over time in a process of equilibrium. This means that, as a whole, the balance between production and consumption, both oxygen and carbon dioxide, follows an eternal process of feedback that is responsible for reaching at a given moment a situation of climax, a concept that will need, with time, be revised. We must not forget that, in nature, the number of producers (plants) is much higher than that of consumers (animals).\n\nOf course, this does not mean that the geographic environment (soil, vegetation, fauna, pollutant production) can continue to be depleted without restrictions until reaching irreversible situations. On the other hand, it must be taken into account that ecological problems vary widely at local or regional level: what can be a balancing situation on a global scale does not mean that there are no problems at other scales. What has to be taken into account is that the capacity of regeneration and restoration of the balance lost in the vegetation of the inter-tropical zone, on the one hand, is much greater than what people (including scientists) assume and on the other hand that, in parallel with the processes of desertification due to the poor management of the environment and the depletion of many natural resources, there is a continuous advance in the use and rescue for reforestation and for the cultivation of previously uncultivated and unproductive areas that have giving rise to overproduction in many orders with regard to food, especially in the intertropical zone.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of the enormous amount of vegetal species for the obtaining of medicinal products has an enormous potentiality, that will only be widened to the extent that is better known. The drink known as [[Angostura bitters|Amargo de Angostura]], for example, is an example of the development of a tonic developed in the Angostura of the Orinoco (now Ciudad Bolivar) that was very useful since the nineteenth century because, although with a composition created by Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, and which has always been kept in the greatest secrecy until today, is known to contain among its ingredients quina (hence the bitter taste) and sarrapia, vegetables whose medicinal principles have been perfectly proven for more than three centuries.\n\nIn addition to the vegetation of the equatorial forest, in the Llanos, which share Venezuela and Colombia, savannas predominate, grasses of seasonal pastures, with gallery forests, woods (small clusters isolated from trees) and estuaries with palms ([[Copernicia tectorum|palma llanera]], especialmente), etc.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Keyhole cichlid]]\n* [[Sabana Surinam toad]]\n* [[Physiographic regions of the world]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* DE LE\u00d3N, Rafael y RODR\u00cdGUEZ D\u00cdAZ, Alberto J.

The Orinoco watershed covers an area of about 990000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, making it the third largest in South America, covering most of [[Venezuela]] and eastern part of [[Colombia]].\n\nThe Orinoco is one of the most important rivers in the world due to its length and flow (2140&nbsp;km and more than 30000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s),<ref>Historial del caudal del Orinoco desde 1969, en Musinacio {{cite web |url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/part%274/SOUTH_AMERICA/Venezuela/3vn%60or~2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304193548/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/part'4/SOUTH_AMERICA/Venezuela/3vn%60or~2.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> the extent of its basin (1 million km<sup>2</sup>) and especially its historical importance and economic and the meaning it has had for Venezuela, where most of its basin is spread, with almost two-thirds of it. It is probably the largest river in the world in relation to its basin, similar in extent to that of the [[Danube]] but five times greater in volume.  Its discharge is the third largest of any river worldwide, after the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and the [[Congo River|Congo]], and much greater than that of many rivers of greater length and basin area.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Orinoco river basin synthesizes the three great forms of relief that exist in nature: ancient massifs and shields on the one hand, recently raised (that is the [[Cenozoic|Tertiary]]) ridges on the other and tectonic depressions and basins or accumulation plains, in third place. Each of these forms of relief has its own characteristics, but also its similarities with similar natural regions of other parts of the world. For any country, especially in the inter-tropical zone, it represents a great ecological and economic advantage to have represented in its territory these three forms of relief.  The only other countries in the Americas with a similar geological disposition are Canada and the United States.\n\nTo define the Orinoco basin as a natural region, it is necessary to establish the geographic characteristics that define it, such as extension, relief, [[climate]], [[hydrography]], [[vegetation]], soils, and mineral resources.\n\n== Extension ==\nThe Orinoco basin covers an area of almost 989000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of which 643480&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or slightly more than 65% remain in Venezuelan territory, while the remaining 35% is in Colombian territory in the Colombian Llanos and The eastern slope of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia, a stretch of the great mountain range of the Andes. This Colombian region is called [[Orinoqu\u00eda natural region|Orinoqu\u00eda]]. Of the part located in Venezuela, just over half extend from the Venezuelan Andes and the Cordillera de la Costa to the north-western bank of the Orinoco River (the left bank), forming most of the Venezuelan plains and the delta Orinoco. The southern part of the basin contains most of the waters that come from the [[Guayana venezolana|Venezuelan Guiana]].\n\n== Relief ==\n[[File:Roraima-Tepui Plateau.jpg|thumb|The top of Roraima, the highest Tepui of Venezuelan Guayana. The curious shapes have been produced by erosion.]]\n\nThe sources of the Orinoco River are located at Cerro [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], at 1047 meters above sea level, discovered in 1951 by the Franco-Venezuelan expedition that went back and explored the Upper Orinoco course to the [[Parima Mountains|Sierra Parima]], headed By Venezuelan army officer Frank Risquez Iribarren. The first reference to this expedition was that of Alberto Contramaestre Torres in 1954.<ref>Alberto Contramaestre Torres. Expedici\u00f3n a las fuentes del Orinoco. Caracas, 1954.</ref> And there are other references to this expedition, for example, that of Pablo J. Anduce.<ref>Pablo J. Anduce. ''Shailili-Ko. Descubrimiento de las fuentes del Orinoco''. Caracas: Talleres Gr\u00e1ficos Ilustraciones S. A., 1960</ref> From the birth of the Orinoco at the foot of the hill Delgado Chalbaud (02\u00ba19\u201905\u201d07 Of latitude north, 63\u00ba21\u201942\u201d63 of longitude west and 1047.35 meters of altitude) until its opening in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the Orinoco describes a great arc and its basin extends like fan, reason why the north-western part Of the basin is somewhat more extensive than the south-east.\n\nAs already indicated, the two sub-regions of the basin have quite different characteristics, due to differences in their geological constitution. The maximum height of the basin is located in the [[Sierra Nevada del Cocuy]], in Colombia (more than 5000 meters above sea level), which forms part of the Eastern Andean Cordillera of Colombia.\n\nThe north-western edge of the basin would consist of the Colombian-Venezuelan Andean slopes and the southern slopes of other mountainous reliefs of northern Venezuela, while the southern edge of the basin would be marked for the most part by the watershed between the Orinoco and the Amazon, which is located on the Guayan\u00e9s massif. Between the two sides extends the Venezuelan Guayana on the right bank of the Orinoco and the Llanos, both Colombian and Venezuelan on the left bank. As we see, the Orinoco river itself marks the natural boundary between these two regions; it could be said that the Orinoco is one of the most remarkable natural borders in the world, although this fact has a simple explanation: the rivers have little slope and have been building for millions of years a level of accumulation with the sediments that they carry from the mountain ranges where they are born. And it is these sediments that push the channel of the Orinoco against the Guayanese shield itself, to the point that in most of its course, the channel is riding on the rocks of the guayan\u00e9s shield, as can be seen in Piedra del Medium in front of [[Ciudad Bol\u00edvar]] (before Angostura). The ancient name of Bolivar City, Angostura of the Orinoco is due to the fact that the rocks of the shield are very resistant to the erosion and presented in that point, a narrowing of about 800 meters of width that gave origin to a species of imprisonment during, probably, millions of years, until the river was gradually excavating the channel on granite rocks.\n\n[[File:Orinocometer.jpg|thumb|right|350 px|The Piedra del Medio, located in front of Ciudad Bolivar is a kind of '' nilometer '' or '' orino-meter '' in this case, in which the lines of different coloration indicate the successive levels reached by the water.]]\n\nThus, the Venezuelan Guiana constitutes, unlike the Llanos, a surface of erosion. From the combination of these two forces that modify the relief, a constructive one, the sedimentation and another destructive one, the erosion, arises the current situation in which the river marks approximately the limit between the two regions. As can be seen from the above, this limit presents exceptions since, in some sections, rounded hills of granite origin (and therefore, Guayan reliefs) can be seen on the left bank of the Orinoco, that is, on the border of the Llanos. In the stone of the middle, you can see the different levels reached by the waters of the river, expressed in the different coloration of the granite, which explains the value of this granite island as \"nilometer\" - according to [[Alexander von Humboldt|Alejandro de Humboldt]]. These lines of distinct coloring should not be interpreted as a reduction of river flow over geological time, but as a descent of river level with sediment transport from the bottom to the sea: we recall that the river delta (almost 40000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was built with these sediments, while granitic rocks (such as Piedra del Medio) have been much more resistant to erosion.\n\nOn the other hand, the sandstones of the Venezuelan Guayana (of the Roraima formation) have been transformed into sand by the erosion that, although never very intense by the extra-ordinary resistance of the rocks, has been very durable (more than 1 billion of years), for which the sedimentary cover has been transformed into an inverted relief that forms the Tepuis. Moreover, were it not for the fact that the Guayanese Massif has been suffering a slow and long movement of ascent, in the present time it would have already become a penillanura in which almost all the sedimentary cover of sandstones would have disappeared. The sands coming from this erosive process have been deposited in the left bank of the river, especially in the low plains of Apure state, between the rivers [[Meta River|Meta]] and [[Apure]] itself. They were not deposited in the right border because there the relief is higher. And these sands could become over millions of years in strata of sandstones that could also become converted to rise and rejuvenate the relief on plateaus similar to those that now exist in Guyana. This would be a kind of example of the theory of the [[Ciclo geogr\u00e1fico|geographical cycle]].\n\nIn turn, these sands have come to create a unique eco-system in the world: an extensive dune field (occupies about 30,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) that has the peculiarity that it is not a desert climate but a savanna climate in a landscape of natural pastures that alternate with some gallery forests, flowing rivers and [[dune]]s of more than 100&nbsp;km in length and up to 20&nbsp;m in height.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magazine.com.ve/turismo/index.php?id=3303&idSec=8&accion=detalle |title= Ruta de Gallegos: para ver m\u00e9danos y playas de agua dulce en Apure Parte II|accessdate=1 October 2009 |author=Magazine Digital |language= Spanish}}</ref> Some of these dunes are used by the [[Llanero]] to establish in them the cheese,<ref>Fernando Calzadilla Vald\u00e9s. ''Por los llanos de Apure''.

They also serve to protect the livestock from floods. Thus, this eco-system so curious and picturesque, is the result of wind modeling in a savannah climate. It is not, as stated in the Atlas of Venezuela. A spatial image (also known as the Atlas of [[PDVSA]],<ref>[[PDVSA]]. ''Atlas de Venezuela. Una visi\u00f3n espacial''. Caracas: Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda, 1992</ref> of a paleodunas eco-system formed in an environment with a climate much drier than the present one, but of a mechanism of formation of dunes that only acts during the dry season since. When the level of the waters of the Orinoco falls due to the drought of the rivers, especially those that come from the Llanos, they remain extensive beaches of very fine sand, that the trade winds soon transfer towards the south-east forming what now constitutes the [[Santos Luzardo National Park]], a name taken from one of the main characters in [[Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara]]'s novel by [[R\u00f3mulo Gallegos]].\n\nThe direction of the winds during the dry season (of the summer as it is said in the Llanos) is on average very constant and with a considerable speed, from the north-east to the south-west, as can be seen in the direction of the elongated dunes in satellite images. This address may vary for a short time but in the long run it is maintained exactly in that direction. In the rainy season (or winter) the direction changes slightly and proceeds practically from the free east. But this is not the most remarkable change, but the decrease of its speed. This is due to the greater humidity that the trade winds bring and to the consequent convection: as the wet winds advance on the savanna they increase of temperature by the heat of the ground due to the solar radiation. In turn, this warming gives rise to the rise of moist air (precisely what we know as convection) and this rise gives rise, in turn, to a decrease in the speed of the winds and the increase of precipitation. So the mechanism of the winds and that of the accumulation of the sands from the Guayanese Massif are almost opposite and this opposition has been favorable for the establishment of agricultural activities in the Llanos: the dunes can become covered with vegetation and serve. The basis for the establishment of houses, herds and roads, and this process becomes more noticeable to the west, not only by the decrease of the speed of the winds as they move in that direction but also because the sands they form. These dunes come from the beaches of the Orinoco and the transport of the same diminishes when the speed of the wind descends. Fernando Calzadilla Vald\u00e9s explains all this process in the central part of the [[Apure state]], where he begins what he calls the Alto Llano, although this concept is not established with a certain level that throughout the Apure is very low until reaching the true piedmont of the Andes (established modern, this yes, in the curve of level of the 200 altitude.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Klimadiagramm-metrisch-deutsch-Ciudad Bolivar.Venezuela.png|thumb|350px|right|Climograph of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar. Rains are indicated in mm and temperatures in \u00b0C.]]\n\nAcross the Orinoco basin, climates are isothermal, i.e, climates with few temperature variations throughout the year (the difference between the average temperature of the warmer months and the less warm months is only 3\u00b0C), as corresponds to the inter-tropical zone. Five major types of climate in the lowlands (up to 800 m above sea level, according to the considerations of [[Antonio W. Goldbrunner]]), which are the [[tropical rainforest climate|jungle climate]] (Af in the K\u00f6ppen classification), [[tropical savanna climate|savanna]] (Aw in the same climatic classification), the semi-desert and the desert proper. It is disputed whether there is a monsoon climate (according to the K\u00f6ppen nomenclature) in the Orinoco basin, which would become the fifth type of climate. In any case, the existence of this climate would be reduced to the Atlantic coast of the Orinoco delta, where the influence of the northern equatorial current (which here is practically a coastal drift) influences to make the rains much more important On the whole coast common to the Guianas and Venezuela, but that diminish abruptly in Venezuela when advancing inland. At higher altitudes four or five thermal, climatic, biotic or ecological floors can be distinguished according to criteria used by different authors and their interest in their field of research. Temperatures have a very limited annual amplitude (about 3\u00b0C or less), although their daily amplitude is much higher and around 10\u00b0C. Rainfall is high, especially in Venezuelan Guayana, where it reaches very high values (4000 mm or more) in some fairly extensive areas. In Los Llanos, rainfall is much lower (1500 to 2000 mm, with an elevation of this amount towards the foothills of the Andes) and gives rise to the presence of savanna vegetation, with gallery forests next to the rivers, and in the Andean piedmont, tropophile forests, which lose much of their leaves during the dry season. The climate chart of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar shows the behavior of rains (blue line) and temperature (red line). The shading in yellow indicates the season or season of drought (deficit of precipitations, according to the xerothermic index of Gaussen). However, Ciudad Bol\u00edvar's climate is not representative of the entire Orinoco basin, but is rather an anomaly, in the sense that, because of its location with respect to the prevailing winds (by the action of mountains north-eastern Venezuela and the plateaus of the south-east) and this city being somewhat distant from the sea (the influence of the rainfall of the coastal drift in the Venezuelan Atlantic coasts), the precipitations are quite smaller than they should be.\n\n==== Climate for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n ====\n* Current climate conditions for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n ([[Bol\u00edvar (state)|Bolivar state]]):\n** Location: latitude 4\u00ba36'N, longitude 61\u00ba06'W, altitude, 910 mm.\n** Temperature: January (21.6\u00b0C), February (22\u00b0C), March (22.5\u00b0C), April (22.3\u00b0C), May (22\u00b0C), June (21.5\u00b0C), July (21.5\u00b0C), August (21.5\u00b0C), September (22\u00b0C), October (22.1\u00b0C), November (22\u00b0C), December (21.8\u00b0C).

The two stripes can be seen by the different coloration of the two rivers.]]\n\nThe Orinoco, with its tributaries, constitutes an extensive hydrographic network with rivers very flowing and of considerable length. Of all its basin, the longest tributary is the Guaviare, longer (about 1550 km) than the Orinoco itself at the point of its confluence, while the largest is the Caroni. Many of its tributaries are navigable rivers, especially those on the left bank, which come from the Llanos, both Colombian and Venezuelan, while the Guayan rivers (tributaries on the right bank) are more flowing but with jumps and rains, which make them very useful in the production of hydro-electric energy, but without use as navigational routes, except for some very short stretches. There are numerous islands, both rocky (erosion reliefs) and sedimentary (sand and other sediments), as well as many pipes or arms, abandoned meanders and horseshoe lakes.\n\nThe main tributaries on the right bank are the Manaviche, Ocamo, Padamo (with its Matacuni tributary on its left bank), Cunucunuma, Ventuari (very flowing river, with its Manapiare tributary on the right), Sipapo with its tributaries Autana and Cuao, both on the right), Samariapo, Parguaza (with several tributaries with a curious bayonet drainage), Suapure, Cuchivero river (with its tributary Guaniamo, on the left bank, a river where the gold has been exploited for a long time), the Caura (with its Erebato tributary on its left bank), a very flowing river and with one of the most notable leaps of Guayana (not so much because of its height but Caudal), the Par\u00e1 jump, the Aro and finally the Caron\u00ed with its tributary the Paragua, dammed both rivers in the Necoima Canyon or Necuima, in a hydro-electric dam of more than 200 m of height that originates a reservoir, the Lake of Guri, with more than 4000 km<sup>2</sup> of surface and a production of about 10 million kW/hour, which defines it as one of the most valuable and productive rivers in the world: to date, the production of the Guri hydro-electric power station is only surpassed by the Itaip\u00fa hydro-electric power station, in the Paran\u00e1 River. In the Cuao river basin (except for the long, or horseshoe-shaped lagoons formed by some abandoned meanders), the only lagoon in the basin: the lagoon of King Leopold, so named because it was discovered during an expedition sponsored by King Leopold III Of Belgium a little more than 50 years ago (at the moment it is very easy to observe it through programs with satellite images, generally of free access in Internet). This lagoon has about 400 m of length by 270 of width, approximately. It is the only lagoon in Venezuelan Guiana, which confirms the irregular nature of the relief of this natural region, which is not favorable to them, and also contradicts the myth of the sixteenth century, of the existence of a huge lake (Lake Parima) from which the Orinoco and Amazon rivers were born, with almost all its tributaries.\n\nOn the left bank we can mention the Mavaca, the unique case in the Casiquiare world (which is not a tributary but, on the contrary, an effluent, that is to say, a derivation of the Orinoco that drains its waters towards the Amazon basin through the Negro River), the Atabapo, the four rivers that come from the Colombian territory, which are the Guaviare (with its tributary the In\u00edrida), Vichada, Tomo and Meta. And again in Venezuelan territory, the Apurean rivers to the north of the Meta: Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and Apure, the latter with numerous tributaries on its left bank gathered in two great rivers, the Portuguesa and Gu\u00e1rico. And some rivers also llaneros of minor importance and caudal, like the Manapire, Iguana, Zuata and Pao. Finally, the Ca\u00f1o [[Macareo (hidrograf\u00eda)|Manamo]] will end up in the Orinoco delta, the [[Taiga]] with its tributary by its right margin, the Long Morichal and the Guanipa with its tributary by its left bank, the Amana.\n\nEach of the named tributaries of the Orinoco River deserves a more detailed study. Also, some problems that are scarcely investigated, such as the different coloration of the waters of these tributaries, as seen in the image, the phenomenon of the lack of cloudiness in the mornings in the mountiest rivers (a phenomenon that is briefly explained in the articles on the Venezuelan Guayana, in the Amazon river and especially in the article on diathermy), the great extension of dunes or dunes in the Apure state, which is located between the Cinaruco, Capanaparo, Arauca and the own rivers Apure, the comparison of the flow between the different tributaries and between the Guaviare and the Orinoco and others, are also issues that deserve separate treatment, something more detailed than the one that is included later in the documentary study of the basin of the great river Columbia-Venezuelan.\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Matapalo o higuerote (Ficus el\u00e1stica).jpg|thumb|Matapalo or fig tree showing in an opening part of the trunk of the tree on which it supported. [[Parque del Este]], Caracas, Venezuela.]]\n\nIn the Guayana part of the Orinoco basin, the equatorial forests predominate, characterized by the existence of several levels of trees of very varied species, as a consequence of a high competition to obtain a sufficient supply of solar rays.\n\nThis struggle for sunlight is exemplified by the presence of matapalos, trees that originally have a creeping stalk that they use to lean around a large tree in order to reach sunlight. When they overcome the roof and increase the function of photosynthesis they begin to grow strangling the tree on which they had leaned (as well as blocking the sunlight). The most frequent matapalos belong to the genus Ficus, as is the case of natural rubber. The peculiar note of these jungles is the extra-ordinary variety of the vegetation: many vegetal species per hectare, but few copies of each one in that surface. The other distinguishing note is the enormous annual biomass production: about 500 t/yr/ha, against about 300 in the coniferous forests of the Taiga area in the northern hemisphere, under the most favorable conditions. And it is this extra-ordinary diversity that makes it the most useful type of vegetation that exists, especially for its possibilities and for the production of oxygen, although this diversity presents a limitation as far as its commercial exploitation is concerned.\n\nThe jungles of the inter-tropical zone constitute the biggest vegetable lung of the planet since all the vegetables need to absorb an enormous amount of water and CO<sub>2</sub> to produce, through [[photosynthesis]], the carbohydrates that they need for their growth, but they also leave an enormous amount of free oxygen that animals use for their respiration. In the very long term, the balance between production and consumption of both oxygen and CO<sub>2</sub> tends to be balanced, according to [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier's]] principle that matter is not created or destroyed, but only transformed. But for millions of years (since the primary era, when the first plant species appeared on our planet) has accumulated an enormous amount of biomass on the earth's surface (and also in the subsoil as hydrocarbons), where it usually there is a close correspondence between production and consumption that fluctuates over time in a process of equilibrium. This means that, as a whole, the balance between production and consumption, both oxygen and carbon dioxide, follows an eternal process of feedback that is responsible for reaching at a given moment a situation of climax, a concept that will need, with time, be revised. We must not forget that, in nature, the number of producers (plants) is much higher than that of consumers (animals).\n\nOf course, this does not mean that the geographic environment (soil, vegetation, fauna, pollutant production) can continue to be depleted without restrictions until reaching irreversible situations. On the other hand, it must be taken into account that ecological problems vary widely at local or regional level: what can be a balancing situation on a global scale does not mean that there are no problems at other scales. What has to be taken into account is that the capacity of regeneration and restoration of the balance lost in the vegetation of the inter-tropical zone, on the one hand, is much greater than what people (including scientists) assume and on the other hand that, in parallel with the processes of desertification due to the poor management of the environment and the depletion of many natural resources, there is a continuous advance in the use and rescue for reforestation and for the cultivation of previously uncultivated and unproductive areas that have giving rise to overproduction in many orders with regard to food, especially in the intertropical zone.\n\nOn the other hand, the use of the enormous amount of vegetal species for the obtaining of medicinal products has an enormous potentiality, that will only be widened to the extent that is better known. The drink known as [[Angostura bitters|Amargo de Angostura]], for example, is an example of the development of a tonic developed in the Angostura of the Orinoco (now Ciudad Bolivar) that was very useful since the nineteenth century because, although with a composition created by Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, and which has always been kept in the greatest secrecy until today, is known to contain among its ingredients quina (hence the bitter taste) and sarrapia, vegetables whose medicinal principles have been perfectly proven for more than three centuries.\n\nIn addition to the vegetation of the equatorial forest, in the Llanos, which share Venezuela and Colombia, savannas predominate, grasses of seasonal pastures, with gallery forests, woods (small clusters isolated from trees) and estuaries with palms ([[Copernicia tectorum|palma llanera]], especialmente), etc.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Keyhole cichlid]]\n* [[Sabana Surinam toad]]\n* [[Physiographic regions of the world]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* DE LE\u00d3N, Rafael y RODR\u00cdGUEZ D\u00cdAZ, Alberto J.

Copyright law is largely harmonized in the Union, although country to country differences exist. The body of law was implemented in the EU through a number of [[Directive (European Union)|directives]], which the member states need to enact into their national law. The main copyright directives are the [[Copyright Term Directive]], the [[Information Society Directive]] and the [[Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market]].

This right, which is sometime known by its French name ''[[droit de suite]]'', is personal to the artist and can only be transferred by inheritance. It is calculated as a proportion of the resale price (net of tax), which varies between 4 and 5&nbsp;percent for the portion of the resale price up to EUR&nbsp;50,000 and 0.25% for the portion of the resale price above EUR&nbsp;500,000. The total royalty is limited at EUR&nbsp;12,500, equivalent to a resale price of EUR&nbsp;2,000,000. Member States may choose to exempt sales of less than EUR&nbsp;3000 from royalty. Works of art which are covered by this resale right are \"works of graphic or plastic art such as pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware and photographs, provided they are made by the artist herself or himself or are copies which have been made in limited numbers by the artist or under his or her authority.\"\n\n=== Database rights ===\nThe [[Database Directive]] created a ''[[sui generis]]'' protection for databases which do not meet the criterion of originality for copyright protection. It is specifically intended to protect \"the investment of considerable human, technical and financial resources\" in creating databases (para.&nbsp;7 of the preamble), whereas the copyright laws of many Member States specifically exclude effort and labour from the criteria for copyright protection. To qualify, the database must show \"qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\".<ref>[[Database Directive]], Art.&nbsp;7(1)</ref> Their creators have the right \"to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively, of the contents of that database.\" This is taken to include the repeated extraction of insubstantial parts of the contents if this conflicts with the normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the creator of the database.<ref>[[Database Directive]], Art.&nbsp;7(5)</ref>\n\nMember States may limit this right in the following cases:<ref>[[Database Directive]], Art.&nbsp;9</ref>\n\n*extraction for private use from a non-electronic database;\n*extraction for the purposes of teaching or research, to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose;\n*extraction and/or reutilisation for the purposes of public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.\n\nDatabase rights last for fifteen years from:<ref>[[Database Directive]], Art.&nbsp;10</ref>\n\n*the \"completion\" of the database, that is to say the point at which the criterion of substantial investment is fulfilled, or from\n*the date at which the database is made available to the public, whichever is the later. The protection period runs until 31 December of the year in which it expires. If there is a \"substantial change\" in the database which would be qualified as a \"substantial new investment\", a new protection period is granted for the resulting database.\n\n== Limitations ==\nTemporary copying which is the result of the transmission of a work or of its legal use is not covered by the exclusive right of reproduction.<ref>[[Information Society Directive]], Art.&nbsp;5(1)</ref>\n\nMember states can implement other limitations from the list in [[Information Society Directive]] Article 5, or retain limitations which were already in force on 22 June 2001.

This right, which is sometime known by its French name ''[[droit de suite]]'', is personal to the artist and can only be transferred by inheritance. It is calculated as a proportion of the resale price (net of tax), which varies between 4 and 5&nbsp;percent for the portion of the resale price up to EUR&nbsp;50,000 and 0.25% for the portion of the resale price above EUR&nbsp;500,000. The total royalty is limited at EUR&nbsp;12,500, equivalent to a resale price of EUR&nbsp;2,000,000. Member States may choose to exempt sales of less than EUR&nbsp;3000 from royalty. Works of art which are covered by this resale right are \"works of graphic or plastic art such as pictures, collages, paintings, drawings, engravings, prints, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, ceramics, glassware and photographs, provided they are made by the artist herself or himself or are copies which have been made in limited numbers by the artist or under his or her authority.\"\n\n=== Database rights ===\nThe [[Database Directive]] created a ''[[sui generis]]'' protection for databases which do not meet the criterion of originality for copyright protection. It is specifically intended to protect \"the investment of considerable human, technical and financial resources\" in creating databases (para.&nbsp;7 of the preamble), whereas the copyright laws of many Member States specifically exclude effort and labour from the criteria for copyright protection. To qualify, the database must show \"qualitatively and/or quantitatively a substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\".<ref>[[Database Directive]], Art.&nbsp;7(1)</ref> Their creators have the right \"to prevent extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part, evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively, of the contents of that database.\" This is taken to include the repeated extraction of insubstantial parts of the contents if this conflicts with the normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the creator of the database.<ref>[[Database Directive]], Art.&nbsp;7(5)</ref>\n\nMember States may limit this right in the following cases:<ref>[[Database Directive]], Art.&nbsp;9</ref>\n\n*extraction for private use from a non-electronic database;\n*extraction for the purposes of teaching or research, to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose;\n*extraction and/or reutilisation for the purposes of public security or an administrative or judicial procedure.\n\nDatabase rights last for fifteen years from:<ref>[[Database Directive]], Art.&nbsp;10</ref>\n\n*the \"completion\" of the database, that is to say the point at which the criterion of substantial investment is fulfilled, or from\n*the date at which the database is made available to the public, whichever is the later. The protection period runs until 31 December of the year in which it expires. If there is a \"substantial change\" in the database which would be qualified as a \"substantial new investment\", a new protection period is granted for the resulting database.\n\n== Limitations ==\nTemporary copying which is the result of the transmission of a work or of its legal use is not covered by the exclusive right of reproduction.<ref>[[Information Society Directive]], Art.&nbsp;5(1)</ref>\n\nMember states can implement other limitations from the list in [[Information Society Directive]] Article 5, or retain limitations which were already in force on 22 June 2001. Permitted limitations are:<ref>[[Information Society Directive]] Article 5(3)(o)</ref>\n\n*art. 5.2(a) paper reproductions by photocopying or similar methods, except of sheet music, if there is compensation for rightsholders;\n*art. 5.2(b)reproductions made for private and non-commercial use if there is compensation for rightholders;\n*art. 5.2(c) reproductions by public libraries, educational institutions or archives for non-commercial use;\n*art. 5.2(d) preservation of recordings of broadcasts in official archives;\n*art. 5.2(e) reproductions of broadcasts by social, non-commercial institutions such as hospitals and prisons, if there is compensation to rightholders;\n*art. 5.3(a) use for illustration for teaching or scientific research, to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose;\n*art. 5.3(b) uses directly related to a disability, to the extent justified by the disability;\n*art. 5.3(c) press reviews and news reporting;\n*art. 5.3(d) quotations for the purposes of criticism or review;\n*art. 5.3(e) uses for the purposes of public security or in administrative, parliamentary or judicial proceedings;\n*art. 5.3(f) uses of political speeches and extracts of public lectures, to the extent justified by public information;\n*art. 5.3(g) uses during religious or official celebrations;\n*art. 5.3(h) uses of works, such as architecture or sculpture, which are located permanently in public places;\n*art. 5.3(i) incidental inclusion in another work;\n*art. 5.3(j) use for the advertisement of the public exhibition or sale of art;\n*art. 5.3(k) caricature, parody or pastiche;\n*art. 5.3(l) use in connection with the demonstration or repair of equipment;\n*art. 5.3(m) use of a protected work (e.g., plans) for the reconstruction of a building;\n*art. 5.3(n) communication of works to the public within the premises of public libraries, educational institutions, museums or archives.\n\nNo new limitations may come into force after 22 June 2001 except those in the permitted limitations given in the Information Society Directive.

Smith]], based on Smith's [[A Simple Plan (novel)|1993 novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Bill Paxton]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], and [[Bridget Fonda]]. Set in rural [[Minnesota]], the story follows brothers Hank (Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Thornton), who, along with Jacob's friend Lou ([[Brent Briscoe]]), discover a crashed plane containing $4.4 million in cash. The three men and Hank's wife Sarah (Fonda) go to great lengths to keep the money a secret but begin to doubt each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 1993 before the novel was published. [[Mike Nichols]] purchased the film rights, and the project was picked up by [[Savoy Pictures]]. After Nichols stepped down, the film adaptation became mired in [[development hell]], with [[Ben Stiller]] and [[John Dahl]] turning down opportunities to direct it. After Savoy closed in November 1997, the project was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[John Boorman]] was hired to direct, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Raimi. An international co-production between the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan, the film was financed by [[Mutual Film Company]], its investors and [[Newmarket Capital Group]], which allocated a budget of $17 million. [[Principal photography]] began in January 1998 and concluded in March after 55 days of filming in [[Wisconsin]] and Minnesota. The [[film score|score]] was produced and composed by [[Danny Elfman]].\n\n''A Simple Plan'' premiered at the [[1998 Toronto International Film Festival]], where it was met with critical acclaim. The film's appearance at the festival preceded a limited release in the United States on December 11, 1998, followed by a general release in North America on January 22, 1999. It underperformed at the North American box office, grossing $16.3 million. Reviewers praised various aspects of the film's production, including the storytelling, performances and Raimi's direction. ''A Simple Plan'' earned multiple awards and nominations, among them two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Thornton) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Smith).\n\n==Plot==\nHank Mitchell and his pregnant wife Sarah live in rural [[Minnesota]]. One of the town's few college graduates, Hank works in a feed mill, while his wife is a librarian. When Hank, his older, socially challenged brother Jacob, and Jacob's friend Lou Chambers chase a fox into the woods, they stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in $100 bills. He suggests turning the money in but Lou and Jacob persuade him not to. Hank then proposes that he keep the money safe at his house until the end of winter. Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. At Lou's suggestion, Jacob mentions hearing a plane in the area in an attempt to avoid suspicion. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to keep the money a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he immediately reveals the discovery to Sarah.\n\nSarah suggests that Hank return a paltry sum of the money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. She insists that he should go alone, but Hank takes Jacob with him. Hank walks through the woods to the plane while Jacob waits at the car pretending to change the tire. An old farmer approaches Jacob and asks him if he came across a fox that ran off with a chicken\u2014the same fox that led to the discovery of the plane. While Hank is on his way back from placing the money in the plane, Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons the old man. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. \n\nSarah finds out that the money was a ransom for a kidnapped girl taken by two brothers, one of which was presumably the dead pilot. The whereabouts of the second brother are unknown. \n\nThe following night, Lou drunkenly demands his portion of the money from Hank, because he is broke and has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the murder of the farmer. Hank lies to Lou, telling him that the money is not inside his house. He gives him 40 dollars to tide him over, and calms him down by telling him that they are in this together.\n\nAfter giving birth to their daughter Amanda, Sarah advises Hank to frame Lou for the farmer's murder...by getting Lou drunk and recording him making a false confession to the killing. The plan works, although Jacob is dismayed and reluctant to betray his friend. Lou grows enraged when he realizes that they have conspired against him, and he pulls a shotgun on Hank. Jacob grabs his hunting rifle from his truck and kills Lou to save his brother. Hank then tries to calm Lou's wife, who gets a gun and shoots at Hank, who then kills her with Lou's shotgun. Hank stages the scene to make it look like Lou shot his wife and was about to shoot him. He and Jacob tell the police this story, and are able to avoid arrest and suspicion.  \n\nBecause Jacob mentioned hearing a plane in the woods, Carl asks the brothers to assist an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, Neil Baxter, in a search for the missing aircraft. Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah is immediately skeptical of Baxter, whom she suspects is the brother of the dead pilot, posing as an FBI agent. When she discovers this to be true, she calls to warn Hank, who steals a revolver from Carl's office. The four men head into the woods and split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and forces Hank to retrieve the money from the plane. Hank manages to distract Baxter with the small amount of money he had returned to the plane, and he then shoots and kills Baxter. He starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities, but Jacob tells him that he does not want to live with the memories of what they have done, and asks Hank to kill him and frame Baxter for it. When Hank refuses, he threatens to commit suicide, which would implicate them both in the whole conspiracy. After grappling with the decision, Hank kills Jacob with Baxter's pistol. \n\nAt the police station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. He is not suspected of any wrongdoing, and is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' [[serial number]]s were written down to track the cash. Hank cannot use the money without being caught. He returns home and burns it all, leaving Sarah distraught. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses. Although he tries to move on with his life, the murders constantly haunt him.\n\n===Differences Between the Novel and the Film===\n* In the book, Hank discovers that Sarah has spent part of the money at a liquor store miles from their home. Hank goes to retrieve the $100 bill by robbing the small store. He pulls a machete on the clerk, Michael Morton (a tall, imposing, and muscular fellow), and orders that Morton empty the cash register. Morton refuses, demanding that Hank leave. When Hank doesn't, Morton - instead of calling the police - locks up the store and tries to kill Hank...who instead kills him with the machete. While Hank is disposing of the evidence, an elderly woman shows up looking to buy some wine for dinner guests. Hank tries to get her to leave, to no avail. She discovers Morton's body, which forces Hank to murder her as well.\n\n* In the book, Hank narrowly saves Amanda - his and Sarah's daughter - from drowning in a plastic wading pool. The little girl suffers brain damage, which will severely limit her mental and emotional development as she gets older...much as with Jacob. Her parents consider this tragedy a penance for the murders both have committed. \n\n* At the end of the book, Hank and Sarah welcome a second child: son Jackson, named after Hank's late brother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Bill Paxton]] as Hank Mitchell\n*[[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Jacob Mitchell\n*[[Bridget Fonda]] as Sarah Mitchell\n*[[Brent Briscoe]] as Lou Chambers\n*[[Gary Cole]] as Neil Baxter\n*Jack Walsh as Tom Butler\n*[[Chelcie Ross]] as Sheriff Carl Jenkins\n*[[Becky Ann Baker]] as Nancy Chambers\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | width1 = 130\n | image1 = ScottSmith2.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | width2 = 140\n | image2 = Sam Raimi by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = From left to right: [[Scott Smith (author)|Scott B.

Smith]], based on Smith's [[A Simple Plan (novel)|1993 novel of the same name]]. The film stars [[Bill Paxton]], [[Billy Bob Thornton]], and [[Bridget Fonda]]. Set in rural [[Minnesota]], the story follows brothers Hank (Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Thornton), who, along with Jacob's friend Lou ([[Brent Briscoe]]), discover a crashed plane containing $4.4 million in cash. The three men and Hank's wife Sarah (Fonda) go to great lengths to keep the money a secret but begin to doubt each other's trust, resulting in lies, deceit and murder.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in 1993 before the novel was published. [[Mike Nichols]] purchased the film rights, and the project was picked up by [[Savoy Pictures]]. After Nichols stepped down, the film adaptation became mired in [[development hell]], with [[Ben Stiller]] and [[John Dahl]] turning down opportunities to direct it. After Savoy closed in November 1997, the project was sold to [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[John Boorman]] was hired to direct, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Raimi. An international co-production between the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Japan, the film was financed by [[Mutual Film Company]], its investors and [[Newmarket Capital Group]], which allocated a budget of $17 million. [[Principal photography]] began in January 1998 and concluded in March after 55 days of filming in [[Wisconsin]] and Minnesota. The [[film score|score]] was produced and composed by [[Danny Elfman]].\n\n''A Simple Plan'' premiered at the [[1998 Toronto International Film Festival]], where it was met with critical acclaim. The film's appearance at the festival preceded a limited release in the United States on December 11, 1998, followed by a general release in North America on January 22, 1999. It underperformed at the North American box office, grossing $16.3 million. Reviewers praised various aspects of the film's production, including the storytelling, performances and Raimi's direction. ''A Simple Plan'' earned multiple awards and nominations, among them two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Thornton) and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] (Smith).\n\n==Plot==\nHank Mitchell and his pregnant wife Sarah live in rural [[Minnesota]]. One of the town's few college graduates, Hank works in a feed mill, while his wife is a librarian. When Hank, his older, socially challenged brother Jacob, and Jacob's friend Lou Chambers chase a fox into the woods, they stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in $100 bills. He suggests turning the money in but Lou and Jacob persuade him not to. Hank then proposes that he keep the money safe at his house until the end of winter. Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. At Lou's suggestion, Jacob mentions hearing a plane in the area in an attempt to avoid suspicion. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to keep the money a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he immediately reveals the discovery to Sarah.\n\nSarah suggests that Hank return a paltry sum of the money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. She insists that he should go alone, but Hank takes Jacob with him. Hank walks through the woods to the plane while Jacob waits at the car pretending to change the tire. An old farmer approaches Jacob and asks him if he came across a fox that ran off with a chicken\u2014 the same fox that led to the discovery of the plane. While Hank is on his way back from placing the money in the plane, Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons the old man. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. \n\nSarah finds out that the money was a ransom for a kidnapped girl taken by two brothers, one of which was presumably the dead pilot. The whereabouts of the second brother are unknown. \n\nThe following night, Lou drunkenly demands his portion of the money from Hank, because he is broke and has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the murder of the farmer. Hank lies to Lou, telling him that the money is not inside his house. He gives him 40 dollars to tide him over, and calms him down by telling him that they are in this together.\n\nAfter giving birth to their daughter Amanda, Sarah advises Hank to frame Lou for the farmer's murder...by getting Lou drunk and recording him making a false confession to the killing. The plan works, although Jacob is dismayed and reluctant to betray his friend. Lou grows enraged when he realizes that they have conspired against him, and he pulls a shotgun on Hank. Jacob grabs his hunting rifle from his truck and kills Lou to save his brother. Hank then tries to calm Lou's wife, who gets a gun and shoots at Hank, who then kills her with Lou's shotgun. Hank stages the scene to make it look like Lou shot his wife and was about to shoot him. He and Jacob tell the police this story, and are able to avoid arrest and suspicion.  \n\nBecause Jacob mentioned hearing a plane in the woods, Carl asks the brothers to assist an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, Neil Baxter, in a search for the missing aircraft. Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah is immediately skeptical of Baxter, whom she suspects is the brother of the dead pilot, posing as an FBI agent. When she discovers this to be true, she calls to warn Hank, who steals a revolver from Carl's office. The four men head into the woods and split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and forces Hank to retrieve the money from the plane. Hank manages to distract Baxter with the small amount of money he had returned to the plane, and he then shoots and kills Baxter. He starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities, but Jacob tells him that he does not want to live with the memories of what they have done, and asks Hank to kill him and frame Baxter for it. When Hank refuses, he threatens to commit suicide, which would implicate them both in the whole conspiracy. After grappling with the decision, Hank kills Jacob with Baxter's pistol. \n\nAt the police station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. He is not suspected of any wrongdoing, and is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' [[serial number]]s were written down to track the cash. Hank cannot use the money without being caught. He returns home and burns it all, leaving Sarah distraught. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses. Although he tries to move on with his life, the murders constantly haunt him.\n\n===Differences Between the Novel and the Film===\n* In the book, Hank discovers that Sarah has spent part of the money at a liquor store miles from their home. Hank goes to retrieve the $100 bill by robbing the small store. He pulls a machete on the clerk, Michael Morton (a tall, imposing, and muscular fellow), and orders that Morton empty the cash register. Morton refuses, demanding that Hank leave. When Hank doesn't, Morton - instead of calling the police - locks up the store and tries to kill Hank...who instead kills him with the machete. While Hank is disposing of the evidence, an elderly woman shows up looking to buy some wine for dinner guests. Hank tries to get her to leave, to no avail. She discovers Morton's body, which forces Hank to murder her as well.\n\n* In the book, Hank narrowly saves Amanda - his and Sarah's daughter - from drowning in a plastic wading pool. The little girl suffers brain damage, which will severely limit her mental and emotional development as she gets older...much as with Jacob. Her parents consider this tragedy a penance for the murders both have committed. \n\n* At the end of the book, Hank and Sarah welcome a second child: son Jackson, named after Hank's late brother.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Bill Paxton]] as Hank Mitchell\n*[[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Jacob Mitchell\n*[[Bridget Fonda]] as Sarah Mitchell\n*[[Brent Briscoe]] as Lou Chambers\n*[[Gary Cole]] as Neil Baxter\n*Jack Walsh as Tom Butler\n*[[Chelcie Ross]] as Sheriff Carl Jenkins\n*[[Becky Ann Baker]] as Nancy Chambers\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | width1 = 130\n | image1 = ScottSmith2.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | width2 = 140\n | image2 = Sam Raimi by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = From left to right: [[Scott Smith (author)|Scott B.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]].

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat.

He emphasised the importance of [[social obligation]] rather than the [[individualism]] that pervaded his society.{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16\u201317}} Disraeli warned that Britain would become divided into two nations (of the rich and poor) as a result of increased [[industrialisation]] and [[Economic inequality|inequality]].<ref name=Heywood82/> Concerned at this division, he supported measures to improve the lives of the people to provide social support and protect the working classes.{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16\u201317}}\n\nDisraeli justified his ideas by his belief in an [[Organicism|organic society]] in which the different classes have natural obligations to one another.{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16-17}} He saw society as naturally hierarchical and emphasised the obligation of those at the top to those below. This was based in the feudal concept of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'', which asserted that the [[aristocracy]] had an obligation to be generous and honourable and to Disraeli this implied that government should be paternalistic.<ref name=Heywood82/> Unlike the [[New Right]], one-nation conservatism takes a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to politics and accepts the need for flexible policies as one-nation conservatives have often sought compromise with their ideological opponents for the sake of [[Status quo|social stability]].<ref>Bloor 2010, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> Disraeli justified his views pragmatically by arguing that should the [[ruling class]] become indifferent to the suffering of the people, society would become unstable and [[social revolution]] would become a possibility.{{sfn|Dorey|1995|pp=16-17}}\n\n== Catholic political movements in the 19th century ==\nIn Europe, Catholic political movements emerged in the 19th century as a response to widespread deterioration of social conditions and rising [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] tendencies amongst artisans and workers.<ref>[[#eley|Eley]] (1997), p. 174.</ref> It mixed social commitment, paternalistic social welfare and authoritarian patronage from above with deepening popular piety.<ref>[[#eley|Eley]] (1997), pp. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n\nIn France, the influence of these doctrines can be seen in the conservative socialism of [[Albert de Mun]] and [[Ren\u00e9 de La Tour du Pin]]. The [[Conservatism in Germany|German conservative]] [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] figure [[Adolf Stoecker]] founded the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Workers' Party]] in 1878 that aimed to align workers with [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity]] and the [[House of Hohenzollern|German monarchy]].<ref>Dietze, Gottfried (1995).

[[Dairy]] farming is the principal activity. Good trout fishing is to be had in the numerous streams of the area. As a town, Matatiele is the reference point for all of the northern Transkei. \n\nThe name \"Matatiele\" is clearly a [[Sesotho language|Sotho]] word{{According to whom|date=October 2019}},  based on the Sesotho phrase \"matata aile\" meaning \"the ducks have gone\". In [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], the town name is pronounced \"Madadiyela\". The common informal name for the town in any of the languages mentioned, including English, is \"Matat\". Those who are born there call it \"sweet Matat\". The town became more popular when a [[Generations (South African TV series)|Generations]] producer Mfundi Vundla wrote a story about Matatiele Where the Actor real name \"Nambitha Mpulawana\" acted as a Matatiele Born. there was also a Tv show called \"Matatiele\" that aired two families Xhosa and Sesotho families who were not getting along at all but unfortunately they could not stop children from dating, that forced them to sit on the table to negotiate [[lobola]]. Matatiele is the hometown of the socialist Selby Buhle Baqwa of Mzongwana.\n\nThe residents in and around Matatiele, as in most of the northern Transkei region, are generally bilingual in Hlubi, isiXhosa and Sesotho. Many speak English. Some also speak as a home language (or as a language of heritage) Phuthi, especially residents in Tsitsong and T\u0161episong. \n{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nEvidence of [[Stone Age]] inhabitants in the form of art adorning rocks are found throughout the area. In the early 1860s the [[Griqua people|Griquas]] settled here after migrating across the Drakensberg from [[Philippolis]]. The town was the centre of [[cattle]] rustling and gun-running and order was only restored in 1874 by the [[Cape Mounted Riflemen]]. The town became a municipality in 1904.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe town was part of Cape Province until being transferred to Natal in 1978. In 2005, the municipality was moved from the KwaZulu-Natal province to the Eastern Cape as part of the [[Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa]], over the objections of the majority of residents, some of whom in response founded the [[African Independent Congress]].  On 18 August 2006 the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] ruled that the part of the 12th Amendment dealing with the transfer of  Matatiele from KwaZulu-Natal to the Eastern Cape was invalid due to insufficient consultation with stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1985286,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201444/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1985286,00.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 }}</ref> The situation was eventually resolved, and Matatiele was confirmed as part of Eastern Cape province under the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa|13th Amendment]].<ref>http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/const13th-2007gg.pdf</ref>\n\n==Notable people of Matatiele==\n* [[Mosiuoa Lekota]], politician leader of the [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]]\n* [[Andile Jali]], footballer\n* [[Thulas Nxesi]], Minister of Public Works\n* [[Chris Jafta]], judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa\n* [[Mthembeni Ndevu]], popularly known as [[Emtee (rapper)|Emtee]], hip hop musician and record producer\n* [[Innocent Mdledle]], footballer (Supersport United)\n* [[Siyabonga Siphika]], former footballer [[Bush Bucks F.C.

As a town, Matatiele is the reference point for all of the northern Transkei. \n\nThe name \"Matatiele\" is clearly a [[Sesotho language|Sotho]] word{{According to whom|date=October 2019}},  based on the Sesotho phrase \"matata aile\" meaning \"the ducks have gone\". In [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], the town name is pronounced \"Madadiyela\". The common informal name for the town in any of the languages mentioned, including English, is \"Matat\". Those who are born there call it \"sweet Matat\". The town became more popular when a [[Generations (South African TV series)|Generations]] producer Mfundi Vundla wrote a story about Matatiele Where the Actor real name \"Nambitha Mpulawana\" acted as a Matatiele Born. there was also a Tv show called \"Matatiele\" that aired two families Xhosa and Sesotho families who were not getting along at all but unfortunately they could not stop children from dating, that forced them to sit on the table to negotiate [[lobola]].\n\nThe residents in and around Matatiele, as in most of the northern Transkei region, are generally bilingual in Hlubi, isiXhosa and Sesotho. Many speak English. Some also speak as a home language (or as a language of heritage) Phuthi, especially residents in Tsitsong and T\u0161episong. \n{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nEvidence of [[Stone Age]] inhabitants in the form of art adorning rocks are found throughout the area. In the early 1860s the [[Griqua people|Griquas]] settled here after migrating across the Drakensberg from [[Philippolis]]. The town was the centre of [[cattle]] rustling and gun-running and order was only restored in 1874 by the [[Cape Mounted Riflemen]]. The town became a municipality in 1904.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe town was part of Cape Province until being transferred to Natal in 1978. In 2005, the municipality was moved from the KwaZulu-Natal province to the Eastern Cape as part of the [[Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa]], over the objections of the majority of residents, some of whom in response founded the [[African Independent Congress]].  On 18 August 2006 the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] ruled that the part of the 12th Amendment dealing with the transfer of  Matatiele from KwaZulu-Natal to the Eastern Cape was invalid due to insufficient consultation with stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1985286,00.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201444/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_1985286,00.html |archivedate=2007-09-30 }}</ref> The situation was eventually resolved, and Matatiele was confirmed as part of Eastern Cape province under the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of South Africa|13th Amendment]].<ref>http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/const13th-2007gg.pdf</ref>\n\n==Notable people of Matatiele==\n* [[Mosiuoa Lekota]], politician leader of the [[Congress of the People (South African political party)|Congress of the People]]\n* [[Andile Jali]], footballer\n* [[Thulas Nxesi]], Minister of Public Works\n* [[Chris Jafta]], judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa\n* [[Mthembeni Ndevu]], popularly known as [[Emtee (rapper)|Emtee]], hip hop musician and record producer\n* [[Innocent Mdledle]], footballer (Supersport United)\n* [[Siyabonga Siphika]], former footballer [[Bush Bucks F.C.
