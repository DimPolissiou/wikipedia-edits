During her international film career, she won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for her performance as [[Anna Leonowens]] in the musical film ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956). As well as ''The King and I'', her films include: ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'' (1957), ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947), ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), ''[[Tea and Sympathy (film)|Tea and Sympathy]]'' (1956), ''[[Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison]]'' (1957), ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' (1961), ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960), ''[[The Grass is Greener]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Night of the Iguana (film)|The Night of the Iguana]]'' (1964). \n\nDeborah Kerr was nominated six times for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and holds the record for an actress most nominated in the lead actress category without winning. In 1994, however, having already received honorary awards from the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], Kerr received an [[Academy Honorary Award]] with a citation recognising her as \"an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance\".<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7051206.stm |title=British actress Kerr dies at 86 |work=BBC News |date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nDeborah Jane Kerr-Trimmer was born on 30 September 1921 in [[Hillhead, Glasgow]],<ref name=\"herald\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/features/features/display.var.1771494.0.0.php |title=Deborah Kerr profile |accessdate=19 October 2007 |author=The Herald |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021045411/http://theherald.co.uk/features/features/display.var.1771494.0.0.php |archivedate=21 October 2007  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbGcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA642|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2005-2008|last=Goldman|first=Lawrence|date=2013-03-07|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199671540|pages=642|language=en}}</ref> the only daughter of Kathleen Rose (n\u00e9e Smale) and Capt.

She then went to the Sadler's Wells ballet school and in 1938 made her d\u00e9but in the corps de ballet in ''Prometheus''. After various walk-on parts in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] productions at the [[Regent's Park Open Air Theatre|Open Air Theatre]] in [[Regent's Park]], London, she joined the Oxford Playhouse repertory company in 1940, playing, ''inter alia'', \"Margaret\" in ''Dear Brutus'' and \"Patty Moss\" in ''The Two Bouquets''.<ref name=\"Telegraph\" />\n\nIn 1943, aged 21, Deborah Kerr made her West End d\u00e9but as \"Ellie Dunn\" in a revival of ''Heartbreak House'' at the [[Cambridge Theatre]], stealing attention from stalwarts such as [[Edith Evans]] and [[Isabel Jeans]]. \"She has the rare gift\", wrote critic Beverley Baxter, \"of thinking her lines, not merely remembering them. The process of development from a romantic, silly girl to a hard, disillusioned woman in three hours was moving and convincing\".<ref name=\"Telegraph\" />\n\nKerr returned to the London stage 29 years later, in many productions including the old-fashioned, ''The Day After the Fair'' (Lyric, 1972), a [[Peter Ustinov]] comedy, ''Overheard'' (Haymarket, 1981) and a revival of [[Emlyn Williams]]'s ''The Corn is Green''.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> After her first London success in 1943, she toured England and Scotland in ''Heartbreak House''. Near the end of the Second World War, she also toured Holland, France, and Belgium for [[ENSA]] as \"Mrs Manningham\" in ''Angel Street'', and Britain (with [[Stewart Granger]]) in ''Gaslight''.\n\nHaving established herself as a film actress in the meantime, she made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in [[Robert Woodruff Anderson|Robert Anderson]]'s ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. Kerr repeated her role along with her stage partner [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] (no relation) in [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s film adaptation of the drama. In 1955, Kerr won the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway d\u00e9but in 1953, she toured the United States with ''Tea and Sympathy''. In 1975, she returned to Broadway, creating the role of Nancy in [[Edward Albee]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play ''[[Seascape (play)|Seascape]]''.\n\nIn 1977, she came back to the West End, playing the title role in a production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]''.\n\nThe theatre, despite her success in films, was always to remain Kerr's first love, even though going on stage filled her with trepidation:\n{{quote|I do it because it's exactly like dressing up for the grown ups.

The film was a hit in the US, as well as the UK, and Kerr won the New York Film Critics' Award as Actress of the Year. British exhibitors voted her the eighth-most popular local star at the box office.<ref>'Bing's Lucky Number: Pa Crosby Dons 4th B.O.

Kerr, nevertheless, used any opportunity to discard her cool exterior. She starred in the 1950 adventure film ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1950 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', shot on location in Africa with [[Stewart Granger]] and [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]. This was immediately followed by her appearance in the religious epic ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis?]]'' (1951), shot at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in Rome, in which she played the indomitable Lygia, a first-century Christian. She then played Princess Flavia in a remake of ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1952 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1952). In 1953, Kerr \"showed her theatrical mettle\" as Portia in [[Joseph Mankiewicz]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]''.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> She then departed from typecasting with a performance that brought out her sensuality, as \"Karen Holmes\", the embittered military wife in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), for which she received an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The [[American Film Institute]] acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which [[Burt Lancaster]] and she romped illicitly and passionately amidst crashing waves on a Hawaiian beach.

She also portrayed an earthy Australian sheep-herder's wife in ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960) and appeared as lustful and beautiful screen enchantresses in both ''[[Beloved Infidel]]'' (1959) and ''[[Bonjour Tristesse (film)|Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1958).\n\nAmong her most famous roles were [[Anna Leonowens]] in the film version of the [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956); and opposite [[Cary Grant]] as his shipboard romantic interest Terry McKay in the bittersweet love story ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'' (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, ''[[The Grass Is Greener]]'' (1960), and then joined [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]'' (1965). In 1965, the producers of ''[[Carry On Screaming!]]'' offered her a fee comparable to that paid to the rest of the cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Kerr appeared in the comedy ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', achieving the distinction of being, at 46, the oldest \"[[Bond Girl]]\" in any [[James Bond]] film, until [[Monica Bellucci]], at the age of 50, in ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015). In 1969, pressure of competition from younger, upcoming actresses made her agree to appear nude in [[John Frankenheimer]]'s ''[[The Gypsy Moths]]'', the only nude scene in her career. Concern about the parts being offered to her, as well as the increasing amount of nudity included in films, led her to abandon the medium at the end of the 1960s in favour of television and theatre work.<ref name=\"Deborah\"/>\n\n===Television===\nDeborah Kerr experienced a career resurgence on television in the early 1980s when she played the role of the nurse, played by [[Elsa Lanchester]] in the 1957 film, in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1982 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]''. Later, Kerr rejoined screen partner Robert Mitchum in ''[[Reunion at Fairborough]]''. She also took on the role of the older Emma Harte, a tycoon, in the adaptation of [[Barbara Taylor Bradford]]'s ''[[A Woman of Substance (miniseries)|A Woman of Substance]]''. For this performance, Kerr was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nKerr's first marriage was to [[Squadron Leader]] [[Tony Bartley|Anthony Bartley]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently married to the actor [[John Shrapnel]]). The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success,<ref name=\"Deborah\"/> and because her career often took her away from home. They divorced in 1959.\n\nHer second marriage was to author [[Peter Viertel]] on 23 July 1960. In marrying Viertel, she became stepmother to Viertel's daughter, Christine Viertel. Although she long resided in [[Klosters]], Switzerland and [[Marbella]], Spain, she moved back to Britain to be closer to her own children as her health began to deteriorate. Her husband, however, continued to live in Marbella.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/actress-deborah-kerr-dies-at-86/|title=Actress Deborah Kerr Dies at 86|author=|date=|website=www.cbsnews.com|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Stewart Granger]] claimed in his autobiography that she had approached him romantically in the back of his chauffeur-driven car at the time he was making ''Caesar and Cleopatra''.<ref>Granger, Stewart.

She then went to the Sadler's Wells ballet school and in 1938 made her d\u00e9but in the corps de ballet in ''Prometheus''. After various walk-on parts in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] productions at the [[Regent's Park Open Air Theatre|Open Air Theatre]] in [[Regent's Park]], London, she joined the Oxford Playhouse repertory company in 1940, playing, ''inter alia'', \"Margaret\" in ''Dear Brutus'' and \"Patty Moss\" in ''The Two Bouquets''.<ref name=\"Telegraph\" />\n\nIn 1943, aged 21, Deborah Kerr made her West End d\u00e9but as \"Ellie Dunn\" in a revival of ''Heartbreak House'' at the [[Cambridge Theatre]], stealing attention from stalwarts such as [[Edith Evans]] and [[Isabel Jeans]]. \"She has the rare gift\", wrote critic Beverley Baxter, \"of thinking her lines, not merely remembering them. The process of development from a romantic, silly girl to a hard, disillusioned woman in three hours was moving and convincing\".<ref name=\"Telegraph\" />\n\nKerr returned to the London stage 29 years later, in many productions including the old-fashioned, ''The Day After the Fair'' (Lyric, 1972), a [[Peter Ustinov]] comedy, ''Overheard'' (Haymarket, 1981) and a revival of [[Emlyn Williams]]'s ''The Corn is Green''.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> After her first London success in 1943, she toured England and Scotland in ''Heartbreak House''. Near the end of the Second World War, she also toured Holland, France, and Belgium for [[ENSA]] as \"Mrs Manningham\" in ''Angel Street'', and Britain (with [[Stewart Granger]]) in ''Gaslight''.\n\nHaving established herself as a film actress in the meantime, she made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in [[Robert Woodruff Anderson|Robert Anderson]]'s ''[[Tea and Sympathy (play)|Tea and Sympathy]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. Kerr repeated her role along with her stage partner [[John Kerr (actor)|John Kerr]] (no relation) in [[Vincente Minnelli]]'s film adaptation of the drama. In 1955, Kerr won the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway d\u00e9but in 1953, she toured the United States with ''Tea and Sympathy''. In 1975, she returned to Broadway, creating the role of Nancy in [[Edward Albee]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play ''[[Seascape (play)|Seascape]]''.\n\nIn 1977, she came back to the West End, playing the title role in a production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]''.\n\nThe theatre, despite her success in films, was always to remain Kerr's first love, even though going on stage filled her with trepidation:\n{{quote|I do it because it's exactly like dressing up for the grown ups.

She starred in the 1950 adventure film ''[[King Solomon's Mines (1950 film)|King Solomon's Mines]]'', shot on location in Africa with [[Stewart Granger]] and [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]]. This was immediately followed by her appearance in the religious epic ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis?]]'' (1951), shot at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in Rome, in which she played the indomitable Lygia, a first-century Christian. She then played Princess Flavia in a remake of ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda (1952 film)|The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1952). In 1953, Kerr \"showed her theatrical mettle\" as Portia in [[Joseph Mankiewicz]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]''.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> She then departed from typecasting with a performance that brought out her sensuality, as \"Karen Holmes\", the embittered military wife in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), for which she received an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].

She also portrayed an earthy Australian sheep-herder's wife in ''[[The Sundowners (1960 film)|The Sundowners]]'' (1960) and appeared as lustful and beautiful screen enchantresses in both ''[[Beloved Infidel]]'' (1959) and ''[[Bonjour Tristesse (film)|Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1958).\n\nAmong her most famous roles were [[Anna Leonowens]] in the film version of the [[Richard Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]] musical ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956); and opposite [[Cary Grant]] as his shipboard romantic interest Terry McKay in the bittersweet love story ''[[An Affair to Remember]]'' (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, ''[[The Grass Is Greener]]'' (1960), and then joined [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, ''[[Marriage on the Rocks]]'' (1965). In 1965, the producers of ''[[Carry On Screaming!]]'' offered her a fee comparable to that paid to the rest of the cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''.\n\nIn 1967, Kerr appeared in the comedy ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'', achieving the distinction of being, at 46, the oldest \"[[Bond Girl]]\" in any [[James Bond]] film, until [[Monica Bellucci]], at the age of 50, in ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015). In 1969, pressure of competition from younger, upcoming actresses made her agree to appear nude in [[John Frankenheimer]]'s ''[[The Gypsy Moths]]'', the only nude scene in her career. Concern about the parts being offered to her, as well as the increasing amount of nudity included in films, led her to abandon the medium at the end of the 1960s in favour of television and theatre work.<ref name=\"Deborah\"/>\n\n===Television===\nDeborah Kerr experienced a career resurgence on television in the early 1980s when she played the role of the nurse, played by [[Elsa Lanchester]] in the 1957 film, in ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1982 film)|Witness for the Prosecution]]''. Later, Kerr rejoined screen partner Robert Mitchum in ''[[Reunion at Fairborough]]''. She also took on the role of the older Emma Harte, a tycoon, in the adaptation of [[Barbara Taylor Bradford]]'s ''[[A Woman of Substance (miniseries)|A Woman of Substance]]''. For this performance, Kerr was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nKerr's first marriage was to [[Squadron Leader]] [[Tony Bartley|Anthony Bartley]] [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently married to the actor [[John Shrapnel]]). The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success,<ref name=\"Deborah\"/> and because her career often took her away from home. They divorced in 1959.\n\nHer second marriage was to author [[Peter Viertel]] on 23 July 1960. In marrying Viertel, she became stepmother to Viertel's daughter, Christine Viertel. Although she long resided in [[Klosters]], Switzerland and [[Marbella]], Spain, she moved back to Britain to be closer to her own children as her health began to deteriorate.

In an FA Cup tie for [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], in November 1971, he scored nine goals in an 11\u20130 win against [[Margate F.C.|Margate]]. He formed a successful striking partnership with [[Phil Boyer]] at four of his clubs.\n\n==Playing career==\nMacDougall was raised in [[Inverness]], moving to [[Widnes]], [[Lancashire]], with his parents shortly after his 12th birthday. He subsequently played in a local men's amateur league, and worked as a trainee [[compositing|compositor]] on a local newspaper.\n\n===Liverpool===\nMacDougall joined [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] as an apprentice in 1964 and, on the day he turned 19, he was offered a professional contract at [[Anfield]] by manager [[Bill Shankly]]. However, MacDougall did not make it at Liverpool, where [[Ian St. John]], [[Roger Hunt]] and [[Tony Hateley]] shared the goal-scoring duties, and he only made one first-team appearance, as a substitute in a UEFA Cup match.\n\n===York City===\nIn 1967 MacDougall left Liverpool to join Fourth Division [[York City F.C.|York City]] for \u00a35,000.\n\nHe quickly established himself as a prolific centre-forward. He scored on his debut against [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]], and went on to finish with 15 goals in his first season at [[Bootham Crescent]].\n\nIn the following season MacDougall linked up for the first time with [[Phil Boyer]], who helped him score 19 times despite the fact that York were struggling near the bottom of the table.\n\nDespite the fact that MacDougall scored 40 goals in two seasons, York twice had to apply for re-election during his two seasons at the club\n\n===Bournemouth===\nIn the summer of 1969, manager [[Freddie Cox]] brought in three new strikers at [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic]]. One of the new strikers, MacDougall, was to become known as \"SuperMac\". \u00a310,000 was paid to the Minstermen for MacDougall's signature.\n\nDespite MacDougall's signing, and the 21 league goals he contributed, the Cherries were relegated to the 4th Division in 1970 and Freddie Cox was sacked by the then chairman Harold Walker.\n\nIn came [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]], who, at first, didn't rate MacDougall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} By October, however, he had netted 16 goals, helping the team to climb to the top of the table. That season also saw the club record for the number of goals scored in a game smashed as MacDougall put six past [[Oxford City F.C.|Oxford City]] in an FA Cup replay that eventually finished 8\u20131.\n\nIn December 1970, on MacDougall's recommendation, Bond snapped up Phil Boyer from York City to be re-united with MacDougall. The pairing helped Bournemouth and Boscombe to promotion in second place, with MacDougall scoring 42 league goals.\n\nOn their return to Division 3 in the 1971\u201372 season, and with the new name change to A.F.C Bournemouth implemented, Bournemouth finished in third place in Division 3, narrowly missing a second successive promotion at a time when only two clubs went up.\n\nOn 20 November 1971, MacDougall netted nine goals in Bournemouth's 11\u20130 victory over [[Margate F.C.|Margate]] in the first round of the FA Cup.<ref name=\"hassan\">{{cite news |first=Nabil |last1=Hassan |first2=Adam |last2=Blackmore |title=When Ted MacDougall scored nine goals in the FA Cup for Bournemouth |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15776021 |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date= 17 November 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2012 }}</ref> MacDougall scored five in the first half \u2013 at which point the Margate boss jokingly asked Bond to substitute their tormentor{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} \u2013 and another four after the interval.

He also linked up again with [[Phil Boyer]], who had played alongside MacDougall at both Bournemouth and York.\n\nAt the end of the 1973\u201374 season, the Canaries were relegated to the Second Division, although in the following season they not only regained their First Division status but also reached the final of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].\n\nIn the semi-final, Norwich defeated MacDougall's former club Manchester United (who were also spending a season in the Second Division). The final against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] was a tense, scrappy affair in which MacDougall had few scoring opportunities, with Villa winning by a single goal. It would be MacDougall's only cup final appearance.\n\nAt the end of the 1974\u201375 season, MacDougall was given his only run in the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national side]]. He made a scoring debut against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], and managed three goals in seven games before being passed over as competition for places in the Scottish team was fairly intense at this time.\n\nIn the 1975\u201376 season, Norwich were able to maintain their First Division place, with MacDougall contributing 23 goals, making him the division's top scorer. Highlights include two hat-tricks in the space of four games.\n\nDespite this, however, in the autumn of 1976 MacDougall moved on to Second Division [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to work with manager [[Lawrie McMenemy]], who was in the process of rebuilding the side, for \u00a350,000. [[Kevin Reeves]] was signed for the same sum from Bournemouth to replace him.\n\n===Southampton===\nAt Southampton, he scored 23 league goals in his first season, playing alongside players such as [[Mick Channon]] and [[Peter Osgood]], although they were unable to gain promotion to Division One.\n\nIn the [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377 season]], MacDougall had his only taste of European football as the Saints progressed to the quarter-finals of the [[Cup Winners Cup]] before losing to Belgian team [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], although MacDougall did score the winner in a 2\u20131 victory in the second leg at [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]].\n\nIn the following season, [[1977\u201378 in English football|1977\u201378]], Southampton were finally promoted back to [[Football League Division 1|Division One]]. By now MacDougall had once again renewed his partnership with Phil Boyer, with the pair scoring an astonishing 31 of the team's 70 league goals.\n\nOnce Southampton had secured their place back in the First Division, McMenemy deemed MacDougall \"surplus to requirements\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} \u2013 rumoured to have been encouraged to do so by MacDougall himself, who was finding himself a tad \"off the pace\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} as his career progressed towards its culmination, and he was transferred back to his \"happy hunting ground\",{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Dean Court.\n\n===Back to Bournemouth===\nIn November 1978, six years after departing, MacDougall rejoined the Cherries, under manager [[John Benson (footballer, born 1942)|John Benson]], on a free transfer from Southampton. Benson was soon replaced by [[Alec Stock]] and things were on the up after his first game, in which the Cherries thumped [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster]] 7\u20131, but the good fortune did not continue as Bournemouth finished in 18th place. MacDougall's second spell at Bournemouth was not as prolific as his first (16 goals in 50 appearances).\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn February 1980, MacDougall left Bournemouth to join [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball's]] [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] as player-coach until October 1980 and thereafter was restricted to occasional matches in [[non-League football]] at [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]], [[Poole Town F.C.|Poole Town]] and [[Gosport Borough F.C.|Gosport Borough]].\n\nIn June 1998 he rejoined Alan Ball as reserve-team coach at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], but was sacked with Ball on 14 December 1999.\n\nMacDougall also spent time based in [[Atlanta]], USA, where he was youth Director of Coaching with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantasilverbacks.com/youth/index.php?id=00001&opt=viewpage&type=html |title=2007 coaching staff |accessdate=18 August 2012 |publisher=[[Atlanta Silverbacks]] }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWhilst at Bournemouth, MacDougall started his own business \u2013 a sports shop in Boscombe called \"Ted MacDougall Sports\", with another branch opened in Poole later on. The Boscombe branch was given a grand opening by [[Geoff Hurst]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nHe was for a period the landlord of the Mill Arms public house at [[Dunbridge railway station|Dunbridge]], Hampshire.\n\nWhen he had finished playing at non-League level, he went to live in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, where he became a successful property developer.\n\nIn July 2013, the redeveloped south stand at Bournemouth's [[Dean Court]] stadium was named after MacDougall in recognition of his service at the club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fletch: Stand is fitting for MacDougall |url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2013-07-19-fletch-stand-is-fitting-for-macdougall-930456.aspx |website=afcb.co.uk |publisher=AFC Bournemouth |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722153135/http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2013-07-19-fletch-stand-is-fitting-for-macdougall-930456.aspx |archivedate=22 July 2013  }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;General\n*{{Cite book |first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk |title=In That Number \u2013 A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |publisher=Hagiology Publishing |year=2003 |pages=542\u2013543 |isbn=0-9534474-3-X }}\n\n;Specific\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Soccerbase}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061207150740/http://www.football-england.com/ted_macdougall.html Profile on football-england.com]\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dorset/content/image_galleries/cherries_goodtimes_gallery.shtml?2 Picture of MacDougall in action for Bournemouth]\n*{{SFA Profile|id=113804}}\n*[http://nasljerseys.com/Players/M/MacDougall.Ted.htm Detroit Express stats]\n\n{{Navboxes colour\n| title = Awards\n| bg = gold\n| fg = navy\n| list1 = \n{{English First Division top scorers}}\n{{English Third Division top scorers}}\n{{English Fourth Division top scorers}}\n{{Norwich City F.C.

In an FA Cup tie for [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], in November 1971, he scored nine goals in an 11\u20130 win against [[Margate F.C.|Margate]]. He formed a successful striking partnership with [[Phil Boyer]] at four of his clubs.\n\n==Playing career==\nMacDougall was raised in [[Inverness]], moving to [[Widnes]], [[Lancashire]], with his parents shortly after his 12th birthday. He subsequently played in a local men's amateur league, and worked as a trainee [[compositing|compositor]] on a local newspaper.\n\n===Liverpool===\nMacDougall joined [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] as an apprentice in 1964 and, on the day he turned 19, he was offered a professional contract at [[Anfield]] by manager [[Bill Shankly]]. However, MacDougall did not make it at Liverpool, where [[Ian St. John]], [[Roger Hunt]] and [[Tony Hateley]] shared the goal-scoring duties, and he only made one first-team appearance, as a substitute in a UEFA Cup match.\n\n===York City===\nIn 1967 MacDougall left Liverpool to join Fourth Division [[York City F.C.|York City]] for \u00a35,000.\n\nHe quickly established himself as a prolific centre-forward. He scored on his debut against [[Workington A.F.C.|Workington]], and went on to finish with 15 goals in his first season at [[Bootham Crescent]].\n\nIn the following season MacDougall linked up for the first time with [[Phil Boyer]], who helped him score 19 times despite the fact that York were struggling near the bottom of the table.\n\nDespite the fact that MacDougall scored 40 goals in two seasons, York twice had to apply for re-election during his two seasons at the club\n\n===Bournemouth===\nIn the summer of 1969, manager [[Freddie Cox]] brought in three new strikers at [[AFC Bournemouth|Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic]].  One of the new strikers, MacDougall, was to become known as \"SuperMac\". \u00a310,000 was paid to the Minstermen for MacDougall's signature.\n\nDespite MacDougall's signing, and the 21 league goals he contributed, the Cherries were relegated to the 4th Division in 1970 and Freddie Cox was sacked by the then chairman Harold Walker.\n\nIn came [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]], who, at first, didn't rate MacDougall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} By October, however, he had netted 16 goals, helping the team to climb to the top of the table.

He also linked up again with [[Phil Boyer]], who had played alongside MacDougall at both Bournemouth and York.\n\nAt the end of the 1973\u201374 season, the Canaries were relegated to the Second Division, although in the following season they not only regained their First Division status but also reached the final of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].\n\nIn the semi-final, Norwich defeated MacDougall's former club Manchester United (who were also spending a season in the Second Division). The final against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] was a tense, scrappy affair in which MacDougall had few scoring opportunities, with Villa winning by a single goal. It would be MacDougall's only cup final appearance.\n\nAt the end of the 1974\u201375 season, MacDougall was given his only run in the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national side]]. He made a scoring debut against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], and managed three goals in seven games before being passed over as competition for places in the Scottish team was fairly intense at this time.\n\nIn the 1975\u201376 season, Norwich were able to maintain their First Division place, with MacDougall contributing 23 goals, making him the division's top scorer. Highlights include two hat-tricks in the space of four games.\n\nDespite this, however, in the autumn of 1976 MacDougall moved on to Second Division [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to work with manager [[Lawrie McMenemy]], who was in the process of rebuilding the side, for \u00a350,000. [[Kevin Reeves]] was signed for the same sum from Bournemouth to replace him.\n\n===Southampton===\nAt Southampton, he scored 23 league goals in his first season, playing alongside players such as [[Mick Channon]] and [[Peter Osgood]], although they were unable to gain promotion to Division One.\n\nIn the [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377 season]], MacDougall had his only taste of European football as the Saints progressed to the quarter-finals of the [[Cup Winners Cup]] before losing to Belgian team [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], although MacDougall did score the winner in a 2\u20131 victory in the second leg at [[The Dell (Southampton F.C.)|The Dell]].\n\nIn the following season, [[1977\u201378 in English football|1977\u201378]], Southampton were finally promoted back to [[Football League Division 1|Division One]]. By now MacDougall had once again renewed his partnership with Phil Boyer, with the pair scoring an astonishing 31 of the team's 70 league goals.\n\nOnce Southampton had secured their place back in the First Division, McMenemy deemed MacDougall \"surplus to requirements\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} \u2013 rumoured to have been encouraged to do so by MacDougall himself, who was finding himself a tad \"off the pace\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} as his career progressed towards its culmination, and he was transferred back to his \"happy hunting ground\",{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Dean Court.\n\n===Back to Bournemouth===\nIn November 1978, six years after departing, MacDougall rejoined the Cherries, under manager [[John Benson (footballer, born 1942)|John Benson]], on a free transfer from Southampton. Benson was soon replaced by [[Alec Stock]] and things were on the up after his first game, in which the Cherries thumped [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster]] 7\u20131, but the good fortune did not continue as Bournemouth finished in 18th place. MacDougall's second spell at Bournemouth was not as prolific as his first (16 goals in 50 appearances).\n\n==Coaching career==\nIn February 1980, MacDougall left Bournemouth to join [[Alan Ball, Jr.|Alan Ball's]] [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] as player-coach until October 1980 and thereafter was restricted to occasional matches in [[non-League football]] at [[Salisbury City F.C.|Salisbury City]], [[Poole Town F.C.|Poole Town]] and [[Gosport Borough F.C.|Gosport Borough]].\n\nIn June 1998 he rejoined Alan Ball as reserve-team coach at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], but was sacked with Ball on 14 December 1999.\n\nMacDougall also spent time based in [[Atlanta]], [[United States]], where he was youth Director of Coaching with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantasilverbacks.com/youth/index.php?id=00001&opt=viewpage&type=html |title=2007 coaching staff |accessdate=18 August 2012 |publisher=[[Atlanta Silverbacks]] }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWhilst at Bournemouth, MacDougall started his own business \u2013 a sports shop in Boscombe called \"Ted MacDougall Sports\", with another branch opened in Poole later on. The Boscombe branch was given a grand opening by [[Geoff Hurst]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nHe was for a period the landlord of the Mill Arms public house at [[Dunbridge railway station|Dunbridge]], Hampshire.\n\nWhen he had finished playing at non-League level, he went to live in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], where he became a successful property developer.\n\nIn July 2013, the redeveloped south stand at Bournemouth's [[Dean Court]] stadium was named after MacDougall in recognition of his service at the club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fletch: Stand is fitting for MacDougall |url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2013-07-19-fletch-stand-is-fitting-for-macdougall-930456.aspx |website=afcb.co.uk |publisher=AFC Bournemouth |date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=20 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722153135/http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2013-07-19-fletch-stand-is-fitting-for-macdougall-930456.aspx |archivedate=22 July 2013  }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;General\n*{{Cite book |first1=Duncan |last1=Holley |first2=Gary |last2=Chalk |title=In That Number \u2013 A post-war chronicle of Southampton FC |publisher=Hagiology Publishing |year=2003 |pages=542\u2013543 |isbn=0-9534474-3-X }}\n\n;Specific\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Soccerbase}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061207150740/http://www.football-england.com/ted_macdougall.html Profile on football-england.com]\n*[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dorset/content/image_galleries/cherries_goodtimes_gallery.shtml?2 Picture of MacDougall in action for Bournemouth]\n*{{SFA Profile|id=113804}}\n*[http://nasljerseys.com/Players/M/MacDougall.Ted.htm Detroit Express stats]\n\n{{Navboxes colour\n| title = Awards\n| bg = gold\n| fg = navy\n| list1 = \n{{English First Division top scorers}}\n{{English Third Division top scorers}}\n{{English Fourth Division top scorers}}\n{{Norwich City F.C.

The squadron, known as the \"Dragons\", is based at [[Marine Corps Air Station Futenma]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Japan]] and falls under the command of [[Marine Aircraft Group 36]] (MAG-36) and the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] (1st MAW).\n\n==Mission==\nSupport the [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]] (MAGTF) Commander by providing assault support transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment, day or night under all weather conditions during expeditionary, joint or combined operations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nHMM-265 was commissioned on October 1, 1962 at [[Marine Corps Air Station New River|Marine Corps Air Facility Jacksonville]], [[North Carolina]]. Originally flying the [[H-34 Choctaw|UH-34]], the squadron deployed to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] shortly after commissioning in support of the Mississippi Crisis, a critical moment in the [[American civil rights movement]]. Following that, HMM-265 began a series of deployments testing new helicopter tactics such as the night raid. The squadron's commanding officer, LtCol Beeler, developed innovative new helicopter tactics and became a legacy in the \"Dragons\" and in helicopter aviation.\n\nThe day of destiny for HMM-265 occurred on June 29, 1964 as BUNO 150942 was flown for 3.4 hours to the squadron's home at MCAF Jacksonville by LtCol Beeler. By July of that year, the squadron began accepting Sea Knights and is the first F[[Fleet Marine Force]] squadron to fly the aircraft.<ref name=Mersky_p224>[[#Mersky|Mersky]] (1983), p.224.</ref> To commemorate their new aircraft, the Dragons of HMM-265 unveiled a new insignia on October 1, 1964. This design, created by PFC Charles D. Lyles, was the official unit patch until 2007, when a new design was adopted, based on the Japanese [[Shinjitai]] for [[dragon]]: . On February 4, 1966, as HMM-265 became the first Marine Squadron to log 10,000 accident free hours in the CH-46A. This is a great achievement in an era when the CH-46 was going through the growing pains that occur when a new aircraft is fielded.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nIn April 1966, HMM-265 boarded {{USS|Boxer|LPH-4|6}} in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. On May 22, 1966, the squadron arrived in [[Vietnam]] at the [[Marble Mountains (Vietnam)|Marble Mountain Air Facility]] located southeast of [[Da Nang Air Base]]. The squadron had 22 CH-46As and was assigned to [[Marine Aircraft Group 16]], [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]].[[File:Hmm265-a.gif|thumb|left|200px|HMM-265 Vietnam-era patch]]\n\nOn July 15, 1966, during the first day of [[Operation Hastings]], HMM-265 had two of its helicopters crash. The first crash was caused when a CH-46A struck a tree during the initial insert of Marines from [[3rd Battalion 4th Marines|3rd Battalion, 4th Marines]] and the second occurred later that evening when aircraft EP-171 was hit at {{convert|1,500|ft|m}} by 12.7&nbsp;mm fire resulting in the death of 13 Marines.<ref name=Coan_p41-42>[[#Coan|Coan]] (2004), pp. 41-42.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.flyarmy.org/panel/battle/66071501.HTM|title= How 'Helicopter Valley' got its name information|website=www.flyarmy.org}}</ref>  In addition to daily missions transporting Marines and cargo, HMM-265 and its Sea Knights flew in support of [[Operation Macon]] from July 4 through October 27, 1966. HMM-265 along with [[HMM-164]] conducted multiple battalion insertions to allow the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]] to conduct multiple [[search and destroy]] missions in the [[An Hoa Combat Base|An Hoa region]]. [[12th Marine Regiment (United States)|12th Marines]] artillery and Marine [[A-4 Skyhawk]]s fired on landing zones prior to the CH-46s landing.\n\nThe other major operation in 1966 was [[Operation Prairie]] (August 3 \u2013 September 13). The Dragons supported the [[4th Marine Regiment (United States)|4th Marine Regiment]] as they battled for the [[Mutter's Ridge|Nui Cay Tre (Mutter's) Ridge]]. Landing in \u201chot\u201d zones under heavy enemy fire marked this battle, a harbinger of future battles in Vietnam.\n\nIn July 1967, HMM-265 became the Special Landing Force (SLF) helicopter squadron embarked aboard the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet's]] [[Amphibious Ready Group]]. As the SLF squadron, the Dragons were tasked with conducting heliborne search and destroy missions against [[Viet Cong]] targets along the coast. During this time, five major operations were conducted with names such as Bear Chain/Fremont, Beacon Guide, Kangaroo Kick, Beacon Gate, and Cochise.\n\nThe Dragons resumed duties as the SLF squadron aboard {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}} in May 1969. They conducted amphibious raids in support of Operations Bold Pursuit (June 27 \u2013 July 6), Mighty Play (July 10 \u2013 July 20), and finally Defiant Stand (September 7 \u2013 September 18). After three years in Vietnam, the squadron was [[Operation Keystone Cardinal|relocated]] to [[Marine Corps Air Station Santa Ana]], [[California]] on October 10, 1969 leaving their helicopters with other in-country squadrons. A total of twenty-seven HMM-265 Marines perished in the war. HMM-265 was rebuilt using a few squadron personnel returned from Vietnam and the Marines of [[HMMT-301]].  The CH-46A helicopters left behind in Vietnam were replaced by the CH-46 Super D from overhaul.  The squadron was deactivated on November 13, 1970.\n\n===Reactivation in 1977===\nOn September 1, 1977, HMM-265 was reactivated at [[Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay]], [[Hawaii]] under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Donald Klingler, reestablishing a presence in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] that continues to this day. On the day of reactivation, the squadron had no helicopters, and by December it was almost at a full strength of 4 CH-46Ds and 7 CH-46Fs.\n\nIn the spring of 1978, HMM-265 deployed to Kauai's Barking Sands training area to increase combat readiness in preparation for their upcoming Western Pacific deployment. While there, the squadron performed exercises in low terrain flying and troop transportation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goodson|first1=Sgt.

Col. William Barba during a Change of Command ceremony on February 22. Under the leadership of Barba, the squadron continued to operate in and out of Kaneohe Bay and the Western Pacific.\n\nUnder Barba, HMM-265 (REIN) \"Dragons\" deployed aboard {{USS|Tarawa|LHA-1|6}} as part of Task Group 76.3/Amphibious Ready Group Alfa/Amphibious Squadron Seven. HMM-265 was equipped with 12 CH-46D Sea Knight and were reinforced by detachments from HMH-463 \"Pegasus\" and 4 CH-53D Sea Stallions, HMA-169 \"Vipers\" with 4 AH-1T Sea Cobra / 2 UH-1N Hueys from MCAS Camp Pendleton, California, and VMA-513 \"Flying Nightmares\" with 6 AV-8A Harriers based out of MCAS Yuma, Arizona. After boarding USS ''Tarawa'', Amphibious Squadron Seven left San Diego on from 14 October 1980, visiting Subic Bay, Philippines and participating in exercises Valiant Blitz in the Philippines, Amphibious Squadron Seven spent almost a week at Phattaya Beach, from 22 to 27 December, before moving on to Singapore where she arrived on the 30th. After operations in [[Diego Garcia]] where Amphibious Squadron Seven's embarked marines carried out a landing exercise between 28 and 30 January, they headed south east for exercise Valiant Usher 81-3 off Lancelin, Western Australia with units of the Australian MIlitary. After Valiant Usher off Western Australia, VMA-513 and Amphibious Squadron One conducted an R&R visit to Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia from 8-13 February 1981. The squadron later took part in exercises Team Spirit 81 and Valiant Flex 81\u20132 at Pusan (Busan) South Korea. HMM-265 (REIN) arrived back at MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii before or about 16 April 1981 with the detachments arriving home shortly after.\n\n[[File:Hmm265-dragons.jpg|thumb|left|225px|CH-46 of HMM-265 lands on the deck of {{USS|Essex|LHD-2|6}} in January 2004]][[File:HMM-265 new patch.PNG|thumb|right|200px|HMM-265 old squadron patch]]\n\n===Gulf War & the 1990s===\nIn 1990 and 1991 the Dragons were attached to the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, Marine Air Group 50.

During this deployment the Dragons provided support to [[HMX-1]] for the Presidential visit to Tokyo. The Dragons were then called to [[Cambodia]] in support of [[Operation Full Accounting]] in 1992, where they assisted in the recovery of remains of US Servicemen lost during the Vietnam War. The Dragons of HMM-265 were relocated entirely to [[Marine Corps Air Station Futenma]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Japan]] in early 1995.\n\nHeightened tensions in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the fall of 1998 brought the Dragons back on a no-notice deployment as the [[Aviation Combat Element]] (ACE) for the [[31st Marine Expeditionary Unit]]. They participated in [[Operation Desert Fox]] in the Persian Gulf and [[Kuwait]] from November 1998 through February 1999.  When the squadron returned, they had a short break before deploying again.  This time, the Marines helped end a bloody [[civil war]] on the small island country of [[East Timor]] during [[Operation Stabilise]] in October 1999 and again during January and February 2000.\n\n===Global War on Terror===\nDeployed in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] operating from [[Al Asad Airbase]], [[Al-Qa'im (town)|Al-Qa'im]], and [[Korean Village]] from October 2004 to February 2005.\n\n=== Losses ===\nOn 5 August 2017 a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey, assigned to VMM-265 with the [[31st Marine Expeditionary Unit]], crashed in [[Shoalwater Bay]] on the east coast of Australia after taking off from the amphibious assault ship {{USS|Bonhomme Richard|LHD-6|6}}.  23 personnel were rescued, while three were missing {{as of|2017|8|6|lc=y|df=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/us-military-helicopter-crashes-off-queensland-two-feared-dead/news-story/885fa149cbf29da4e02c18e07a0bfeb7 |title=US military helicopter crashes off Queensland; three feared dead |publisher=The Daily Telegraph |date=5 August 2017 |accessdate=6 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2017/08/05/marine-osprey-crashes-off-australia/|title=Three Marines missing after Osprey crashes off Australia|first=Jeff|last=Schogol|date=August 5, 2017|website=Marine Corps Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-army-mv-22-osprey-heli-plane-crashes-australian-n789836|title=3 U.S. Marines missing after heli-plane crashes off Australian coast|website=NBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* Marine Corps Aviation Association's Squadron of the Year for 1992, 1999, 2000 and 2009.\n* [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Safety Award for the years 1978, \u201879, \u201884, \u201894, \u201895, \u201896, \u201897, and 2009.\n* The squadron surpassed 60,000 mishap free flight hours in the fall of 2003.\n\n==Gallery==\n{{commonscat|Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265}}\n<gallery>\nFile:HMM-265 Squadron Insignia 1977.jpg|HMM-265 Squadron Insignia 1977\nFile:Squadron Plaque 1977.jpg|HMM-265 Squadron Plaque 1977\nFile:HMM-265 Group Squadron Photo 1977.jpeg|HMM-265 Squadron Group Photo 1977\nFile:HMM-265 Squadron Plaque 1979.jpg|HMM-265 Squadron Plaque 1979\nFile:HMM-265 Squadron Group Photo 1979.jpeg|HMM-265 Group Squadron Photo 1979\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n:{{Marine Corps}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last =Coan\n  | first =James P.\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Con Thien - Hill of Angels\n  | publisher = The University of Alabama Press\n  | year = 2004\n  | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama\n  | doi =\n  | isbn= 0-8173-1414-8\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Mersky\n | first = Peter B.\n | year = 1983\n | title = U.S. Marine Corps Aviation - 1912 to the Present\n | publisher = Nautical and Aviation Publishing Company of America\n | isbn = 0-933852-39-8\n}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last =Sturkey \n  | first =Marion F.\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =BONNIE-SUE: A Marine Corps Helicopter Squadron in Vietnam \n  | publisher =Heritage Press International\n  | year =1997\n  | location =\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-9650814-2-7\n  | page =509\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n;Web\n{{Refbegin}}\n[http://www.1stmaw.marines.mil/SubordinateUnits/MarineAircraftGroup36/VMM265.aspx VMM-265 Official Website]\n{{Refend}}\n\n{{US Marine Corps navbox}}\n{{1stMAW}}\n\n[[Category:Helicopter squadrons of the United States Marine Corps|Medium 9]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|US Marine Corps transport squadron}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name= Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265\n|image= VMM 265 Reinforced patches.jpg\n|image_size= 200px\n|caption= VMM-265 insignia\n|dates= *October 1, 1962- November 13, 1970\n*September 1, 1977 - present\n|country= [[United States]]\n|allegiance= [[United States|United States of America]]\n|branch= [[United States Marine Corps]]\n|type= Medium-lift tiltrotor squadron\n|role= Conduct assault support operations for the [[Fleet Marine Force]]s\n|size=\n|command_structure= [[Marine Aircraft Group 36]]<br/>[[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]]\n|current_commander= [http://www.1stmaw.marines.mil/SubordinateUnits/MarineAircraftGroup36/VMM265/CommandSuite/CommandingOfficer LtCol Mark E.

The squadron, known as the \"Dragons\", is based at [[Marine Corps Air Station Futenma]], [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], [[Japan]] and falls under the command of [[Marine Aircraft Group 36]] (MAG-36) and the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] (1st MAW).\n\n==Mission==\nSupport the [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]] (MAGTF) Commander by providing assault support transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment, day or night under all weather conditions during expeditionary, joint or combined operations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nHMM-265 was commissioned on October 1, 1962 at [[Marine Corps Air Station New River|Marine Corps Air Facility Jacksonville]], [[North Carolina]]. Originally flying the [[H-34 Choctaw|UH-34]], the squadron deployed to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] shortly after commissioning in support of the Mississippi Crisis, a critical moment in the [[American civil rights movement]]. Following that, HMM-265 began a series of deployments testing new helicopter tactics such as the night raid. The squadron's commanding officer, LtCol Beeler, developed innovative new helicopter tactics and became a legacy in the \"Dragons\" and in helicopter aviation.\n\nThe day of destiny for HMM-265 occurred on June 29, 1964 as BUNO 150942 was flown for 3.4 hours to the squadron's home at MCAF Jacksonville by LtCol Beeler. By July of that year, the squadron began accepting Sea Knights and is the first F[[Fleet Marine Force]] squadron to fly the aircraft.<ref name=Mersky_p224>[[#Mersky|Mersky]] (1983), p.224.</ref> To commemorate their new aircraft, the Dragons of HMM-265 unveiled a new insignia on October 1, 1964. This design, created by PFC Charles D. Lyles, was the official unit patch until 2007, when a new design was adopted, based on the Japanese [[Shinjitai]] for [[dragon]]: . On February 4, 1966, as HMM-265 became the first Marine Squadron to log 10,000 accident free hours in the CH-46A. This is a great achievement in an era when the CH-46 was going through the growing pains that occur when a new aircraft is fielded.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nIn April 1966, HMM-265 boarded {{USS|Boxer|LPH-4|6}} in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. On May 22, 1966, the squadron arrived in [[Vietnam]] at the [[Marble Mountains (Vietnam)|Marble Mountain Air Facility]] located southeast of [[Da Nang Air Base]].
