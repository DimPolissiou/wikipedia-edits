The station is owned by [[Standard Media]]. WLNE's studios are located in the Orms Building in downtown Providence, and its transmitter is based in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1963\u20131977)===\nThe station began broadcasting on January 1, 1963, as '''WTEV''' from studios on 430 County Street in New Bedford.<ref>http://menujoy.com/wtev/</ref> Its transmitter was located in [[Little Compton, Rhode Island]], with the antenna mounted on a {{convert|500|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tower; a few years later, WTEV moved to a {{convert|950|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tower in [[Tiverton, Rhode Island|Tiverton]]. The Tiverton transmitter was still {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} away from the transmitter sites in Rehoboth used by the existing stations in the Providence market, [[WJAR|WJAR-TV]] (channel 10) and WPRO-TV (channel 12, now [[WPRI-TV]]). However, WTEV could not build a tower in Rehoboth due to the risk of interference with [[WRGB]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], [[WCSH|WCSH-TV]] in [[Portland, Maine]], and [[WPVI-TV|WFIL-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]], which all broadcast on channel 6 in the analog era. Before cable arrived in Rhode Island in the early 1970s, viewers experienced reception problems with WTEV. This was because for its first four decades on air, its transmitter was located in [[Newport County, Rhode Island|Newport County]], resulting in its signal being sent from a different direction than WJAR-TV and WPRO-TV/WPRI-TV. This forced viewers to mount their outdoor antennas on rotators to get a passable signal from the station. The ensuing signal problems would be the bane of channel 6's existence for 45 years.\n\nABC had a curious history in Rhode Island prior to WTEV's sign-on. In the earliest years of television in Providence, all four networks (including [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]) were shoehorned on primary [[NBC]] affiliate WJAR-TV, at that time the market's only television station (WJAR carried about half of NBC's and [[CBS]]' programming, but very few ABC or DuMont shows). WNET launched on channel 16 in 1953 as an ABC affiliate. However, it was forced off the air in 1956 due to the difficulties faced by UHF startups at the time. Since television manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability on television sets prior to 1964, viewers needed an expensive converter (or an all-channel set, the latter being very rare at the time) to watch WNET, and the picture was marginal at best even with one. For the seven years prior to channel 6's sign-on, WJAR and CBS affiliate WPRO-TV cherry-picked ABC programming, usually airing it in off-hours but occasionally preempting their primary network's schedule. Much of Rhode Island could access the full ABC schedule from [[Boston]] stations\u2014[[WHDH-TV (defunct)|WHDH-TV]] (channel 5, now occupied by [[WCVB-TV]]) prior to January 1, 1961, and [[WNAC-TV (defunct)|WNAC-TV]] (channel 7, presently occupied by the present-day [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] [not to be confused with the now-defunct WHDH on channel 5]) from 1961 to 1963.\n\nEven though Providence was big enough to support three full network affiliates, it soon became apparent that channel 16 would not be resurrected in the near future. The owners of the future WTEV decided to seek a waiver of FCC technical regulations to allow VHF channel 6 to be added to the FCC's ''Table of Allocations''.<ref>http://www.fcc.gov/spectrum</ref> The channel 6 license had originally been allocated to the island of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]] off [[Cape Cod]], in the Boston market. However, at the time, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules required that a station have its studios and offices located in its community of license, and numerous FCC filings argued that it was not practical to operate a full-service television station from Nantucket. Since a channel 6 allocation in the Providence area would have been short-spaced to WCSH-TV and WRGB, the FCC allocation was modified to New Bedford\u2014the nearest city on the Massachusetts side of the market where a transmitter could be built that could decently cover Providence while protecting WCSH-TV and WRGB from interference.\n\nNew Bedford and [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]] are part of the Rhode Island market due to Rhode Island's small geographic size, even though the rest of southern Massachusetts is in the Boston market (counties were assigned by [[Arbitron]] and [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] to a particular television market based upon their viewing patterns). The advent of satellite television made this an irritation to some Massachusetts subscribers of services such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] who are unable to receive Massachusetts news and sports from Boston stations. The FCC allows network affiliates to prevent satellite subscribers from receiving network stations from outside the station's designated market. Bristol County is the only part of Massachusetts associated with Rhode Island for television purposes.\n\nWTEV was founded by WTEV Television, Inc.,<ref>http://www.tv-signoffs.com/audio/1964signoffs/WTEV-signoff-1964.mp3</ref> a group that was 55-percent owned by E. Anthony and Sons, publisher of the New Bedford ''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' and owner of WNBH radio ([[WNBH|1340 AM]] and 98.1 FM, now [[WCTK]]); the remaining 45 percent was held by New England Television, the holder of the license for the old WNET.<ref name=\"by1964\">{{cite book|title=Broadcasting Yearbook 1964|year=1964|pages=A-25\u20136|url=http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1964/Section%20A%20%20TV%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201964.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1966, shortly after E.

At the time, ABC was aggressively pursuing strong NBC and CBS affiliates to switch as their ratings rose during the late 1970s, and succeeded in persuading some longtime NBC and CBS stations to switch (as an example, [[KSTP-TV]] in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] and [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]], both longtime NBC affiliates, switched to ABC during that period).\n\nIn 1979, the Steinmans sold WTEV and their flagship station, [[WGAL|WGAL-TV]] in Lancaster, to [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer Publishing]]. This sale reunited them with [[KOAT-TV]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], which had been sold to Pulitzer in 1969. Pulitzer changed channel 6's call letters to the present-day '''WLNE-TV''' on September 8, 1980. The new call letters were used as a promotional acronym: \"<u>W</u>e <u>L</u>ove <u>N</u>ew <u>E</u>ngland.\"  The WTEV call sign was later used on the CBS affiliate in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], from March 1996 until September 2014, when that station changed its call sign to [[WJAX-TV]]. Under Pulitzer, the station acquired studio space in the Orms Building in downtown Providence. Within a few years, most of the station's main operations were moved to Providence. The original New Bedford facility was used as a [[news bureau]], secondary studio, and sales office through the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1983, Pulitzer sold WLNE to [[Freedom Communications]]. This sale was necessary because Pulitzer had acquired WFBC-TV (now [[WYFF]]) in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], and [[WXII-TV]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], that same year, leaving the company one VHF station over the FCC's ownership limit of the time.\n\n===Return to ABC (1995\u2013present)===\nWPRI was sold to CBS in the spring of 1995, making it a CBS [[owned-and-operated station]] and one of the last such acquisitions prior to the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]'s [[Westinghouse Broadcasting#Merger with CBS|purchase of the network]] in August of that year. This resulted in the sale of WPRI to [[Clear Channel Communications]] due to a significant signal overlap with [[WBZ-TV]], which had [[1994 United States broadcast television realignment|joined CBS]] back in January of that year as a result of an affiliation agreement that also affected its sister stations, [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[WJZ-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. As a result, at midnight on September 10, 1995, WPRI reversed the 1977 swap with WLNE and officially rejoined CBS. WLNE then became an ABC affiliate again, and began calling itself '''ABC6'''.<ref name=projo-wlneabc6>{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Jerry|last2=Katz|first2=Celeste|title=Newport teachers get 10 days to deal|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/580919401.html?dids=580919401:580919401&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+09%2C+1995&author=O+Brien%2C+Jerry%3B+Katz%2C+Celeste&pub=The+Providence+Journal&desc=Newport+teachers+get+10+days+to+deal&pqatl=google|accessdate=January 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]]|date=September 9, 1995}}</ref> CBS sold WPRI to [[Clear Channel Communications]] seven months after Westinghouse's acquisition of CBS was finalized.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of May 4, 2005, WLNE's analog transmitter was knocked off the air due to a faulty section of transmission line on the tower. The transmitter had been running at 80% power due to another unrelated technical problem that occurred approximately two weeks earlier. Although Dish Network [[satellite television|satellite]] and some [[cable television|cable]] systems continued to receive broadcasts through fiber optic connections, [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] and DirecTV satellite subscribers were left without a local ABC affiliate (DirecTV gets its signal via antenna).  Some cable providers made special temporary arrangements to carry Boston ABC station WCVB during this outage. The WLNE transmitter was operational again late Thursday evening after 32 hours off the air.<ref>Paul Grimaldi and Timothy C. Barmann (May 7, 2005). \"Channel 6 off air for over a day\".

Barmann (August 17, 2006). \"Longtime owners say Channel 6 is for sale\". ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', pp. F1</ref> The key reason for the decision was the lack of a second station for Freedom to operate in the market that would improve synergies for the Providence operation. On March 12, 2007, Freedom announced it was selling WLNE to [[Global Broadcasting]], a [[Delaware corporation]] headed by Robinson Ewert and Kevin O'Brien.<ref>Lynn Arditi (March 13, 2007). \"Deal reached on sale of WLNE \u2013 A private company plans to purchase the ABC affiliate\".

''[[The Providence Journal]]'', pp. B1.</ref> Freedom continued to operate WLNE's website until November 30, 2007, when control was shifted to Broadcast Interactive Media, and later WorldNow in April 2010. Global Broadcasting was not related to a Canadian network, the [[Global Television Network]], or its then-parent, [[Canwest Global Communications]].\n\n=== Financial struggles, bankruptcy===\nOn June 23, NewsBlues reported that Global Broadcasting co-owner Robinson Ewert had left the company amidst a dispute with CBS over licensing fees for programs originating from [[CBS Television Distribution|its syndication unit]]. He was replaced by Rob Holtzer, general sales manager at Sunrise Sports and Entertainment, owner of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Florida Panthers]] and the [[BankAtlantic Center]] in [[Sunrise, Florida]].

Still, due to the fact it operates from Rehoboth with the other major Rhode Island stations, it now has a signal comparable to WJAR and WPRI for the first time ever.\n\n==Programming==\nAs an ABC affiliate, WLNE runs virtually the entire ABC programming schedule. Effective with the 1995 affiliation switch, Saturday morning [[infomercial]]s were replaced with ABC's Saturday morning program block (currently known as [[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]; that block replaced [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] in 2011). [[broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WLNE includes ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[Hot Bench]]'', ''[[Judge Jerry]]'', ''[[25 Words or Less (game show)|25 Words or Less]]'' and ''[[The 700 Club]]'', among others.\n\n===Past programming preemptions and deferrals===\nAs WTEV, the station moderately preempted ABC shows, in most every case a low-rated program. This did not pose as much of a problem, since most viewers could still get the full ABC schedule on Boston's WNAC until 1972, and on WCVB afterward. During afternoon hours, WTEV ran [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and classic sitcoms, with late nights being devoted to movies.\n\nBeginning in 1980, WLNE ran an afternoon movie from 4:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. By 1982, the station was also running a movie weekdays from 9:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m. These movies were run under the ''[[Dialing For Dollars]]'' promotion and were hosted by George Allen for a decade. WLNE also continued to preempt moderate amounts of programming, particularly whatever game show CBS ran at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (to accommodate the morning movie), as well as [[The CBS Late Movie|late night programming]]. As a result of the preemptions, ''[[Child's Play (game show)|Child's Play]]'', the 1983 version of ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', and ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' never aired on WLNE; the 1986 version of ''[[Card Sharks]]'' did not air on the station until late in the show's run. Other shows, such as ''[[Tattletales]]'' and ''[[Body Language (game show)|Body Language]]'' were tape-delayed and aired in the noon slot, since WLNE did not have a noon news broadcast at that time. Providence area viewers could also watch the preempted shows via WNEV, which was available over-the-air on the Massachusetts side of the market. Throughout much of the 1980s, WLNE was known for running two movies a day.\n\nBy the fall of 1988, WLNE was only running an afternoon movie weekdays and began clearing CBS' 10:00&nbsp;a.m. hour. In the fall of 1989, WLNE dropped CBS' ''[[Guiding Light]]'', moving the movie to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. and adding more syndicated programming in the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. hour; by mid-1990, the afternoon movie was dropped in favor of additional syndicated programming. In the fall of 1990, WLNE dropped the CBS [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s in favor of several movies in that time slot. In 1991, ''Guiding Light'' was reinstated. By 1993, the Saturday morning movies were replaced with educational children's programs and infomercials.\n\nFor many years, WLNE carried the syndicated shows ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', ''[[Rachael Ray (talk show)|Rachael Ray]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Insider (TV program)|The Insider]]'', and ''Inside Edition'' from CBS Television Distribution. However, in mid-2009, the station was unable to reach a carriage agreement with the syndicator, successor to [[King World Productions]] and [[Paramount Domestic Television]]. At that time, the station was carrying ''Dr. Phil'', ''Entertainment Tonight'', and ''Inside Edition''. As a result of the situation, the shows were dropped on June 5 and quickly moved to [[WNAC-TV]] (channel 64, and the legal successor to the former WNET).<ref>[[WNAC-TV|WNAC]] (June 29, 2009). \"'Phil', ET, Inside Edition get new home\". {{cite web |url=http://www.foxprovidence.com/dpp/entertainment/television/foxprovidence_dr_phil_et_inside_edition_move_20090629 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217171613/http://www.foxprovidence.com/dpp/entertainment/television/foxprovidence_dr_phil_et_inside_edition_move_20090629 |archivedate=February 17, 2012  }}</ref> Temporarily put in their place were ''[[Cristina's Court]]'', ''[[Family Court with Judge Penny]]'', a 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''.<ref>[http://www.tvnewsday.com TVNEWSDAY] (June 5, 2009). \"WLNE Providence Dropping CTD Syndies\".

The Sunday morning public affairs program debuted very early in 1963. Numerous politicians appeared on the show, including two [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]]. In late 2005, [[Truman Taylor]] taped his final show. He is now a featured op-ed columnist for the ''[[Providence Journal]]''. In early 2006, ''ABC6 News On the Record'' replaced ''Truman Taylor'', with Jim Hummel hosting the program until his departure from the station in July 2008. Following his departure, ''On the Record'' was temporarily taken off-the-air and replaced with infomercials. The show returned in October 2008 with John DeLuca and former Providence mayor [[Buddy Cianci]] as co-hosts. Cianci would host the show solo from May 2011 until his death in January 2016. Another hiatus would follow.\n\nOn June 19, 2016, WLNE debuted ''In the Arena'', with former Providence mayor Joe Paolino, Jr. as host.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Donnis|first1=Ian|title=Paolino To Host New Sunday Morning Show On ABC6|url=http://ripr.org/post/paolino-host-new-sunday-morning-show-abc6|accessdate=June 17, 2016|work=[[Rhode Island Public Radio]]|date=June 16, 2016}}</ref> The show initially consisted of a [[Round table (discussion)|round table]] discussion with guest political analysts and Paolino as moderator.

As WTEV, it was one of the first affiliates of the \"Love Network\" when it was formed in 1968. Local segments had been broadcast from the [[Warwick Mall]] for several years. In 2007, the telethon relocated to the [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel in downtown Providence. In 2008, the telethon was broadcast from [[Twin River Casino]] in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]]. Local segments continued to be broadcast from Twin River until 2012, when the telethon became the ''MDA Show of Strength''. The following year, the show began being televised over one national network (ABC) and the local segments were discontinued. The final ''Show of Strength'' was broadcast in 2014.\n\nWLNE became the first station in Rhode Island to broadcast a local program in high-definition when it aired [[Bristol's 4th of July Parade]] in 2008 live with production facilities provided by Comcast. In 2009, the station won an [[Emmy Award]] for its pre-parade special, ''Reflections of the Fourth: Celebrating Bristol'', from the Boston/New England chapter of the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]].<ref> [http://www.newenglandemmy.org</ref> The parade was not broadcast in 2011 amidst the change in station ownership, but would return in 2012. WLNE has been the official television home of the parade since 2006.\n\n===''Caught in Providence''===\n''Caught in Providence'' is a [[reality television|reality]] [[court show]] presided over by Judge [[Frank Caprio (judge)|Frank Caprio]]. The program showcases the proceedings inside Providence Municipal Court.

Operated by WLNE (until 2012) and Cox Communications, it was the first and only 24-hour local news channel in the state. It provided non-stop news 24 hours a day, seven days a week, mainly consisting of rebroadcasts of news that aired on WLNE. The station could only be found on Cox Cable channel 5 in Rhode Island. NewsChannel 5 also provided live, continuing coverage of breaking news and other events. When severe weather struck, the WLNE weather team provided up to the minute forecasts.\n\nPrior to Citadel Communications' acquisition of WLNE, there were three live newscasts that aired exclusively on NewsChannel 5. From its launch, a weekend morning newscast was seen exclusively on the station. As of May 2011, this newscast was also broadcast on the main channel. On September 29, 2008, WLNE began offering an extra hour of local news on weekday mornings at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. An extended hour of ''Good Morning Providence'' was one of two 7 o'clock local newscasts in the market, the other being an extended hour of WPRI's ''Eyewitness News This Morning'' on WNAC-TV. This newscast was no longer broadcast as of May 2011. WLNE occasionally aired a 10 o'clock newscast during major news events or when sports programming preempted the 10 o'clock news on competitor WNAC. As of May 2011, this newscast no longer aired.\n\nFor a brief period in September 2009, an audio feed of NewsChannel 5 was broadcast on radio station [[WALE (Rhode Island)|WALE]] in various timeslots; this included a start-to-finish simulcast of the ''Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon''. On February 1, 2012, WLNE's affiliation with Cox channel 5 ended, and its programming on the channel was replaced with WJAR programming and is now [[Ocean State Networks]] (OSN).<ref name=wlne-rinewschannel5>{{cite web|title=Cox No Longer Airing ABC6 News on Rhode Island News Channel 5|url=http://www.abc6.com/story/16652841/cox-no-longer-airing-abc6-news-on-rhode-island-news-channel-5|work=abc6.com|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:Super Bowl LII experience reporters.jpg|thumb|right|WLNE reporters at the [[NFL Experience|Super Bowl Experience]] in [[Minnesota]] for [[Super Bowl LII]].]]\nWLNE presently broadcasts 27\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLNE has placed a distant third in the market, behind WJAR and WPRI. The station has been known for numerous turnovers in format, talent and management over the years for the purpose of increasing its newscast ratings and sales revenue, all having little or no effect. Under Global Broadcasting's ownership, changes in image and news coverage resulted in a marginal ratings increase and for a time, ''ABC6 News'' was promoted as \"New England's Fastest Growing News\". The ratings surge did not last for long. However, on March 29, 2011, WLNE scored its first late news victory in years, finishing number one at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. following the series premiere of network medical drama ''[[Body of Proof]]'', which was filmed entirely in Rhode Island for its first season.\n\nOn October 24, 2007, WLNE announced that infamous former Providence mayor and [[WPRO (AM)|WPRO]] personality Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci would join the station as chief political analyst and contributing editor starting on November 1.<ref>[http://www.abc6.com abc6.com] (October 24, 2007). \"ABC6 names \"Buddy\" Cianci Chief Political Analyst & Contributing Editor\".</ref> Cianci was a political analyst at WLNE in the late 1980s. As part of his duties at the station, he moderated a daily segment on ''ABC6 News''. It was first entitled ''Your Attention Please'' and was co-moderated in-studio by former Chief Reporter Jim Hummel. Following Hummel's departure from the station in July 2008, it was changed to ''Buddy TV'' and weeknight anchor John DeLuca became co-moderator. The segment aired live during the former ''ABC6 News First At Four'' with Cianci first appearing in-studio and then from the [[East Providence, Rhode Island|East Providence]] studios of WPRO, where the segment was simulcast during his weekday show that aired from 2:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. In October 2008, he started co-hosting the Sunday morning public affairs program ''ABC6 News On the Record'' with DeLuca.\n\nWith the change in station ownership in May 2011, the segment name was changed to ''The World According to Buddy'' with a solo Cianci in the ABC6 studios. The segment was taped live during the noon newscasts and re-aired during the 5 o'clock news. He also became a solo host of ''On the Record''. On June 25, 2014, Cianci announced that he would be seeking a third term as mayor of Providence as an Independent candidate. As a result, he had to step down from his position at WLNE as well as WPRO for the duration of the campaign.

The hour-long newscast aired for just over three years and competed head to head with ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' airing on WJAR. ''First At Four'' last aired in April 2011 prior to the sale of the station to Citadel. In March 2020, under Standard Media, WLNE began airing a special half-hour 4 o'clock newscast with extended coverage of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nIn May 2009, WLNE launched a 10 o'clock newscast on Sunday mornings. Previously, it had only produced weekend morning newscasts for ''NewsChannel 5''. It was the only Providence station with a local news broadcast airing at that time. In May 2011, Citadel moved the newscast to 7:30&nbsp;a.m. and added Saturday morning broadcasts in addition to Sunday mornings. The weekend morning newscasts were cancelled in 2012.\n\nIn June 2009, the station launched the market's first (since the 1980s) 7 o'clock newscast on weeknights, filling the spot vacated by ''Entertainment Tonight'', which was taken off the schedule due to the station's dispute with CBS Television Distribution.

The station is owned by [[Standard Media]]. WLNE's studios are located in the Orms Building in downtown Providence, and its transmitter is based in [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts]].\n\n==History==\n===Early years (1963\u20131977)===\nThe station began broadcasting on January 1, 1963, as '''WTEV''' from studios on 430 County Street in New Bedford.<ref>http://menujoy.com/wtev/</ref> Its transmitter was located in [[Little Compton, Rhode Island]], with the antenna mounted on a {{convert|500|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tower; a few years later, WTEV moved to a {{convert|950|ft|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tower in [[Tiverton, Rhode Island|Tiverton]]. The Tiverton transmitter was still {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} away from the transmitter sites in Rehoboth used by the existing stations in the Providence market, [[WJAR|WJAR-TV]] (channel 10) and WPRO-TV (channel 12, now [[WPRI-TV]]). However, WTEV could not build a tower in Rehoboth due to the risk of interference with [[WRGB]] in [[Schenectady, New York]], [[WCSH|WCSH-TV]] in [[Portland, Maine]], and [[WPVI-TV|WFIL-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]], which all broadcast on channel 6 in the analog era. Before cable arrived in Rhode Island in the early 1970s, viewers experienced reception problems with WTEV. This was because for its first four decades on air, its transmitter was located in [[Newport County, Rhode Island|Newport County]], resulting in its signal being sent from a different direction than WJAR-TV and WPRO-TV/WPRI-TV. This forced viewers to mount their outdoor antennas on rotators to get a passable signal from the station. The ensuing signal problems would be the bane of channel 6's existence for 45 years.\n\nABC had a curious history in Rhode Island prior to WTEV's sign-on. In the earliest years of television in Providence, all four networks (including [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]) were shoehorned on primary [[NBC]] affiliate WJAR-TV, at that time the market's only television station (WJAR carried about half of NBC's and [[CBS]]' programming, but very few ABC or DuMont shows). WNET launched on channel 16 in 1953 as an ABC affiliate. However, it was forced off the air in 1956 due to the difficulties faced by UHF startups at the time. Since television manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuning capability on television sets prior to 1964, viewers needed an expensive converter (or an all-channel set, the latter being very rare at the time) to watch WNET, and the picture was marginal at best even with one. For the seven years prior to channel 6's sign-on, WJAR and CBS affiliate WPRO-TV cherry-picked ABC programming, usually airing it in off-hours but occasionally preempting their primary network's schedule. Much of Rhode Island could access the full ABC schedule from [[Boston]] stations\u2014[[WHDH-TV (defunct)|WHDH-TV]] (channel 5, now occupied by [[WCVB-TV]]) prior to January 1, 1961, and [[WNAC-TV (defunct)|WNAC-TV]] (channel 7, presently occupied by the present-day [[WHDH (TV)|WHDH]] [not to be confused with the now-defunct WHDH on channel 5]) from 1961 to 1963.\n\nEven though Providence was big enough to support three full network affiliates, it soon became apparent that channel 16 would not be resurrected in the near future. The owners of the future WTEV decided to seek a waiver of FCC technical regulations to allow VHF channel 6 to be added to the FCC's ''Table of Allocations''.<ref>http://www.fcc.gov/spectrum</ref> The channel 6 license had originally been allocated to the island of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]] off [[Cape Cod]], in the Boston market. However, at the time, [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) rules required that a station have its studios and offices located in its community of license, and numerous FCC filings argued that it was not practical to operate a full-service television station from Nantucket. Since a channel 6 allocation in the Providence area would have been short-spaced to WCSH-TV and WRGB, the FCC allocation was modified to New Bedford\u2014the nearest city on the Massachusetts side of the market where a transmitter could be built that could decently cover Providence while protecting WCSH-TV and WRGB from interference.\n\nNew Bedford and [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]] are part of the Rhode Island market due to Rhode Island's small geographic size, even though the rest of southern Massachusetts is in the Boston market (counties were assigned by [[Arbitron]] and [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] to a particular television market based upon their viewing patterns). The advent of satellite television made this an irritation to some Massachusetts subscribers of services such as [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] who are unable to receive Massachusetts news and sports from Boston stations. The FCC allows network affiliates to prevent satellite subscribers from receiving network stations from outside the station's designated market. Bristol County is the only part of Massachusetts associated with Rhode Island for television purposes.\n\nWTEV was founded by WTEV Television, Inc.,<ref>http://www.tv-signoffs.com/audio/1964signoffs/WTEV-signoff-1964.mp3</ref> a group that was 55-percent owned by E. Anthony and Sons, publisher of the New Bedford ''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' and owner of WNBH radio ([[WNBH|1340 AM]] and 98.1 FM, now [[WCTK]]); the remaining 45 percent was held by New England Television, the holder of the license for the old WNET.<ref name=\"by1964\">{{cite book|title=Broadcasting Yearbook 1964|year=1964|pages=A-25\u20136|url=http://www.davidgleason.com/Archive%20BC-YB/1964/Section%20A%20%20TV%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201964.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1966, shortly after E.

At the time, ABC was aggressively pursuing strong NBC and CBS affiliates to switch as their ratings rose during the late 1970s, and succeeded in persuading some longtime NBC and CBS stations to switch (as an example, [[KSTP-TV]] in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]] and [[WSB-TV]] in [[Atlanta]], both longtime NBC affiliates, switched to ABC during that period).\n\nIn 1979, the Steinmans sold WTEV and their flagship station, [[WGAL|WGAL-TV]] in Lancaster, to [[Pulitzer, Inc.|Pulitzer Publishing]]. This sale reunited them with [[KOAT-TV]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], which had been sold to Pulitzer in 1969. Pulitzer changed channel 6's call letters to the present-day '''WLNE-TV''' on September 8, 1980. The new call letters were used as a promotional acronym: \"<u>W</u>e <u>L</u>ove <u>N</u>ew <u>E</u>ngland.\"  The WTEV call sign was later used on the CBS affiliate in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], from March 1996 until September 2014, when that station changed its call sign to [[WJAX-TV]]. Under Pulitzer, the station acquired studio space in the Orms Building in downtown Providence. Within a few years, most of the station's main operations were moved to Providence. The original New Bedford facility was used as a [[news bureau]], secondary studio, and sales office through the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1983, Pulitzer sold WLNE to [[Freedom Communications]]. This sale was necessary because Pulitzer had acquired WFBC-TV (now [[WYFF]]) in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], and [[WXII-TV]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], that same year, leaving the company one VHF station over the FCC's ownership limit of the time.\n\n===Return to ABC (1995\u2013present)===\nWPRI was sold to CBS in the spring of 1995, making it a CBS [[owned-and-operated station]] and one of the last such acquisitions prior to the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]'s [[Westinghouse Broadcasting#Merger with CBS|purchase of the network]] in August of that year. This resulted in the sale of WPRI to [[Clear Channel Communications]] due to a significant signal overlap with [[WBZ-TV]], which had [[1994 United States broadcast television realignment|joined CBS]] back in January of that year as a result of an affiliation agreement that also affected its sister stations, [[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[WJZ-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. As a result, at midnight on September 10, 1995, WPRI reversed the 1977 swap with WLNE and officially rejoined CBS. WLNE then became an ABC affiliate again, and began calling itself '''ABC6'''.<ref name=projo-wlneabc6>{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Jerry|last2=Katz|first2=Celeste|title=Newport teachers get 10 days to deal|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/projo/access/580919401.html?dids=580919401:580919401&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+09%2C+1995&author=O+Brien%2C+Jerry%3B+Katz%2C+Celeste&pub=The+Providence+Journal&desc=Newport+teachers+get+10+days+to+deal&pqatl=google|accessdate=January 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The Providence Journal]]|date=September 9, 1995}}</ref> CBS sold WPRI to [[Clear Channel Communications]] seven months after Westinghouse's acquisition of CBS was finalized.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of May 4, 2005, WLNE's analog transmitter was knocked off the air due to a faulty section of transmission line on the tower. The transmitter had been running at 80% power due to another unrelated technical problem that occurred approximately two weeks earlier. Although Dish Network [[satellite television|satellite]] and some [[cable television|cable]] systems continued to receive broadcasts through fiber optic connections, [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] and DirecTV satellite subscribers were left without a local ABC affiliate (DirecTV gets its signal via antenna).  Some cable providers made special temporary arrangements to carry Boston ABC station WCVB during this outage. The WLNE transmitter was operational again late Thursday evening after 32 hours off the air.<ref>Paul Grimaldi and Timothy C. Barmann (May 7, 2005). \"Channel 6 off air for over a day\".

Still, due to the fact it operates from Rehoboth with the other major Rhode Island stations, it now has a signal comparable to WJAR and WPRI for the first time ever.\n\n==Programming==\nAs an ABC affiliate, WLNE runs virtually the entire ABC programming schedule. Effective with the 1995 affiliation switch, Saturday morning [[infomercial]]s were replaced with ABC's Saturday morning program block (currently known as [[Litton's Weekend Adventure]]; that block replaced [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]] in 2011). [[broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programming on WLNE includes ''[[Access Hollywood]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[Hot Bench]]'', ''[[Judge Jerry]]'', ''[[25 Words or Less (game show)|25 Words or Less]]'' and ''[[The 700 Club]]'', among others.\n\n===Past programming preemptions and deferrals===\nAs WTEV, the station moderately preempted ABC shows, in most every case a low-rated program. This did not pose as much of a problem, since most viewers could still get the full ABC schedule on Boston's WNAC until 1972, and on WCVB afterward. During afternoon hours, WTEV ran [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and classic sitcoms, with late nights being devoted to movies.\n\nBeginning in 1980, WLNE ran an afternoon movie from 4:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. By 1982, the station was also running a movie weekdays from 9:00 to 11:00&nbsp;a.m. These movies were run under the ''[[Dialing For Dollars]]'' promotion and were hosted by George Allen for a decade. WLNE also continued to preempt moderate amounts of programming, particularly whatever game show CBS ran at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. (to accommodate the morning movie), as well as [[The CBS Late Movie|late night programming]]. As a result of the preemptions, ''[[Child's Play (game show)|Child's Play]]'', the 1983 version of ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', and ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' never aired on WLNE; the 1986 version of ''[[Card Sharks]]'' did not air on the station until late in the show's run. Other shows, such as ''[[Tattletales]]'' and ''[[Body Language (game show)|Body Language]]'' were tape-delayed and aired in the noon slot, since WLNE did not have a noon news broadcast at that time. Providence area viewers could also watch the preempted shows via WNEV, which was available over-the-air on the Massachusetts side of the market. Throughout much of the 1980s, WLNE was known for running two movies a day.\n\nBy the fall of 1988, WLNE was only running an afternoon movie weekdays and began clearing CBS' 10:00&nbsp;a.m. hour. In the fall of 1989, WLNE dropped CBS' ''[[Guiding Light]]'', moving the movie to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. and adding more syndicated programming in the 5:00&nbsp;p.m. hour; by mid-1990, the afternoon movie was dropped in favor of additional syndicated programming. In the fall of 1990, WLNE dropped the CBS [[Saturday morning cartoon]]s in favor of several movies in that time slot. In 1991, ''Guiding Light'' was reinstated. By 1993, the Saturday morning movies were replaced with educational children's programs and infomercials.\n\nFor many years, WLNE carried the syndicated shows ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', ''[[Rachael Ray (talk show)|Rachael Ray]]'', ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Insider (TV program)|The Insider]]'', and ''Inside Edition'' from CBS Television Distribution. However, in mid-2009, the station was unable to reach a carriage agreement with the syndicator, successor to [[King World Productions]] and [[Paramount Domestic Television]]. At that time, the station was carrying ''Dr. Phil'', ''Entertainment Tonight'', and ''Inside Edition''. As a result of the situation, the shows were dropped on June 5 and quickly moved to [[WNAC-TV]] (channel 64, and the legal successor to the former WNET).<ref>[[WNAC-TV|WNAC]] (June 29, 2009). \"'Phil', ET, Inside Edition get new home\". {{cite web |url=http://www.foxprovidence.com/dpp/entertainment/television/foxprovidence_dr_phil_et_inside_edition_move_20090629 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217171613/http://www.foxprovidence.com/dpp/entertainment/television/foxprovidence_dr_phil_et_inside_edition_move_20090629 |archivedate=February 17, 2012  }}</ref> Temporarily put in their place were ''[[Cristina's Court]]'', ''[[Family Court with Judge Penny]]'', a 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, and ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''.<ref>[http://www.tvnewsday.com TVNEWSDAY] (June 5, 2009). \"WLNE Providence Dropping CTD Syndies\".

The Sunday morning public affairs program debuted very early in 1963. Numerous politicians appeared on the show, including two [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]]. In late 2005, [[Truman Taylor]] taped his final show. He is now a featured op-ed columnist for the ''[[Providence Journal]]''. In early 2006, ''ABC6 News On the Record'' replaced ''Truman Taylor'', with Jim Hummel hosting the program until his departure from the station in July 2008. Following his departure, ''On the Record'' was temporarily taken off-the-air and replaced with infomercials. The show returned in October 2008 with John DeLuca and former Providence mayor [[Buddy Cianci]] as co-hosts. Cianci would host the show solo from May 2011 until his death in January 2016. Another hiatus would follow.\n\nOn June 19, 2016, WLNE debuted ''In the Arena'', with former Providence mayor Joe Paolino, Jr. as host.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Donnis|first1=Ian|title=Paolino To Host New Sunday Morning Show On ABC6|url=http://ripr.org/post/paolino-host-new-sunday-morning-show-abc6|accessdate=June 17, 2016|work=[[Rhode Island Public Radio]]|date=June 16, 2016}}</ref> The show initially consisted of a [[Round table (discussion)|round table]] discussion with guest political analysts and Paolino as moderator.

As WTEV, it was one of the first affiliates of the \"Love Network\" when it was formed in 1968. Local segments had been broadcast from the [[Warwick Mall]] for several years. In 2007, the telethon relocated to the [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel in downtown Providence. In 2008, the telethon was broadcast from [[Twin River Casino]] in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island|Lincoln]]. Local segments continued to be broadcast from Twin River until 2012, when the telethon became the ''MDA Show of Strength''. The following year, the show began being televised over one national network (ABC) and the local segments were discontinued. The final ''Show of Strength'' was broadcast in 2014.\n\nWLNE became the first station in Rhode Island to broadcast a local program in high-definition when it aired [[Bristol's 4th of July Parade]] in 2008 live with production facilities provided by Comcast. In 2009, the station won an [[Emmy Award]] for its pre-parade special, ''Reflections of the Fourth: Celebrating Bristol'', from the Boston/New England chapter of the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]].<ref> [http://www.newenglandemmy.org</ref> The parade was not broadcast in 2011 amidst the change in station ownership, but would return in 2012.

Operated by WLNE (until 2012) and Cox Communications, it was the first and only 24-hour local news channel in the state. It provided non-stop news 24 hours a day, seven days a week, mainly consisting of rebroadcasts of news that aired on WLNE. The station could only be found on Cox Cable channel 5 in Rhode Island. NewsChannel 5 also provided live, continuing coverage of breaking news and other events. When severe weather struck, the WLNE weather team provided up to the minute forecasts.\n\nPrior to Citadel Communications' acquisition of WLNE, there were three live newscasts that aired exclusively on NewsChannel 5. From its launch, a weekend morning newscast was seen exclusively on the station. As of May 2011, this newscast was also broadcast on the main channel. On September 29, 2008, WLNE began offering an extra hour of local news on weekday mornings at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. An extended hour of ''Good Morning Providence'' was one of two 7 o'clock local newscasts in the market, the other being an extended hour of WPRI's ''Eyewitness News This Morning'' on WNAC-TV. This newscast was no longer broadcast as of May 2011. WLNE occasionally aired a 10 o'clock newscast during major news events or when sports programming preempted the 10 o'clock news on competitor WNAC. As of May 2011, this newscast no longer aired.\n\nFor a brief period in September 2009, an audio feed of NewsChannel 5 was broadcast on radio station [[WALE (Rhode Island)|WALE]] in various timeslots; this included a start-to-finish simulcast of the ''Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon''. On February 1, 2012, WLNE's affiliation with Cox channel 5 ended, and its programming on the channel was replaced with WJAR programming and is now [[Ocean State Networks]] (OSN).<ref name=wlne-rinewschannel5>{{cite web|title=Cox No Longer Airing ABC6 News on Rhode Island News Channel 5|url=http://www.abc6.com/story/16652841/cox-no-longer-airing-abc6-news-on-rhode-island-news-channel-5|work=abc6.com|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n[[File:Super Bowl LII experience reporters.jpg|thumb|right|WLNE reporters at the [[NFL Experience|Super Bowl Experience]] in [[Minnesota]] for [[Super Bowl LII]].]]\nWLNE presently broadcasts 27\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5\u00bd hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays).\n\nFor most of its history, WLNE has placed a distant third in the market, behind WJAR and WPRI. The station has been known for numerous turnovers in format, talent and management over the years for the purpose of increasing its newscast ratings and sales revenue, all having little or no effect. Under Global Broadcasting's ownership, changes in image and news coverage resulted in a marginal ratings increase and for a time, ''ABC6 News'' was promoted as \"New England's Fastest Growing News\". The ratings surge did not last for long. However, on March 29, 2011, WLNE scored its first late news victory in years, finishing number one at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. following the series premiere of network medical drama ''[[Body of Proof]]'', which was filmed entirely in Rhode Island for its first season.\n\nOn October 24, 2007, WLNE announced that infamous former Providence mayor and [[WPRO (AM)|WPRO]] personality Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci would join the station as chief political analyst and contributing editor starting on November 1.<ref>[http://www.abc6.com abc6.com] (October 24, 2007). \"ABC6 names \"Buddy\" Cianci Chief Political Analyst & Contributing Editor\".</ref> Cianci was a political analyst at WLNE in the late 1980s. As part of his duties at the station, he moderated a daily segment on ''ABC6 News''. It was first entitled ''Your Attention Please'' and was co-moderated in-studio by former Chief Reporter Jim Hummel. Following Hummel's departure from the station in July 2008, it was changed to ''Buddy TV'' and weeknight anchor John DeLuca became co-moderator. The segment aired live during the former ''ABC6 News First At Four'' with Cianci first appearing in-studio and then from the [[East Providence, Rhode Island|East Providence]] studios of WPRO, where the segment was simulcast during his weekday show that aired from 2:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;p.m. In October 2008, he started co-hosting the Sunday morning public affairs program ''ABC6 News On the Record'' with DeLuca.\n\nWith the change in station ownership in May 2011, the segment name was changed to ''The World According to Buddy'' with a solo Cianci in the ABC6 studios. The segment was taped live during the noon newscasts and re-aired during the 5 o'clock news. He also became a solo host of ''On the Record''. On June 25, 2014, Cianci announced that he would be seeking a third term as mayor of Providence as an Independent candidate. As a result, he had to step down from his position at WLNE as well as WPRO for the duration of the campaign. Former chief political reporter [[Mark Curtis (broadcaster)|Mark Curtis]] took over as host of the program while Cianci campaigned for office. He lost the bid to Democrat [[Jorge Elorza]] and returned to his previous positions shortly after the 2014 general elections.\n\nOn January 27, 2016, Cianci was taken from the WLNE studios to [[Miriam Hospital]] after falling ill during the taping of ''On the Record'' and was pronounced dead on January 28 at age 74.<ref name=wlne-ciancidead>{{cite web|title=Vincent \"Buddy\" Cianci dies at 74|url=http://ww.abc6.com/story/31075183/breaking-vincent-buddy-cianci-has-died|website=abc6.com|accessdate=January 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131201824/http://ww.abc6.com/story/31075183/breaking-vincent-buddy-cianci-has-died|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The episode did not make air, with a special on Cianci airing in its place on January 31.<ref name=projo-wlnecianci>{{cite news|last1=Catanzaro|first1=Mikki|title=WLNE-TV to air Cianci special Sunday in late mayor's timeslot|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20160128/wlne-tv-to-air-cianci-special-sunday-in-late-mayors-timeslot|accessdate=January 28, 2016|work=Providence Journal|date=January 28, 2016}}</ref> The Sunday morning public affairs program was then put on hiatus until June 2016 when ''In the Arena'' with Joe Paolino debuted.\n\nOn December 17, 2007, WLNE announced it would launch ''ABC6 News First At Four'', the [[media market|market]]'s first-ever 4 o'clock news on January 14, 2008. Described as a \"hard newscast\" and not morning-show style fluff, ''First At Four'' gave WLNE a head start in coverage of weather and politics. The hour-long newscast aired for just over three years and competed head to head with ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' airing on WJAR. ''First At Four'' last aired in April 2011 prior to the sale of the station to Citadel. In March 2020, under Standard Media, WLNE began airing a special half-hour 4 o'clock newscast with extended coverage of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nIn May 2009, WLNE launched a 10 o'clock newscast on Sunday mornings. Previously, it had only produced weekend morning newscasts for ''NewsChannel 5''. It was the only Providence station with a local news broadcast airing at that time. In May 2011, Citadel moved the newscast to 7:30&nbsp;a.m. and added Saturday morning broadcasts in addition to Sunday mornings. The weekend morning newscasts were cancelled in 2012.\n\nIn June 2009, the station launched the market's first (since the 1980s) 7 o'clock newscast on weeknights, filling the spot vacated by ''Entertainment Tonight'', which was taken off the schedule due to the station's dispute with CBS Television Distribution. In March 2011, this newscast was replaced with infomercials, with the newscast airing only in the event they could not sell the time slot on a given day.<ref name=wlne7pmbrainfomercial>{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Andrew|title=Providence\u2019s WLNE Airs Bra Infomercial in Place of 7:00&nbsp;pm Newscast|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/providences-wlne-airs-bra-infomercial-in-place-of-7-p-m-newscast_b7751|accessdate=May 5, 2011|newspaper=TVSpy|date=March 16, 2011}}</ref> After the station's sale to Citadel, this newscast was officially replaced with syndicated programming the following month.\n\nOn April 5, 2011, WLNE announced a new programming lineup that included the addition of a 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast on April 25.<ref name=WLNE040511/> The station then began to shift towards [[video journalism]], and all remaining reporters and new hires were converted into one man bands.<ref name=\"WLNEMMJ\">{{cite web |title=Liz Tufts Named Weekend News Anchor at WLNE-TV/ABC6 |url=https://www.abc6.com/liz-tufts-named-weekend-news-anchor-at-wlne-tvabc6/ |website=abc6.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> On September 13, WLNE became the second station in the market to broadcast news in high-definition, behind WJAR and just a week ahead of WPRI/WNAC.<ref name=tvspy-wlnehd>{{cite news|last=Gauthier|first=Andrew|title=WLNE Now Broadcasting News in HD|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/wlne-now-broadcasting-news-in-hd_b23426|accessdate=September 29, 2011|newspaper=TVSpy|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref> Along with the transition came a standardized graphics package used by other Citadel stations.

The segments are presented on-air under the Stormtracker label. From 2012 to 2017, the Stormtracker Weather Team was certified as providing Southern New England's most accurate forecast by  WeatheRate, an independent weather research firm.<ref>[http://www.weatherate.com/</ref> On July 19, 2012, WLNE became the first station in Southern New England to be recognized as [[StormReady]] by the National Weather Service.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC6/WLNE-TV  RECOGNIZED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE|url=http://ww.abc6.com/story/19066733/abc6-recognized-by-the-national-weather-service|accessdate=July 19, 2012|newspaper=abc6.com|date=July 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714202218/http://ww.abc6.com/story/19066733/abc6-recognized-by-the-national-weather-service|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWLNE won the Massachusetts/Rhode Island [[Associated Press]] News Station of the Year award four years in a row from 1997 to 2000 and again in 2002.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]].

The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 92 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporation]]s \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} where [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss | title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ? |publisher=[[IBM]]}}</ref>\n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange]]s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].\n\nA potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the [https://www.smartworking1.in/2020/03/what-is-difference-between-nse-and-bse.html exchange] of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].\n\nThe [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated [[market maker]] (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid\u2013ask spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].\n\nThe [[NASDAQ]] is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system]] was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ubs-goldman-wean-away-trade-from-nyse-nasdaq/articleshow/726712.cms | title=UBS, Goldman wean away trade from NYSE, Nasdaq | work=[[The Economic Times]] | date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> Financial regulators have probed [[dark pool]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s- | title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | first=Sam | last=Mamudi | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0 | title=Financial regulators probe dark pools | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=September 15, 2014 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Market participant==\n[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, [[institutional investor]]s (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares.

Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder.

Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first [[broker]]s. A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 | title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto | publisher=Belgiumview.com}}</ref>  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading.

In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.

(Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by [[randomness]], although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.<ref name=\"Cutler, D. Poterba, J. & Summers, L. 1991 520\u2013546\"/>\n\nA 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot ''systematically'' profit from any momentary '[[market anomaly]]'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending){{dubious|date=November 2019}}, many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).<ref>{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |edition=annot.| publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04357-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | edition = 2nd | publisher = Random House | isbn = 978-1-4000-6793-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/fooledbyrandomne00tale }}</ref>\n\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124\u20131131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}</ref>\n\nAnother phenomenon\u2014also from psychology\u2014that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.\n\nIn one paper the authors draw an analogy with [[gambling]].<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Stephen Morris (game theorist) |first=Stephen |last=Morris |first2=Hyun Song |last2=Shin |title=Risk management with interdependent choice |journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=52\u201362 |year=1999 |doi=10.1093/oxrep/15.3.52 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~smorris/Published/paper_21_Risk_Management.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.381.3080 }}</ref> In normal times the market behaves like a game of [[roulette]]; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\n\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent{{fact|date=November 2019}} of the analysts' recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000\u20132002 [[Bear Market|bear market]], the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market. Research has shown that mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies, and smaller companies have higher returns historically.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Irrational behavior ===\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2006211-why-the-market-doesnt-care-where-you-think-it-should-go|title=Why The Market Doesn't Care Where You Think It Should Go|author=David Fabian|date=February 9, 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected.  Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.<ref>Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).</ref>  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Crashes===\n{{Main|Stock market crash}}\n{{further|List of stock market crashes and bear markets}}\n[[Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|380px|right|thumb|[[Robert Shiller]]'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |edition=2nd|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12335-6 |title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average...

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.\n\nThere have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973\u20134]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\n=== 1929 ===\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. \n\n=== 1987 ===\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\n=== Circuit breakers ===\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012</ref>\n* New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp | title=Market volatility regulations | publisher=[[The Vanguard Group]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! % drop in [[S&P 500 Index]]\n! trading halt\n\n|-\n| 7%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\n|-\n| 13%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.\n|-\n| 20%\n| Trading will stop for the day\n|}\n\n==Stock market index==\n{{Main|Stock market index}}\n\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the [[Standard & Poor's|S&P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\n==Derivative instruments==\n{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\n==Leveraged strategies==\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\n===Short selling===\n{{Main|Short selling}}\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\n===Margin buying===\n{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\n==New issuance==\nFor statistics on equity issuances, see [[Refinitiv league tables]].\n\n==Investment strategies==\n{{Main|Investment strategy|Stock market prediction|Investment management}}\nMany strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, and general economic conditions. [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive [[index fund]]s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&P 500 Index]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. [[Socially responsible investing]] is another investment preference.\n\n==Taxation==\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a [[capital gains tax]]. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Equity crowdfunding]]\n* [[List of stock exchange trading hours]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of stock market indices]]\n* [[Modeling and analysis of financial markets]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Selling climax]]\n* [[Stock market bubble]]\n* [[Stock market cycles]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Hamilton | first = W.

For example, [[Nestl\u00e9]] and [[Novartis]] are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]], so they may be considered as part of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as [[American depository receipt]]s (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.\n\n==Size of the markets==\nThe total [[market capitalization]] of equity backed securities worldwide rose from $2.5 trillion in 1980 to $68.65 trillion at the end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref> As of December 31, 2019, the total [[market capitalization]] of all stocks worldwide was approximately US$70.75 trillion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/cm.mkt.lcap.cd | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|}}, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world.

Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporation]]s \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} where [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss | title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ? |publisher=[[IBM]]}}</ref>\n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange]]s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].\n\nA potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].\n\nThe [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated [[market maker]] (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid\u2013ask spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].\n\nThe [[NASDAQ]] is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system]] was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ubs-goldman-wean-away-trade-from-nyse-nasdaq/articleshow/726712.cms | title=UBS, Goldman wean away trade from NYSE, Nasdaq | work=[[The Economic Times]] | date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> Financial regulators have probed [[dark pool]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s- | title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | first=Sam | last=Mamudi | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0 | title=Financial regulators probe dark pools | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=September 15, 2014 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Market participant==\n[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, [[institutional investor]]s (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares.

Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Government Policy and Ownership of Financial Assets | date=2013-01-01 | first = Kristian | last=Rydqvist | first2=Joshua | last2=Spizman | first3=Ilya A. | last3=Strebulaev | ssrn=1428442}}</ref>\n\n==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====\nRates of participation and the value of holdings differs significantly across strata of income.

Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Determinants and possible explanations of stock market participation====\nIn a 2003 paper by Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing.

Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first [[broker]]s. A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 | title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto | publisher=Belgiumview.com}}</ref>  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading. The idea quickly spread around [[Flanders]] and neighboring countries and \"Beurzen\" soon opened in [[Ghent]] and [[Rotterdam]].\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, [[Venice|Venetian]] bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.  Around this time, a [[joint stock company]]--one whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders--emerged and became important for colonization of what Europeans called the \"New World\".<ref>[Ralph Dahrendorft, Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society (Stanford, CA:  Stanford University Press, 1959)]</ref>\n\n===Birth of formal stock markets===\n{{See also|Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Financial history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch East India Company}}\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]] (VOC).

Within the [[Communist countries]], the spectrum of socialism ranged from the quasi-market, quasi-[[syndicalist]] system of Yugoslavia to the centralized [[totalitarianism]] of neighboring Albania. One time I asked Professor [[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises]], the great expert on the economics of socialism, at what point on this spectrum of statism would he designate a country as \"socialist\" or not. At that time, I wasn't sure that any definite criterion existed to make that sort of clear-cut judgment. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and decisiveness of Mises's answer. \"A stock market,\" he answered promptly. \"A stock market is crucial to the existence of [[capitalism]] and [[private property]]. For it means that there is a functioning market in the exchange of private titles to the [[means of production]]. There can be no genuine private ownership of capital without a stock market: there can be no true socialism if such a market is allowed to exist.\"\n|200px||[[Murray Rothbard]], in \u201cMaking Economic Sense\u201d (2006)<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]]: ''Making Economic Sense'', 2nd edition.

The [[liquidity]] that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as [[property]] and other immoveable assets.\n\nHistory has shown that the price of [[stock]]s and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's economic strength and development.<ref>Mahipal Singh, 2011, {{ISBN|9788182055193}}, April 2011</ref>\n\nRising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, [[central bank]]s tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of [[financial system]] functions. Financial stability is the [[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]] of central banks.<ref>{{Cite web| url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2009/wp0970.pdf | title=Financial Stability Frameworks and the Role of Central Banks: Lessons from the Crisis | first=Erlend Walter | last=Nier | publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]}}</ref>\n\nExchanges also act as the clearinghouse for each transaction, meaning that they collect and deliver the shares, and guarantee payment to the seller of a security.

(Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by [[randomness]], although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.<ref name=\"Cutler, D. Poterba, J. & Summers, L. 1991 520\u2013546\"/>\n\nA 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot ''systematically'' profit from any momentary '[[market anomaly]]'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending){{dubious|date=November 2019}}, many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).<ref>{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |edition=annot.| publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04357-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | edition = 2nd | publisher = Random House | isbn = 978-1-4000-6793-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/fooledbyrandomne00tale }}</ref>\n\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124\u20131131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}</ref>\n\nAnother phenomenon\u2014also from psychology\u2014that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group.

In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\n\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent{{fact|date=November 2019}} of the analysts' recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000\u20132002 [[Bear Market|bear market]], the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market. Research has shown that mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies, and smaller companies have higher returns historically.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Irrational behavior ===\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2006211-why-the-market-doesnt-care-where-you-think-it-should-go|title=Why The Market Doesn't Care Where You Think It Should Go|author=David Fabian|date=February 9, 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected.  Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.<ref>Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).</ref>  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Crashes===\n{{Main|Stock market crash}}\n{{further|List of stock market crashes and bear markets}}\n[[Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|380px|right|thumb|[[Robert Shiller]]'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |edition=2nd|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12335-6 |title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average...

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.\n\nThere have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973\u20134]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\n=== 1929 ===\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. \n\n=== 1987 ===\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\n=== Circuit breakers ===\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012</ref>\n* New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp | title=Market volatility regulations | publisher=[[The Vanguard Group]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! % drop in [[S&P 500 Index]]\n! trading halt\n\n|-\n| 7%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\n|-\n| 13%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.\n|-\n| 20%\n| Trading will stop for the day\n|}\n\n==Stock market index==\n{{Main|Stock market index}}\n\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the [[Standard & Poor's|S&P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\n==Derivative instruments==\n{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\n==Leveraged strategies==\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\n===Short selling===\n{{Main|Short selling}}\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\n===Margin buying===\n{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\n==New issuance==\nFor statistics on equity issuances, see [[Refinitiv league tables]].\n\n==Investment strategies==\n{{Main|Investment strategy|Stock market prediction|Investment management}}\nMany strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, and general economic conditions. [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive [[index fund]]s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&P 500 Index]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. [[Socially responsible investing]] is another investment preference.\n\n==Taxation==\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a [[capital gains tax]]. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Equity crowdfunding]]\n* [[List of stock exchange trading hours]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of stock market indices]]\n* [[Modeling and analysis of financial markets]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Selling climax]]\n* [[Stock market bubble]]\n* [[Stock market cycles]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Hamilton | first = W.

{"title_page": "Christophe Rousset", "text_new": "{{BLP sources|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Christophe Rousset.jpg|thumb|Rousset in 2012.]]\n'''Christophe Rousset''' ({{IPA-fr|\u0281us\u025b|lang}}; born 12 April 1961) is an internationally renowned [[France|French]] [[harpsichordist]] and [[conducting|conductor]], specializing in the performance of [[Baroque music]] on [[Authentic performance|period instruments]].<ref>[http://odb-opera.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=165 Interview (French) on Odb-opera.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216084607/http://odb-opera.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=165 |date=2012-02-16 }}</ref> He is also a [[musicologist]], with a passion for opera and European music of the 17th and 18th centuries, and is the founder of the French music ensemble [[Les Talens Lyriques]].\n\n==Biography==\nRousset studied harpsichord at La [[Schola Cantorum de Paris]] with [[Huguette Dreyfus]], and subsequently at the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague]] with [[Bob van Asperen]] winning the prestigious First Prize in the 7th Bruges Harpsichord Competition at the age of 22. This was followed by the creation of his own ensemble, [[Les Talens Lyriques]], in 1991. At the heart of the ensemble is Rousset's research and expertise across the music of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and early [[Romantic period (music)|Romantic]] periods.\n\nHaving initially attracted the notice of the international press and record companies with his extraordinary talent as a harpsichordist, he soon went on to make his mark as a young and gifted conductor, earning invitations to perform with his ensemble at venues throughout the world, including among them [[Paris Opera]], De Nederlandse Opera, [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], [[Salle Pleyel]], Op\u00e9ra de Lausanne, [[Teatro Real]], [[Theater an der Wien]], Op\u00e9ra Royal de Versailles, [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie]], [[Barbican Centre]], [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Concertgebouw]] Amsterdam, the [[Aix-en-Provence Festival|Aix-en-Provence]] and [[Festival de Beaune|Beaune]] festivals.\n\nAlongside this, he has continued to pursue an active career as harpsichordist and chamber musician, performing and recording on the most beautiful period instruments. His complete performances of the works for harpsichord by [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Jean-Henri d'Anglebert|d\u2019Anglebert]] and [[Antoine Forqueray|Forqueray]] and various recordings of pieces by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (Partitas, [[Goldberg Variations]], Concertos for harpsichord, [[English Suites]], [[French Suites]] and the [[Klavierb\u00fcchlein]]), are considered to be landmark references. His most recent album, devoted to a musical monument by the German Cantor, Book II of the Well-Tempered Clavier (on [[Apart\u00e9]])\u2014recorded at the Ch\u00e2teau of Versailles on a harpsichord by [[Joannes Ruckers]] (1628)\u2014has won numerous awards, including a \"Choc\" from Classica magazine and \"CD of the Week\" from BBC Radio 3. In addition, instruments from the collection of the [[Cit\u00e9 de la Musique|Museum of Music]] in Paris, have been entrusted to him for the recording of three records devoted to Royer, Rameau and Froberger.\n\nTeaching is also of major importance for Christophe Rousset, who conducts and organises master classes and academies for young people (Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, CNSMD Paris, Acad\u00e9mie d\u2019Ambronay, Orchestre Fran\u00e7ais des Jeunes Baroques, Jeune Orchestre Atlantique, Junge Deutsche Philharmonie, the [[Britten-Pears Orchestra]]) and he devotes himself with great energy, alongside the musicians of Les Talens Lyriques, to introducing young secondary school pupils in Paris to music.\n\nRousset also has enjoyed a career as guest conductor with [[Liceu]] Barcelona, [[Teatro San Carlo]] Naples, Teatro alla [[La Scala|Scala]], [[Op\u00e9ra Royal de Wallonie|Royal Opera of Wallonia]], [[Orquesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]], [[Royal Opera House|London\u2019s Royal Opera House]], [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|Orchestra of the age of Enlightenment]] among other orchestras, and has actively pursued musical research, producing critical editions and the publication in 2007, by Actes Sud, of a study on Rameau.\n\nChristophe Rousset has been awarded the French honours of Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]], Commandeur in the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] and Chevalier in the [[National Order of Merit (France)|Ordre national du M\u00e9rite]].\n\n==Recordings==\n\n===As a harpsichordist===\n* [[Johann Sebastian Bach]],

for opera and European music of the 17th and 18th centuries, and is the founder of the French music ensemble [[Les Talens Lyriques]].\n\n==Biography==\nRousset studied harpsichord at La [[Schola Cantorum de Paris]] with [[Huguette Dreyfus]], and subsequently at the [[Royal Conservatory of The Hague]] with [[Bob van Asperen]] winning the prestigious First Prize in the 7th Bruges Harpsichord Competition at the age of 22. This was followed by the creation of his own ensemble, [[Les Talens Lyriques]], in 1991. At the heart of the ensemble is Rousset's research and expertise across the music of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and early [[Romantic period (music)|Romantic]] periods.\n\nHaving initially attracted the notice of the international press and record companies with his extraordinary talent as a harpsichordist, he soon went on to make his mark as a young and gifted conductor, earning invitations to perform with his ensemble at venues throughout the world, including among them [[Paris Opera]], De Nederlandse Opera, [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]], [[Salle Pleyel]], Op\u00e9ra de Lausanne, [[Teatro Real]], [[Theater an der Wien]], Op\u00e9ra Royal de Versailles, [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie]], [[Barbican Centre]], [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Concertgebouw]] Amsterdam, the [[Aix-en-Provence Festival|Aix-en-Provence]] and [[Festival de Beaune|Beaune]] festivals.\n\nAlongside this, he has continued to pursue an active career as harpsichordist and chamber musician, performing and recording on the most beautiful period instruments. His complete performances of the works for harpsichord by [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Jean-Henri d'Anglebert|d\u2019Anglebert]] and [[Antoine Forqueray|Forqueray]] and various recordings of pieces by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (Partitas, [[Goldberg Variations]], Concertos for harpsichord, [[English Suites]], [[French Suites]] and the [[Klavierb\u00fcchlein]]), are considered to be landmark references. His most recent album, devoted to a musical monument by the German Cantor, Book II of the Well-Tempered Clavier (on [[Apart\u00e9]])\u2014recorded at the Ch\u00e2teau of Versailles on a harpsichord by [[Joannes Ruckers]] (1628)\u2014has won numerous awards, including a \"Choc\" from Classica magazine and \"CD of the Week\" from BBC Radio 3. In addition, instruments from the collection of the [[Cit\u00e9 de la Musique|Museum of Music]] in Paris, have been entrusted to him for the recording of three records devoted to Royer, Rameau and Froberger.\n\nTeaching is also of major importance for Christophe Rousset, who conducts and organises master classes and academies for young people (Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena, CNSMD Paris, Acad\u00e9mie d\u2019Ambronay, Orchestre Fran\u00e7ais des Jeunes Baroques, Jeune Orchestre Atlantique, Junge Deutsche Philharmonie, the [[Britten-Pears Orchestra]]) and he devotes himself with great energy, alongside the musicians of Les Talens Lyriques, to introducing young secondary school pupils in Paris to music.\n\nRousset also has enjoyed a career as guest conductor with [[Liceu]] Barcelona, [[Teatro San Carlo]] Naples, Teatro alla [[La Scala|Scala]], [[Op\u00e9ra Royal de Wallonie|Royal Opera of Wallonia]], [[Orquesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]], [[Royal Opera House|London\u2019s Royal Opera House]], [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment|Orchestra of the age of Enlightenment]] among other orchestras, and has actively pursued musical research, producing critical editions and the publication in 2007, by Actes Sud, of a study on Rameau.\n\nChristophe Rousset has been awarded the French honours of Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]], Commandeur in the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] and Chevalier in the [[National Order of Merit (France)|Ordre national du M\u00e9rite]].\n\n==Recordings==\n\n===As a harpsichordist===\n* [[Johann Sebastian Bach]],

The early training allowed Aicelle to indulge in her original dream to become a famous pianist. However, a shift in focus took place as she realized she would rather be a famous singer than be a known pianist. Aicelle's inspiration on the field came from [[Walt Disney]]'s character [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from the movie ''[[The Little Mermaid]]''. The movie's theme song \"Part of Your World\" was the first song Aicelle memorized, which she also performed during her elementary school programs.\n\nWhile still at her first year of college at the [[Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila]], Aicelle joined [[ABS-CBN]]'s Season 1 of ''[[Star in a Million]]'' (2003), her first take on a nationwide televised singing competition.

Although she sometimes struggled, she eventually struck a balance between attending university and focusing on her blossoming singing career.\n\nAicelle took advantage of the minor fame that her [[Star in a Million]] appearance gave her and showcased her talents on top performers' settings with a new acoustic group Dream Sequence.

However, he had a good relationship with his younger sister and held a boundless adoration of his mother, who died of cancer when he was 23 years old.\n\nAt the age of 20, he suddenly picked up a passion for cycling. Eight years later, he left home to travel erratically around France on foot, by hitchhiking, cycling, and via train (often without a ticket), staying in [[Emmaus (charity)|Emma\u00fcs]] shelters, psychiatric institutions, and detoxification centers. He occasionally found odd jobs as a mason or metal worker, and spent his meager earnings on drinking, sometimes mixing alcohol and tranquilizers. \n\nAs someone with untreated [[Klinefelter's syndrome]], Heaulme was at the time incapable of committing rape in the \"standard\" manner. However, in at least two instances he was accompanied by other men (one a distant cousin), who violated the victims themselves while Heaulme killed them. He confessed the murders to medical personnel who did not reveal the information because of medical confidentiality. In many police stations, he did in fact recount false assaults.\n\nHe was arrested on January 7, 1992 at [[Bischwiller]]. The law enforcement agencies (police and gendarmerie) had great difficulty proving their cases because the acts were done without apparent reason or motive by a person who was highly mobile, and had alibis due to negligence. The shortcomings and poor coordination of the police organizations were also contributing factors.\n\nDespite the lack of support from his superiors, gendarme Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Abgrall quickly understood the basic rule about who he is responsible for tracking down: \"It's when you ask him nothing that he says the most.\"\n\nFrancis Heaulme recounted murder scenes with incredible precision. For example, he showed officers how to kill a sentry by having a firm grip on the back of his head with one hand and stabbing him in the carotid artery with the other, draw, and then retract. According to Abgrall, \"He doesn't lie. He never makes anything up. But he deliberately covers his tracks by mixing the crimes, dates and locations.\"\n\n==Cases==\n\nThe cases in which he is suspected, accused or convicted are many. There are reportedly dozens in 87 departments in France. Among them:\n\n* The murder of 8-year-old Jorris Viville in [[Grimaud, Var|Port-Grimaud]]. There is no doubt that Heaulme had an accomplice as the body had been moved more than 20 kilometres by car and he did not drive. When confronted with five possible suspects at the trial, he successively indicated each as his accomplice, before declaring he didn't want to be a \"scapegoat.\" He alone was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\n* The murder of 44-year-old Aline Peres in [[Brest, France|Brest]], for which he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The crime occurred on a public beach in broad daylight, surrounded by people who saw nothing.  This murder put gendarme Abgrall, then assigned to the [[Research and Intervention Brigade]] in [[Rennes]], on his trail. It was this murder for which he was arrested four years later in [[Bischwiller]].\n* The murder of a retired legionnaire from [[Courth\u00e9zon]], in [[Vaucluse]], for which he received an acquittal. Although Heaulme had confessed to Abgrall, his presence at the crime scene was never proven. Moreover, his confession seemed completely fanciful, in the light of findings made by the police on the crime scene.\n* The murder of Laurence Guillaume, a 14-year-old girl, around [[Metz]], for which he was sentenced to life in prison. For this murder, Heaulme was accompanied by the cousin of the victim, whom he had met less than an hour earlier at the fair in Metz. His accomplice was convicted of rape and complicity in the murder and sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n* The murder of Laurent Bureau, a young military conscript, for which he was acquitted by the [[Assize Court]] of [[Dordogne]]. During the murder, Heaulme was accompanied by Didier Gentil, who at the time of the trial was already sentenced to life in prison for the rape and murder of a young girl named Celine in [[La Motte-du-Caire]] in 1989. The court, unable to determine which of the two murderers had actually killed Laurent Bureau, acquitted them both.\n* The Sept. 29, 1986, murder of two children, Cyril Beining and Alexander Beckrich, found dead along the railroad tracks in [[Montigny-l\u00e8s-Metz]]. A man named [[Patrick Dils]] was convicted of the crime, and served 15 years in prison before being exonerated in 2002.\n\n==Convictions==\n\n* In May 1997, for several murders, the Assises Court of Var sentenced him to life in prison with no chance of parole for 22 years.\n* On 16 December 2004, he was sentenced to an additional thirty years in prison with no chance of parole for 20 years for three murders committed in the region of the Marne in 1988 and 1989.\n\n* On 17th May 2017, Heaulme was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two boys, Cyril Beining and Alexandre Beckrich. Upon conviction, his lawyer submitted an appeal.\n\n==Personality==\n\nChief Warrant Officer Gendarmerie, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Abgrall, the Research Section of the gendarmerie in Rennes, is the specialist for cases in which Francis Heaulme was convicted, accused or suspect. He arrested Heaulme on January 7, 1992 at Bischwiller in Alsace.\n\nBehind the face of a madman hides a manipulative and calculating mind. His morbid game consists of releasing bits of information to police to make it clear that he had \"hit a snag\" ({{lang-fr|[[:wikt:p\u00e9pin#French|p\u00e9pin]]}}), a term he uses to describe his murders.  This occurred in each new case, and is evident throughout the course of his dialogs.\n\nAccording to one of his successive string of lawyers, Gonzalez de Pierre Gaspard, Heaulme is not to be confronted with an authority, whether a policeman, a police officer or a judge, because he feels like they can make him say whatever they want.\n\n==Media coverage==\n\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Abgrall wrote ''Inside the Mind of a Killer,'' published by Profile Books Ltd, in which he recounts, step-by-step, his investigation of Heaulme, the so-called \"Criminal Backpacker\".\n* The television channel TF1 introduced in March 2005 a television drama with Thierry Fr\u00e9mont in the role of Heaulme and Bernard Giraudeau in the role of policeman Abgrall.\n* The channel aired a 90-minute documentary titled \"The Bloody Road - On the Trail of Francis Heaulme\", on November 13, 2005.  The documentary was produced by Doc en Stock, and directed by Laurent Guerin and Franck Doors, and retraced his route step by step.\n* A 70-minute [[BBC Storyville documentary]] in which Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Abgrall recounted his investigation of Heaulme, titled \"Dance with a Serial Killer\", was aired on BBC One, 24 February 2008.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080402033434/http://www.tueursenserie.org/article.php?id_article=10 Biography of Francis Heaulme] (On a serial-killers specialised website)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heaulme, Francis}}\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French serial killers]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by France]]\n[[Category:French people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by France]]\n[[Category:French prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment]]\n[[Category:People from Metz]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=September 2018}}\n{{Infobox serial killer\n|name=Francis Heaulme\n|image=\n|caption=\n|birthname=Francis Heaulme\n|alias=The Criminal Backpacker\n|birth_date={{Birth date and age|1959|2|25|df=y}}\n|birth_place=[[Metz]], [[France]]\n|death_date=\n|death_place= \n|cause=\n|conviction=[[Murder]]\n|sentence=[[Life Imprisonment]]\n|victims=9+\n|beginyear=\n|endyear=\n|country=\n|states=\n|apprehended=\n}}\n\n'''Francis Heaulme''' (born February 25, 1959 at [[Metz]]) is a [[French people|French]] [[serial killer]] dubbed the \"Criminal Backpacker\".\n\n==Biography==\n\nHeaulme's father brutalized him until the age of 17 causing him to become an alcoholic and attempting suicide.

A man named [[Patrick Dils]] was convicted of the crime, and served 15 years in prison before being exonerated in 2002.\n\n==Convictions==\n\n* In May 1997, for several murders, the Assises Court of Var sentenced him to life in prison with no chance of parole for 22 years.\n* On 16 December 2004, he was sentenced to an additional thirty years in prison with no chance of parole for 20 years for three murders committed in the region of the Marne in 1988 and 1989.\n\n* On 17th May 2017, Heaulme was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of two boys, Cyril Beining and Alexandre Beckrich. Upon conviction, his lawyer submitted an appeal.\n\n==Personality==\n\nChief Warrant Officer Gendarmerie, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Abgrall, the Research Section of the gendarmerie in Rennes, is the specialist for cases in which Francis Heaulme was convicted, accused or suspect. He arrested Heaulme on January 7, 1992 at Bischwiller in Alsace.\n\nBehind the face of a madman hides a manipulative and calculating mind. His morbid game consists of releasing bits of information to police to make it clear that he had \"hit a snag\" ({{lang-fr|[[:wikt:p\u00e9pin#French|p\u00e9pin]]}}), a term he uses to describe his murders.  This occurred in each new case, and is evident throughout the course of his dialogs.\n\nAccording to one of his successive string of lawyers, Gonzalez de Pierre Gaspard, Heaulme is not to be confronted with an authority, whether a policeman, a police officer or a judge, because he feels like they can make him say whatever they want.\n\n==Media coverage==\n\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Abgrall wrote ''Inside the Mind of a Killer,'' published by Profile Books Ltd, in which he recounts, step-by-step, his investigation of Heaulme, the so-called \"Criminal Backpacker\".\n* The television channel TF1 introduced in March 2005 a television drama with Thierry Fr\u00e9mont in the role of Heaulme and Bernard Giraudeau in the role of policeman Abgrall.\n* The channel aired a 90-minute documentary titled \"The Bloody Road - On the Trail of Francis Heaulme\", on November 13, 2005.  The documentary was produced by Doc en Stock, and directed by Laurent Guerin and Franck Doors, and retraced his route step by step.\n* A 70-minute [[BBC Storyville documentary]] in which Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Abgrall recounted his investigation of Heaulme, titled \"Dance with a Serial Killer\", was aired on BBC One, 24 February 2008.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080402033434/http://www.tueursenserie.org/article.php?id_article=10 Biography of Francis Heaulme] (On a serial-killers specialised website)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Heaulme, Francis}}\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French serial killers]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by France]]\n[[Category:French people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by France]]\n[[Category:French prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment]]\n", "name_user": "ExRat", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Heaulme"}
