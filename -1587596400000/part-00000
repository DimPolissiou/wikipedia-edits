Hawkins's playing changed significantly during [[Louis Armstrong]]'s tenure with the Henderson Orchestra (1924\u201325). In the late 1920s, Hawkins also participated in some of the earliest interracial recording sessions with the [[Mound City Blue Blowers]]. During his time with Henderson he became a star soloist with increasing prominence on records. While with the band, he and [[Red Allen|Henry \"Red\" Allen]] recorded a series of small group sides for [[American Record Corporation|ARC]] (on their [[Perfect Records|Perfect]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], and [[Oriole Records (U.S.)|Oriole]] labels). Hawkins also recorded a number of solo recordings with either piano or a pick-up band of Henderson's musicians in 1933\u201334, just prior to his period in Europe. He was also featured on a [[Benny Goodman]] session on February 2, 1934 for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], which also featured [[Mildred Bailey]] as guest vocalist.\n\nIn late 1934, Hawkins accepted an invitation to play with [[Jack Hylton]]'s orchestra in London, and toured Europe as a soloist until 1939, performing and recording with [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[Benny Carter]] in Paris in 1937.<ref name=\"hl\">{{cite book|last=Lyttelton|first=Humphrey|authorlink=Humphrey Lyttelton|title=The Best of Jazz|publisher=Robson Books|year=1998|isbn=1-86105-187-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bestofjazz0000lytt/page/256 256\u2013287]|url=https://archive.org/details/bestofjazz0000lytt/page/256}}</ref> During Hawkins' time touring Europe between 1934 and 1939 attention in the U.S. shifted to other tenor saxophonists, including [[Lester Young]], [[Ben Webster]], and [[Chu Berry]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chilton|first1=John|title=The Song of the Hawk:The Life and Recordings of Coleman Hawkins|date=1990|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=University of Michigan}}</ref>  Following his return to the United States, he quickly re-established himself as one of the leading lights on tenor by adding innovations to his earlier style.  On October 11, 1939, he recorded a two-chorus performance of the pop standard \"[[Body and Soul (song)|Body and Soul]]\", which he had been performing at [[Bert Kelly (jazz musician)|Bert Kelly's]] New York venue, [[Kelly's Stables (New York)|Kelly's Stables]]. In a landmark recording of the swing era, captured as an afterthought at the session, Hawkins ignores almost all of the melody, with only the first four bars stated in a recognizable fashion.  Hawkins' departure from the melodic themes of the tune, use of upper chord intervals, and implied passing chords in that recording have been described as \"one of the early tremors of bebop.\"<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|author=Tom Moon |url=https://www.npr.org/2000/03/06/1071243/body-and-soul |title='Body And Soul' |website=Npr.org |date=2000-03-06 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}</ref>\n\n===The 1940s and 1950s===\n[[File:Coleman Hawkins (Gottlieb 03991).jpg|thumb|Coleman Hawkins, c.

That general period saw him recording with such diverse stylists as [[Sid Catlett]], [[Tyree Glenn]], [[Hilton Jefferson]] (a Fletcher Henderson bandmate), [[Hank Jones]], [[Billy Taylor]], [[J. J. Johnson]] and [[Fats Navarro]]. He also toured with [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] (JATP).  He maintained his [[Polystylism|eclectic]] approach to his music through much of his later career.\n\nAfter 1948, Hawkins divided his time between New York and Europe, making numerous freelance recordings. In 1948 Hawkins recorded \"Picasso\", an early piece for unaccompanied saxophone.  He remained commercially successful with \"[[Mainstream jazz|mainstream]]\" recordings, sometimes with strings, and the JATP tour during the early 1950s, and appeared to be losing interest in the more dynamic and challenging styles with which he had recently been associated.\n\nIn the 1950s, Hawkins performed with more traditional musicians such as Red Allen and [[Roy Eldridge]], with whom he appeared at the 1957 [[Newport Jazz Festival]] and recorded ''[[Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster]]'' with fellow tenor saxophonist [[Ben Webster]] along with [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Herb Ellis]], [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], and [[Alvin Stoller]]. His 1957 album ''[[The Hawk Flies High]]'', with [[Idrees Sulieman]], J. J. Johnson, Hank Jones, [[Barry Galbraith]], Oscar Pettiford, and [[Jo Jones]] shows his interest in modern jazz styles during a period better known for his playing with more traditional musicians.\n\nHawkins' interest in more modern styles manifested in a reunion with Monk, with whom he had remained close even though they hadn't played together for over a decade. Monk led a June 1957 session featuring Hawkins and [[John Coltrane]] that would yield the classic ''[[Monk's Music]]'' album issued later that summer.<ref>Kelley, Robin D.G. ''Thelonious Monk The Life and Times of an American Original.'' New York: Free Press, 2009, pps. 222-223.</ref> Outtakes from this session would comprise half the tracks on ''[[Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane]]'', released on the Jazzland Records subsidiary of [[Riverside Records]] in 1961.\n\n===1960\u20131969===\nIn the 1960s, Hawkins appeared regularly at the [[Village Vanguard]] in [[Manhattan]]. In 1960 he recorded on Max Roach's ''[[We Insist!]]'' suite, a key jazz document which anticipated the political and social linkages that would develop between jazz and the [[civil rights movement]] during the coming decade. At the behest of [[Impulse Records]] producer [[Bob Thiele]], Hawkins availed himself of a long-desired opportunity to record with [[Duke Ellington]] for the 1962 album ''[[Duke Ellington Meets Coleman Hawkins]]'' alongside Ellington band stalwarts [[Johnny Hodges]], [[Lawrence Brown (jazz trombonist)|Lawrence Brown]], [[Ray Nance]], and [[Harry Carney]] as well as the Duke. Sessions for Impulse with his performing quartet yielded ''[[Today and Now]]'', also in 1962 and judged one of his better latter-day efforts by ''[[The Penguin Guide to Jazz|The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings]]''.<ref>Cook, Richard, and Morton, Brian. ''The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings, Ninth Edition.'' London: Penguin Books, 2008, p. 670.</ref> Hawkins recorded in 1963 alongside [[Sonny Rollins]] for their collaborative album ''[[Sonny Meets Hawk!]]''\n\nIt was shortly after this busy period that Hawkins fell into the grip of depression and heavy drinking and his recording output began to wane. His last recording was in 1967; Hawkins died of liver disease on May 19, 1969, at Wickersham Hospital, in Manhattan. He was survived by his widow, Dolores, and by three children: a son, Rene, and two daughters, Colette and Mimi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1121.html|title=Coleman Hawkins, Tenor Saxophonist, Is Dead|website=Archive.nytimes.com|accessdate=March 11, 2019}}</ref> Hawkins is interred in the Yew Plot at the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City.<ref name=ALLMUSIC />\n\n''The Song of the Hawk'', a 1990 biography written by British jazz historian [[John Chilton]], chronicles Hawkins's career.

Retrieved May 15, 2013.</ref> Hawkins joined [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s Orchestra, where he remained until 1934, sometimes doubling on [[clarinet]] and [[bass saxophone]]. Hawkins's playing changed significantly during [[Louis Armstrong]]'s tenure with the Henderson Orchestra (1924\u201325). In the late 1920s, Hawkins also participated in some of the earliest interracial recording sessions with the [[Mound City Blue Blowers]]. During his time with Henderson he became a star soloist with increasing prominence on records. While with the band, he and [[Red Allen|Henry \"Red\" Allen]] recorded a series of small group sides for [[American Record Corporation|ARC]] (on their [[Perfect Records|Perfect]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], and [[Oriole Records (U.S.)|Oriole]] labels). Hawkins also recorded a number of solo recordings with either piano or a pick-up band of Henderson's musicians in 1933\u201334, just prior to his period in Europe. He was also featured on a [[Benny Goodman]] session on February 2, 1934 for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], which also featured [[Mildred Bailey]] as guest vocalist.\n\nIn late 1934, Hawkins accepted an invitation to play with [[Jack Hylton]]'s orchestra in London, and toured Europe as a soloist until 1939, performing and recording with [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[Benny Carter]] in Paris in 1937.<ref name=\"hl\">{{cite book|last=Lyttelton|first=Humphrey|authorlink=Humphrey Lyttelton|title=The Best of Jazz|publisher=Robson Books|year=1998|isbn=1-86105-187-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bestofjazz0000lytt/page/256 256\u2013287]|url=https://archive.org/details/bestofjazz0000lytt/page/256}}</ref> During Hawkins' time touring Europe between 1934 and 1939 attention in the U.S. shifted to other tenor saxophonists, including [[Lester Young]], [[Ben Webster]], and [[Chu Berry]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chilton|first1=John|title=The Song of the Hawk:The Life and Recordings of Coleman Hawkins|date=1990|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|location=University of Michigan}}</ref>  Following his return to the United States, he quickly re-established himself as one of the leading lights on tenor by adding innovations to his earlier style.  On October 11, 1939, he recorded a two-chorus performance of the pop standard \"[[Body and Soul (song)|Body and Soul]]\", which he had been performing at [[Bert Kelly (jazz musician)|Bert Kelly's]] New York venue, [[Kelly's Stables (New York)|Kelly's Stables]]. In a landmark recording of the swing era, captured as an afterthought at the session, Hawkins ignores almost all of the melody, with only the first four bars stated in a recognizable fashion.  Hawkins' departure from the melodic themes of the tune, use of upper chord intervals, and implied passing chords in that recording have been described as \"one of the early tremors of bebop.\"<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|author=Tom Moon |url=https://www.npr.org/2000/03/06/1071243/body-and-soul |title='Body And Soul' |website=Npr.org |date=2000-03-06 |accessdate=2016-07-26}}</ref>\n\n===The 1940s and 1950s===\n[[File:Coleman Hawkins (Gottlieb 03991).jpg|thumb|Coleman Hawkins, c.

That general period saw him recording with such diverse stylists as [[Sid Catlett]], [[Tyree Glenn]], [[Hilton Jefferson]] (a Fletcher Henderson bandmate), [[Hank Jones]], [[Billy Taylor]], [[J. J. Johnson]] and [[Fats Navarro]]. He also toured with [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] (JATP).  He maintained his [[Polystylism|eclectic]] approach to his music through much of his later career.\n\nAfter 1948, Hawkins divided his time between New York and Europe, making numerous freelance recordings. In 1948 Hawkins recorded \"Picasso\", an early piece for unaccompanied saxophone.  He remained commercially successful with \"[[Mainstream jazz|mainstream]]\" recordings, sometimes with strings, and the JATP tour during the early 1950s, and appeared to be losing interest in the more dynamic and challenging styles with which he had recently been associated.\n\nIn the 1950s, Hawkins performed with more traditional musicians such as Red Allen and [[Roy Eldridge]], with whom he appeared at the 1957 [[Newport Jazz Festival]] and recorded ''[[Coleman Hawkins Encounters Ben Webster]]'' with fellow tenor saxophonist [[Ben Webster]] along with [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Herb Ellis]], [[Ray Brown (musician)|Ray Brown]], and [[Alvin Stoller]]. His 1957 album ''[[The Hawk Flies High]]'', with [[Idrees Sulieman]], J. J. Johnson, Hank Jones, [[Barry Galbraith]], Oscar Pettiford, and [[Jo Jones]] shows his interest in modern jazz styles during a period better known for his playing with more traditional musicians.\n\nHawkins' interest in more modern styles manifested in a reunion with Monk, with whom he had remained close even though they hadn't played together for over a decade. Monk led a June 1957 session featuring Hawkins and [[John Coltrane]] that would yield the classic ''[[Monk's Music]]'' album issued later that summer.<ref>Kelley, Robin D.G. ''Thelonious Monk The Life and Times of an American Original.'' New York: Free Press, 2009, pps. 222-223.</ref> Outtakes from this session would comprise half the tracks on ''[[Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane]]'', released on the Jazzland Records subsidiary of [[Riverside Records]] in 1961.\n\n===1960\u20131969===\nIn the 1960s, Hawkins appeared regularly at the [[Village Vanguard]] in [[Manhattan]]. In 1960 he recorded on Max Roach's ''[[We Insist!]]'' suite, a key jazz document which anticipated the political and social linkages that would develop between jazz and the [[civil rights movement]] during the coming decade. At the behest of [[Impulse Records]] producer [[Bob Thiele]], Hawkins availed himself of a long-desired opportunity to record with [[Duke Ellington]] for the 1962 album ''[[Duke Ellington Meets Coleman Hawkins]]'' alongside Ellington band stalwarts [[Johnny Hodges]], [[Lawrence Brown (jazz trombonist)|Lawrence Brown]], [[Ray Nance]], and [[Harry Carney]] as well as the Duke. Sessions for Impulse with his performing quartet yielded ''[[Today and Now]]'', also in 1962 and judged one of his better latter-day efforts by ''[[The Penguin Guide to Jazz|The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings]]''.<ref>Cook, Richard, and Morton, Brian. ''The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings, Ninth Edition.'' London: Penguin Books, 2008, p. 670.</ref> Hawkins recorded in 1963 alongside [[Sonny Rollins]] for their collaborative album ''[[Sonny Meets Hawk!]]''\n\nIt was shortly after this busy period that Hawkins fell into the grip of depression and heavy drinking and his recording output began to wane. His last recording was in 1967; Hawkins died of liver disease on May 19, 1969, at Wickersham Hospital, in Manhattan. He was survived by his widow, Dolores, and by three children: a son, Rene, and two daughters, Colette and Mimi.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1121.html|title=Coleman Hawkins, Tenor Saxophonist, Is Dead|website=Archive.nytimes.com|accessdate=March 11, 2019}}</ref> Hawkins is interred in the Yew Plot at the [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[The Bronx]], New York City.<ref name=ALLMUSIC />\n\n''The Song of the Hawk'', a 1990 biography written by British jazz historian [[John Chilton]], chronicles Hawkins's career.

The Cimmerian villagers, including young Conan's family, bear the Aquilonian yoke resentfully but stoically. Conan himself, a boy of twelve, is kept down as much by his overbearing blacksmith father as the invaders. Conflict builds as Count Stercus, the occupiers' lecherous commander, seizes the weaver's daughter Tarla, whom Conan also admires. Both she and his parents perish during the tensions. Eventually he joins the force of northern Cimmerians gathering to drive out the Aquilonians, participating in the sack of Venarium and the warriors' subsequent vengeful drive south into Aquilonia. Unusually for a Conan story, the supernatural is relatively absent, confined largely to appearances of a demonic bird and an enormous serpent, and a seer's foretelling of Conan's destiny, which in the manner common to such prophecies, the youth misinterprets.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Roland J.
