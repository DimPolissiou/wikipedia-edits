These are polynomials <math>\\Phi_n</math> defined as<blockquote><math>\\Phi_n(x) = \\prod_{\n\\begin{matrix}\n1 \\leq k \\leq n \\\\\n\\gcd(k,n) = 1\n\\end{matrix}\n} \\left( x - e^{2ik\\pi /n} \\right)</math></blockquote>whose degree is <math>\\phi(n)</math>, [[Euler's totient function]] at <math>n</math>.

Since the degree of the field is equal to the degree of the polynomial, these automorphisms generate the Galois group<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dummit|first=|title=Abstract Algebra|last2=Foote|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=596, 14.5 Cyclotomic Extensions}}</ref>. If <math>n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}</math>, then<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \n\\prod_{a_i}\n\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{p_i^{a_i}})/\\mathbb{Q})  </math></blockquote>If <math>n </math> is a prime <math>p </math>, then a corollary of this is <blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/(p-1) </math></blockquote>In fact, any finite Abelian group can be found as the Galois group of some subfield of a cyclotomic field extension by the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]].\n\n==== Finite Fields ====\nAnother useful class of examples of Galois groups with finite abelian groups comes from finite fields. If {{math|''q''}} is a prime power, and if {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''GF'''(''q'')}} and {{math|''E'' {{=}} '''GF'''(''q''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} denote the [[Finite field|Galois fields]] of order {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}} respectively, then <math>\\text{Gal}(E/F)</math> is cyclic of order {{math|''n''}} and generated by the [[Frobenius homomorphism]].\n\n==== Degree 4 examples ====\nOne example of a degree <math>4</math> field extension is the field extension <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}</math><ref>Since <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}\\oplus \\mathbb{Q}\\cdot\\sqrt{2} \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}\\cdot\\sqrt{3} \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}\\cdot \\sqrt{6}</math> as a <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> vector space.</ref>. This has two automorphisms <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> where <math>\\sigma</math> maps <math>\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}</math> and <math>\\tau</math> maps <math>\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}</math>. Since these two generators define a group of order <math>4</math>, the [[Klein four-group]], they determine the entire Galois group structure<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nAnother example is given from the splitting field <math>E/\\mathbb{Q}</math> of the polynomial<blockquote><math>f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1</math></blockquote>Note because <math>f(x)\\cdot(x-1) = x^5 - 1</math>, the roots of <math>f(x)</math> are <math>e^{2k\\pi i / 5}</math>. There are automorphisms <math>\\sigma_l</math> sending <math>e^{2\\pi i / 5}</math> to  <math>(e^{2\\pi i/5})^l</math>, generating a group of order <math>4</math>. Since <math>\\sigma_1</math> generates this group, the Galois group is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}/4</math>.\n\n=== Finite Non-Abelian groups ===\nConsider now {{math|''L'' {{=}} '''Q'''({{radic|2|3}}, ''\u03c9'')}}, where {{math|''\u03c9''}} is a [[root of unity|primitive cube root of unity]]. The group {{math|Gal(L/'''Q''')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}}, the [[dihedral group of order 6]], and {{math|''L''}} is in fact the splitting field of {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 2}} over {{math|'''Q'''}}.\n\n==== Quaternion Group ====\nThe [[Quaternion group]] can be found as the Galois group of a field extension of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>. For example, the field extension<blockquote><math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{\n    (2+\\sqrt{2})\n    (3+\\sqrt{3})\n})</math><ref>{{Cite book|last=Milne|first=|title=Field Theory|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=46}}</ref></blockquote>has the prescribed Galois group.\n\n==== Symmetric group of prime order ====\nIf <math>f</math> is an [[irreducible polynomial]] of prime degree {{math|''p''}} with rational coefficients and exactly two non-real roots, then the Galois group of <math>f</math> is the full [[symmetric group]] <math>S_p</math><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Lang|first=Serge|title=Algebra|publisher=|year=|isbn=|edition=Revised Third Edition|location=|pages=263,273}}</ref>.\n\nFor example, the polynomial<blockquote><math>f(x) = x^5 - 4x + 2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}</math></blockquote>is irreducible from Eisenstein's criterion. Plotting the graph of <math>f</math>  with graphing software or paper shows it has three real roots, hence two complex roots, showing its Galois group is <math>S_5</math>.\n\n=== Infinite Groups ===\nA basic example of a field extension with an infinite group of automorphisms, is {{math|Aut('''C'''/'''Q''')}} since it contains every algebraic field extension <math>E/\\mathbb{Q}</math>. For example, the field extensions <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{a})/\\mathbb{Q}</math> for a square-free element <math>a \\in \\mathbb{Q}</math> each have a unique degree <math>2</math> automorphism, inducing an automorphism in {{math|Aut('''C'''/'''Q''')}}.\n\nOne of the most studied classes of examples of infinite Galois groups come from the [[Absolute Galois group]], which are [[Profinite group|profinite groups]]. These are infinite groups defined as the [[inverse limit]] of Galois groups all finite Galois extensions <math>E/F</math> for a fixed field. The inverse limit is denoted<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\overline{F}/F) := \\varprojlim_{E/F \\text{ finite separable}}{\\text{Gal}(E/F)}</math></blockquote>where <math>\\overline{F}</math> is the separable closure of a field.

Another readily computable example comes from the field extension <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{5}, \\ldots)/ \\mathbb{Q}</math> containing the square root of every positive prime. It has Galois group<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{5}, \\ldots)/ \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\prod_{p} \\mathbb{Z}/2</math> </blockquote>which can be deduced from the profinite limit<blockquote><math>\\cdots \\rightarrow \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{5})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\rightarrow \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q})</math></blockquote>and using the computation of the Galois groups.\n\n==Properties==\nThe significance of an extension being Galois is that it obeys the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]: the closed (with respect to the [[Krull topology]]) subgroups of the Galois group correspond to the intermediate fields of the field extension.\n\nIf <math>E/F</math> is a Galois extension, then <math>\\text{Gal}(E/F)</math> can be given a [[topological space|topology]], called the Krull topology, that makes it into a [[profinite group]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]\n*[[Absolute Galois group]]\n*[[Demushkin group]]\n*[[Solvable group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n| last=Jacobson\n| first=Nathan\n| author-link=Nathan Jacobson\n| title=Basic Algebra I\n| year=2009\n| edition=2nd\n| publisher=Dover Publications\n| isbn=978-0-486-47189-1\n| origyear=1985\n}}\n*{{Lang Algebra}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{springer|title=Galois group|id=p/g043150}}\n*[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/248224/galois-group-and-the-quaternion-group Galois group and the Quaternion group]\n*{{MathPages|id=home/kmath290/kmath290|title=Galois Groups}}\n\n[[Category:Galois theory]]\n", "text_old": "In [[mathematics]], more specifically in the area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[Galois theory]], the '''Galois group''' of a certain type of [[field extension]] is a specific [[group (mathematics)|group]] associated with the field extension.

Then, the splitting field over <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> is <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)</math> and has automorphisms <math>\\sigma_a</math> sending <math>\\zeta_n \\mapsto \\zeta_n^a</math> for <math>1 \\leq a < n</math> relatively prime to <math>n</math>. Since the degree of the field is equal to the degree of the polynomial, these automorphisms generate the Galois group<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dummit|first=|title=Abstract Algebra|last2=Foote|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=596, 14.5 Cyclotomic Extensions}}</ref>. If <math>n = p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}</math>, then<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \n\\prod_{a_i}\n\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_{p_i^{a_i}})/\\mathbb{Q})  </math></blockquote>If <math>n </math> is a prime <math>p </math>, then a corollary of this is <blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/(p-1) </math></blockquote>In fact, any finite Abelian group can be found as the Galois group of some subfield of a cyclotomic field extension by the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]].\n\n==== Finite Fields ====\nAnother useful class of examples of Galois groups with finite abelian groups comes from finite fields. If {{math|''q''}} is a prime power, and if {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''GF'''(''q'')}} and {{math|''E'' {{=}} '''GF'''(''q''<sup>''n''</sup>)}} denote the [[Finite field|Galois fields]] of order {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}} respectively, then <math>\\text{Gal}(E/F)</math> is cyclic of order {{math|''n''}} and generated by the [[Frobenius homomorphism]].\n\n==== Degree 4 examples ====\nOne example of a degree <math>4</math> field extension is the field extension <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}</math><ref>Since <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}\\oplus \\mathbb{Q}\\cdot\\sqrt{2} \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}\\cdot\\sqrt{3} \\oplus \\mathbb{Q}\\cdot \\sqrt{6}</math> as a <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> vector space.</ref>. This has two automorphisms <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> where <math>\\sigma</math> maps <math>\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}</math> and <math>\\tau</math> maps <math>\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}</math>. Since these two generators define a group of order <math>4</math>, the [[Klein four-group]], they determine the entire Galois group structure<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nAnother example is given from the splitting field <math>E/\\mathbb{Q}</math> of the polynomial<blockquote><math>f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1</math></blockquote>Note because <math>f(x)\\cdot(x-1) = x^5 - 1</math>, the roots of <math>f(x)</math> are <math>e^{2k\\pi i / 5}</math>. There are automorphisms <math>\\sigma_l</math> sending <math>e^{2\\pi i / 5}</math> to  <math>(e^{2\\pi i/5})^l</math>, generating a group of order <math>4</math>. Since <math>\\sigma_1</math> generates this group, the Galois group is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}/4</math>.\n\n=== Finite Non-Abelian groups ===\nConsider now {{math|''L'' {{=}} '''Q'''({{radic|2|3}}, ''\u03c9'')}}, where {{math|''\u03c9''}} is a [[root of unity|primitive cube root of unity]]. The group {{math|Gal(L/'''Q''')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''S''<sub>3</sub>}}, the [[dihedral group of order 6]], and {{math|''L''}} is in fact the splitting field of {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 2}} over {{math|'''Q'''}}.\n\n==== Quaternion Group ====\nThe [[Quaternion group]] can be found as the Galois group of a field extension of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>. For example, the field extension<blockquote><math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{\n    (2+\\sqrt{2})\n    (3+\\sqrt{3})\n})</math><ref>{{Cite book|last=Milne|first=|title=Field Theory|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=46}}</ref></blockquote>has the prescribed Galois group.\n\n==== Symmetric group of prime order ====\nIf <math>f</math> is an [[irreducible polynomial]] of prime degree {{math|''p''}} with rational coefficients and exactly two non-real roots, then the Galois group of <math>f</math> is the full [[symmetric group]] <math>S_p</math><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Lang|first=Serge|title=Algebra|publisher=|year=|isbn=|edition=Revised Third Edition|location=|pages=263,273}}</ref>.\n\nFor example, the polynomial<blockquote><math>f(x) = x^5 - 4x + 2 \\in \\mathbb{Q}</math></blockquote>is irreducible from Eisenstein's criterion. Plotting the graph of <math>f</math>  with graphing software or paper shows it has three real roots, hence two complex roots, showing its Galois group is <math>S_5</math>.\n\n=== Infinite Groups ===\nA basic example of a field extension with an infinite group of automorphisms, is {{math|Aut('''C'''/'''Q''')}} since it contains every algebraic field extension <math>E/\\mathbb{Q}</math>. For example, the field extensions <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{a})/\\mathbb{Q}</math> for a square-free element <math>a \\in \\mathbb{Q}</math> each have a unique degree <math>2</math> automorphism, inducing an automorphism in {{math|Aut('''C'''/'''Q''')}}.\n\nOne of the most studied classes of examples of infinite Galois groups come from the [[Absolute Galois group]], which are [[Profinite group|profinite groups]]. These are infinite groups defined as the [[inverse limit]] of Galois groups all finite Galois extensions <math>E/F</math> for a fixed field. The inverse limit is denoted<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\overline{F}/F) := \\varprojlim_{E/F \\text{ finite separable}}{\\text{Gal}(E/F)}</math></blockquote>where <math>\\overline{F}</math> is the separable closure of a field. Note this group is a [[Topological group]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BMI|title=9.22 Infinite Galois theory|last=|first=|date=|website=The Stacks project|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Some basic examples include<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q/\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cong \\hat{\\mathbb{Z}} \\cong \\prod_p \\mathbb{Z}_p</math><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/FT.pdf|title=Field Theory|last=Milne|first=|date=|website=|page=98|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/122676/2/memoria.pdf|title=Infinite Galois Theory|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=|website=|pages=14|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200406024608/http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/122676/2/memoria.pdf|archive-date=6 Apr 2020|access-date=}}</ref></blockquote>and <math>\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q})</math>. Another readily computable example comes from the field extension <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{5}, \\ldots)/ \\mathbb{Q}</math> containing the square root of every positive prime. It has Galois group<blockquote><math>\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{5}, \\ldots)/ \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\prod_{p} \\mathbb{Z}/2</math> </blockquote>which can be deduced from the profinite limit<blockquote><math>\\cdots \\rightarrow \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{5})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\rightarrow \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q})</math></blockquote>and using the computation of the Galois groups.\n\n==Properties==\nThe significance of an extension being Galois is that it obeys the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]: the closed (with respect to the [[Krull topology]]) subgroups of the Galois group correspond to the intermediate fields of the field extension.\n\nIf <math>E/F</math> is a Galois extension, then <math>\\text{Gal}(E/F)</math> can be given a [[topological space|topology]], called the Krull topology, that makes it into a [[profinite group]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fundamental theorem of Galois theory]]\n*[[Absolute Galois group]]\n*[[Demushkin group]]\n*[[Solvable group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n| last=Jacobson\n| first=Nathan\n| author-link=Nathan Jacobson\n| title=Basic Algebra I\n| year=2009\n| edition=2nd\n| publisher=Dover Publications\n| isbn=978-0-486-47189-1\n| origyear=1985\n}}\n*{{Lang Algebra}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{springer|title=Galois group|id=p/g043150}}\n*[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/248224/galois-group-and-the-quaternion-group Galois group and the Quaternion group]\n*{{MathPages|id=home/kmath290/kmath290|title=Galois Groups}}\n\n[[Category:Galois theory]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_group"}

{"title_page": "Multiview projection", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Planform|wing planform of aircraft|planform (aeronautics)}}\n{{Views}}\n\nIn [[technical drawing]] and [[computer graphics]], a '''multiview projection''' is a technique of illustration by which a standardized series of [[orthographic projection|orthographic]] [[two-dimensional]] pictures are constructed to represent the form of a [[three-dimensional]] object. Up to six pictures of an object are produced (called ''primary views''), with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: ''first-angle'' or ''third-angle'' projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being ''projected'' onto planes that form a six-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, ''usually'' three views of a drawing give enough information to make a three-dimensional object. These views are known as ''front view'', ''top view'' and ''end view''. Other names for these views include ''plan'', ''elevation'' and ''section''.\n\nThe terms ''orthographic projection'' and ''orthogonal projection'' are sometimes reserved specifically for multiview. However, ''orthographic'' and ''orthogonal'' more correctly refer to the [[right angle]] formed between the projection rays and the [[projection plane]], versus the angle formed between the ''subject of the drawing'' and the projection plane. Thus, orthographic projections include ''[[axonometric projection|axonometric]]'' or ''auxiliary views'' in addition to multiviews.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Comparison of several types of [[graphical projection]], including ''elevation'' and ''plan'' views]]\nTo render each such picture, a ''[[Line (geometry)#Ray|ray]] of sight'' (also called a ''projection line'', ''projection ray'' or ''line of sight'') towards the object is chosen, which determines on the object various points of interest (for instance, the points that are visible when looking at the object along the ray of sight); those points of interest are mapped by an [[orthographic projection]] to points on some [[Plane (geometry)|geometric plane]] (called a ''[[projection plane]]'' or ''[[image plane]]'') that is perpendicular to the ray of sight, thereby creating a 2D representation of the 3D object.\n\nCustomarily, two rays of sight are chosen for each of the [[Cartesian coordinate system|three axes]] of the object's coordinate system; that is, parallel to each axis, the object may be viewed in one of 2 opposite directions, making for a total of 6 orthographic projections (or \"views\") of the object:<ref>{{Citation |author=Ingrid Carlbom, Joseph Paciorek |title=Planar Geometric Projections and Viewing Transformations |journal=[[ACM Computing Surveys]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=465\u2013502 |year=1978 |doi=10.1145/356744.356750|citeseerx=10.1.1.532.4774 }}</ref>\n\n* Along a vertical axis (often the ''y''-axis): The ''top'' and ''bottom'' views, which are known as ''plans'' (because they show the arrangement of features on a horizontal plane, such as a floor in a building).\n* Along a horizontal axis (often the ''z''-axis): The ''front'' and ''back'' views, which are also known as ''elevations'' (because they show the heights of features of an object such as a building).\n* Along an orthogonal axis (often the ''x''-axis): The ''left'' and ''right'' views, which are known as ''elevations'', following the same reasoning.\n\nThese six planes of projection intersect each other, forming a box around the object, the most uniform construction of which is a cube; traditionally, these six views are presented together by first projecting the 3D object onto the 2D faces of a cube, and then \"unfolding\" the faces of the cube such that all of them are contained within the same plane (namely, the plane of the medium on which all of the images will be presented together, such as a piece of paper, or a computer monitor, etc.). However, even if the faces of the box are unfolded in one standardized way, there is ambiguity as to which projection is being displayed by a particular face; the cube has two faces that are perpendicular to a ray of sight, and the points of interest may be projected onto either one of them, a choice which has resulted in two predominant standards of projection:\n{{comparison_of_graphical_projections.svg}}\n# '''First-angle projection''': In this type of projection, the object is imagined to be in the first quadrant. Because the observer normally looks from the right side of the quadrant to obtain the front view, the objects will come in between the observer and the plane of projection. Therefore, in this case, the object is imagined to be transparent, and the projectors are imagined to be extended from various points of the object to meet the projection plane. When these meeting points are joined in order on the plane they form an image, thus in the first angle projection, any view is so placed that it represents the side of the object away from it. First angle projection is often used throughout parts of Europe so that it is often called European projection.\n# '''Third-angle projection''': In this type of projection, the object is imagined to be in the third quadrant. Again, as the observer is normally supposed to look from the right side of the quadrant to obtain the front view, in this method, the projection plane comes in between the observer and the object. Therefore, the plane of projection is assumed to be transparent. The intersection of this plan with the projectors from all the points of the object would form an image on the transparent plane. Thus it is seen that in the third angle projection any view is so placed that it represents the side from the object nearest to it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://civiljungle.com/first-angle-projection-third-angle-projection-symbol/|title=First Angle Projection & Third Angle Projection Symbol (Orthographic Projection)|date=2019-09-10|website=CivilJungle|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Primary views==\nMultiview projections show the ''primary views'' of an object, each viewed in a direction parallel to one of the main coordinate axes. These primary views are called ''plans'' and ''elevations''. Sometimes they are shown as if the object has been cut across or sectioned to expose the interior: these views are called ''sections''.\n\n===Plan===\n{{see also|Plan (drawing)|Floor plan}}\n[[File:Millbank Prison Plan.jpg|thumb|right|A plan view of [[Millbank Prison]], 1828]]\nA '''plan''' is a view of a 3-dimensional object seen from vertically above (or sometimes below). It may be drawn in the position of a horizontal plane passing through, above, or below the object. The outline of a shape in this view is sometimes called its ''planform'', for example with [[planform (aeronautics)|aircraft wings]].\n\nThe plan view from above a building is called its roof plan. A section seen in a horizontal plane through the walls and showing the floor beneath is called a ''floor plan''.\n\n===Elevation===\n[[File:Panth\u00e9on Soufflot - \u00e9levation principale.png|thumb|Principal fa\u00e7ade of the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris]], by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]].]]\n\n'''Elevation''' is the view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a vertical plane beside an object. In other words, an elevation is a side view as viewed from the front, back, left or right (and referred to as a ''front elevation'', ''[left/ right] side elevation'', and a ''rear elevation'').\n\nAn elevation is a common method of depicting the external configuration and detailing of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. Building fa\u00e7ades are shown as elevations in [[architectural drawing]]s and [[technical drawing]]s.\n\nElevations are the most common orthographic projection for conveying the appearance of a building from the exterior. [[Perspective projection|Perspectives]] are also commonly used for this purpose. A building elevation is typically labeled in relation to the compass direction it faces; the direction from which a person views it. E.g. the North Elevation of a building is the side that most closely faces true north on the compass.<ref>{{Citation | first = Frank| last = Ching | author-link = Frank Ching | title = Architectural Graphics - Second Edition | place = New York | publisher = Van Norstrand Reinhold | year = 1985 | isbn = 978-0-442-21862-1 }}</ref>\n\nInterior elevations are used to show details such as [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] and trim configurations.\n\nIn the building industry elevations are non-perspective views of the structure. These are drawn to scale so that measurements can be taken for any aspect necessary. Drawing sets include front, rear, and both side elevations. The elevations specify the composition of the different facades of the building, including ridge heights, the positioning of the final fall of the land, exterior finishes, roof pitches, and other architectural details.\n\n====Developed elevation====\nA '''developed elevation''' is a variant of a regular elevation view in which several adjacent non-parallel sides may be shown together as if they have been unfolded.  For example, the north and west views may be shown side-by-side, sharing an edge, even though this does not represent a proper orthographic projection.\n\n===Section===\n{{See also|Cross section (geometry)}}\nA '''section''', or ''cross-section'', is a view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object.\n\nA section is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions.  It is often used in [[technical drawing]] and is traditionally [[crosshatch]]ed. The style of crosshatching often indicates the type of material the section passes through.\n\nWith [[computed axial tomography]], computers construct cross-sections from [[x-ray]] data.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Cross section.png|A 3-D view of a [[beverage-can stove]] with a '''cross-section''' in yellow.\nFile:Seal mechanical compression.png|A 2-D cross-sectional view of a compression seal.\nFile:Porsche 911 halbiert Seite.jpg|Cutaway of a [[Porsche 996]]\nFile:Jet engine numbered.svg|Cross-section of a jet engine\n</gallery>\n\n==Auxiliary views==\nAn ''auxiliary view'' or ''pictorial'', is an orthographic view that is projected into any plane other than one of the six ''primary views''.<ref>Bertoline, Gary R. ''Introduction to Graphics Communications for Engineers (4th Ed.).'' New York, NY. 2009</ref>  These views are typically used when an object has a surface in an oblique plane. By projecting into a plane parallel with the oblique surface, the true size and shape of the surface are shown. Auxiliary views tend to make use of [[axonometric projection]].\n\n==Multiviews==\n{{MOS|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Quadrants in descriptive geometry===\n[[File:Quadrants in descriptive geometry.png|thumb|200px|left|Gaspard Monge's four quadrants and two planes.]]\nModern orthographic projection is derived from [[Gaspard Monge]]'s [[descriptive geometry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/spotlight/geometric-models-jullien-models-for-descriptive-geometry|title=Geometric Models - Jullien Models for Descriptive Geometry|website=Smithsonian Institution|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> Monge defined a reference system of two viewing planes, horizontal ''H'' (\"ground\") and vertical ''V'' (\"backdrop\").  These two planes intersect to partition 3D space into 4 quadrants, which he labeled:\n* ''I'': above ''H'', in front of ''V''\n* ''II'': above ''H'', behind ''V''\n* ''III'': below ''H'', behind ''V''\n* ''IV'': below ''H'', in front of ''V''\nThese quadrant labels are the same as used in 2D planar geometry, as seen from infinitely far to the \"left\", taking ''H'' and ''V'' to be the ''X''-axis and ''Y''-axis, respectively.\n\nThe 3D object of interest is then placed into either quadrant ''I'' or ''III'' (equivalently, the position of the intersection line between the two planes is shifted), obtaining ''first''- and ''third-angle'' projections, respectively.  Quadrants ''II'' and ''IV'' are also mathematically valid, but their use would result in one view \"true\" and the other view \"flipped\" by 180\u00b0 through its vertical centerline, which is too confusing for technical drawings. (In cases where such a view is useful, e.g. a ceiling viewed from above, a reflected view is used, which is a mirror image of the true orthographic view.)\n\nMonge's original formulation uses two planes only and obtains the top and front views only.  The addition of a third plane to show a [[Elevation (view)|side view]] (either left or right) is a modern extension.  The terminology of ''quadrant'' is a mild anachronism, as a modern orthographic projection with three views corresponds more precisely to an octant of 3D space.\n'''\n\n===First-angle projection===\nIn '''first-angle projection''', the object is conceptually located in quadrant '''I''', i.e. it '''floats above and before''' the viewing planes, the planes are '''opaque''', and each view is '''pushed''' through the object onto the plane furthest from it.  (Mnemonic: an \"actor on a stage\".)  Extending to the 6-sided box, each view of the object is projected in the direction (sense) of sight of the object, onto the (opaque) interior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the opposite side of the box. A two-dimensional representation of the object is then created by \"unfolding\" the box, to view all of the '''interior''' walls. This produces two [[plan]]s and four [[elevation]]s. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the\nobject on top of an upside-down bowl. Sliding the object down the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Object in box upload.svg|An image of an object in a box.\nFile:First angle projecting.svg|The same image, with views of the object projected in the direction of sight onto walls using first-angle projection.\nFile:First angle unfolding.svg|Similar image showing the box unfolding from around the object.\nFile:First angle unfolded.svg|Image showing orthographic views located relative to each other in accordance with first-angle projection.\n</gallery>\n'''\n\n===Third-angle projection===\n\n[[File:Orthographic example.gif|thumb|An example of a multiview orthographic drawing from a US Patent (1913), showing two views of the same object. Third angle projection is used.]]\nIn '''third-angle projection''', the object is conceptually located in quadrant III, i.e. it is positioned '''below and behind''' the viewing planes, the planes are '''transparent''', and each view is '''pulled''' onto the plane closest to it.  (Mnemonic: a \"shark in a tank\", esp. that is sunken into the floor.)  Using the 6-sided viewing box, each view of the object is projected opposite to the direction (sense) of sight, onto the (transparent) exterior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the same side of the box.  The box is then unfolded to view all of its '''exterior''' walls. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the object in the bottom of a bowl. Sliding the object up the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.\n\nHere is the construction of third angle projections of the same object as above.  Note that the individual views are the same, just arranged differently.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Object in box upload.svg\nFile:Third angle projecting.svg\nFile:Third angle unfolding.svg\nFile:Third angle unfolded.svg\n</gallery>\n\n===Additional information===\n\nFirst-angle projection is as if the object were sitting '''on''' the paper and, from\nthe \"face\" (front) view, it is rolled to the right to show the left side or rolled up to show its bottom. It is standard throughout Europe and Asia (excluding Japan).  First-angle projection was widely used in the UK, but during World War II, British drawings sent to be manufactured in the USA, such as of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]], had to be drawn in third-angle projection before they could be produced, e.g., as the [[Packard V-1650 Merlin]]. This meant that some British companies completely adopted third angle projection. BS 308 (Part 1) Engineering Drawing Practice, gave the option of using both projections, but generally, every illustration (other than the ones explaining the difference between first and third-angle) was done in first-angle. After the withdrawal of BS 308 in 1999, BS 8888 offered the same choice since it referred directly to ISO 5456-2, Technical drawings \u2013 Projection methods \u2013 Part 2: Orthographic representations.\n\nThird-angle is as if the object were a box to be unfolded. If we unfold the box so that the front view is in the center of the two arms, then the top view is above it, the bottom view is below it, the left view is to the left, and the right view is to the right. It is standard in the USA ([[the American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] Y14.3-2003 specifies it as the default projection system), Japan ([[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] B 0001:2010 specifies it as the default projection system), Canada, and Australia.\n\nBoth first-angle and third-angle projections result in the same 6 views; the difference between them is the arrangement of these views around the box.\n\nA great deal of confusion has ensued in drafting rooms and engineering departments when drawings are transferred from one convention to another.  On [[engineering drawing]]s, the projection is denoted by an international symbol representing a truncated [[cone (geometry)|cone]] in either first-angle or third-angle projection, as shown by the diagram on the right.\n\n[[File:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|right|Symbols used to define whether a projection is either first angle (left) or third angle (right)]]\n\nThe 3D interpretation is a solid truncated cone, with the small end pointing toward the viewer. The front view is, therefore, two concentric circles (a \"donut\"). The fact that the inner circle is drawn with a solid line instead of dashed identifies this view as the front view, not the rear view.\n* In ''first-angle projection'', the front view is pushed back to the rear wall, and the right side view is pushed to the left wall, so the first-angle symbol shows the cone with its large end toward the donut.\n* In ''third-angle projection'', the front view is pulled forward to the front wall, and the right side view is pulled to the right wall, so the third-angle symbol shows the cone with its large end away from the donut.\n\n==Multiviews without rotation==\n\nOrthographic multiview projection is derived from the principles of [[descriptive geometry]] and may produce an image of a specified, imaginary object as viewed from any direction of space. Orthographic projection is distinguished by parallel projectors emanating from all points of the imaged object and which intersect of projection at right angles. Above, a technique is described that obtains varying views by projecting images after the object is rotated to the desired position.\n\nDescriptive geometry customarily relies on obtaining various views by imagining an object to be stationary and changing the direction of projection (viewing) in order to obtain the desired view.\n\nSee ''Figure 1''. Using the rotation technique above, note that no orthographic view is available looking perpendicularly at any of the inclined surfaces. Suppose a technician desired such a view to, say, look through a hole to be drilled perpendicularly to the surface. Such a view might be desired for calculating clearances or for dimensioning purposes. To obtain this view without multiple rotations requires the principles of Descriptive Geometry. The steps below describe the use of these principles in third angle projection.\n\n[[File:One thru Nine Step by Step Orthographic Auxiliary Projection2.png|thumb|664px|left|Figures one through nine.]]{{Clear}}\n\n*''Fig.1'': Pictorial of the imaginary object that the technician wishes to image.\n*''Fig.2'': The object is imagined behind a vertical plane of projection.

However, even if the faces of the box are unfolded in one standardized way, there is ambiguity as to which projection is being displayed by a particular face; the cube has two faces that are perpendicular to a ray of sight, and the points of interest may be projected onto either one of them, a choice which has resulted in two predominant standards of projection:\n{{comparison_of_graphical_projections.svg}}\n# '''First-angle projection''': In this type of projection, the object is imagined to be in the first quadrant. Because the observer normally looks from the right side of the quadrant to obtain the front view, the objects will come in between the observer and the plane of projection. Therefore, in this case, the object is imagined to be transparent, and the projectors are imagined to be extended from various points of the object to meet the projection plane. When these meeting points are joined in order on the plane they form an image, thus in the first angle projection, any view is so placed that it represents the side of the object away from it. First angle projection is often used throughout parts of Europe so that it is often called European projection.\n# '''Third-angle projection''': In this type of projection, the object is imagined to be in the third quadrant. Again, as the observer is normally supposed to look from the right side of the quadrant to obtain the front view, in this method, the projection plane comes in between the observer and the object. Therefore, the plane of projection is assumed to be transparent. The intersection of this plan with the projectors from all the points of the object would form an image on the transparent plane. Thus it is seen that in the third angle projection any view is so placed that it represents the side from the object nearest to it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://civiljungle.com/first-angle-projection-third-angle-projection-symbol/|title=First Angle Projection & Third Angle Projection Symbol (Orthographic Projection)|date=2019-09-10|website=CivilJungle|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Primary views==\nMultiview projections show the ''primary views'' of an object, each viewed in a direction parallel to one of the main coordinate axes. These primary views are called ''plans'' and ''elevations''. Sometimes they are shown as if the object has been cut across or sectioned to expose the interior: these views are called ''sections''.\n\n===Plan===\n{{see also|Plan (drawing)|Floor plan}}\n[[File:Millbank Prison Plan.jpg|thumb|right|A plan view of [[Millbank Prison]], 1828]]\nA '''plan''' is a view of a 3-dimensional object seen from vertically above (or sometimes below). It may be drawn in the position of a horizontal plane passing through, above, or below the object. The outline of a shape in this view is sometimes called its ''planform'', for example with [[planform (aeronautics)|aircraft wings]].\n\nThe plan view from above a building is called its roof plan. A section seen in a horizontal plane through the walls and showing the floor beneath is called a ''floor plan''.\n\n===Elevation===\n[[File:Panth\u00e9on Soufflot - \u00e9levation principale.png|thumb|Principal fa\u00e7ade of the [[Panth\u00e9on, Paris]], by [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]].]]\n\n'''Elevation''' is the view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a vertical plane beside an object. In other words, an elevation is a side view as viewed from the front, back, left or right (and referred to as a ''front elevation'', ''[left/ right] side elevation'', and a ''rear elevation'').\n\nAn elevation is a common method of depicting the external configuration and detailing of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. Building fa\u00e7ades are shown as elevations in [[architectural drawing]]s and [[technical drawing]]s.\n\nElevations are the most common orthographic projection for conveying the appearance of a building from the exterior. [[Perspective projection|Perspectives]] are also commonly used for this purpose. A building elevation is typically labeled in relation to the compass direction it faces; the direction from which a person views it. E.g. the North Elevation of a building is the side that most closely faces true north on the compass.<ref>{{Citation | first = Frank| last = Ching | author-link = Frank Ching | title = Architectural Graphics - Second Edition | place = New York | publisher = Van Norstrand Reinhold | year = 1985 | isbn = 978-0-442-21862-1 }}</ref>\n\nInterior elevations are used to show details such as [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] and trim configurations.\n\nIn the building industry elevations are non-perspective views of the structure. These are drawn to scale so that measurements can be taken for any aspect necessary. Drawing sets include front, rear, and both side elevations. The elevations specify the composition of the different facades of the building, including ridge heights, the positioning of the final fall of the land, exterior finishes, roof pitches, and other architectural details.\n\n====Developed elevation====\nA '''developed elevation''' is a variant of a regular elevation view in which several adjacent non-parallel sides may be shown together as if they have been unfolded.  For example, the north and west views may be shown side-by-side, sharing an edge, even though this does not represent a proper orthographic projection.\n\n===Section===\n{{See also|Cross section (geometry)}}\nA '''section''', or ''cross-section'', is a view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object.\n\nA section is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions.  It is often used in [[technical drawing]] and is traditionally [[crosshatch]]ed. The style of crosshatching often indicates the type of material the section passes through.\n\nWith [[computed axial tomography]], computers construct cross-sections from [[x-ray]] data.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Cross section.png|A 3-D view of a [[beverage-can stove]] with a '''cross-section''' in yellow.\nFile:Seal mechanical compression.png|A 2-D cross-sectional view of a compression seal.\nFile:Porsche 911 halbiert Seite.jpg|Cutaway of a [[Porsche 996]]\nFile:Jet engine numbered.svg|Cross-section of a jet engine\n</gallery>\n\n==Auxiliary views==\nAn ''auxiliary view'' or ''pictorial'', is an orthographic view that is projected into any plane other than one of the six ''primary views''.<ref>Bertoline, Gary R. ''Introduction to Graphics Communications for Engineers (4th Ed.).'' New York, NY. 2009</ref>  These views are typically used when an object has a surface in an oblique plane. By projecting into a plane parallel with the oblique surface, the true size and shape of the surface are shown. Auxiliary views tend to make use of [[axonometric projection]].\n\n==Multiviews==\n{{MOS|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Quadrants in descriptive geometry===\n[[File:Quadrants in descriptive geometry.png|thumb|200px|left|Gaspard Monge's four quadrants and two planes.]]\nModern orthographic projection is derived from [[Gaspard Monge]]'s [[descriptive geometry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/spotlight/geometric-models-jullien-models-for-descriptive-geometry|title=Geometric Models - Jullien Models for Descriptive Geometry|website=Smithsonian Institution|language=en|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> Monge defined a reference system of two viewing planes, horizontal ''H'' (\"ground\") and vertical ''V'' (\"backdrop\").  These two planes intersect to partition 3D space into 4 quadrants, which he labeled:\n* ''I'': above ''H'', in front of ''V''\n* ''II'': above ''H'', behind ''V''\n* ''III'': below ''H'', behind ''V''\n* ''IV'': below ''H'', in front of ''V''\nThese quadrant labels are the same as used in 2D planar geometry, as seen from infinitely far to the \"left\", taking ''H'' and ''V'' to be the ''X''-axis and ''Y''-axis, respectively.\n\nThe 3D object of interest is then placed into either quadrant ''I'' or ''III'' (equivalently, the position of the intersection line between the two planes is shifted), obtaining ''first''- and ''third-angle'' projections, respectively.  Quadrants ''II'' and ''IV'' are also mathematically valid, but their use would result in one view \"true\" and the other view \"flipped\" by 180\u00b0 through its vertical centerline, which is too confusing for technical drawings. (In cases where such a view is useful, e.g. a ceiling viewed from above, a reflected view is used, which is a mirror image of the true orthographic view.)\n\nMonge's original formulation uses two planes only and obtains the top and front views only.  The addition of a third plane to show a [[Elevation (view)|side view]] (either left or right) is a modern extension.  The terminology of ''quadrant'' is a mild anachronism, as a modern orthographic projection with three views corresponds more precisely to an octant of 3D space.\n'''\n\n===First-angle projection===\nIn '''first-angle projection''', the object is conceptually located in quadrant '''I''', i.e. it '''floats above and before''' the viewing planes, the planes are '''opaque''', and each view is '''pushed''' through the object onto the plane furthest from it.  (Mnemonic: an \"actor on a stage\".)  Extending to the 6-sided box, each view of the object is projected in the direction (sense) of sight of the object, onto the (opaque) interior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the opposite side of the box. A two-dimensional representation of the object is then created by \"unfolding\" the box, to view all of the '''interior''' walls. This produces two [[plan]]s and four [[elevation]]s. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the\nobject on top of an upside-down bowl. Sliding the object down the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Object in box upload.svg|An image of an object in a box.\nFile:First angle projecting.svg|The same image, with views of the object projected in the direction of sight onto walls using first-angle projection.\nFile:First angle unfolding.svg|Similar image showing the box unfolding from around the object.\nFile:First angle unfolded.svg|Image showing orthographic views located relative to each other in accordance with first-angle projection.\n</gallery>\n'''\n\n===Third-angle projection===\n\n[[File:Orthographic example.gif|thumb|An example of a multiview orthographic drawing from a US Patent (1913), showing two views of the same object. Third angle projection is used.]]\nIn '''third-angle projection''', the object is conceptually located in quadrant III, i.e. it is positioned '''below and behind''' the viewing planes, the planes are '''transparent''', and each view is '''pulled''' onto the plane closest to it.  (Mnemonic: a \"shark in a tank\", esp. that is sunken into the floor.)  Using the 6-sided viewing box, each view of the object is projected opposite to the direction (sense) of sight, onto the (transparent) exterior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the same side of the box.  The box is then unfolded to view all of its '''exterior''' walls. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the object in the bottom of a bowl. Sliding the object up the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.\n\nHere is the construction of third angle projections of the same object as above.  Note that the individual views are the same, just arranged differently.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Object in box upload.svg\nFile:Third angle projecting.svg\nFile:Third angle unfolding.svg\nFile:Third angle unfolded.svg\n</gallery>\n\n===Additional information===\n\nFirst-angle projection is as if the object were sitting '''on''' the paper and, from\nthe \"face\" (front) view, it is rolled to the right to show the left side or rolled up to show its bottom. It is standard throughout Europe and Asia (excluding Japan).  First-angle projection was widely used in the UK, but during World War II, British drawings sent to be manufactured in the USA, such as of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]], had to be drawn in third-angle projection before they could be produced, e.g., as the [[Packard V-1650 Merlin]]. This meant that some British companies completely adopted third angle projection. BS 308 (Part 1) Engineering Drawing Practice, gave the option of using both projections, but generally, every illustration (other than the ones explaining the difference between first and third-angle) was done in first-angle. After the withdrawal of BS 308 in 1999, BS 8888 offered the same choice since it referred directly to ISO 5456-2, Technical drawings \u2013 Projection methods \u2013 Part 2: Orthographic representations.\n\nThird-angle is as if the object were a box to be unfolded. If we unfold the box so that the front view is in the center of the two arms, then the top view is above it, the bottom view is below it, the left view is to the left, and the right view is to the right. It is standard in the USA ([[the American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] Y14.3-2003 specifies it as the default projection system), Japan ([[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] B 0001:2010 specifies it as the default projection system), Canada, and Australia.\n\nBoth first-angle and third-angle projections result in the same 6 views; the difference between them is the arrangement of these views around the box.\n\nA great deal of confusion has ensued in drafting rooms and engineering departments when drawings are transferred from one convention to another.  On [[engineering drawing]]s, the projection is denoted by an international symbol representing a truncated [[cone (geometry)|cone]] in either first-angle or third-angle projection, as shown by the diagram on the right.\n\n[[File:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|right|Symbols used to define whether a projection is either first angle (left) or third angle (right)]]\n\nThe 3D interpretation is a solid truncated cone, with the small end pointing toward the viewer. The front view is, therefore, two concentric circles (a \"donut\"). The fact that the inner circle is drawn with a solid line instead of dashed identifies this view as the front view, not the rear view.\n* In ''first-angle projection'', the front view is pushed back to the rear wall, and the right side view is pushed to the left wall, so the first-angle symbol shows the cone with its large end toward the donut.\n* In ''third-angle projection'', the front view is pulled forward to the front wall, and the right side view is pulled to the right wall, so the third-angle symbol shows the cone with its large end away from the donut.\n\n==Multiviews without rotation==\n\nOrthographic multiview projection is derived from the principles of [[descriptive geometry]] and may produce an image of a specified, imaginary object as viewed from any direction of space. Orthographic projection is distinguished by parallel projectors emanating from all points of the imaged object and which intersect of projection at right angles. Above, a technique is described that obtains varying views by projecting images after the object is rotated to the desired position.\n\nDescriptive geometry customarily relies on obtaining various views by imagining an object to be stationary and changing the direction of projection (viewing) in order to obtain the desired view.\n\nSee ''Figure 1''. Using the rotation technique above, note that no orthographic view is available looking perpendicularly at any of the inclined surfaces. Suppose a technician desired such a view to, say, look through a hole to be drilled perpendicularly to the surface. Such a view might be desired for calculating clearances or for dimensioning purposes. To obtain this view without multiple rotations requires the principles of Descriptive Geometry. The steps below describe the use of these principles in third angle projection.\n\n[[File:One thru Nine Step by Step Orthographic Auxiliary Projection2.png|thumb|664px|left|Figures one through nine.]]{{Clear}}\n\n*''Fig.1'': Pictorial of the imaginary object that the technician wishes to image.\n*''Fig.2'': The object is imagined behind a vertical plane of projection.

The locals are sometimes called ''Corallini'' because of the once plentiful [[Coral|coral]] in the nearby sea, and because the city has been a major producer of coral jewellery and cameo brooches since the seventeenth century.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient period===\n[[File:Satiro versante - Da Prassitele -370-60 aC- - Copia romana cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Satyr of [[Praxiteles]] (370\u2013360 BC), Roman copy from the Villa Sora, Palermo museum]]\n[[File:Ermes, Euridice, Orfeo.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hermes, Euridice, Orpheus; 40 BC Roman copy of the Greek original of 5th c. BC (Naples museum). Sculptor from the school of [[Phidias]], perhaps [[Alkamenes]]]]\n\nHistorically part of [[Magna Graecia]], the area was first colonised by ancient Greek settlers. In [[ancient Rome|Roman times]], Torre del Greco was probably a suburb of [[Herculaneum]] and, like alsewhere on the Bay of Naples such as at [[Oplontis]] and [[Stabiae]], many patrician's villas would have lined the coast. In 79&nbsp;AD the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] buried the area under volcanic ash. \n\nThe nearby Roman Villa Sora<ref>http://pompeiisites.org/en/villa-sora/</ref> was a large and sumptuous residence overlooking the sea from its 150m-long frontage, dating from the 1st c. BC, whose excavated remains can be seen today.<ref>https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/neighbouring-area/torre-del-greco</ref> It was built on multiple levels like the [[Villa of the Papyri]] and on the beach below are the remains of a Roman bath complex (''Terme Ginnasi'') and quays would have been on the shore. It was embellished in the early imperial period and was being renovated in 79 AD probably after the 62 AD earthquake as shown by the piles of lime in some rooms, unfinished precious ''[[opus sectile]]'' floors made of imported marble and a famous graffito which recorded the cost of the work.\n\nMany exquisite statues and frescos were found here firstly in the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] excavations of the 1700s which are now in the museums such as [[National Archaeological Museum of Naples|Naples]] and the [[Regional Archeological Museum Antonio Salinas|Palermo]]. Its size and quality implies it belonged to an important figure, possibly of the Imperial family judging by the spectacular frescoes which during the excavations of 1989 the area inspector considered closer to the Neronian [[Domus Aurea]] than to Pompeian houses.<ref>http://www.gruppoarcheologicovesuviano.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6&Itemid=11</ref>\n\nIt was rediscovered in 1974 by the GAV Archaeological Group. Further excavations in 1989\u201392 exposed the areas east and west of the apsidal hall, including service corridors, reception rooms, finely decorated bedrooms and the remains visible today. It was found that the top floor collapsed following the eruption while the bottom floor was buried by the ash. The middle floor can be visited today.\n\n===Post-Roman period===\nLater two villages are known to have been established in the area, Sora and Calastro. The Byzantine general [[Belisarius]] moved their inhabitants to [[Naples]] in 535. Around 700, it was also known as ''Turris Octava'', the Latin for The Tower of Eight [sides] or The Eighth Tower, probably referring to a coastal watch tower. The current name appears for the first time in 1015; according to tradition, it stems from a Greek hermit who took up residence in the tower, or from the cultivation of a particular vine from Greece.\n\n===Middle ages===\n\nTorre del Greco was part of the royal estates of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], until King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] ceded it to the [[House of Carafa|Carafa]] family.\n\nIn 1631 Torre del Greco was again damaged by an eruption of Vesuvius. Its citizens bought back their rights in 1699, after paying 106,000 [[ducat (coin)|ducat]]s to their landlord, the Marquis of Monforte, and thenceforth the city flourished as a maritime trading and fishing port. The tradition of coral crafting dates from this time.\n\nThe historical centre of Torre del Greco was buried under a {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} layer of lava in 1794.\n\n=== 19th and early 20th century ===\nAt the time of the French rule of [[Joachim Murat]], Torre del Greco, with 18,000 inhabitants, was the third largest mainland city in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] after Naples and [[Foggia]].\n\nStarting in the 16th century, wealthy families and even Italian nobility built elaborate summer palaces on the outskirts of the town. Among the most notable of these is the Palazzo Materazzo, renovated in the 1970s as a dance school, but later taken over by squatters after the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]] destroyed the homes of many of the poorer residents. In the 19th century, and continuing into the early 20th century, Torre del Greco was a popular summer resort for wealthy Italians.\n\nIn its heyday Torre del Greco was renowned for its caf\u00e9s and eateries, particularly the \"Gran Caff\u00e8 Palumbo\", a large [[Art Nouveau]] caf\u00e9 with an extensive outdoor pavilion known for its [[gelato]], pastries, food and coffee. The comedian [[Tot\u00f2]] was among those who made Torre del Greco their annual summer retreat.{{fact|date=November 2017}} The reason for Torre del Greco's popularity as a resort town was its fine beaches and the rural setting of lush farmlands and [[vineyard]]s, as well as its close proximity to Vesuvius. As the town nearest to the volcano, Torre del Greco was the main starting point for tourists wishing to scale the mountain. This was facilitated by the [[Vesuvius Funicular]], which took tourists to the crater from the town.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the city was used as an ammunition depot by the [[Wehrmacht|German army]], and consequently suffered heavy bombing by [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Climate===\nTorre del Greco experiences a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csa'').\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Torre del Greco\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high F = 54.5\n|Feb high F = 55.8\n|Mar high F = 59.4\n|Apr high F = 64.8\n|May high F = 72.7\n|Jun high F = 79.2\n|Jul high F = 84.7\n|Aug high F = 85.1\n|Sep high F = 79.3\n|Oct high F = 71.2\n|Nov high F = 62.6\n|Dec high F = 56.5\n|year high F = 68.8\n|Jan low F = 38.8\n|Feb low F = 39.7\n|Mar low F = 42.6\n|Apr low F = 46.9\n|May low F = 53.8\n|Jun low F = 60.1\n|Jul low F = 64.4\n|Aug low F = 64.2\n|Sep low F = 59.5\n|Oct low F = 52.9\n|Nov low F = 45.9\n|Dec low F = 41.2\n|year low F = 50.8\n|Jan precipitation inch = 4.1\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.9\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.4\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.0\n|May precipitation inch = 2.0\n|Jun precipitation inch = 1.3\n|Jul precipitation inch = 1.0\n|Aug precipitation inch = 1.6\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.2\n|Oct precipitation inch = 5.1\n|Nov precipitation inch = 6.4\n|Dec precipitation inch = 4.8\n|year precipitation inch = 39.8\n|source 1 = <ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.intellicast.com/Local/History.aspx?location=ITXX0076 |title=Torre del Greco historic weather averages in Italy |accessdate= 3 June 2009 |publisher=Intellicast}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Economy==\nThe city is the headquarters of [[Banca di Credito Popolare di Torre del Greco]].\n\n==Main sights==\n*Roman archaeological remains, including the so-called Villa Sora (1st century AD), probably a property of the [[Flavians]].\n*The monastery of the [[Zoccolanti]], with a [[cloister]] housing 28 [[fresco]]ed panels depicting the life of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]].\n*The parish church of Santa Croce, whose [[baroque]] belltower was buried by lava in 1794.\n*The 17th-century church of San Michele.\n*[[Villa delle Ginestre]], where the poet [[Giacomo Leopardi]] sojourned.\n*The Museum of Coral.\n\n[[File:Alexander Andrejewitsch Iwanow 007.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Torre del Greco near [[Pompeii]]'', [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]], 1846.]]\n\n==Cameos and coral jewellery==\nDiving for [[coral]] has taken place in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] ever since [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, and in the 15th century Torre del Greco became known for its coral diving and harvesting of red coral.

In [[ancient Rome|Roman times]], Torre del Greco was probably a suburb of [[Herculaneum]] and, like alsewhere on the Bay of Naples such as at [[Oplontis]] and [[Stabiae]], many patrician's villas would have lined the coast. In 79&nbsp;AD the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] buried the area under volcanic ash. \n\nThe nearby Roman Villa Sora<ref>http://pompeiisites.org/en/villa-sora/</ref> was a large and sumptuous residence overlooking the sea from its 150m-long frontage, dating from the 1st c.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the [[Abbasids]] of [[Baghdad]], and the [[Fatimids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] of Egypt.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: History of Arabia\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: History of Arabia] retrieved 18 January 2011</ref>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Ottoman territories acquired between 1481 and 1683 ([[List of Ottoman Empire dominated territories|See: list of territories]])]]\n\nThe provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in [[Syria (region)|Syria]], which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon ([[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate|Mount Lebanon was, however, a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate]]).

Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of [[Hejaz]], asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised [[Cilicia]] \u2013 [[\u0130skenderun]] and [[Mersin]], [[Iraq]] with [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]], [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]], [[Jordan]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].<ref>As cited by R, John and S.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name=enein>{{Cite news |issue=Jan\u2013Feb, 2004 |last=Aboul-Enein |first=Youssef |title=The Egyptian-Yemen War: Egyptian perspectives on Guerrilla warfare |work=Infantry Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2008 |date=2004-01-01 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203161830/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-03}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\nIn 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.<ref>see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed.
