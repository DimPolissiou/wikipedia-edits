The short, which shows an old man who competes with himself in a game of [[chess]], was [[Pixar]]'s first film to feature a [[human being]] as its main character; Geri later made an appearance in ''[[Toy Story 2]]''.\n\n''Geri's Game'' was released eight years after ''[[Knick Knack]]'', the last short by Pixar, made as part of an effort to reignite the [[List of Pixar shorts|studio's short film series]], which had been put on standby in order to focus on the creation of the studio's first feature film, which would become the first-ever [[Feature film|full-length]] computer-animated film, ''[[Toy Story]]''. A dedicated [[research and development]] team worked alongside the filmmakers to devise ways to get around the burdens of animating a human character, leading to an in-house [[computer simulation]] to mimic the natural [[Cloth simulation|movement of clothing]] on a character. [[Subdivision surface]] [[3D modeling|modeling]], a technique partly pioneered by [[Edwin Catmull]] in 1978 but mostly ignored in favor of NURBS surfaces, was used to bestow natural movement and realistic skin [[Texture (computer graphics)|textures]] on the human character himself.\n\n''Geri's Game'' premiered on November 24, 1997, winning an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]] the following year. It was later shown with the theatrical release of Pixar's second feature film, ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', the following year, and therefore became part of a Pixar tradition of pairing shorts with feature films.\n\n==Plot==\nAt a peaceful park in [[Paris]], against a backdrop of fall leaves in early October, 1997, and the sounds of an [[accordion]] softly playing ''[[A Night in Tunisia]]'', the title character, Geri (voiced by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]], although the character never forms any actual words), a balding [[Old age|elderly]] man in a [[lounge suit]] fond of smacking his toothless gums and lips together, plays a game of [[chess]] against himself. He \"becomes\" each player after every turn by slowly walking to the other side of the [[chessboard]], where he changes his personality and either puts on or removes his glasses to show this change in character.\n\nAs the game progresses, the [[Cut (transition)|cuts]] speed up, and it seems more and more as though there are two people playing; at one point, 2 minutes and 25 seconds in, the frame even shows the \"opponent's\" hand in the foreground and the other Geri in focus in the background. Geri's aggressive [[alter ego]], playing as [[Black chess pieces|Black]], soon gains the upper hand over the original Geri, capturing every one of his [[Chess piece|pieces]] except for the [[king (chess)|king]] and [[Queen (chess)|queen]]. After one bad move of the king, Geri's queen is captured and he is soon put into [[checkmate]]. \n\nHowever, Geri outsmarts himself by faking a [[heart attack]] to distract his alter ego so he can spin the board around, knocking the box of pieces off the table he is playing on. While his alternate self is still preoccupied with his gloating, Geri [[checkmate]]s what is now his opponent's king. Finding that he is now the one who is losing, and realizing what has happened, the nonbespectled Geri begrudgingly [[resign (chess)|resigns]] the game by tipping his king over and hands over a set of [[dentures]] as the prize. Timid Geri then puts them into his mouth, chuckling and basking in his victory as he sits by himself, smiling a toothy grin, while the camera pulls back to reveal that he was on his own the whole time.\n\n==Development==\n''Geri's Game'' was Pixar's first original short film since 1989, when ''[[Knick Knack]]'' was released. It was directed and written by [[Jan Pinkava]], who joined the studio in 1993 to work on their [[TV commercials]] while the other directors and writers were preoccupied with the production of ''[[Toy Story]]'', and had been continuously approaching executive producer [[Darla K. Anderson]] with the proposal that the studio make a new short film.<ref name=\"20 years\">{{cite web|title=\u2018Geri\u2019s Game\u2019 Turns 20: Director Jan Pinkava Reflects On The Game-Changing Pixar Short|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cgi/geris-game-turns-20-director-jan-pinkava-reflects-game-changing-pixar-short-154646.html|publisher=Cartoor Brew|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Initial conception ===\nWork on the short began shortly after the release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' and during early production of ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', when [[Ed Catmull]] decided that the studio should resurrect its short films production as a way to not only bring new animators and storytellers into Pixar, but also as a way to further push [[research and development]] for the studio.<ref name=\"New Face\">{{cite magazine|last=Robertson |first=Barbara |title=Meet Geri: The New Face of Animation |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/glmiller/public/computational-geometry/15-852-F08/RelatedWork/meet-geri.pdf |magazine=Computer Graphics World |date=February 1998 |accessdate=May 7, 2018}}</ref> For the first of these shorts, which would be the first one made in 8 years, Catmull wanted Pixar to create a story which featured a human as its central protagonist.

Clark|Jim Clark]], which allowed for more lifelike skin surfaces.<ref name=\"20 years\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Subdivision Surfaces in Character Animation|url=http://graphics.pixar.com/library/Geri/paper.pdf|website=graphics.pixar.com|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref> \n\nPreviously, most 3D character surfaces were crafted using several [[non-uniform rational B-spline]]s (NURBS) that had to be \"stitched\" together, which made for less expressive movement and caused models to frequently tear. The use of subdivision surfacing, which renders a character's skin as one large surface, allowed for smoother object movement, as well as more intricate detail. DeRose had been working on the technology at the [[University of Washington]], and had already brought subdivision surfaces to [[CAD]] makers, who were ultimately unconvinced, and held their faith in NURBS, before bringing it to Pixar, which was much more receptive.<ref name=\"New Face\" /> \n\nOn the clothing side, after toiling endlessly, Kass managed to create a system which could emulate/simulate the movement of cloth, at which point the team realized that the [[suit jacket]] they had modeled didn't fit with Geri's movement outside of a default [[T-pose]]. According to Pinkava, [[Steve Jobs]], upon a hearing about the issue, had offered to help him by enlisting [[tailor]] [[Giorgio Armani]] to help them design an outfit for Geri, which he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"20 years\" /> The development of a dynamic cloth simulator made several changes to the way that animators work; for instance, the animation, when completed, needed to be sent to the simulator, which would automatically insert Geri's jacket and calculate its movements, rather than being directly sourced to the [[3D rendering|renderer]] after being finished. Geri also needed to be animated 30 [[Film frame|frames]] in advance in order to get the simulation going, and animators couldn't \"cheat\" by having off-camera body parts go unanimated, as it would affect how the simulating program moved the clothing.<ref name=\"New Face\" /> \n\nLike other Pixar shorts, ''Geri's Game'' contains no [[spoken dialogue]], and so is driven only by the actions and [[Facial expression|expressions]] of its main character. To further push the ability to convey the film's story, extra detail was put into Geri's facial [[Rigging (computer graphics)|rigging]] compared to previous rigging methods, with rigger Paul Aichele giving the character ''hundreds'' of face controls for animators to use.<ref name=\"20 years\" /> These new, more detailed rigging methods went on to be used in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', which was being worked on at the same time.<ref name=\"20 years\" />\n\n=== Staff ===\nLike previous short films made by Pixar, ''Geri's Game'' was made by a temporary branch of Pixar employees, and was separate from the people working on the studio's feature films. It took roughly a year to produce, according to Pinkava, largely due to the amount of time allotted to developing the [[cloth simulation]].<ref name=\"20 years\" /> While the short was being made, most of Pixar Studios was preoccupied with making ''A Bug's Life''. Despite this, there were 18 different animators<ref name=\"New Face\" /> that worked on the project (including Pixar storywriter [[Pete Docter]], who contributed a few scenes out of sheer interest<ref name=\"20 years\" />). Despite being preoccupied directing ''A Bug's Life'', [[John Lasseter]] suggested adding a scene in which Geri checks to make sure he's alright after seeing his alter ego stage a heart attack and keel over; Lasseter physically staged out the entire scene to Pinkava.<ref name=\"20 years\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Geri's Game'' premiered on November 24, 1997 at [[Laemmle Theatres|Laemmle's]] Monica Theater in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref name=TFLPremiere>{{cite news|title=Question: Where Can You Get a Glimpse of the Future of Animation?; Answer: At an Exclusive Screening - From the Makers of 'Toy Story' - Tonight!|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Question%3A+Where+Can+You+Get+a+Glimpse+of+the+Future+of+Animation%3F%3B...-a020009689|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Free Library|date=November 24, 1997|author=Pixar Animation Studios}}</ref> It was also attached to the theatrical release of Pixar's second feature film, ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', in 1998,<ref name=\"Bug\">{{cite news| last= Maslin| first= Janet| title= A Bug's Life (1998)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E7DA1639F936A15752C1A96E958260|accessdate=6 May 2012| newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 November 1998}}</ref> and subsequently featured on that film's [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] releases.<ref>{{cite news|title=The $152 Million Hit Movie That Broke All Thanksgiving Box Office Records |url=http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/news/19990129-71143.htm |publisher=Pixar |date=29 January 1999 |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230141634/http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/news/19990129-71143.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n===1998===\n* [[Academy Award]] \u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The 70th Academy Awards (1998) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/70th-winners.html|publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>\n* Anima Mundi Animation Festival \u2013 Best Film x2\n* [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] \u2013 Jan Pinkava \n* [[Annie Award]] \u2013 [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject|Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Florida Film Festival]] \u2013 Best Short\n* World Animation Celebration \u2013 Best 3-D CGI by Professional Jan Pinkava \n* [[Zagreb World Festival of Animated Films]] \u2013 Internet Favourite\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.pixar.com/geris-game}}\n* {{IMDb title|0131409|Geri's Game}}\n* {{tcmdb title|526369|Geri's Game}}\n* {{bcdb title|39006|Geri's Game}}\n\n{{Pixar}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Awards for ''Geri's Game''\n|list=\n{{Academy Award Best Animated Short Film}}\n{{Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s animated short films]]\n[[Category:1990s computer-animated films]]\n[[Category:1997 in chess]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Subject Annie Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films about chess]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films without speech]]\n[[Category:Pixar short films]]\n[[Category:Disney animated short films, 1990s]]\n[[Category:Films about old age]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1997 short film by Jan Pinkava}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = Geri's Game\n| image = Geri's Game poster.jpg\n| alt = Poster for Geri's Game\n| caption = Film poster\n| director = [[Jan Pinkava]]\n| producer = [[Karen Dufilho-Rosen|Karen Dufilho]]\n| writer = Jan Pinkava\n| starring = [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]]\n| music = [[Gus Viseur]]\n| cinematography =\n| editing = Jim Kallett\n| studio = [[Pixar Animation Studios]]\n| distributor = [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]]\n| released = {{film date|1997|11|24|premiere|1998|11|25|with ''[[A Bug's Life]]''|ref1=<ref name=\"TFLPremiere\"/>}}\n| runtime = 5 minutes\n| country = United States\n| budget = \n}}\n'''''Geri's Game''''' is a 1997 American [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] [[short film]] written and directed by [[Jan Pinkava]].

Clark|Jim Clark]], which allowed for more lifelike skin surfaces.<ref name=\"20 years\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Subdivision Surfaces in Character Animation|url=http://graphics.pixar.com/library/Geri/paper.pdf|website=graphics.pixar.com|accessdate=14 April 2015}}</ref> \n\nPreviously, most 3D character surfaces were crafted using several [[non-uniform rational B-spline]]s (NURBS) that had to be \"stitched\" together, which made for less expressive movement and caused models to frequently tear. The use of subdivision surfacing, which renders a character's skin as one large surface, allowed for smoother object movement, as well as more intricate detail. DeRose had been working on the technology at the [[University of Washington]], and had already brought subdivision surfaces to [[CAD]] makers, who were ultimately unconvinced, and held their faith in NURBS, before bringing it to Pixar, which was much more receptive.<ref name=\"New Face\" /> \n\nOn the clothing side, after toiling endlessly, Kass managed to create a system which could emulate/simulate the movement of cloth, at which point the team realized that the [[suit jacket]] they had modeled didn't fit with Geri's movement outside of a default [[T-pose]]. According to Pinkava, [[Steve Jobs]], upon a hearing about the issue, had offered to help him by enlisting [[tailor]] [[Giorgio Armani]] to help them design an outfit for Geri, which he ultimately declined.<ref name=\"20 years\" /> The development of a dynamic cloth simulator made several changes to the way that animators work; for instance, the animation, when completed, needed to be sent to the simulator, which would automatically insert Geri's jacket and calculate its movements, rather than being directly sourced to the [[3D rendering|renderer]] after being finished. Geri also needed to be animated 30 [[Film frame|frames]] in advance in order to get the simulation going, and animators couldn't \"cheat\" by having off-camera body parts go unanimated, as it would affect how the simulating program moved the clothing.<ref name=\"New Face\" /> \n\nLike other Pixar shorts, ''Geri's Game'' contains no [[spoken dialogue]], and so is driven only by the actions and [[Facial expression|expressions]] of its main character. To further push the ability to convey the film's story, extra detail was put into Geri's facial [[Rigging (computer graphics)|rigging]] compared to previous rigging methods, with rigger Paul Aichele giving the character ''hundreds'' of face controls for animators to use.<ref name=\"20 years\" /> These new, more detailed rigging methods went on to be used in ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', which was being worked on at the same time.<ref name=\"20 years\" />\n\n=== Staff ===\nLike previous short films made by Pixar, ''Geri's Game'' was made by a temporary branch of Pixar employees, and was separate from the people working on the studio's feature films. It took roughly a year to produce, according to Pinkava, largely due to the amount of time allotted to developing the [[cloth simulation]].<ref name=\"20 years\" /> While the short was being made, most of Pixar Studios was preoccupied with making ''A Bug's Life''. Despite this, there were 18 different animators<ref name=\"New Face\" /> that worked on the project (including Pixar storywriter [[Pete Docter]], who contributed a few scenes out of sheer interest<ref name=\"20 years\" />). Despite being preoccupied directing ''A Bug's Life'', [[John Lasseter]] suggested adding a scene in which Geri checks to make sure he's alright after seeing his alter ego stage a heart attack and keel over; Lasseter physically staged out the entire scene to Pinkava.<ref name=\"20 years\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Geri's Game'' premiered on November 24, 1997 at [[Laemmle Theatres|Laemmle's]] Monica Theater in [[Santa Monica, California]].<ref name=TFLPremiere>{{cite news|title=Question: Where Can You Get a Glimpse of the Future of Animation?; Answer: At an Exclusive Screening - From the Makers of 'Toy Story' - Tonight!|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Question%3A+Where+Can+You+Get+a+Glimpse+of+the+Future+of+Animation%3F%3B...-a020009689|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The Free Library|date=November 24, 1997|author=Pixar Animation Studios}}</ref> It was also attached to the theatrical release of Pixar's second feature film, ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', in 1998,<ref name=\"Bug\">{{cite news| last= Maslin| first= Janet| title= A Bug's Life (1998)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C02E7DA1639F936A15752C1A96E958260|accessdate=6 May 2012| newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 November 1998}}</ref> and subsequently featured on that film's [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] releases.<ref>{{cite news|title=The $152 Million Hit Movie That Broke All Thanksgiving Box Office Records |url=http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/news/19990129-71143.htm |publisher=Pixar |date=29 January 1999 |accessdate=May 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230141634/http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/press_box/news/19990129-71143.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n===1998===\n* [[Academy Award]] \u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The 70th Academy Awards (1998) Nominees and Winners|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/70th-winners.html|publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>\n* Anima Mundi Animation Festival \u2013 Best Film x2\n* [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival]] \u2013 Jan Pinkava \n* [[Annie Award]] \u2013 [[Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject|Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Short Subject]]\n* [[Florida Film Festival]] \u2013 Best Short\n* World Animation Celebration \u2013 Best 3-D CGI by Professional Jan Pinkava \n* [[Zagreb World Festival of Animated Films]] \u2013 Internet Favourite\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.pixar.com/geris-game}}\n* {{IMDb title|0131409|Geri's Game}}\n* {{tcmdb title|526369|Geri's Game}}\n* {{bcdb title|39006|Geri's Game}}\n\n{{Pixar}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title= Awards for ''Geri's Game''\n|list=\n{{Academy Award Best Animated Short Film}}\n{{Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:1997 films]]\n[[Category:1997 animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1990s animated short films]]\n[[Category:1990s computer-animated films]]\n[[Category:1997 in chess]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Subject Annie Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films about chess]]\n[[Category:Films set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Films without speech]]\n[[Category:Pixar short films]]\n[[Category:Disney animated short films, 1990s]]\n[[Category:Films about old age]]\n", "name_user": "Srennef", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected name of the baby character", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geri%27s_Game"}

The first principle of population dynamics is widely regarded as the exponential law of [[Malthus]], as modeled by the [[Malthusian growth model]]. The early period was dominated by [[demography|demographic]] studies such as the work of [[Benjamin Gompertz]] and [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Verhulst]] in the early 19th century, who refined and adjusted the Malthusian demographic model.\n\nA more general model formulation was proposed by [[F.J. Richards]] in 1959, further expanded by [[Simon Hopkins]], in which the models of Gompertz, Verhulst and also [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] are covered as special cases of the general formulation. The [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equation|Lotka\u2013Volterra predator-prey equations]] are another famous example, as well as the alternative [[Arditi\u2013Ginzburg equations]]. The [[computer game]] ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'', ''[[Sim Earth]]'' and the [[MMORPG]] [[Ultima Online]], among others, tried to [[computer simulation|simulate]] some of these population dynamics.\n\nIn the past 30 years, population dynamics has been complemented by [[evolutionary game theory]], developed first by [[John Maynard Smith]]. Under these dynamics, evolutionary biology concepts may take a deterministic mathematical form. Population dynamics overlap with another active area of research in mathematical biology: [[Mathematical modelling in epidemiology|mathematical epidemiology]], the study of infectious disease affecting populations. Various models of viral spread have been proposed and analyzed, and provide important results that may be applied to health policy decisions.\n\n== Intrinsic rate of increase ==\nThe rate at which a population increases in size if there are no density-dependent forces regulating the population is known as the ''intrinsic rate of increase''. It is\n\n: <math>\\dfrac{dN}{dt} \\dfrac{1}{N} = r</math>\n\nwhere  the [[derivative]] <math>dN / dt </math> is the rate of increase of the population, ''N'' is the population size, and ''r'' is the intrinsic rate of increase. Thus ''r'' is the maximum theoretical rate of increase of a population per individual \u2013 that is, the maximum population growth rate. The concept is commonly used in insect population biology to determine how environmental factors affect the rate at which pest populations increase.

Usually refers to the age a fish can be caught and counted in nets.\n*[[Population growth rate]], which measures the growth of individuals in size and length. More important in fisheries, where population is often measured in biomass.\n*[[Mortality rate|Mortality]], which includes harvest mortality and natural mortality. Natural mortality includes non-human predation, disease and old age.\n\nIf ''N''<sub>1</sub> is the number of individuals at time 1 then\n:::: <math> N_1 = N_0 + B - D + I - E </math>\nwhere ''N''<sub>0</sub> is the number of individuals at time 0, ''B'' is the number of individuals born, ''D'' the number that died, ''I'' the number that immigrated, and ''E'' the number that emigrated between time 0 and time 1.\n\nIf we measure these rates over many time intervals, we can determine how a population's density changes over time. Immigration and emigration are present, but are usually not measured.\n\nAll of these are measured to determine the harvestable surplus, which is the number of individuals that can be harvested from a population without affecting long-term population stability or average population size. The harvest within the harvestable surplus is termed \"compensatory\" mortality, where the harvest deaths are substituted for the deaths that would have occurred naturally. Harvest above that level is termed \"additive\" mortality, because it adds to the number of deaths that would have occurred naturally. These terms are not necessarily judged as \"good\" and \"bad,\" respectively, in population management. For example, a fish & game agency might aim to reduce the size of a deer population through additive mortality. Bucks might be targeted to increase buck competition, or does might be targeted to reduce reproduction and thus overall population size.\n\nFor the management of many fish and other wildlife populations, the goal is often to achieve the largest possible long-run sustainable harvest, also known as [[maximum sustainable yield]] (or MSY). Given a population dynamic model, such as any of the ones above, it is possible to calculate the population size that produces the largest harvestable surplus at equilibrium.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mathematical bioeconomics : the optimal management of renewable resources|last=Clark|first=Colin|publisher=Wiley|year=1990|isbn=978-0471508830|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicalbioe0002clar}}{{pn|date=November 2017}}</ref> While the use of population dynamic models along with statistics and optimization to set harvest limits for fish and game is controversial among scientists,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/icesjms/fss192 |title=Maximum sustained yield: A policy disguised as science |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=245\u201350 |year=2013 |last1=Finley |first1=C |last2=Oreskes |first2=N |doi-access=free }}</ref> it has been shown to be more effective than the use of human judgment in computer experiments where both incorrect models and natural resource management students competed to maximize yield in two hypothetical fisheries.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/15-1295 |pmid=27755756 |title=Human judgment vs. Quantitative models for the management of ecological resources |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=1553\u20131565 |year=2016 |last1=Holden |first1=Matthew H |last2=Ellner |first2=Stephen P |arxiv=1603.04518 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/sometimes-even-bad-models-make-better-decisions-than-people-4956bade3990#.qv2oz7gd2 |title=Sometimes, Even Bad Models Make Better Decisions Than People|last=Standard|first=Pacific |date=2016-03-11 |newspaper=Pacific Standard|access-date=2017-01-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  To give an example of a non-intuitive result, fisheries produce more fish when there is a nearby [[refuge (ecology)|refuge]] from human predation in the form of a [[nature reserve]], resulting in higher catches than if the whole area was open to fishing.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10867-013-9329-5 |pmid=23949368 |pmc=3758828 |title=An ecological perspective on marine reserves in prey\u2013predator dynamics |journal=Journal of Biological Physics |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=749\u201376 |year=2013 |last1=Chakraborty |first1=Kunal |last2=Das |first2=Kunal |last3=Kar |first3=T.

With the use of [[evolutionary game theory]], population games are broadly implemented for different industrial and daily-life contexts. Mostly used in multiple-input-multiple-output ([[MIMO]]) systems, although they can be adapted for use in single-input-single-output ([[Single-input single-output system|SISO]]) systems. Some examples of applications are military campaigns, resource allocation for [[Water supply network|water distribution]], [[Dispatchable generation|dispatch of distributed generators]], lab experiments, transport problems, communication problems, among others.  Furthermore, with the adequate contextualization of industrial problems, population dynamics can be an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for control-related problems.

Given a population dynamic model, such as any of the ones above, it is possible to calculate the population size that produces the largest harvestable surplus at equilibrium.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mathematical bioeconomics : the optimal management of renewable resources|last=Clark|first=Colin|publisher=Wiley|year=1990|isbn=978-0471508830|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicalbioe0002clar}}{{pn|date=November 2017}}</ref> While the use of population dynamic models along with statistics and optimization to set harvest limits for fish and game is controversial among scientists,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/icesjms/fss192 |title=Maximum sustained yield: A policy disguised as science |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=245\u201350 |year=2013 |last1=Finley |first1=C |last2=Oreskes |first2=N |doi-access=free }}</ref> it has been shown to be more effective than the use of human judgment in computer experiments where both incorrect models and natural resource management students competed to maximize yield in two hypothetical fisheries.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/15-1295 |pmid=27755756 |title=Human judgment vs. Quantitative models for the management of ecological resources |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=1553\u20131565 |year=2016 |last1=Holden |first1=Matthew H |last2=Ellner |first2=Stephen P |arxiv=1603.04518 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/sometimes-even-bad-models-make-better-decisions-than-people-4956bade3990#.qv2oz7gd2 |title=Sometimes, Even Bad Models Make Better Decisions Than People|last=Standard|first=Pacific |date=2016-03-11 |newspaper=Pacific Standard|access-date=2017-01-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  To give an example of a non-intuitive result, fisheries produce more fish when there is a nearby [[refuge (ecology)|refuge]] from human predation in the form of a [[nature reserve]], resulting in higher catches than if the whole area was open to fishing.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10867-013-9329-5 |pmid=23949368 |pmc=3758828 |title=An ecological perspective on marine reserves in prey\u2013predator dynamics |journal=Journal of Biological Physics |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=749\u201376 |year=2013 |last1=Chakraborty |first1=Kunal |last2=Das |first2=Kunal |last3=Kar |first3=T.

With the use of [[evolutionary game theory]], population games are broadly implemented for different industrial and daily-life contexts. Mostly used in multiple-input-multiple-output ([[MIMO]]) systems, although they can be adapted for use in single-input-single-output ([[Single-input single-output system|SISO]]) systems. Some examples of applications are military campaigns, resource allocation for [[Water supply network|water distribution]], [[Dispatchable generation|dispatch of distributed generators]], lab experiments, transport problems, communication problems, among others.  Furthermore, with the adequate contextualization of industrial problems, population dynamics can be an efficient and easy-to-implement solution for control-related problems. Multiple academic research has been and is continuously carried out.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Delayed density dependence]]\n* [[Demography]]\n* [[Holocene extinction]]\n* [[Human overpopulation]]\n* [[Lotka-Volterra equations]]\n* [[Minimum viable population]]\n* [[Maximum sustainable yield]]\n* [[Nicholson\u2013Bailey model]]\n* [[Overshoot (population)]]\n* [[Pest insect population dynamics]]\n* [[Population cycle]]\n* [[Population dynamics of fisheries]]\n* [[Population ecology]]\n* [[Population genetics]]\n* [[Population modeling]]\n* [[Ricker model]]\n* [[r/K selection theory|''r''/''K'' selection theory]]\n* [[Sigmoid curve]]\n* [[Societal collapse]]\n* [[System dynamics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina.

An example of such a flaw was found in OpenSSL that allowed the attacker to negotiate the use of a lower version of TLS between the client and server. This is one of the most common types of downgrade attacks. Another example is intercepting web traffic and redirecting the user from the secure, HTTPS version of a website to an unencrypted HTTP version.\n\n==Attack==\nDowngrade attacks are often implemented as part of a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] (MITM), and may be used as a way of enabling a [[cryptographic attack]] that might not be possible otherwise.

It was inscribed in the [[World Heritage Site]] in 2007 as part of the [[Rainforests of the Atsinanana]].\n\n==History==\nThe importance of the area was noted by explorers in the early 20th century and in 1927 the central part of the mountain range was declared a \u2033Strict Nature Reserve\u2033. During the early 1990s the Malagasy Environmental Action Plan introduced the idea of Madagascar taking ownership of the environmental agenda, rather than donors, and in 1999 the area became a National Park.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Razafindralambo|first1=Guy|last2=Gaylord|first2=Lisa|title=Madagascar: National Environmental Action Plan|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Malagasy+Environmental+Action+Plan&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b&gfe_rd=cr&ei=WOMVWJm6O6j38AeAu4Qg|accessdate=30 October 2016|pages=75\u201382}}</ref><ref name=\"travel\">{{cite web|title=Andringitra National Park|url=http://www.travelmadagascar.org/PARKS/Andringitra-National-Park.html|website=Travel Madagascar|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref> In 2007 the park became part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana World Heritage Site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nomination of natural, mixed and cultural properties to the world heritage list \u2013 Rainforests of the Atsinanana|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/1307|website=UNESCO World Heritage|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe reserve covers {{convert|31160|ha}} covering much of the granite massif of the Andringitra mountains which rise above plains.

The eastern flank of the massif is covered with humid forest, and humid grassland and scrub in the higher areas. On the western flank there is relatively dry forest. There are over one thousand species of plants, one hundred species of birds, and fifty-five species of frogs are known to inhabit the park.<ref name=\"travel\"/>\n\nThere are over fifty species of mammals, including thirteen species of [[lemur]].

The park was established in 1999 and is managed by the [[Madagascar National Parks Association]]. It was inscribed in the [[World Heritage Site]] in 2007 as part of the [[Rainforests of the Atsinanana]].\n\n==History==\nThe importance of the area was noted by explorers in the early 20th century and in 1927 the central part of the mountain range was declared a \u2033Strict Nature Reserve\u2033. During the early 1990s the Malagasy Environmental Action Plan introduced the idea of Madagascar taking ownership of the environmental agenda, rather than donors, and in 1999 the area became a National Park.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Razafindralambo|first1=Guy|last2=Gaylord|first2=Lisa|title=Madagascar: National Environmental Action Plan|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Malagasy+Environmental+Action+Plan&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b&gfe_rd=cr&ei=WOMVWJm6O6j38AeAu4Qg|accessdate=30 October 2016|pages=75\u201382}}</ref><ref name=\"travel\">{{cite web|title=Andringitra National Park|url=http://www.travelmadagascar.org/PARKS/Andringitra-National-Park.html|website=Travel Madagascar|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref> In 2007 the park became part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana World Heritage Site.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nomination of natural, mixed and cultural properties to the world heritage list \u2013 Rainforests of the Atsinanana|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/1307|website=UNESCO World Heritage|accessdate=30 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe reserve covers {{convert|31160|ha}} covering much of the granite massif of the Andringitra mountains which rise above plains.

It is surrounded by a wall built in the mid-12th century by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. The wall was originally 2,200 meters in length, 50 meters in width and 15 meters in height. The remains of the wall are located in the eastern and southern parts of the national park.\n\nThe site contains archeological remains of the different civilizations that lived in the area, including [[Canaanites]], [[Philistines]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Muslims]] and [[Crusaders]]. Roman remains include marble and granite [[column]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s, a Roman [[basilica]] and Roman [[statue]]s.

Using a medieval Italian manuscript as her guide, she persuaded the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities to allow her to excavate the site in search of a large hoard of gold coins allegedly buried under the ruins of the Ashkelon mosque. The governor of [[Jaffa]], Abu Nabbut (Father of the Cudgel) was ordered to accompany her. On the second day of digging, the lower foundation walls of the mosque were discovered at a depth of three or four feet, along with fragments of marble pillars, a Corinthian capital, a faience vessel, and two small pottery phials. Further exploration revealed several distinct phases in the history of the structure, leading to the conclusion that the site had originally been a pagan temple converted into a church and then a mosque. Stanhope's main find was a seven-foot headless marble statue, which was smashed and thrown into the sea.<ref name=bar>\n{{cite journal |last=Asher Silberman |first= Neil |date=July\u2013August 1984|title=Restoring the Reputation of Lady Hester Lucy Stanhope  |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review  |volume=10 |issue=4 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem began excavations at Ashkelon, focusing on the same columns and semi-circular wall explored by Lady Hester. They dated the earliest structure, featuring Corinthian columns and a row of pedestals, to [[Herod the Great|Herod]]. The foot and arm of a colossal marble statue were found at this level.

It is surrounded by a wall built in the mid-12th century by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. The wall was originally 2,200 meters in length, 50 meters in width and 15 meters in height. The remains of the wall are located in the eastern and southern parts of the national park.\n\nThe site contains archeological remains of the different civilizations that lived in the area, including [[Canaanites]], [[Philistines]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Muslims]] and [[Crusaders]]. Roman remains include marble and granite [[column]]s and [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s, a Roman [[basilica]] and Roman [[statue]]s. The site also features a [[Middle Bronze Age]] [[gate]] with the world's earliest [[arch]], dating back to approximately 1850 BCE. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Archaeology==\nIn 1815, [[Lady Hester Stanhope]]'s expedition to Ashkelon constituted the first modern archaeological excavation in Palestine. Using a medieval Italian manuscript as her guide, she persuaded the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities to allow her to excavate the site in search of a large hoard of gold coins allegedly buried under the ruins of the Ashkelon mosque. The governor of [[Jaffa]], Abu Nabbut (Father of the Cudgel) was ordered to accompany her. On the second day of digging, the lower foundation walls of the mosque were discovered at a depth of three or four feet, along with fragments of marble pillars, a Corinthian capital, a faience vessel, and two small pottery phials. Further exploration revealed several distinct phases in the history of the structure, leading to the conclusion that the site had originally been a pagan temple converted into a church and then a mosque. Stanhope's main find was a seven-foot headless marble statue, which was smashed and thrown into the sea.<ref name=bar>\n{{cite journal |last=Asher Silberman |first= Neil |date=July\u2013August 1984|title=Restoring the Reputation of Lady Hester Lucy Stanhope  |journal=Biblical Archaeology Review  |volume=10 |issue=4 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1921, the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem began excavations at Ashkelon, focusing on the same columns and semi-circular wall explored by Lady Hester. They dated the earliest structure, featuring Corinthian columns and a row of pedestals, to [[Herod the Great|Herod]]. The foot and arm of a colossal marble statue were found at this level.
