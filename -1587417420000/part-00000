It is a ''[[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]'' of [[Duino-Aurisina]], a municipality (''[[comune]]'') of the [[Province of Trieste]] in the [[Friuli\u2013Venezia Giulia]] region of northeastern [[Italy]]. The settlement, picturesquely situated on the steep [[Karst]] cliffs of the [[Gulf of Trieste]], is known for [[Duino Castle]], perpetuated by the poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] in his ''[[Duino Elegies]]''.\n\n==Name==\nDuino was attested in historical sources as ''Duino'' in 1139, ''Dewin'' in the 13th century, and ''Tybein'' {{circa}} 1370, among various other forms of the name. Although equivalents of the Slovene name appear in various Slavic languages (cf. [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[Dev\u00edn]]'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[Dziewin, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Dziewin]]'', etc., all ultimately derived from Slavic ''*d\u011bva'' 'girl'), the name of this settlement is not originally Slavic. Instead, it derives from [[Romance languages|Romance]] ''tub\u012bnum'' < Latin ''tubus'' '(water) pipe'.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Snoj |first1=Marko |title=Etimolo\u0161ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen |date=2009 |publisher=Modrijan |location=Ljubljana |page=109}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Franco Crevatin |editor1-last=Corbato |editor1-first=Carlo |title=Studi Monfalconesi e Duinati Atti della giornata di studio di Monfalcone, 3. aprile 1976 |date=1976 |publisher=Arti grafiche friulane |location=Udine |pages=23\u201327 |format=Antichit\u00e0 altoadriatiche 10 |chapter=Il nome di Duino|url=https://www.openstarts.units.it/bitstream/10077/21294/1/02-Crevatin_23-27.pdf|accessdate = January 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Peninsula near castle Duino.JPG|thumb|left|Old Castle ruins]]\nThe Lords of Duino, [[vassal]]s of the [[Patria del Friuli|Patriarchs of Aquileia]], were first mentioned about 1150. From their ancestral seat, located on a rock high above the Adriatic Sea, they controlled the trade routes running from the city of [[Monfalcone]] along the coast to the [[Istria]]n peninsula. Serving as ''[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' of the [[County of Gorizia|Counts of Gorizia]] and also of their successors, the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] archdukes of [[Inner Austria]], they secured their position in the [[Friuli]] region.\n\nTheir Old Castle is today in ruins, while the newer Duino Castle, dating back to 1389, is inhabited to this day and can be visited by tourists. Below the ruins of the ancient castle there lies a white rock projecting into the sea, the ''Dama Bianca'', which resembles a veiled woman and gave origin to many gothic legends. Held by the descendants of the [[Della Torre]] (''[[Thurn und Taxis|Thurn]]'') noble family from the 16th century onwards, the estates were inherited by Marie von Thurn und Taxis (1855\u20131934) in 1893.

It is a ''[[hamlet]]'' of [[Duino-Aurisina]], a municipality (''[[comune]]'') of the [[Province of Trieste]] in the [[Friuli\u2013Venezia Giulia]] region of northeastern [[Italy]]. The settlement, picturesquely situated on the steep [[Karst]] cliffs of the [[Gulf of Trieste]], is known for [[Duino Castle]], perpetuated by the poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] in his ''[[Duino Elegies]]''.\n\n==Name==\nDuino was attested in historical sources as ''Duino'' in 1139, ''Dewin'' in the 13th century, and ''Tybein'' {{circa}} 1370, among various other forms of the name. Although equivalents of the Slovene name appear in various Slavic languages (cf. [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[Dev\u00edn]]'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''[[Dziewin, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Dziewin]]'', etc., all ultimately derived from Slavic ''*d\u011bva'' 'girl'), the name of this settlement is not originally Slavic.

From their ancestral seat, located on a rock high above the Adriatic Sea, they controlled the trade routes running from the city of [[Monfalcone]] along the coast to the [[Istria]]n peninsula. Serving as ''[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' of the [[County of Gorizia|Counts of Gorizia]] and also of their successors, the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] archdukes of [[Inner Austria]], they secured their position in the [[Friuli]] region.\n\nTheir Old Castle is today in ruins, while the newer Duino Castle, dating back to 1389, is inhabited to this day and can be visited by tourists. Below the ruins of the ancient castle there lies a white rock projecting into the sea, the ''Dama Bianca'', which resembles a veiled woman and gave origin to many gothic legends. Held by the descendants of the [[Della Torre]] (''[[Thurn und Taxis|Thurn]]'') noble family from the 16th century onwards, the estates were inherited by Marie von Thurn und Taxis (1855\u20131934) in 1893. A patron of the arts and socialite, she accommodated Rainer Maria Rilke at Duino Castle from 1911\nto 1912 and he dedicated his ''Duino Elegies'' to her.

Four rockets that failed to launch were found in their silos. The Iraqis sent the pickup to U.S. forces where, according to two unidentified U.S. officials, U.S. investigators found evidence in the truck that helped attribute it to Kata'ib Hezbollah.

Iraqi officials suggested that the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), a [[Sunni]] terror group, may have orchestrated it given that the rockets were launched from a Sunni part of Kirkuk notorious for attacks and executions by the group, which would have also made the area hostile territory for a Shiite militia like Khata'ib Hezbollah, and the fact that ISIL had carried out three attacks relatively close to the base in the ten days before the attack on K-1. The ''Times'' report also highlighted discrepancies with the Iraqi and U.S. accounts of the attack, including the amount of rockets fired; the U.S. said 31 rockets were fired, several Iraqi officers at K-1 said as many as 16 were fired, and Gen. Adnan said 11 were fired.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://archive.is/szFcC#selection-789.88-799.0|title=Was U.S. Wrong About Attack That Nearly Started a War With Iran?|date=6 February 2020|accessdate=8 February 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref> \n\nBy February 2020, the U.S. had yet to share its intelligence with Iraqi officials that it says linked the attack to the militia.

The air base is one of many Iraqi military bases that host [[Operation Inherent Resolve]] (OIR) personnel and, according to the coalition, was attacked by more than 30 rockets.

Four rockets that failed to launch were found in their silos. The Iraqis sent the pickup to U.S. forces where, according to two unidentified U.S. officials, U.S. investigators found evidence in the truck that helped attribute it to Kata'ib Hezbollah. The officials also cited separate communications intercepts that reportedly showed the group's involvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/officials-us-civilian-contractor-killed-attack-iraq-base |title= Officials: US Civilian Contractor Killed in Attack on Iraq Base.}}</ref><ref name=NYT/> \n\nOn 6 February 2020, over a month after the attack, ''The New York Times'' reported that Iraqi military and intelligence officials said they had no direct evidence to prove that Kata'ib Hezbollah, which has not had a presence in Kirkuk Province since 2014, was involved in the attack. Iraqi officials suggested that the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), a [[Sunni]] terror group, may have orchestrated it given that the rockets were launched from a Sunni part of Kirkuk notorious for attacks and executions by the group, which would have also made the area hostile territory for a Shiite militia like Khata'ib Hezbollah, and the fact that ISIL had carried out three attacks relatively close to the base in the ten days before the attack on K-1. The ''Times'' report also highlighted discrepancies with the Iraqi and U.S. accounts of the attack, including the amount of rockets fired; the U.S. said 31 rockets were fired, several Iraqi officers at K-1 said as many as 16 were fired, and Gen. Adnan said 11 were fired.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://archive.is/szFcC#selection-789.88-799.0|title=Was U.S. Wrong About Attack That Nearly Started a War With Iran?|date=6 February 2020|accessdate=8 February 2020|work=The New York Times}}</ref> \n\nBy February 2020, the U.S. had yet to share its intelligence with Iraqi officials that it says linked the attack to the militia.

{"title_page": "Workers' Party (Singapore)", "text_new": "the workers party is cool.Black people is a skin group-based classification for specific people with a mid to dark brown complexion. Not all black people have dark skin; however, in certain countries, often in socially based systems of racial classification in the Western World, the term black is used to describe persons who are perceived as dark-skinned compared to other populations. It is mostly used for the people of Sub-Saharan African descent and the indigenous peoples of Oceania, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Generally speaking, indigenous African societies do not use the term \"Black\" as a racial identity outside of influences brought by Western culture or colonization.\n\nDifferent societies apply different criteria regarding who is classified \"black\", and these social constructs have changed over time. In a number of countries, societal variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for \"blackness\" vary. In the United Kingdom, \"black\" was historically equivalent with \"person of color\", a general term for non-European peoples. In other regions such as Australasia, settlers applied the term \"black\" or it was used by local populations with different histories and ancestral backgrounds.\n\nFor many other individuals, communities and countries, \"black\" is also perceived as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result is neither used nor defined, especially in African cultures with little to no colonial history. Some have pointed out that labeling people groups \"black\" is erroneous as the people described as \"black\" have a brown skin color.[1]\n\nAfrica\n\nAsia\n\nEurope\n\nOceania\n\nNorth America\n\nSouth America\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nLast edited 4 days ago by Llakew18\nRELATED ARTICLES\nMulatto\nHistorical racial classification\nQuadroon\na person with one quarter African and three quarters European ancestry\nAfro-Brazilians\nracial or ethnic group of Brazilians with African ancestry\n\n==Ideology==\nThe Workers' Party believes in a socialist Singapore that must go beyond elitism and materialism and for Singapore to seek for a \"First World Parliament\", where the government is held accountable for issues concerning Singaporeans and where Singaporeans are able to exercise their rights in political participation.\n\nIn general, the Workers\u2019 Party's ideology is [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]], with further [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] factions.

On 3 November that year, Marshall went on to found Workers' Party.\n\n=== 1957-1961: City Council Elections ===\nFollowing the adoption of the Rendel and McNeice Commission recommendations, the six wards in the city area consisting of 18 elected seats was carved into 32. In 1957, the pro-communists backed two new entrants, the Workers' Party and the [[People's Action Party]], which later went on to become the long-running governing party in Singapore. Their electoral debut was mostly a success as the party elected four members (out of the five contested) to the City Council; however, in 1958, Kallang ward incumbent Chang Yuen Tong resigned, and subsequently lost their seat to PAP as a result of their by-election defeat.\n\n=== 1959-1965: Legislative Assembly ===\nThe party's first Legislative election in [[1959 Singaporean general election|1959]] did not see success unlike the 1957 City Election, as Marshall lost his [[Cairnhill Single Member Constituency|Cairnhill constituency]] to former Chief Minister and [[Singapore People's Alliance]] leader [[Lim Yew Hock]], and the WP did not win any of the three contested seats. That same election also saw PAP became the majority party for the very first time.\n\nIn May 1961, a by-election was precipitated due to the passing of  [[Anson Single Member Constituency|Anson constituency]]'s incumbent MP Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff. Marshall then went to declare his candidacy with the statement:\n\n<blockquote>\"... effective, vigorous and constructive opposition and to protect them against the arrogant dictatorship of unchallenged power. Marshall was also eager to assist the workers to prevent the political enslavement of trade unions and to revive the struggle against colonialism in seeking complete independence preferably within and, if necessary, without the Federation.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 15 July, Marshall won the by-election and subsequently returned to the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]].\n\nDavid Marshall, as Chairman of the party, made his views known on merger at public rallies and radio talks. Marshall's stand on merger was that:\n<blockquote>\"... Singapore should seek equal privileges and rights for its citizens in the new federation but surrender autonomy in education and labour, since different policies in these crucial areas would undermine the stability of Malaysia in the long run. He further maintained that if Singapore could not negotiate for a complete merger, she should seek independence on her own, a proposition which drew gales of laughter from the Legislative Chamber at that time. Marshall's strongest objection to the White Paper merger terms was on the point of citizenship and the implications of citizenship in the new federation. He saw the provisions as denying the Singapore citizen who was a federal national, the right of political participation in terms of being allowed to organise or contest in an election in the other states of the Federation. Singaporeans would in his view, be no more than favoured foreigners in the Federation, permitted to live and work there without visas, but also without the important constitutional guarantees that immigration barriers would not be raised against them.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe party concerned Marshall's issue of common citizenship and the rights of Singapore citizens when they joined the Federation. Marshall later stated on 20 August 1962:\n\n<blockquote>\"... issued a statement to advise his Executive Council and party members to accept the White Paper proposals for merger, but continued to oppose the Government on the referendum urging the people to cast blank votes on the grounds that it was undemocratically conducted.\"</blockquote>\n\n===1965-1986: Post Independence, First Opposition MP===\nOn 9 August 1965, Singapore was declared as an independent sovereign state, and the Legislative was reformed as [[Parliament of Singapore]]. 1968 was the first post-independence election, which saw PAP winning every one of 58 contested seats (51 by a walkover, and the other seven on polling day), due to the election boycotting of the main opposition party at the time, the [[Barisan Sosialis]], leading to the mass arrests of most of its leadership since 1963.\n\nHaving become a small and fairly insignificant party by the late-1960s, the party saw a rejuvenation by recruiting a group of lawyers, including [[J.B. Jeyaretnam]], who became the party's [[Secretary-General]]. Despite fielding a large slate of candidates in succeeding elections, the ruling PAP still managed to retain the monopoly by winning every contested seats for the next three general elections (including by-elections) until 1981.\n\nOn 13 October 1981, [[Devan Nair]] vacated his Anson seat to assume his role as the nation's third [[President of Singapore|President]], and precipitated the [[1981 Anson by-election|by-election]]; on 31 October, the party's victory was noted as historic as candidate Jeyaretnam became the first opposition MP-elect to be elected in Parliament with 51.9% (7,012) of the valid votes cast, beating PAP's [[Pang Kim Hin]]'s 47.1% (6,359) and a third candidate's 1.0% (131), marking the first time since 1961 the Anson electorate voted the WP into the assembly. Jeyaretnam then went on to held the constituency in the [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 elections]] with an increased margin of 56.8%.\n\n{{Off topic|date=July 2014}}\n\nHowever, two months later, Jeyaretnam was charged with falsely accounting the party's funds. In 1986, Senior District Judge Michael Khoo found Jeyaretnam innocent of all charges but one. The prosecution later appealed a retrial to be held in a different district court, which saw Jeyaretnam found guilty on all charges and resulted in his disqualification, though he subsequently remained as the party's Secretary-General, he was also barred from standing in elections until 1991.<ref name=\"SW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-window.org/1028judi.htm|title=The politics of judicial institutions in Singapore|year=1997|work=[[Francis Seow]]|access-date=3 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922201015/http://www.singapore-window.org/1028judi.htm|archive-date=22 September 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===1987-1991: Re-entry into Parliament===\nIn 1987, some members were among a group of 22 people arrested by Singapore's [[Internal Security Department (Singapore)|Internal Security Department]] as part of Operation Spectrum, accused of being [[Marxist]]s. They were released on condition that they kept out of politics.\n\nPrior to the [[1988 Singaporean general election|1988 general elections]], the party merged [[Barisan Sosialis]] and the Singapore United Front. The party did not win any constituency but came very close to winning the [[Eunos Group Representation Constituency]] (which was then a three-member constituency), which the party's team (consist of [[Francis Seow]] (a former head of the Bar Society who had become a thorn in the government's side and had briefly been detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] prior to the general election), [[Lee Siew Choh]] (a former chairman of the Barisan Sosialis and former PAP Assemblyman from 1959 to 1961) and Mohd Khalit bin Mohd Baboo) scored 49.1%; only one opposition MP was returned to Parliament ([[Chiam See Tong]] of the [[Singapore Democratic Party]]), and since the team garnered the highest percentage of the vote secured by losing opposition candidates at the election, the party was eligible to nominate two members of its team become [[Non-constituency Member of Parliament|Non-constituency MPs]]. The party had refused to nominate NCMPs in the past, but this time they nominated Lee and Seow to become NCMPs. While Lee took his post and became the first NCMP, Seow did not accept the offer after he was accused of espionage and fled to the United States shortly after the election. In Parliament, Lee took up several issues, including the Internal Security Act, living costs and welfare.\n\nJeyaretnam was sued for [[slander]] by the Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] for comments he made at an election rally in 1988, and lost; Jeyaretnam was ordered to pay Lee damages of [[Singapore dollar|S$]]260,000 including costs.\n\n===1991-1997: WP under Low Thia Khiang===\nAt the [[1991 Singaporean general election|1991 general election]], [[Low Thia Khiang]], who was then the party's Organising Secretary, and a previously-contested candidate under the [[Tiong Bahru GRC]] in his debut in 1988, was elected as the MP for [[Hougang SMC]]; defeating PAP's incumbent Tang Guan Seng by 10,621 votes (52.8%) to 9,487 (47.2%). The party had since held on Hougang SMC after the election.\n\nDuring the election campaign, one of the WP's candidates in Eunos GRC, [[Jufrie Mahmood]], drew particular fire from the PAP and then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]], accusing him of being a [[Malay people|Malay]] [[chauvinist]], an accusation Jufrie strongly denied. The party also polled strongly in Eunos GRC, but lost to the PAP's team with 47.6% of the votes to 52.4%; unlike the last election, no NCMPs were offered as the opposition (including Low) elected a combined four seats in parliament. Low became the Assistant Secretary-General following the election; during his tenure, Low was praised by the parliament on his assertiveness, good analytical ability and his willingness to be constructive rather than oppose for the sake of opposing.\n\nA by-election in the [[Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency]] in 1992 was expected to mark the return of Jeyaretnam to electoral politics after his Parliamentary ban had expired; however, the team ultimately did not participate due to one of the candidates turned up late on the nomination day. In 1993, Jeyaretnam and another candidate, Tan Soo Phuan (now a member of [[Democratic Progressive Party (Singapore)|Democratic Progressive Party]]), attempted to seek candidacy in the first-ever [[1993 Singaporean presidential election|presidential election]], but both candidates were denied from granting the Certificate of Eligibility, an item presidential candidates was required to complete their nominations.\n\nIn 1996, Jeyaretnam was sued and paid damages of S$465,000 and S$250,000 in court costs for an article he wrote in an issue of the party's newspaper, ''The Hammer'', calling the PAP's [[Indian people|Indian]] leaders a bunch of stooges. That same year, Lee Siew Choh resigned from the party, citing differences with Jeyaretnam.\n\n===1997-2006: Leader Transition from Jeyaretnam to Low===\nIn the [[1997 Singaporean general election|1997 elections]], Low was re-elected as Hougang MP at the 1997 general election. Besides Low, only one other opposition MP was elected (Chiam See Tong, who left SDP to join the [[Singapore People's Party]]); one NCMP was offered to the WP team for [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]], who polled better than any other opposition losing candidates, with 45.2%; the party selected secretary-general (and candidate) Jeyaretnam as the NCMP, marking his return to the Parliament after 11 years.\n\nDuring the election campaign, another candidate part of the WP's team in Cheng San, lawyer [[Tang Liang Hong]], drew particular attention from the PAP, who accused him of being an anti-Christian and anti-[[Muslim]] [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] chauvinist. Tang, who insisted all he was trying to do was to \"better represent the Chinese community and ask questions on their behalf\", vigorously denied this charge and accused the PAP of trying to win votes by sowing fear into the electorate. Tang also attacked the PAP on the issue of the Hotel Properties Ltd case (which started when the [[Stock Exchange of Singapore]] criticised Hotel Properties Ltd for its \"tardiness\" in disclosing details of sales of its condominium units to directors and their family members).<ref>Ven Sreenivasan and Michelle Low, \"Analysts support SES censure of HPL,\" in: ''Business Times'', 24 April 1996, p. 15</ref>{{efn|name=Tang Liang Hong|Because Singapore's then-[[Senior Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and [[Kwa Geok Choo|his wife]] took discounts while purchasing an apartment in 1996, and younger brother Suan Yew was on the board of directors of the company, these claims raised suspicions of impropriety. Tang made these allegations in a Chinese magazine ''[[Yazhou Zhoukan]]'', which later lost a libel suit filed by Lee Kuan Yew and was ordered to pay damages. Then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]]s [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and [[Tony Tan]], along with former Cabinet Minister [[S. Dhanabalan]] and Heng Chiang Meng, then-President of the Real Estate Developer's Association of Singapore (REDAS), told the House that it was normal practice for developers to cite high list prices and offer customers varying discounts.<br />Warren Fernandez, \"Full details of condo deals revealed,\" ''The Straits Times'', 22 May 1996, p.1}} Lee who had purchased one of the units, claimed that Tang was trying to milk this issue for political capital; the PAP sued Tang for both defamation and branding the PAP leadership as a bunch of liars, for a total of S$13.6 million of damages, and Tang shortly fled to Australia after the election.\n\nPrior to the [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001 election]], Jeyaretnam was discharged from his NCMP seat due to an undischarged bankruptcy (failing to keep up with payments of S$120,000 worth of damages owed from a libel suit brought by then-[[Prime Minister]] Goh Chok Tong and other PAP leaders following comments he had made at an election rally in 1997, but since fulfilled and discharged from bankruptcy on May 2007); Jeyaretnam relinquished his Secretary-General post to Low, which saw the party in bitter acrimony as Jeyaretnam later accused Low of not doing enough to help him pay the damages from the libel suit. In response, Low claimed that he had always looked upon Jeyaretnam as an elder and had done everything possible to help him. Following the renewal, a few members (including Jeyaretnam) left the party, and went to form [[Reform Party (Singapore)|Reform Party]] in 2008, which would be Jeyaretnam's final involvement in politics until his death three months after the founding.\n\nMany observers speculated that with Low at the helm, WP would tone down its more hard-line stance and take on a more [[Centrism|centrist]] outlook at the 2001 election. After Low assumed leadership, Low recruited a series of young members to the party, which include [[James Gomez]], [[Yaw Shin Leong]] and [[Sylvia Lim]] (who would became the party's long-serving (and current) chairperson). Although Low was re-elected as Hougang MP at the 2001 general election, the party's fortunes reached a low as it only contested in two seats, in Hougang and Nee Soon East SMCs and had its entire Aljunied GRC team disqualified on Nomination Day.\n\n===2006-2011: Party's Road to Renewal===\n[[File:Workers party rally.jpg|thumb|A Workers' Party election rally at the [[Serangoon]] Stadium.]]\nWP launched an updated [[manifesto]] in January 2006 entitled \"You Have a Choice\".

The party also polled strongly in the Aljunied GRC, losing to the PAP's team with 43.9% of the vote to 56.1%, allowing the party to elect an NCMP seat by-virtue for their team being best-performing opposition losers, and the party's [[Party Chair|Chairman]] Lim was selected to become its first female NCMP. Another team of young first-time candidates, led by [[Yaw Shin Leong]] in [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency|Ang Mo Kio GRC]] helmed by Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]], garnered a respectable 33.4% or one-third of the votes, slightly higher than the opposition's national average. Combining from all the votes received from the seven constituencies contested by 20 candidates, their popular vote was 38.4%; as compared to the second opposition party, the [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] (the party also fielded the same number of candidates contesting the same number of constituencies), where the party got 32.5%, the party then became the largest opposition for the election, and leader Low succeeded Chiam as the new [[Leader of the Opposition (Singapore)|leader of the opposition]].\n\nDuring campaigning, controversies surrounded to [[James Gomez]], a candidate representing Aljunied GRC, claiming that the Elections Department had lost his minority race candidate's certificate, and was forced to apologise when [[closed-circuit television]] evidence showed that he had placed the form in his briefcase without submitting it. The PAP attacked Gomez for the incident, with Lee Kuan Yew publicly calling him a \"liar\". One day after the election, Gomez was prevented from leaving Singapore on a trip to [[Stockholm]] and questioned by police over whether he had committed criminal intimidation in his dealings with the Elections Department. Gomez was subsequently released after being given a warning, and was allowed travel to Stockholm.\n\n===2011: Party's Breakthrough===\nThe manifesto for the [[2011 Singaporean general election|General Election 2011]] was titled \"Towards a First World Parliament\", which also became their campaign slogan. One key proposal was for more affordable public housing such that [[Housing Development Board]] (HDB) lessees should be able to pay off their mortgage loans within 20 years rather than 30 years. Prior to nomination day (27 April 2011), Low announced that he would vacate his Hougang seat to former Ang Mo Kio GRC candidate Yaw Shin Long, and would contest in Aljunied GRC in the forthcoming election along with Lim and three of his \"A-List\" candidates (Taiwanese-born corporate lawyer [[Chen Show Mao]], law postgraduate and former [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]] [[major]] [[Pritam Singh (Singaporean politician)|Pritam Singh]], and freelance councillor [[Muhamad Faisal Manap]]). The party fielded a total of 23 candidates contesting in eight constituencies, the largest slate since 1988 (WP had the second-largest opposition slate, second only to another opposition party, [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]], which fielded 24 candidates in eight constituencies).\n\nOn 7 May, the team in Aljunied GRC achieved another breakthrough for the party, with the first-ever GRC victory for any opposition party in history, with a score of 54.71% to unseat the PAP team led by then-[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Foreign Minister]] [[George Yeo]] and [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Minister of the Prime Minister's Office]] [[Lim Hwee Hua]]. The Hougang ward was also retained by Yaw with its best performance for the party at 64.80% of the votes (second only to Chiam's score of 69.6% back in 1991), resulting in six seats elected in Parliament. Their party's overall vote was its best performance in history, with 46.58% of the votes combined from the eight constituencies contested (second only to SDP's popular vote of 48.6% in 1991). Additionally, the election of chairwoman Lim, as well as Chen and Manap, became the first female and former NCMP, foreign-born, and Malay opposition MP, respectively, to be elected in Parliament.\n\nDue to an increase of minimum opposition seats from three to nine, the party also won two of the three NCMP seats, which they elect [[Gerald Giam]] and [[Yee Jenn Jong]] (who contested [[East Coast Group Representation Constituency]] and [[Joo Chiat Single Member Constituency]], respectively), bringing a total representation of eight seats, the most for any opposition party in Singapore since independence. Following the elections on 12 June, the party launched its grassroots arm for Aljunied GRC,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_679685.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301210335/http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_679685.html |title=WP sets up Aljunied grassroots body |archivedate=1 March 2012 |publisher=The Straits Times |accessdate=8 October 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> called the Aljunied Constituency Committee.

Since 2011, the Workers' Party has been the only opposition party in Singapore to have elected MPs in Parliament.\n\nThe Workers' Party was founded on 3 November 1957 by Singapore's former [[Chief Minister of Singapore|Chief Minister]], [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]]. In 1981, the party's then-leader [[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam|J. B. Jeyaretnam]] became the first opposition MP to be elected to Parliament since Singapore's independence in 1965, when he defeated the candidate of the governing [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) at a by-election in the constituency of Anson. He was re-elected at the 1984 general election, but subsequently lost his seat in Parliament in 1986 following a conviction for falsely accounting the party's funds, a conviction Jeyaretnam has always maintained was politically motivated. Since the [[1991 Singaporean general election|1991 general election]], the party has held the seat of Hougang. Low Thia Khiang was elected as MP for Hougang in 1991 and re-elected at the [[1997 Singaporean general election|1997]], [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001]] and [[2006 Singaporean general election|2006]] general elections. Low moved to Aljunied GRC for the [[2011 Singaporean general election|2011 general election]] where he led the first team from an opposition party to win a GRC, while [[Yaw Shin Leong]] held the Hougang seat for the party. Yaw was expelled from the party in February 2012, which triggered a [[2012 Hougang by-election|by-election in Hougang]]. The seat was retained by the Workers' Party's candidate, Png Eng Huat. On 12 December 2012, Speaker of Parliament and incumbent PAP MP for Punggol East, [[Michael Palmer (politician)|Michael Palmer]], resigned from his seat.<ref>{{cite news|work=asiaone.com|title=SMSes expose Michael Palmer's affair|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20121213-389445.html|date=15 December 2012|access-date=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218071638/http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20121213-389445.html|archive-date=18 December 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> After the Prime Minister issued the writ of election for the [[2013 Punggol East by-election|Punggol East by-election]], the Workers' Party announced on 14 January 2013 that [[Lee Li Lian]], who stood in Punggol East in the 2011 general election, had been chosen to represent the party. On 26 January 2013, [[Lee Li Lian]] made history as the first woman to win a by-election.<ref>{{cite news|work=Yahoo!

[[Lee Siew Choh]] served as an NCMP from 1988 to 1991. Jeyaretnam returned to Parliament as an NCMP from 1997 to 2001 and Sylvia Lim has served as an NCMP from 2006 to 2011. Two members of the party, [[Gerald Giam]] and [[Yee Jenn Jong]], served as NCMPs between 2011 and 2015. After the 2015 general election, the Workers' Party nominated Dennis Tan Lip Fong, its candidate in [[Fengshan SMC]], as well as [[Leon Perera]] and [[Daniel Goh Pei Siong]], two members of its [[East Coast GRC]] team, to serve as NCMPs in the current parliament.\n\nIn recent years, the Workers' Party's candidates have worn a uniform of light blue shirts while campaigning to represent the party's links with [[working class]] [[blue collar worker|blue-collar]]s.\n\n==Ideology==\nThe Workers' Party believes in a socialist Singapore that must go beyond elitism and materialism and for Singapore to seek for a \"First World Parliament\", where the government is held accountable for issues concerning Singaporeans and where Singaporeans are able to exercise their rights in political participation.\n\nIn general, the Workers\u2019 Party's ideology is [[Centre-left politics|centre-left]], with further [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] factions.

On 3 November that year, Marshall went on to found Workers' Party.\n\n=== 1957-1961: City Council Elections ===\nFollowing the adoption of the Rendel and McNeice Commission recommendations, the six wards in the city area consisting of 18 elected seats was carved into 32. In 1957, the pro-communists backed two new entrants, the Workers' Party and the [[People's Action Party]], which later went on to become the long-running governing party in Singapore. Their electoral debut was mostly a success as the party elected four members (out of the five contested) to the City Council; however, in 1958, Kallang ward incumbent Chang Yuen Tong resigned, and subsequently lost their seat to PAP as a result of their by-election defeat.\n\n=== 1959-1965: Legislative Assembly ===\nThe party's first Legislative election in [[1959 Singaporean general election|1959]] did not see success unlike the 1957 City Election, as Marshall lost his [[Cairnhill Single Member Constituency|Cairnhill constituency]] to former Chief Minister and [[Singapore People's Alliance]] leader [[Lim Yew Hock]], and the WP did not win any of the three contested seats. That same election also saw PAP became the majority party for the very first time.\n\nIn May 1961, a by-election was precipitated due to the passing of  [[Anson Single Member Constituency|Anson constituency]]'s incumbent MP Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff. Marshall then went to declare his candidacy with the statement:\n\n<blockquote>\"... effective, vigorous and constructive opposition and to protect them against the arrogant dictatorship of unchallenged power. Marshall was also eager to assist the workers to prevent the political enslavement of trade unions and to revive the struggle against colonialism in seeking complete independence preferably within and, if necessary, without the Federation.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn 15 July, Marshall won the by-election and subsequently returned to the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]].\n\nDavid Marshall, as Chairman of the party, made his views known on merger at public rallies and radio talks. Marshall's stand on merger was that:\n<blockquote>\"... Singapore should seek equal privileges and rights for its citizens in the new federation but surrender autonomy in education and labour, since different policies in these crucial areas would undermine the stability of Malaysia in the long run. He further maintained that if Singapore could not negotiate for a complete merger, she should seek independence on her own, a proposition which drew gales of laughter from the Legislative Chamber at that time. Marshall's strongest objection to the White Paper merger terms was on the point of citizenship and the implications of citizenship in the new federation. He saw the provisions as denying the Singapore citizen who was a federal national, the right of political participation in terms of being allowed to organise or contest in an election in the other states of the Federation. Singaporeans would in his view, be no more than favoured foreigners in the Federation, permitted to live and work there without visas, but also without the important constitutional guarantees that immigration barriers would not be raised against them.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe party concerned Marshall's issue of common citizenship and the rights of Singapore citizens when they joined the Federation. Marshall later stated on 20 August 1962:\n\n<blockquote>\"... issued a statement to advise his Executive Council and party members to accept the White Paper proposals for merger, but continued to oppose the Government on the referendum urging the people to cast blank votes on the grounds that it was undemocratically conducted.\"</blockquote>\n\n===1965-1986: Post Independence, First Opposition MP===\nOn 9 August 1965, Singapore was declared as an independent sovereign state, and the Legislative was reformed as [[Parliament of Singapore]]. 1968 was the first post-independence election, which saw PAP winning every one of 58 contested seats (51 by a walkover, and the other seven on polling day), due to the election boycotting of the main opposition party at the time, the [[Barisan Sosialis]], leading to the mass arrests of most of its leadership since 1963.\n\nHaving become a small and fairly insignificant party by the late-1960s, the party saw a rejuvenation by recruiting a group of lawyers, including [[J.B. Jeyaretnam]], who became the party's [[Secretary-General]]. Despite fielding a large slate of candidates in succeeding elections, the ruling PAP still managed to retain the monopoly by winning every contested seats for the next three general elections (including by-elections) until 1981.\n\nOn 13 October 1981, [[Devan Nair]] vacated his Anson seat to assume his role as the nation's third [[President of Singapore|President]], and precipitated the [[1981 Anson by-election|by-election]]; on 31 October, the party's victory was noted as historic as candidate Jeyaretnam became the first opposition MP-elect to be elected in Parliament with 51.9% (7,012) of the valid votes cast, beating PAP's [[Pang Kim Hin]]'s 47.1% (6,359) and a third candidate's 1.0% (131), marking the first time since 1961 the Anson electorate voted the WP into the assembly. Jeyaretnam then went on to held the constituency in the [[1984 Singaporean general election|1984 elections]] with an increased margin of 56.8%.\n\n{{Off topic|date=July 2014}}\n\nHowever, two months later, Jeyaretnam was charged with falsely accounting the party's funds. In 1986, Senior District Judge Michael Khoo found Jeyaretnam innocent of all charges but one. The prosecution later appealed a retrial to be held in a different district court, which saw Jeyaretnam found guilty on all charges and resulted in his disqualification, though he subsequently remained as the party's Secretary-General, he was also barred from standing in elections until 1991.<ref name=\"SW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-window.org/1028judi.htm|title=The politics of judicial institutions in Singapore|year=1997|work=[[Francis Seow]]|access-date=3 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922201015/http://www.singapore-window.org/1028judi.htm|archive-date=22 September 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===1987-1991: Re-entry into Parliament===\nIn 1987, some members were among a group of 22 people arrested by Singapore's [[Internal Security Department (Singapore)|Internal Security Department]] as part of Operation Spectrum, accused of being [[Marxist]]s. They were released on condition that they kept out of politics.\n\nPrior to the [[1988 Singaporean general election|1988 general elections]], the party merged [[Barisan Sosialis]] and the Singapore United Front. The party did not win any constituency but came very close to winning the [[Eunos Group Representation Constituency]] (which was then a three-member constituency), which the party's team (consist of [[Francis Seow]] (a former head of the Bar Society who had become a thorn in the government's side and had briefly been detained under the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Act]] prior to the general election), [[Lee Siew Choh]] (a former chairman of the Barisan Sosialis and former PAP Assemblyman from 1959 to 1961) and Mohd Khalit bin Mohd Baboo) scored 49.1%; only one opposition MP was returned to Parliament ([[Chiam See Tong]] of the [[Singapore Democratic Party]]), and since the team garnered the highest percentage of the vote secured by losing opposition candidates at the election, the party was eligible to nominate two members of its team become [[Non-constituency Member of Parliament|Non-constituency MPs]]. The party had refused to nominate NCMPs in the past, but this time they nominated Lee and Seow to become NCMPs. While Lee took his post and became the first NCMP, Seow did not accept the offer after he was accused of espionage and fled to the United States shortly after the election. In Parliament, Lee took up several issues, including the Internal Security Act, living costs and welfare.\n\nJeyaretnam was sued for [[slander]] by the Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] for comments he made at an election rally in 1988, and lost; Jeyaretnam was ordered to pay Lee damages of [[Singapore dollar|S$]]260,000 including costs.\n\n===1991-1997: WP under Low Thia Khiang===\nAt the [[1991 Singaporean general election|1991 general election]], [[Low Thia Khiang]], who was then the party's Organising Secretary, and a previously-contested candidate under the [[Tiong Bahru GRC]] in his debut in 1988, was elected as the MP for [[Hougang SMC]]; defeating PAP's incumbent Tang Guan Seng by 10,621 votes (52.8%) to 9,487 (47.2%). The party had since held on Hougang SMC after the election.\n\nDuring the election campaign, one of the WP's candidates in Eunos GRC, [[Jufrie Mahmood]], drew particular fire from the PAP and then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]], accusing him of being a [[Malay people|Malay]] [[chauvinist]], an accusation Jufrie strongly denied. The party also polled strongly in Eunos GRC, but lost to the PAP's team with 47.6% of the votes to 52.4%; unlike the last election, no NCMPs were offered as the opposition (including Low) elected a combined four seats in parliament. Low became the Assistant Secretary-General following the election; during his tenure, Low was praised by the parliament on his assertiveness, good analytical ability and his willingness to be constructive rather than oppose for the sake of opposing.\n\nA by-election in the [[Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency]] in 1992 was expected to mark the return of Jeyaretnam to electoral politics after his Parliamentary ban had expired; however, the team ultimately did not participate due to one of the candidates turned up late on the nomination day. In 1993, Jeyaretnam and another candidate, Tan Soo Phuan (now a member of [[Democratic Progressive Party (Singapore)|Democratic Progressive Party]]), attempted to seek candidacy in the first-ever [[1993 Singaporean presidential election|presidential election]], but both candidates were denied from granting the Certificate of Eligibility, an item presidential candidates was required to complete their nominations.\n\nIn 1996, Jeyaretnam was sued and paid damages of S$465,000 and S$250,000 in court costs for an article he wrote in an issue of the party's newspaper, ''The Hammer'', calling the PAP's [[Indian people|Indian]] leaders a bunch of stooges. That same year, Lee Siew Choh resigned from the party, citing differences with Jeyaretnam.\n\n===1997-2006: Leader Transition from Jeyaretnam to Low===\nIn the [[1997 Singaporean general election|1997 elections]], Low was re-elected as Hougang MP at the 1997 general election. Besides Low, only one other opposition MP was elected (Chiam See Tong, who left SDP to join the [[Singapore People's Party]]); one NCMP was offered to the WP team for [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]], who polled better than any other opposition losing candidates, with 45.2%; the party selected secretary-general (and candidate) Jeyaretnam as the NCMP, marking his return to the Parliament after 11 years.\n\nDuring the election campaign, another candidate part of the WP's team in Cheng San, lawyer [[Tang Liang Hong]], drew particular attention from the PAP, who accused him of being an anti-Christian and anti-[[Muslim]] [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] chauvinist. Tang, who insisted all he was trying to do was to \"better represent the Chinese community and ask questions on their behalf\", vigorously denied this charge and accused the PAP of trying to win votes by sowing fear into the electorate. Tang also attacked the PAP on the issue of the Hotel Properties Ltd case (which started when the [[Stock Exchange of Singapore]] criticised Hotel Properties Ltd for its \"tardiness\" in disclosing details of sales of its condominium units to directors and their family members).<ref>Ven Sreenivasan and Michelle Low, \"Analysts support SES censure of HPL,\" in: ''Business Times'', 24 April 1996, p. 15</ref>{{efn|name=Tang Liang Hong|Because Singapore's then-[[Senior Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and [[Kwa Geok Choo|his wife]] took discounts while purchasing an apartment in 1996, and younger brother Suan Yew was on the board of directors of the company, these claims raised suspicions of impropriety. Tang made these allegations in a Chinese magazine ''[[Yazhou Zhoukan]]'', which later lost a libel suit filed by Lee Kuan Yew and was ordered to pay damages. Then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]]s [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and [[Tony Tan]], along with former Cabinet Minister [[S. Dhanabalan]] and Heng Chiang Meng, then-President of the Real Estate Developer's Association of Singapore (REDAS), told the House that it was normal practice for developers to cite high list prices and offer customers varying discounts.<br />Warren Fernandez, \"Full details of condo deals revealed,\" ''The Straits Times'', 22 May 1996, p.1}} Lee who had purchased one of the units, claimed that Tang was trying to milk this issue for political capital; the PAP sued Tang for both defamation and branding the PAP leadership as a bunch of liars, for a total of S$13.6 million of damages, and Tang shortly fled to Australia after the election.\n\nPrior to the [[2001 Singaporean general election|2001 election]], Jeyaretnam was discharged from his NCMP seat due to an undischarged bankruptcy (failing to keep up with payments of S$120,000 worth of damages owed from a libel suit brought by then-[[Prime Minister]] Goh Chok Tong and other PAP leaders following comments he had made at an election rally in 1997, but since fulfilled and discharged from bankruptcy on May 2007); Jeyaretnam relinquished his Secretary-General post to Low, which saw the party in bitter acrimony as Jeyaretnam later accused Low of not doing enough to help him pay the damages from the libel suit. In response, Low claimed that he had always looked upon Jeyaretnam as an elder and had done everything possible to help him. Following the renewal, a few members (including Jeyaretnam) left the party, and went to form [[Reform Party (Singapore)|Reform Party]] in 2008, which would be Jeyaretnam's final involvement in politics until his death three months after the founding.\n\nMany observers speculated that with Low at the helm, WP would tone down its more hard-line stance and take on a more [[Centrism|centrist]] outlook at the 2001 election. After Low assumed leadership, Low recruited a series of young members to the party, which include [[James Gomez]], [[Yaw Shin Leong]] and [[Sylvia Lim]] (who would became the party's long-serving (and current) chairperson). Although Low was re-elected as Hougang MP at the 2001 general election, the party's fortunes reached a low as it only contested in two seats, in Hougang and Nee Soon East SMCs and had its entire Aljunied GRC team disqualified on Nomination Day.\n\n===2006-2011: Party's Road to Renewal===\n[[File:Workers party rally.jpg|thumb|A Workers' Party election rally at the [[Serangoon]] Stadium.]]\nWP launched an updated [[manifesto]] in January 2006 entitled \"You Have a Choice\".

The party also polled strongly in the Aljunied GRC, losing to the PAP's team with 43.9% of the vote to 56.1%, allowing the party to elect an NCMP seat by-virtue for their team being best-performing opposition losers, and the party's [[Party Chair|Chairman]] Lim was selected to become its first female NCMP. Another team of young first-time candidates, led by [[Yaw Shin Leong]] in [[Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency|Ang Mo Kio GRC]] helmed by Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]], garnered a respectable 33.4% or one-third of the votes, slightly higher than the opposition's national average. Combining from all the votes received from the seven constituencies contested by 20 candidates, their popular vote was 38.4%; as compared to the second opposition party, the [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] (the party also fielded the same number of candidates contesting the same number of constituencies), where the party got 32.5%, the party then became the largest opposition for the election, and leader Low succeeded Chiam as the new [[Leader of the Opposition (Singapore)|leader of the opposition]].\n\nDuring campaigning, controversies surrounded to [[James Gomez]], a candidate representing Aljunied GRC, claiming that the Elections Department had lost his minority race candidate's certificate, and was forced to apologise when [[closed-circuit television]] evidence showed that he had placed the form in his briefcase without submitting it. The PAP attacked Gomez for the incident, with Lee Kuan Yew publicly calling him a \"liar\". One day after the election, Gomez was prevented from leaving Singapore on a trip to [[Stockholm]] and questioned by police over whether he had committed criminal intimidation in his dealings with the Elections Department. Gomez was subsequently released after being given a warning, and was allowed travel to Stockholm.\n\n===2011: Party's Breakthrough===\nThe manifesto for the [[2011 Singaporean general election|General Election 2011]] was titled \"Towards a First World Parliament\", which also became their campaign slogan. One key proposal was for more affordable public housing such that [[Housing Development Board]] (HDB) lessees should be able to pay off their mortgage loans within 20 years rather than 30 years. Prior to nomination day (27 April 2011), Low announced that he would vacate his Hougang seat to former Ang Mo Kio GRC candidate Yaw Shin Long, and would contest in Aljunied GRC in the forthcoming election along with Lim and three of his \"A-List\" candidates (Taiwanese-born corporate lawyer [[Chen Show Mao]], law postgraduate and former [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]] [[major]] [[Pritam Singh (Singaporean politician)|Pritam Singh]], and freelance councillor [[Muhamad Faisal Manap]]). The party fielded a total of 23 candidates contesting in eight constituencies, the largest slate since 1988 (WP had the second-largest opposition slate, second only to another opposition party, [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]], which fielded 24 candidates in eight constituencies).\n\nOn 7 May, the team in Aljunied GRC achieved another breakthrough for the party, with the first-ever GRC victory for any opposition party in history, with a score of 54.71% to unseat the PAP team led by then-[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Singapore)|Foreign Minister]] [[George Yeo]] and [[Prime Minister's Office (Singapore)|Minister of the Prime Minister's Office]] [[Lim Hwee Hua]]. The Hougang ward was also retained by Yaw with its best performance for the party at 64.80% of the votes (second only to Chiam's score of 69.6% back in 1991), resulting in six seats elected in Parliament. Their party's overall vote was its best performance in history, with 46.58% of the votes combined from the eight constituencies contested (second only to SDP's popular vote of 48.6% in 1991). Additionally, the election of chairwoman Lim, as well as Chen and Manap, became the first female and former NCMP, foreign-born, and Malay opposition MP, respectively, to be elected in Parliament.\n\nDue to an increase of minimum opposition seats from three to nine, the party also won two of the three NCMP seats, which they elect [[Gerald Giam]] and [[Yee Jenn Jong]] (who contested [[East Coast Group Representation Constituency]] and [[Joo Chiat Single Member Constituency]], respectively), bringing a total representation of eight seats, the most for any opposition party in Singapore since independence.
