{"title_page": "Schools' Challenge", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=July 2014}}\n\n'''Schools Challenge''' is the national [[general knowledge]] competition for schools in the United Kingdom. It uses the same [[quiz bowl]] rules as [[University Challenge]], although it is affiliated with neither the game nor the television show.<ref name=\"Edusites\">{{Cite web|url=http://media.edusites.co.uk/blog/article/schools-challenge-general-knowledge-quiz/|title=Schools Challenge - General Knowledge Quiz|accessdate=July 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSchools Challenge was founded by Colin Galloway in 1978, and is divided into Senior and Junior sections. Senior Schools Challenge is for students aged up to 18, with no lower age restriction.  In practice the teams tend to draw on Form III to Upper VI (Year 9 to Year 13 in state schools in England & Wales). Each team comprises four members, two of whom must be no older than the normal age for a Form IV (Year 10) student (in 2018-19, born on or after 1 September 2003, or 1 August 2003 in Northern Ireland). The other two can be of any age. Junior Schools Challenge is for students up to and including the normal age for a Form II Year 8) student, or [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] pupils: in 2019, born on or after 1 September 2006 (1 August 2006 in Northern Ireland). Again, there are four members in each team but there are no restrictions on the numbers of any students from a particular age group in this competition.\n\nThe competition is divided this way because of the incongruence between the [[Independent school (UK)|independent school]] system and [[grammar school|grammar]] or [[comprehensive school]]s. In some independent school systems students attend a preparatory school until the age of 13, after which time they transfer to another school. Schools Challenge has had to work around this so that no school has an unfair advantage in terms of age.\n\nBoth Senior and Junior competitions are divided into a maximum of 15 regions. Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales each comprise a separate region, though Northern Ireland currently does not participate in the Senior competition. Each region has a coordinator, the Regional Organiser, who in turn answers to the National Organisers.\n\nThe competition starts with each respective region's tournament- the number of teams that participate in each region varies, with some regions larger/smaller than others (this can lead to imbalance, meaning regions have been re-organised over the years.)Then, the 15 eventual regional winners play an inter-regional round- usually against the winners of a neighbouring region- the winners of which participate in the national finals to contest the Schools' Challenge shield. The runners-up of the School Challenge competition also receive a smaller shield.  Teams who lose in the first round of the national final contest (the quarter-finals) enter the [[repechage]] contest for the Schools' Challenge Plate.  Finals are contested in a single day, normally the last Sunday in April for the Senior competition and the third or fourth Sunday in June for the Junior competition, at a central venue.\n\nThe most successful team in the competition's history are [[Westminster School]], who won each year from 2005-2009, in 2016 and 2018.  In addition, they were beaten finalists in 2004 and 2011, semi-finalists in 2010, and won the Plate competition in 2015. The only team to have won the Senior and Junior competitions in the same season (2014 and 2019) is [[The Perse School, Cambridge]]. Other consistently successful teams in both Junior and Senior competitions are [[The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]], [[Hereford Cathedral School]], [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], [[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]], [[Nottingham High School]] and [[Calday Grange Grammar School]]; in the Junior competition only, [[Dulwich Prep London]] (previously known as Dulwich College Preparatory School) However, the quality of schools can be changeable (perhaps as older members leave) and it is not uncommon to see a school do well in the competition maybe even for the first time in many years. \n\nSo far, the only all-female teams ever to qualify for the Senior National Finals (four times in all) have been from [[Bournemouth School for Girls]]. BSG\u2019s 2019 team is to date the most successful all girls\u2019 team in the Senior competition\u2019s history, having beaten [[King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford]](in the latter's first foray past the regional rounds in thirteen years) to win the Plate Final. All-female teams have been rather more successful in the Junior competition: [[King Edward VI High School for Girls]], Birmingham (1987 and 2005), [[Withington Girls' School]] (1991), [[Chelmsford County High School for Girls]] (1993) [[Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School]] (2003), [[Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls]] (2004), [[Sacred Heart Grammar School]], Newry (2006 and 2016) and [[Wakefield Girls' High School]] (2013). [[King Edward VI High School for Girls]] has been the only all-female team to have won the Junior National Finals (in 1987); [[Chelmsford County High School for Girls]] were runners-up in 1993.\n\nThe national competition is organised by Paul and Sue Sims, assisted by various regional coordinators.\n\n==Rules==\nThe game is played to similar rules to the TV show [[University Challenge]].  Starter questions are asked to all contestants and the first to buzz must answer immediately (or the full question is passed to the other team).  The team that correctly answers a buzzer question is then asked three 'bonus' questions which they may confer on and which may be passed to the other team.  The main differences between Schools Challenge and University Challenge are:\n\n*No points are deducted for incorrectly interrupting a starter question on the buzzer.\n*Bonus questions are worth 10 points each and are passed across to the other team if answered incorrectly.\n*A team answering the starter and all three subsequent bonuses correctly gains an extra bonus of 10 points: thus 50 points are available per round.\n*There are no picture rounds or music rounds at present.\n*The contestant who buzzes first must wait for the quiz master's signal that they should give their answer. Failure to comply with these regulations may leave the contestant's answer void.\n\n==Equipment==\n8-player lockout buzzers, common in quizzes of this type are used and are supplied by tournament organisers if a hosting school cannot supply the equipment.  While tournament rules do not specify a manufacturer, the Jaser Quizmaster system is the [[de facto]] standard in many regions, although this is no longer being manufactured. \nAn electronic scoreboard, which can be projected onto an IWB (interactive whiteboard) or screen has been used in a number of Regional Finals and National Finals in recent years.\n\n<br />\n\n== Challenge 2019-20 ==\nDue to the [[Covid-19]] pandemic causing the closure of schools in early 2020, the decision was made to run the finals over the [[Zoom Video Communications|zoom]] video app. The inter-regional rounds that were not completed before the closure played the inter-regional round pub-quiz style, rather than on buzzers. The seven teams in the national finals were [[The Perse School]], [[Calday Grange Grammar School|Calday Grange]], [[Dollar Academy]], [[Westminster School]], [[King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford|King Edward VI Grammar School Chelmsford]], and [[Warwick School]], who would have hosted the competition. Due to one team dropping out, [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edward's School]] got a bye to the semi-finals. The other quarter-finals were as follows (* denotes winner):\n\n[[Westminster School]]* v [[The Perse School]]\n\n[[Warwick School]] v [[Calday Grange Grammar School|Calday Grange]]*\n\n[[Dollar Academy]]* v [[King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford|King Edward VI Grammar School Chelmsford]] \n\n([[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edwards School, Birmingham]] v bye)\n\nThe winning teams were then randomly drawn against each other, with [[Westminster School]] playing [[Calday Grange Grammar School|Calday Grange]], and [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edwards School, Birmingham]] playing [[Dollar Academy]]. King Edward's beat Dollar Academy, and Westminster beat Calday Grange. The final of King Edward's v Westminster is yet to be played.\n<br />\n==Competition History - Senior==\n{| class=wikitable\n!width=20|Year\n!width=250|Winners\n!width=200|Runners-up\n!width=200|Plate winners\n|-\n|1980\n|[[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1981\n|[[Monmouth School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1982\n|[[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1983\n|[[King Henry VIII School Abergavenny]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1984\n|[[Monmouth School]]\n|[[Bury Grammar School]]\n|unknown\n|-\n|1985\n|[[Norwich School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1986\n|[[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]]\n|[[Stamford School]]\n|unknown\n|-\n|1987\n|[[Dean Close School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1988\n|[[The Grange School, Aylesbury|The Grange School]]\n|Royal School Dungannon \n|unknown\n|-\n|1989\n|[[Aylesbury Grammar School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1990\n|[[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|King Henry VIII School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1991\n|[[Nottingham High School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1992\n|[[Bryanston School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1993\n|[[Maidstone Grammar School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1994\n|[[Maidstone Grammar School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1995\n|[[Maidstone Grammar School]]\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|[[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby]]\n|-\n|1996\n|[[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n|[[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby]]\n|unknown\n|-\n|1997\n|[[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1998\n|[[The King's School, Canterbury]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|1999\n|[[Devonport High School for Boys]]\n|[[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]]\n|unknown\n|-\n|2000\n|[[Colchester Royal Grammar School]]\n|[[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]]\n|[[Devonport High School for Boys]] \n|-\n|2001\n|[[The King's School, Canterbury]]\n|[[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n|[[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]]\n|-\n|2002\n|[[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School]]\n|[[Royal Grammar School, Guildford]]\n|[[Woodbridge School]]\n|-\n|2003\n|[[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n|[[George Heriot's School]]\n||[[Woodbridge School]]\n|-\n|2004\n|[[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|[[The King's School, Worcester]]\n|-\n|2005\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|[[Bedford School]]\n|[[Manchester Grammar School]]\n|-\n|2006\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|[[Solihull School]]\n|unknown\n|-\n|2007\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|unknown\n|unknown\n|-\n|2008\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|[[Manchester Grammar School]]\n|Abingdon School\n|-\n|2009\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|[[Solihull School]]\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|[[The King's School, Worcester]]\n|[[Abingdon School]]\n|-\n|2011\n|[[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|-\n|2012\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|[[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]]\n|[[Devonport High School for Boys]]\n|-\n|2013\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|[[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]]\n|[[Monmouth School]]\n|-\n|2014\n|[[The Perse School]]\n|[[Hereford Cathedral School]]\n|[[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n|-\n|2015\n|[[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]]\n|[[King Edward's School, Birmingham]]\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|-\n|2016\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|[[King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys]]\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|-\n|2017\n|[[The Perse School]]\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|[[Hereford Cathedral School]]\n|-\n|2018\n|[[Westminster School]]\n|[[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]\n|[[The Perse School]]\n|-\n|2019\n|[[The Perse School]]\n|[[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]]\n|[[Bournemouth School for Girls]]\n|}\n\n==Competition History -
