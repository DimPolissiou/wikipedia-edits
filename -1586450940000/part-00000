They continued to record and tour despite DeLonge reigniting his career with Blink-182 in 2009, and after DeLonge subsequently parted with Blink-182 in 2015, he began to focus on Angels & Airwaves more extensively.

For half a year he worked alone in his home studio before gathering musicians to form the band. Upon fiddling randomly for several weeks with the band's logo, DeLonge realized that if he were to invert the middle \"A\" of the band's acronym into what appeared to be a \"V\", he would have the name of his daughter, Ava. As rumors were floating around about the band's \"break-up\", DeLonge chose to abstain for six months from any interviews surrounding the issue and his future plans; instead he concentrated on writing and recording in his home-based studio. In September 2005, he finally spoke publicly in ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, where he unveiled the name of his new band, Angels & Airwaves. The band included former [[Hazen Street]] guitarist and high-school friend [[David Kennedy (guitarist)|David Kennedy]], former [[Rocket from the Crypt]] and [[The Offspring]] drummer [[Atom Willard]] and former [[The Distillers]] bass guitarist [[Ryan Sinn]]. Atom Willard told ''[[Shave (magazine)|Shave]]'' magazine that the experience of all the members of the band made the band formation very easy. \"There's nobody trying to figure out what is and what isn't going to work, not just for themselves but for music and for a band, what life's going to be like on the road and all that kind of stuff. Everybody had enough experience to just buckle down and do the work. It really has made it easier than anything else.\"<ref name=\"shavemagazine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/angels-and-airwaves-adam-atom-willard |title=Interview: Atom Willard |publisher=ShaveMagazine.com |first=Match |last=Stevens |accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''We Don't Need to Whisper'' (2005\u201307)===\n[[File:Angels and Airwaves (Hyde Park).jpg|thumb|Angels and Airwaves performing at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in June 2006.]]\nSoon after forming, the band began recording its first album in DeLonge's studio in California from mid-2005 to early 2006. However, after a fan e-mail hacked DeLonge and stole four demos, Angels & Airwaves had no other choice but to release \"[[The Adventure]]\" as their first single, which was leaked onto radio stations, causing a premature release on May 18, 2006. A few days later, on 23 May, they released their first album, ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper]]''. The album reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard 200, and went gold in both the US and Canada. Despite this success, critics gave generally mixed reviews, with one noting that \"while well-intentioned [the band] failed to reach the lofty heights to which they aspire\", especially in light of claims made by DeLonge that the album would be \"the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1509766/blinks-tom-delonge-promises-the-greatest-rock-and-roll-revolution/|title=Blink's Tom DeLonge Promises 'The Greatest Rock And Roll Revolution'|publisher=MTV News|access-date=August 29, 2017}}</ref> Yet, later that year, popularity picked up with the release of singles \"[[The War (Angels & Airwaves song)|The War]]\", \"[[Do It For Me Now]]\" and \"[[It Hurts]]\". The remainder of the year into 2007 was taken up with tours, and in early 2007, the supergroup returned to the studio to work on a follow-up album.\n\nHowever, problems accumulated and on April 23, 2007, Angels & Airwaves announced that Ryan Sinn would not play at the Free Earth Day concert at the [[M.I.T.]] campus due to difficulties within the band. Following this incident, on 15 May, Sinn posted on the Army of Angels fan club message board stating that he was \"no longer a part of Angels & Airwaves\" and had received a call on the evening of April 19 concluding his relationship with the band. Matt Wachter (the former bass guitarist of [[30 Seconds to Mars]]), filled in for the show and was later confirmed as a permanent member.\n\n===''I-Empire'' (2007\u201309)===\nThe second studio album, titled ''[[I-Empire]]'' and the first song \"[[Everything's Magic]]\" were leaked to the Internet, and on August 25, 2007, it was the most requested song on California radio station KROQ. Angels & Airwaves began streaming the song on their [[MySpace]] profile on August 28, 2007. It also became available on [[iTunes]], and reached number three on the iTunes Rock Chart on September 11, 2007, before the song was even made available for nationwide airplay. The band recorded the video for the single on January 20 and 21, and it was premiered on MTV2 Unleashed on February 25, 2008.

Former members include [[Ryan Sinn]] (bass guitar, backing vocals), [[Adam Willard|Adam \"Atom\" Willard]] (drums), [[Matt Wachter]] (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) and [[Eddie Breckenridge]] (bass guitar).\n\nThe band formed after [[Blink-182]] went on hiatus in 2005. They continued to record and tour despite DeLonge reigniting his career with Blink-182 in 2009, and after DeLonge subsequently parted with Blink-182 in 2015, he began to focus on Angels & Airwaves more extensively. To date, the band has released five studio albums: ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper]]'' (2006), ''[[I-Empire]]'' (2007), ''[[Love (Angels & Airwaves album)|Love]]'' (2010), ''[[Love: Part Two]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Dream Walker]]'' (2014). The project also resulted in the documentary film ''[[Start the Machine (film)|Start the Machine]]'' (2008). In 2011, accompanying the two ''Love'' albums, the group scored and produced the [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] ''[[Love (2011 film)|Love]]'' by director [[William Eubank]] in 460 theatres nationwide during their multimedia event, [[Angels & Airwaves Presents Love Live|Love Live]].

For half a year he worked alone in his home studio before gathering musicians to form the band. Upon fiddling randomly for several weeks with the band's logo, DeLonge realized that if he were to invert the middle \"A\" of the band's acronym into what appeared to be a \"V\", he would have the name of his daughter, Ava. As rumors were floating around about the band's \"break-up\", DeLonge chose to abstain for six months from any interviews surrounding the issue and his future plans; instead he concentrated on writing and recording in his home-based studio. In September 2005, he finally spoke publicly in ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, where he unveiled the name of his new band, Angels & Airwaves. The band included former [[Hazen Street]] guitarist and high-school friend [[David Kennedy (guitarist)|David Kennedy]], former [[Rocket from the Crypt]] and [[The Offspring]] drummer [[Atom Willard]] and former [[The Distillers]] bass guitarist [[Ryan Sinn]]. Atom Willard told ''[[Shave (magazine)|Shave]]'' magazine that the experience of all the members of the band made the band formation very easy. \"There's nobody trying to figure out what is and what isn't going to work, not just for themselves but for music and for a band, what life's going to be like on the road and all that kind of stuff. Everybody had enough experience to just buckle down and do the work. It really has made it easier than anything else.\"<ref name=\"shavemagazine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/angels-and-airwaves-adam-atom-willard |title=Interview: Atom Willard |publisher=ShaveMagazine.com |first=Match |last=Stevens |accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===''We Don't Need to Whisper'' (2005\u201307)===\n[[File:Angels and Airwaves (Hyde Park).jpg|thumb|Angels and Airwaves performing at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] in June 2006.]]\nSoon after forming, the band began recording its first album in DeLonge's studio in California from mid-2005 to early 2006. However, after a fan e-mail hacked DeLonge and stole four demos, Angels & Airwaves had no other choice but to release \"[[The Adventure]]\" as their first single, which was leaked onto radio stations, causing a premature release on May 18, 2006. A few days later, on 23 May, they released their first album, ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper]]''. The album reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard 200, and went gold in both the US and Canada. Despite this success, critics gave generally mixed reviews, with one noting that \"while well-intentioned [the band] failed to reach the lofty heights to which they aspire\", especially in light of claims made by DeLonge that the album would be \"the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1509766/blinks-tom-delonge-promises-the-greatest-rock-and-roll-revolution/|title=Blink's Tom DeLonge Promises 'The Greatest Rock And Roll Revolution'|publisher=MTV News|access-date=August 29, 2017}}</ref> Yet, later that year, popularity picked up with the release of singles \"[[The War (Angels & Airwaves song)|The War]]\", \"[[Do It For Me Now]]\" and \"[[It Hurts]]\". The remainder of the year into 2007 was taken up with tours, and in early 2007, the supergroup returned to the studio to work on a follow-up album.\n\nHowever, problems accumulated and on April 23, 2007, Angels & Airwaves announced that Ryan Sinn would not play at the Free Earth Day concert at the [[M.I.T.]] campus due to difficulties within the band. Following this incident, on 15 May, Sinn posted on the Army of Angels fan club message board stating that he was \"no longer a part of Angels & Airwaves\" and had received a call on the evening of April 19 concluding his relationship with the band. Matt Wachter (the former bass guitarist of [[30 Seconds to Mars]]), filled in for the show and was later confirmed as a permanent member.\n\n===''I-Empire'' (2007\u201309)===\nThe second studio album, titled ''[[I-Empire]]'' and the first song \"[[Everything's Magic]]\" were leaked to the Internet, and on August 25, 2007, it was the most requested song on California radio station KROQ. Angels & Airwaves began streaming the song on their [[MySpace]] profile on August 28, 2007. It also became available on [[iTunes]], and reached number three on the iTunes Rock Chart on September 11, 2007, before the song was even made available for nationwide airplay. The band recorded the video for the single on January 20 and 21, and it was premiered on MTV2 Unleashed on February 25, 2008. Their second single \"Secret Crowds\" was released on February 4, 2008 along with an accompanying video.

They began producing it in January 2009 but progress was slow due to Blink-182 reuniting and going on tour. The band finished the album in time for its release on Valentine's Day 2010.

He graduated from [[Johns Hopkins University]] and then furthered his education by acquiring a master's degree from [[Yale]], studying at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], and receiving a doctorate from the [[University of Vienna]]. While studying in Vienna he became attracted to the [[Vienna circle]] of [[Logical positivism|Logical Positivists]], founded by the [[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Moritz Schlick]].\n\n==Professional life==\nWithin philosophy Albert Blumberg was best known for having co-authored with [[Herbert Feigl]] a paper which appeared in the [[Journal of Philosophy]] entitled, \"Logical Positivism: A New Movement In European Philosophy.\" For logical positivists the discipline of philosophy hinged on one task; to clarify the meanings of concepts and ideas, and what sort of statements really did have any \"meaning\" in the first place.  There are only two distinctions of statements that have any meaning to logical positivists. The first involves [[logical truth|necessary truth]]s of logic, mathematics, and ordinary language.  The second involves empirical propositions about the world around us that were not necessary truths, instead they are regarded as true with greater or lesser probability.  In addition to being a student and professor of philosophy, Albert Blumberg also fought for economic and social reforms. In the year 1933 he joined the Maryland [[Communist]] Party where he served for four years as the chair of the [[Agitprop]] Committee.\n\n==Political activism==\nIn 1937 Blumberg resigned his faculty position at Johns Hopkins, publicly announced his party membership, and took on the created position of district administrative secretary for the Communist Party.  Blumberg also ran for public office on several occasions, for example, Communist candidate for Mayor of Baltimore City, 1939. As well Blumberg was several times under suspicion by various governmental organizations for communist activities, becoming one of the first convicted under a provision of the 1940 Smith Act. During his senior years Blumberg remained politically active, although not in the communist party.  He enjoyed somewhat more success as the Democratic Party district leader in [[Manhattan]]. He died at the age of 91 near his home in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[American philosophy]]\n*[[List of American philosophers]]\n\n==References==\n* Sarkar, Sahota, and Jessica Pfeifer.
