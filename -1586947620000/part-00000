He attended Blossomfield Infant School in Solihull's Sharmans Cross district from the age of 3\u20137. Originally a pupil of [[Solihull School]], a fee-paying boys' independent school, he moved to [[Ripon Grammar School]], and from 1986 to 1988 attended [[Harrogate College|Harrogate College of Art and Technology]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduation, Hammond worked for several BBC radio stations, including [[BBC Tees|Radio Cleveland]], [[BBC Radio York|Radio York]], [[BBC Radio Cumbria|Radio Cumbria]], [[BBC Radio Leeds|Radio Leeds]] and [[BBC Newcastle|Radio Newcastle]].<ref name=BBCAus/>\n\nPresenting the afternoon programme at [[BBC Radio Lancashire|Radio Lancashire]], his regular guests included motoring journalist [[Zogg Zieglar]], who would review a car of the week by being interviewed by Hammond over the phone.

The show also contained images of the crash, which had made international headlines, with Hammond talking through the events of the day after which the audience broke into spontaneous applause.

Oliver features on Hammond's children's science television show ''[[Richard Hammond's Blast Lab]]'' and in another episode of ''Top Gear'' as a kind of \"Hill-holder\" in the trailer truck challenge (after it acquired the fake personal plate \"OLI V3R\").

Active since 1962, Raven has recorded for several record labels, including [[ABC Records|ABC]], Dimension, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], [[RCA Records|RCA]], [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal]], and [[Capitol Records]]. His greatest commercial success came between 1984 and 1990, during which time Raven achieved six number-one singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts: \"[[I Got Mexico]]\", \"[[Shine, Shine, Shine]]\", \"[[I'm Gonna Get You (Billy Swan song)|I'm Gonna Get You]]\", \"[[Joe Knows How to Live]]\", \"[[A Letter to You|In a Letter to You]]\", and \"[[Bayou Boys]]\". Raven has a total of eighteen top-ten hits on that chart. In addition to his own work, he has written singles for [[Don Gibson]], [[Randy Cornor]], [[Jeannie C. Riley]], and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] among others. Raven's music is defined by mainstream country, [[country pop]], [[Cajun music]], and [[reggae]], and he wrote a large number of his singles by himself.\n\n==Biography==\nEdward Garvin Futch was born in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], on August 19, 1944.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/><ref name=\"Larkin2006\"/> He is the oldest of ten children, and his father worked as a truck driver.<ref name=\"pennies\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112678145/ | title=Eddy Raven to perform at 'Pennies' | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=December 15, 1982 | accessdate=April 23, 2019 | author=Sandy Neese | pages=45}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Futch had originally considered a professional career in baseball, but chose not to after breaking his ankle.<ref name=\"gladys\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/229175341/ | title=Has the country boy caught up with the dream? | work=Daily World | date=January 18, 1981 | accessdate=December 28, 2019 | author=Gladys L. deVillier | pages=C1}}{{Subscription required}}</ref> Growing up, he cited [[Cajun music]] as a musical influence, along with the [[country music]] sounds from popular radio broadcasts such as the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', [[New Orleans blues]], and the new sounds of [[rock and roll]].

The album accounted for four chart singles on Hot Country Songs between 1981 and 1982: \"[[I Should've Called]]\", \"[[Who Do You Know in California]]\", \"[[A Little Bit Crazy]]\", and \"[[She's Playing Hard to Forget]]\", the last of which became his first top ten hit there. Raven wrote the first three by himself.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> At the time of the album's release, Raven said that many of his songs were inspired by situations that he had encountered while touring, noting that \"Who Do You Know in California\" was inspired by an affair he had heard of in [[Dallas, Texas]], but changed to being set in [[California]] because the latter fit the song's meter better.

During this hiatus, he disassociated himself from his existing producers and managers and began writing songs with [[Frank J.

After having success on the songwriting front, which included the title track of [[Tanya Tucker]]'s late-1982 album ''[[Changes (Tanya Tucker album)|Changes]]'', Raven was inspired to resume recording in 1984.<ref name=\"robert\"/>\n\n===1984-88: RCA Records===\n[[File:Frank Myers 190306-D-SW162-1180 (47257966602).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Frank J.

Among other things, he told the members of the Congress the grave problems and difficulties the Philippines face and reported on his special trip to the United States to discuss the approval for independence.<ref>''[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]'' (Manila, May 1946) vol. 42 no. 5, pp. 1151\u20131165</ref>\n\nOn June 21, he reappeared in front of another joint session of the Congress and urged the acceptance of two laws passed by the [[Congress of the United States]] on April 30, 1946\u2014the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]], of Philippine Rehabilitation Act, and the [[Bell Trade Act]] or Philippine Trade Act.<ref>''[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]'', July 1946, vol. 42 no. 7, pp. 1625\u20131628</ref> Both recommendations were accepted by the Congress.\n\n=== First President of the Third Republic (1946\u20131948) ===\n[[File:1946-07-15 Philippines Independence Proclaimed.ogv|thumb|right|Short American [[newsreel]] of Philippine independence ceremonies on July 4, 1946 with brief footage of Roxas taking the Oath of Office.]]\n\nManuel Roxas' term as the President of the Commonwealth ended on the morning of July 4, 1946, when the [[Third Republic of the Philippines]] was inaugurated and independence from the United States proclaimed. The occasion, attended by some 300,000 people, was marked by the simultaneous lowering of the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] and raising of the [[Flag of the Philippines|National Flag]], a [[21-gun salute]], and the pealing of church bells. Roxas then swore the Oath of Office as the first President of the new Republic.\n\nThe inaugural ceremonies took place at [[Luneta Park]] in the [[City of Manila]]. On the Grandstand alone were around 3,000 dignitaries and guests, consisting of President Roxas, Vice-President Quirino, their respective parties and the Cabinet; the last High Commissioner to the Philippines and first [[Embassy of the United States|Ambassador to the Philippines]] Paul McNutt; General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (coming from [[Tokyo]]); [[United States Postmaster General]] [[Robert E.

The Inaugurals of the Presidents of the Philippines|publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc.}}\n}}\nNo sooner had the fanfare of the [[independence]] festivities ended that the government and the people quickly put all hands to work in the tasks of rescuing the country from its dire economic straits. Reputed to be the most bombed and destroyed country in the world, the Philippines was in a sorry mess. Only [[Stalingrad]] and [[Warsaw]], for instance, could compare with [[Manila]] in point of destruction. All over the country more than a million people were unaccounted for. The war casualties as such could very well reach the two million mark. Conservative estimates had it that the [[Philippines]] had lost about two thirds of her material wealth.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\">Molina, Antonio. ''The Philippines: Through the centuries''. Manila: University of Sto. Tomas Cooperative, 1961. Print.</ref>\n\nThe country was facing near bankruptcy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/> There was no national economy, no export trade. Indeed, production for exports had not been restored. On the other hand, imports were to reach the amount of three million dollars. There was need of immediate aid from the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]]. Something along this line was obtained. Again, loans from the United States, as well as some increase in the national revenues, were to help the new Republic.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>\n\nPresident Roxas, with bold steps, met the situation with the same confidence he exuded in his inaugural address, when he said: \"The system of free but guided enterprise is our system\". Among the main remedies proposed was the establishment of the Philippine Rehabilitation Finance Corporation. This entity would be responsible for the construction of twelve thousand houses and for the grant of easy-term loans in the amount of 177,000,000 pesos. Another proposal was the creation of the [[Central Bank of the Philippines]] to help stabilize the Philippine dollar reserves and coordinate and the nations banking activities gearing them to the economic progress.\n\nConcentrating on the sugar industry, President Roxas would exert such efforts as to succeed in increasing production from 13,000 tons at the time of the Philippine liberation to an all-high of one million tons.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>\n\n=====Reconstruction after the war=====\nThe [[World War II|postwar]] Philippines had burned cities and towns, ruined farms and factories, blasted roads and bridges, shattered industries and commerce, and thousands of massacred victims. The war had paralyzed the educational system, where 80% of the school buildings, their equipment, laboratories and furniture were destroyed.<ref>Gallego, Manuel V. \"The Technique of Japanese Cultural Invasion.\" ''Philippine Journal of Education.'' Manila, November 1946, p. 94</ref> Numberless books, invaluable documents and works of art, irreplaceable historical relics and family [[heirloom]]s, hundreds of churches and temples were burned. The reconstruction of the damaged school buildings alone cost more than [[Philippine peso|Php]] 126,000,000,000.\n\nThe new Republic began to function on an annual deficit of over Php 200,000,000 with little prospect of a balanced budget for some years to come.<ref>Message of His Excellency Manuel Roxas, President of the Philippines to the Second Congress delivered on June 3, 1946.

In rural regions, especially the provinces of [[Central Luzon]] and the [[Southern Tagalog]] regions, the [[Hukbalahap]]s and brigands terrorized towns and [[barrio]]s.\n\n=====Agrarian Reform=====\n{{See also|Land reform in the Philippines}}\n\nIn 1946, shortly after his induction to Presidency, Manuel Roxas proclaimed the Rice Share Tenancy Act of 1933 effective throughout the country.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Manapat, Carlos, et al.'' Economics, Taxation, and Agrarian Reform''. Quezon City: C&E Pub., 2010.Print.</ref> However problems of [[land tenure]] continued. In fact these became worse in certain areas.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Among the remedial measures enacted was Republic Act No. 1946 likewise known as the Tenant Act which provided for a 70\u201330 sharing arrangements and regulated share-tenancy contracts.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> It was passed to resolve the ongoing peasant unrest in Central Luzon.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n=====Amnesty Proclamation=====\nPresident Roxas, on January 28, 1948, granted full amnesty to all so-called Philippine collaborators, many of whom were on trial or awaiting to be tried, particularly former President [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] (1943\u20131945).<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/> The Amnesty Proclamation did not apply to those \"collaborators\", who were charged with the commission of common crimes, such as murder, rape, and arson. The presidential decision did much<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/> to heal a standing wound that somehow threatened to divide the people's sentiments. It was a much-called for measure to bring about a closer unity in the trying times when such was most needed for the progress of the nation.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>\n\n=====''Huks'' outlawed=====\nDisgusted with the crimes being committed by the guerilla movement ''[[HUKBALAHAP|Hukb\u00f3 ng Bayan Laban sa Hap\u00f3n]]'' (Nation's Army Against the Japanese, also called \"the Huks\") and possessing evidence of their subversion, Roxas issued a proclamation outlawing the Huk movement on March 6, 1948.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>  It had become an imperative in view of the resurgence of Huk depredations, following the unseating of the seven Communists, led by Huk Supremo [[Luis Taruc]] through acts of terrorism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>\n\n====Foreign policy====\n\n=====Treaty of General Relations=====\n{{See also|Treaty of Manila (1946)}}\nOn August 5, 1946, the [[Congress of the Philippines]] ratified the Treaty of General Relations that had been entered into by and between the [[Republic of the Philippines]] and the United States on July 4, 1946.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/> Aside from withdrawing her sovereignty from the Philippines and recognizing her independence, the Treaty reserved for the United States some bases for the mutual protection of both countries; consented that the United States represent the Philippines in countries where the latter had not yet established diplomatic representation; made the Philippines assume all debts and obligations of the former government in the Philippines; and provided for the settlement of property rights of the citizens of both countries.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>\n\n===== United States military bases =====\n[[File:ManuelRoxas Last.jpg|thumb|225px|One of the last pictures of President Manuel Roxas.]]\nAlthough Roxas was successful in getting rehabilitation funds from the United States after independence, he was forced to concede military bases (23 of which were leased for 99 years), trade restriction for the Philippine citizens, and special privileges for U.S. property owner and investor.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n=====Parity Rights Amendment=====\nOn March 11, 1947, Philippine voters, agreeing with Roxas, ratified in a nationwide [[plebiscite]] the \"[[1947 Philippine Parity Rights plebiscite|parity amendment]]\" to the [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines]], granting United States citizens the right to dispose of and utilize Philippine natural resources, or ''[[parity rights]]''.\n\n=====[[Philippine Turtle Islands|Turtle]] and [[Mangsee Islands|Mangsee]] Islands=====\n{{See also|Philippine Turtle Islands#How the islands came under Philippine administration}}\nOn 19 September 1946 the Republic of the Philippines notified the United Kingdom that it wished to take over the administration of the Turtle Islands and the Mangesse Islands.

On April 16, 1950, he was executed in an [[electric chair]] at [[Muntinlupa]].</ref>\n\n====Controversies====\nHis administration was marred by graft and corruption; moreover, the abuses of the provincial military police contributed to the rise of the left-wing (Huk) movement in the countryside. His heavy-handed attempts to crush the Huks led to widespread peasant disaffection.\n\nThe good record of the Roxas administration was marred by two failures: the failure to curb graft and corruption in the government, as evidenced by the surplus war property scandal, the Chinese immigration scandal and the school supplies scandal; and the failure to check and stop the communist [[Hukbalahap]] movement.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Roxas Tomb.jpg|thumb|Gravesite of Manuel Roxas]]\n\nRoxas did not finish his full four-year term. On the morning of April 15, 1948 Roxas delivered a speech before the United States Thirteenth Air Force. After the speech, he felt dizzy and was brought to the residence of Major General [[Eugene L.

McNutt]], left for the United States.\n\nOn May 28, 1946, Roxas was inaugurated as the last President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. The inaugural ceremonies were held in the ruins of the Legislative Building (now part of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]) and were witnessed by about 200,000 people. In his address, he outlined the main policies of his administration, mainly: closer ties with the United States; adherence to the newly created [[United Nations]]; national reconstruction; relief for the masses; social justice for the working class; the maintenance of peace and order; the preservation of individual rights and liberties of the citizenry; and honesty and efficiency of government.\n\nOn June 3, 1946, Roxas appeared for the first time before a [[joint session]] of Congress to deliver his first [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the Nation Address]].

The occasion, attended by some 300,000 people, was marked by the simultaneous lowering of the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] and raising of the [[Flag of the Philippines|National Flag]], a [[21-gun salute]], and the pealing of church bells. Roxas then swore the Oath of Office as the first President of the new Republic.\n\nThe inaugural ceremonies took place at [[Luneta Park]] in the [[City of Manila]]. On the Grandstand alone were around 3,000 dignitaries and guests, consisting of President Roxas, Vice-President Quirino, their respective parties and the Cabinet; the last High Commissioner to the Philippines and first [[Embassy of the United States|Ambassador to the Philippines]] Paul McNutt; General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (coming from [[Tokyo]]); [[United States Postmaster General]] [[Robert E.

The Inaugurals of the Presidents of the Philippines|publisher=Anvil Publishing, Inc.}}\n}}\nNo sooner had the fanfare of the [[independence]] festivities ended that the government and the people quickly put all hands to work in the tasks of rescuing the country from its dire economic straits. Reputed to be the most bombed and destroyed country in the world, the Philippines was in a sorry mess. Only [[Stalingrad]] and [[Warsaw]], for instance, could compare with [[Manila]] in point of destruction. All over the country more than a million people were unaccounted for. The war casualties as such could very well reach the two million mark. Conservative estimates had it that the [[Philippines]] had lost about two thirds of her material wealth.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\">Molina, Antonio. ''The Philippines: Through the centuries''. Manila: University of Sto. Tomas Cooperative, 1961. Print.</ref>\n\nThe country was facing near bankruptcy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/> There was no national economy, no export trade. Indeed, production for exports had not been restored. On the other hand, imports were to reach the amount of three million dollars. There was need of immediate aid from the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]]. Something along this line was obtained. Again, loans from the United States, as well as some increase in the national revenues, were to help the new Republic.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>\n\nPresident Roxas, with bold steps, met the situation with the same confidence he exuded in his inaugural address, when he said: \"The system of free but guided enterprise is our system\". Among the main remedies proposed was the establishment of the Philippine Rehabilitation Finance Corporation. This entity would be responsible for the construction of twelve thousand houses and for the grant of easy-term loans in the amount of 177,000,000 pesos. Another proposal was the creation of the [[Central Bank of the Philippines]] to help stabilize the Philippine dollar reserves and coordinate and the nations banking activities gearing them to the economic progress.\n\nConcentrating on the sugar industry, President Roxas would exert such efforts as to succeed in increasing production from 13,000 tons at the time of the Philippine liberation to an all-high of one million tons.<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>\n\n=====Reconstruction after the war=====\nThe [[World War II|postwar]] Philippines had burned cities and towns, ruined farms and factories, blasted roads and bridges, shattered industries and commerce, and thousands of massacred victims. The war had paralyzed the educational system, where 80% of the school buildings, their equipment, laboratories and furniture were destroyed.<ref>Gallego, Manuel V. \"The Technique of Japanese Cultural Invasion.\" ''Philippine Journal of Education.'' Manila, November 1946, p. 94</ref> Numberless books, invaluable documents and works of art, irreplaceable historical relics and family [[heirloom]]s, hundreds of churches and temples were burned. The reconstruction of the damaged school buildings alone cost more than [[Philippine peso|Php]] 126,000,000,000.\n\nThe new Republic began to function on an annual deficit of over Php 200,000,000 with little prospect of a balanced budget for some years to come.<ref>Message of His Excellency Manuel Roxas, President of the Philippines to the Second Congress delivered on June 3, 1946.

Laurel]] (1943\u20131945).<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/> The Amnesty Proclamation did not apply to those \"collaborators\", who were charged with the commission of common crimes, such as murder, rape, and arson.

The efficient [[Blue LED]] completing the color triad did not commercially arrive until the late 1980s. \n\nIn the late 1980s, Aluminium Indium Gallium Phosphide LEDs arrived. They provided an efficient source of red and amber and were used in information displays. However, it was still impossible to achieve full colour. The available \"green\" was hardly green at all \u2013 mostly yellow, and an early blue needed a power station to run it. It was only when Shuji Nakumura, then at Nichia Chemical, announced the development of the blue (and later green) LED based on Indium Gallium Nitride, that possibilities opened for big LED video displays.\n\nThe entire idea of what could be done with LED was given an early shake up by Mark Fisher\u2019s design for U2\u2019s \u201cPopmart\u201d tour of 1997. He realized that with long viewing distances, wide pixel spacing could be used to achieve very large images, especially if viewed at night. The system had to be suitable for touring so an open mesh arrangement that could be rolled up for transport was used. The whole display was 52m (170ft) wide and 17m (56ft) high. It had a total of 150,000 pixels. The company that supplied the LED pixels and their driving system, SACO Technologies of Montreal, had never engineered a video system before, previously building mimic panels for power station control rooms.\n\nToday, large displays use high-brightness diodes to generate a wide spectrum of colors. It took three decades and [[organic light-emitting diodes]] for Sony to introduce an OLED TV, the [[Sony XEL-1]] OLED screen which was marketed in 2009. Later, at [[CES 2012]], Sony presented [[Crystal LED]], a TV with a true LED-display, in which LEDs are used to produce actual images rather than acting as backlighting for other types of display, as in [[LED-backlit LCD]]s which are commonly marketed as LED TVs.\n\n==Large video-capable screens==\n\n<!-- Jumbotron\n     Sony Crystal LED\n     Samsung Onyx for Cinema\n     Direct View LED Video Walls -->\n\nThe [[2011 UEFA Champions League Final]] match between [[Manchester United]] and [[Barcelona F.C.|Barcelona]] was broadcast live in [[3D television|3D]] format in [[Gothenburg]] (Sweden), on an [[EKTA]] screen.

Mitchell's paper and operational prototype projected the future replacement of CRTs and included foreseen applications to battery operated devices due the advantages of low power consumption.  Displacement of the electromagnetic scan systems included the removal of inductive deflection, electron beam and color convergence circuits and has been a significant achievement.  The unique properties of the light emitting diode as an emissive device simplifies matrix scanning complexity and has helped the modern television adapt to digital communications and shrink into its current thin form factor.\n\nThe 1977 model was monochromatic by design.\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n[[MicroLED]] displays are currently under development by numerous major corporations such as Apple, Samsung, and LG. \n\nThese displays are easily scalable, and offer a more streamlined production process.

The first practical LED was invented by [[Nick Holonyak]] in 1962 while he was at [[General Electric]].<ref name=\"LEMELSON-MIT\">{{cite news|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/n-pressreleases/n-press-04LMP.html |title=Inventor of Long-Lasting, Low-Heat Light Source Awarded $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize for Invention |date=April 21, 2004 |agency=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |accessdate=December 21, 2011 |location=Washington, D.C. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009111042/http://web.mit.edu/invent/n-pressreleases/n-press-04LMP.html |archivedate=October 9, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe first practical LED display was developed at [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) and introduced in 1968.<ref name=\"Kramer\">{{cite book |last1=Kramer |first1=Bernhard |title=Advances in Solid State Physics |date=2003 |publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]] |isbn=9783540401506 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oREQToB2q2UC&pg=PA40}}</ref> Its development was led by Howard C. Borden, Gerald P. Pighini, and Egyptian engineer [[Mohamed M. Atalla]], at HP Associates and [[HP Labs]], who had engaged in [[research and development]] (R&D) on practical LEDs between 1962 and 1968. In February 1969, they introduced the HP Model 5082-7000 Numeric Indicator.<ref name=\"Borden\">{{cite journal |last1=Borden |first1=Howard C. |last2=Pighini |first2=Gerald P. |title=Solid-State Displays |journal=[[Hewlett-Packard Journal]] |date=February 1969 |pages=2-12 |url=http://hparchive.com/Journals/HPJ-1969-02.pdf}}</ref> It was the first LED device to use [[integrated circuit]] (integrated [[LED circuit]]) technology,<ref name=\"Borden\"/> and the first intelligent LED display, making it a revolution in [[digital display]] technology, replacing the [[Nixie tube]] and becoming the basis for later LED displays.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hewlett-Packard 5082-7000 |url=http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=1052 |website=The Vintage Technology Association |accessdate=15 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarly models were monochromatic by design. The efficient [[Blue LED]] completing the color triad did not commercially arrive until the late 1980s. \n\nIn the late 1980s, Aluminium Indium Gallium Phosphide LEDs arrived. They provided an efficient source of red and amber and were used in information displays. However, it was still impossible to achieve full colour. The available \"green\" was hardly green at all \u2013 mostly yellow, and an early blue needed a power station to run it. It was only when Shuji Nakumura, then at Nichia Chemical, announced the development of the blue (and later green) LED based on Indium Gallium Nitride, that possibilities opened for big LED video displays.\n\nThe entire idea of what could be done with LED was given an early shake up by Mark Fisher\u2019s design for U2\u2019s \u201cPopmart\u201d tour of 1997. He realized that with long viewing distances, wide pixel spacing could be used to achieve very large images, especially if viewed at night. The system had to be suitable for touring so an open mesh arrangement that could be rolled up for transport was used. The whole display was 52m (170ft) wide and 17m (56ft) high. It had a total of 150,000 pixels. The company that supplied the LED pixels and their driving system, SACO Technologies of Montreal, had never engineered a video system before, previously building mimic panels for power station control rooms.\n\nToday, large displays use high-brightness diodes to generate a wide spectrum of colors. It took three decades and [[organic light-emitting diodes]] for Sony to introduce an OLED TV, the [[Sony XEL-1]] OLED screen which was marketed in 2009. Later, at [[CES 2012]], Sony presented [[Crystal LED]], a TV with a true LED-display, in which LEDs are used to produce actual images rather than acting as backlighting for other types of display, as in [[LED-backlit LCD]]s which are commonly marketed as LED TVs.\n\n==Large video-capable screens==\n\n<!-- Jumbotron\n     Sony Crystal LED\n     Samsung Onyx for Cinema\n     Direct View LED Video Walls -->\n\nThe [[2011 UEFA Champions League Final]] match between [[Manchester United]] and [[Barcelona F.C.|Barcelona]] was broadcast live in [[3D television|3D]] format in [[Gothenburg]] (Sweden), on an [[EKTA]] screen. It had a [[refresh rate]] of 100&nbsp;Hz, a [[Screen size|diagonal]] of 7.11 m (23&nbsp;ft 3.92 in) and a [[Screen size|display area]] of 6.192\u00d73.483 m, and was listed in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the largest LED 3D TV.<ref>[http://www.ekta-led.com/news/itm/527/ EKTA\u2019s Ukrainian produced 3D Led TV makes The Guinness Book of World Records] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018191329/http://www.ekta-led.com/news/itm/527/ |date=2011-10-18 }}, www.ekta-led.com</ref><ref>[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/largest-led-3d-tv/ Largest LED 3D TV]. guinnessworldrecords.com</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n=== Early prototypes ===\nA claim for the 'first all-LED flat panel television screen\u2018 is presented in this section.

Additional recognition included letters from Iowa senators John Culver and Dick Clark, the Air Force, the Army, college and university letters acknowledging the Westinghouse STS  paper entry.</ref>  This project marked some of the earliest progresses towards the replacement of the 70+-year-old high-voltage analog CRT system ([[cathode-ray tube]] technology) with a digital x-y scanned LED matrix driven with a NTSC television RF video format.  Mitchell's paper and operational prototype projected the future replacement of CRTs and included foreseen applications to battery operated devices due the advantages of low power consumption.  Displacement of the electromagnetic scan systems included the removal of inductive deflection, electron beam and color convergence circuits and has been a significant achievement.  The unique properties of the light emitting diode as an emissive device simplifies matrix scanning complexity and has helped the modern television adapt to digital communications and shrink into its current thin form factor.\n\nThe 1977 model was monochromatic by design.\n\n=== Recent developments ===\n[[MicroLED]] displays are currently under development by numerous major corporations such as Apple, Samsung, and LG. \n\nThese displays are easily scalable, and offer a more streamlined production process.

Under the leadership of [[E. Cardon Walker]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]] opened in 1983 in Japan with instant success, forming a catalyst for international expansion. In late 1984 the heads of Disney's theme park division, Dick Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park. Britain, France, Italy and Spain were all considered. However, Britain and Italy were dropped from the list due to both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land. By March 1985, the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France and two in Spain. Both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a Disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to Disney.\n\nBoth Spanish sites were located near the Mediterranean and offered a subtropical climate similar to Disney's parks in California and Florida. Disney had asked each site to provide average temperatures for every month for the previous 40 years, which proved a complicated endeavour as none of the records were computerised and were registered on paper.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.levante-emv.com/valencia/2012/06/14/ano-valencia-sono-disney/913079.html|title=El a\u00f1o en que Valencia so\u00f1\u00f3 con la Disney [The year that Valencia dreamed about Disney]|work=[[Levante-EMV]] (in Spanish)|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> The site in [[Pego, Alicante]] became the front-runner, but the location was controversial as it would have meant the destruction of Marjal de Pego-Oliva marshlands, a site of natural beauty and one of the last homes of the almost extinct [[Samaruc]] or Valencia Toothcarp, so there was some local outcry among environmentalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://lamarinaplaza.com/2018/01/14/1985-el-ano-en-que-disney-casi-se-instala-en-pego/|title=El a\u00f1o en que Disney casi se instala en Pego [The year that Disney almost set up in Pego]|work=[[La Marina Plaza]] (in Spanish)|date=14 January 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> Disney had also shown interest in a site near [[Toulon]] in [[southern France]], not far from [[Marseille]]. The pleasing landscape of that region, as well as its climate, made the location a top competitor for what would be called Euro Disneyland. However, shallow bedrock was encountered beneath the site, which would have rendered construction too difficult. Finally, a site in the rural town of Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e was chosen because of its proximity to Paris and its central location in Western Europe. This location was estimated to be no more than a four-hour drive for 68 million people and no more than a two-hour flight for a further 300&nbsp;million.\n\n[[Michael Eisner]], Disney's CEO at the time, signed the first letter of agreement with the [[Cabinet of France|French government]] for the {{convert|20|km2|acre|-1|adj=on}} site on 18 December 1985, and the first financial contracts were drawn up during the following spring.

In order to accomplish this, 29 restaurants were built inside the park (with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and five at Festival Disney). [[Menu]]s and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney's precedent of serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park.\n\n2,300 [[patio]] seats (30% of park seating) were installed to satisfy Europeans' expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather. In [[test kitchen]]s at Walt Disney World, recipes were adapted for European tastes. Walter Meyer, executive [[chef]] for menu development at Euro Disney and executive chef of food projects development at Walt Disney World noted, \"A few things we did need to change, but most of the time people kept telling us, 'Do your own thing.

We are who we are.\"<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nTopics of controversy also included Disney's American managers requiring English to be spoken at all meetings and Disney's appearance code for members of staff, which listed regulations and limitations for the use of makeup, facial hair, tattoos, jewellery, and more.\n\nFrench labour unions mounted protests against the appearance code, which they saw as \"an attack on individual liberty\". Others criticised Disney as being insensitive to French culture, individualism, and privacy, because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under [[French law]], unless it could be demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary.\n\nDisney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long-term success of the park. \"For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint,\" said Thor Degelmann, Euro Disney's personnel director. \"Without it we couldn't be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting.\"<ref>Anne Ferguson, ''Maximising the Mouse.''

The press were able to visit the day before the park's opening day on 12 April.\n\nOn 12 April 1992, Euro Disney Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened.  Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads. A government survey indicated that half a million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut the direct [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible.<ref name=\"thunderbird\"/> Due to the European recession that August, the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do and an overabundance of hotels, leading to underperformance.<ref name=\"Disneyland Paris Brief History\">{{cite web|last=Solarius|title=Disneyland Paris Brief History|url=http://www.solarius.com/dvp/dlp/dlp-history.htm|publisher=Solarius|accessdate=28 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211162227/http://www.solarius.com/dvp/dlp/dlp-history.htm|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA new Indiana Jones roller-coaster ride was opened at Euro Disney in 1993.

It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. The disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by the [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] and increased unemployment, which was affecting France and most of the rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort began, the economy was still on an upswing.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSP40009620090304 | work=Reuters | title=FACTBOX:Who's next?

The Euro Disney Company stock price spiralled downwards and on 23 July 1992, Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million [[French franc]]s. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was so low that it was decided to close the [[Disney's Newport Bay Club|Newport Bay Club]] hotel during the season.\n\nInitial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts found spending to be around 12% lower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/disney-faq/disneyland-paris/ |title=Disneyland Paris (Euro Disney) Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 1996, Andre Willey/Tom Drynda |publisher=Faqs.org |accessdate=23 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922165130/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/disney-faq/disneyland-paris/ |archivedate=22 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began 12 June 1993.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDF1E3FF931A25755C0A965958260|date= 12 June 1993|title=Euro Disney Adding Alcohol |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy the summer of 1994, Euro Disney was burdened with $3 billion worth of debt.

It opened on 1 April 1992 and is notably served by [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|regional express]] line [[RER A]] which provides a direct connection with the centre of Paris and for further connections, direct to Paris - Gare de Lyon.\n\nThe railway station is also served by long-distance high-speed [[TGV]] and [[Ouigo]] trains offering direct services to many cities across France.  There are services from and to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]], Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International by [[Eurostar]]. There are also Thalys services to both Brussels and Amsterdam.\n\nFree shuttle buses provide transport to all Disney hotels and Les Villages Nature<sup>\u00ae</sup> Paris (except Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch) and Associated Hotels.\n\n===Backstage Disney===\nDisneyland Paris has strict rules designed to prevent guests from seeing backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly forbidden in all backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not for the public to see. Numerous area gates allow entrance into the park for cast members, parade floats, etc. When area gates around the park are open, anything that can be seen through them is considered to be on-stage and part of the Disney Magic. Therefore, from the moment the gates are open, all of the cast must be in character and in place to 'perform'. As the complex is so big, shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the parks via service roads located around the perimeter of the parks.\n\nMany attractions are housed in large, soundstage-like buildings called \"show buildings\", some of which are partially or completely disguised by external theming. Most show buildings have off-white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for maintenance cast members. Housed inside show buildings are the actual attractions, which include hidden walkways, service areas, control rooms, and other backstage operations.\n\n===Attendance===\n\n{{Article d\u00e9taill\u00e9|Euro Disney#Donn\u00e9es op\u00e9rationnelles{{!}}Donn\u00e9es op\u00e9rationnelles d'Euro Disney SCA}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable centre\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"90%\"\n|+ '''Fr\u00e9quentation annuelle et rang mondial des parcs de ''Disneyland Paris'''''<br /><small>(En milliers de visiteurs et rang mondial entre parenth\u00e8se)</small>\n|- \n! scope=column width=200px | Ann\u00e9e \n!

A second theme park, [[Walt Disney Studios Park]], opened in 2002, 10 years after the original park. Disneyland Paris celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2017. Within 25 years of opening, 320 million people visited Disneyland Paris, making it the most visited theme park in Europe.<ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/disneyland-paris.htm |title=Disneyland Paris facts and information |author= | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-09-09}}</ref> The Parisian resort is the second [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney park]] to open outside the United States following the opening of the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]] in 1983 and is the largest Disney resort to open outside of the United States. Disneyland Paris is also the only Disney resort outside of the United States to be completely owned by The Walt Disney Company.\n\n==Ownership==\nWalt Disney announced a \u20ac1 billion ($1.25 billion) bailout plan to rescue its subsidiary Disneyland Paris, the Financial Times reported on 6 October 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/332bbed8-4d2c-11e4-8f75-00144feab7de|title=Euro Disney faces \u20ac1bn bailout by Walt Disney parent|last=Carnegy|first=Hugh|date=6 October 2014|work=Financial Times|accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> The park is burdened by its debt, which is calculated at about \u20ac1.75 billion ($2.20 billion) and roughly 15 times its gross average earnings.\n\nUntil June 2017, Disney only held a minority stake in the resort, when they bought the remaining shares. In 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]] offered an informal takeover of Euro Disney S.C.A., buying 9% of the company from [[Kingdom Holding]] and an open offer of 2 euros per share for the remaining stock. This brought The Walt Disney Company's total ownership to 85.7%. The Walt Disney company will also invest an additional 1.5 Billion euros to strengthen the company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://weloveorlandofl.com/breaking-disney-company-takes-full-ownership-of-disneyland-paris/|title=The Walt Disney Company takes full ownership of Disneyland Paris Resort|date=13 June 2017|website=We Love Orlando|access-date=13 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Seeking a location for a European resort===\n\nFollowing the success of Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in Florida, plans to build a similar theme park in Europe emerged In 1972. Under the leadership of [[E. Cardon Walker]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]] opened in 1983 in Japan with instant success, forming a catalyst for international expansion. In late 1984 the heads of Disney's theme park division, Dick Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park. Britain, France, Italy and Spain were all considered. However, Britain and Italy were dropped from the list due to both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land. By March 1985, the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France and two in Spain. Both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a Disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to Disney.\n\nBoth Spanish sites were located near the Mediterranean and offered a subtropical climate similar to Disney's parks in California and Florida. Disney had asked each site to provide average temperatures for every month for the previous 40 years, which proved a complicated endeavour as none of the records were computerised and were registered on paper.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.levante-emv.com/valencia/2012/06/14/ano-valencia-sono-disney/913079.html|title=El a\u00f1o en que Valencia so\u00f1\u00f3 con la Disney [The year that Valencia dreamed about Disney]|work=[[Levante-EMV]] (in Spanish)|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> The site in [[Pego, Alicante]] became the front-runner, but the location was controversial as it would have meant the destruction of Marjal de Pego-Oliva marshlands, a site of natural beauty and one of the last homes of the almost extinct [[Samaruc]] or Valencia Toothcarp, so there was some local outcry among environmentalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://lamarinaplaza.com/2018/01/14/1985-el-ano-en-que-disney-casi-se-instala-en-pego/|title=El a\u00f1o en que Disney casi se instala en Pego [The year that Disney almost set up in Pego]|work=[[La Marina Plaza]] (in Spanish)|date=14 January 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> Disney had also shown interest in a site near [[Toulon]] in [[southern France]], not far from [[Marseille]]. The pleasing landscape of that region, as well as its climate, made the location a top competitor for what would be called Euro Disneyland. However, shallow bedrock was encountered beneath the site, which would have rendered construction too difficult. Finally, a site in the rural town of Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e was chosen because of its proximity to Paris and its central location in Western Europe.

[[Menu]]s and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney's precedent of serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park.\n\n2,300 [[patio]] seats (30% of park seating) were installed to satisfy Europeans' expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather. In [[test kitchen]]s at Walt Disney World, recipes were adapted for European tastes.

We are who we are.\"<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nTopics of controversy also included Disney's American managers requiring English to be spoken at all meetings and Disney's appearance code for members of staff, which listed regulations and limitations for the use of makeup, facial hair, tattoos, jewellery, and more.\n\nFrench labour unions mounted protests against the appearance code, which they saw as \"an attack on individual liberty\". Others criticised Disney as being insensitive to French culture, individualism, and privacy, because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under [[French law]], unless it could be demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary.\n\nDisney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long-term success of the park. \"For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint,\" said Thor Degelmann, Euro Disney's personnel director. \"Without it we couldn't be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting.\"<ref>Anne Ferguson, ''Maximising the Mouse.''

The press were able to visit the day before the park's opening day on 12 April.\n\nOn 12 April 1992, Euro Disney Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened.  Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads. A government survey indicated that half a million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut the direct [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible.<ref name=\"thunderbird\"/> Due to the European recession that August, the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do and an overabundance of hotels, leading to underperformance.<ref name=\"Disneyland Paris Brief History\">{{cite web|last=Solarius|title=Disneyland Paris Brief History|url=http://www.solarius.com/dvp/dlp/dlp-history.htm|publisher=Solarius|accessdate=28 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211162227/http://www.solarius.com/dvp/dlp/dlp-history.htm|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA new Indiana Jones roller-coaster ride was opened at Euro Disney in 1993.

There were rumours that Euro Disney was getting close to having to file for bankruptcy. The banks and the backers had meetings to work out some of the financial problems facing Euro Disney. In March 1994 Team Disney went into negotiations with the banks so that they could get some help for their debt. As a last resort, the Walt Disney Company threatened to close the Disneyland Paris park, leaving the banks with the land.<ref name=\"Disneyland Paris Brief History\"/>\n\n===Financial, attendance and employment struggles===\n[[File:Lake of Disney Village 2.jpg|thumb|left|Disney's Newport Bay Club]]\nIn May 1992, entertainment magazine ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce \u2013 approximately 3,000 people \u2013 had resigned from their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. The disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by the [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] and increased unemployment, which was affecting France and most of the rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort began, the economy was still on an upswing.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSP40009620090304 | work=Reuters | title=FACTBOX:Who's next?

In response to the financial situation, Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney-MGM Studios Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be made. Prices at the hotels were reduced.\n \nDespite these efforts in May 1992, park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro Disney Company stock price spiralled downwards and on 23 July 1992, Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million [[French franc]]s. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was so low that it was decided to close the [[Disney's Newport Bay Club|Newport Bay Club]] hotel during the season.\n\nInitial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts found spending to be around 12% lower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/disney-faq/disneyland-paris/ |title=Disneyland Paris (Euro Disney) Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 1996, Andre Willey/Tom Drynda |publisher=Faqs.org |accessdate=23 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922165130/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/disney-faq/disneyland-paris/ |archivedate=22 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began 12 June 1993.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDF1E3FF931A25755C0A965958260|date= 12 June 1993|title=Euro Disney Adding Alcohol |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy the summer of 1994, Euro Disney was burdened with $3 billion worth of debt.

It opened on 1 April 1992 and is notably served by [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|regional express]] line [[RER A]] which provides a direct connection with the centre of Paris and for further connections, direct to Paris - Gare de Lyon.\n\nThe railway station is also served by long-distance high-speed [[TGV]] and [[Ouigo]] trains offering direct services to many cities across France.  There are services from and to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]], Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International by [[Eurostar]]. There are also Thalys services to both Brussels and Amsterdam.\n\nFree shuttle buses provide transport to all Disney hotels and Les Villages Nature<sup>\u00ae</sup> Paris (except Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch) and Associated Hotels.\n\n===Backstage Disney===\nDisneyland Paris has strict rules designed to prevent guests from seeing backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly forbidden in all backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not for the public to see. Numerous area gates allow entrance into the park for cast members, parade floats, etc. When area gates around the park are open, anything that can be seen through them is considered to be on-stage and part of the Disney Magic. Therefore, from the moment the gates are open, all of the cast must be in character and in place to 'perform'. As the complex is so big, shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the parks via service roads located around the perimeter of the parks.\n\nMany attractions are housed in large, soundstage-like buildings called \"show buildings\", some of which are partially or completely disguised by external theming. Most show buildings have off-white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for maintenance cast members. Housed inside show buildings are the actual attractions, which include hidden walkways, service areas, control rooms, and other backstage operations.\n\n===Attendance===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:777 height:336\n\n#hoogte yas 200px-30px marge is 170px voor grafiek\n\nPlotArea = left:70 right:10 top:10 bottom:20\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nAlignBars = justify\nColors =\n id:gray1 value:gray(0.9)\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod = from:1992 till:2020\n\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:1992\nPlotData =\n bar:16000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde8_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:14000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde7_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:12000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde6_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:10000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde5_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:8000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde4_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:6000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde3_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:4000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde2_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:2000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde1_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:0 color:gray1\n\n# berekening van xwaarde punt: 70+((jaartal-jaartalminimum)\u00d725)\n# berekening van ywaarde punt: 20+((305/16.000.000)\u00d7bezoekers)\n\nLineData =\n layer:front\n points:(70,180)(75,180) color:blue width:2 #1992: 8.400.000\n points:(75,180)(95,207) color:blue width:2 #1993: 9.800.000\n points:(95,207)(120,188) color:blue width:2 #1994: 8.800.000\n points:(120,188)(145,235) color:blue width:2 #1995: 11.300.000\n points:(145,235)(170,245) color:blue width:2 #1996: 11.800.000\n points:(170,245)(195,264) color:blue width:2 #1997: 12.800.000\n points:(195,264)(220,258) color:blue width:2 #1998: 12.500.000\n points:(220,258)(245,258) color:blue width:2 #1999: 12.500.000\n points:(245,258)(270,249) color:blue width:2 #2000: 12.000.000\n points:(270,249)(295,251) color:blue width:2 #2001: 12.100.000\n points:(295,251)(320,275) color:blue width:2 #2002: 13.400.000\n points:(320,275)(345,256) color:blue width:2 #2003: 12.400.000\n points:(345,256)(370,254) color:blue width:2 #2004: 12.300.000\n points:(370,254)(395,254) color:blue width:2 #2005: 12.300.000\n points:(395,254)(420,270) color:blue width:2 #2006: 13.100.000\n points:(420,270)(445,296) color:blue width:2 #2007: 14.500.000\n points:(445,296)(470,312) color:blue width:2 #2008: 15.300.000\n points:(470,312)(495,314) color:blue width:2 #2009: 15.400.690\n points:(495,314)(520,309) color:blue width:2 #2010: 15.158.800\n points:(520,309)(545,319) color:blue width:2 #2011: 15.700.000\n points:(545,319)(570,325) color:blue width:2 #2012: 16.000.000\n points:(570,325)(595,304) color:blue width:2 #2013: 14.900.000\n points:(595,304)(620,291) color:blue width:2 #2014: 14.200.000\n points:(620,291)(645,302) color:blue width:2 #2015: 14.800.000\n points:(645,302)(670,275) color:blue width:2 #2016: 13.400.000\n points:(670,275)(695,303) color:blue width:2 #2017: 14.860.000\n #points:(695,303)(720,???) color:blue width:2 #2018: ???\n #points:(720,???)(745,???) color:blue width:2 #2019: ???\n #points:(745,???)(770,???) color:blue width:2 #2020: ???\n\n{{Article d\u00e9taill\u00e9|Euro Disney#Donn\u00e9es op\u00e9rationnelles{{!}}Donn\u00e9es op\u00e9rationnelles d'Euro Disney SCA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable centre\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"90%\"\n|+ '''Fr\u00e9quentation annuelle et rang mondial des parcs de ''Disneyland Paris'''''<br /><small>(En milliers de visiteurs et rang mondial entre parenth\u00e8se)</small>\n|- \n! scope=column width=200px | Ann\u00e9e \n!

The discovery that the loss of ECM1 expression leads to the symptoms associated with Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease suggests that ECM1 may contribute to skin adhesion, epidermal differentiation, and wound healing and scarring.<ref name=Hamada-etal-2002/>  It is also thought to play a role in endochondral bone formation, tumor biology, endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\nThe dermatological symptoms are caused by a buildup of a [[hyaline]] material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/> The nature of this material is unknown, but researchers have suggested that it may be a glycoprotein, a [[glycolipid]], an acid [[mucopolysaccharide]], altered [[collagen]] or elastic tissue.<ref name=Caro-1978/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is typically diagnosed by its clinical dermatological manifestations, particularly the beaded papules on the eyelids.  Doctors can also test the hyaline material with a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, as the material colors strongly for this stain.<ref name=Caro-1978/>\n\nImmunohistochemical skin labeling for [[antibody|antibodies]] for the ECM1 protein as labeling has been shown to be reduced in the skin of those affected by Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease.<ref name = Chan-etal-2007/>  Staining with anti-type IV collagen antibodies or anti-type VII collagen antibodies reveals bright, thick bands at the [[dermoepidermal junction]].<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\nNon-contrast [[computed tomography|CT scans]] can image calcifications, but this is not typically used as a means of diagnosing the disease.  This is partly due to the fact that not all Urbach-Wiethe patients exhibit calcifications, but also because similar lesions can be formed from other diseases such as [[herpes simplex]] and [[encephalitis]].  The discovery of mutations within the ECM1 gene has allowed the use of genetic testing to confirm initial clinical diagnoses of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease.  It also allows doctors to better distinguish between Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease and other similar diseases not caused by mutations in ECM1.\n\n== Treatment ==\nCurrently, there is no cure for Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease although there are some ways to individually treat many of its symptoms.  There has been some success with oral [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO) and intralesional [[heparin]], but this is not true in all cases.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/><ref name = Cinaz-1993/> D-[[penicillamine]] has also shown promise, but has yet to have been used extensively.<ref name = Chan-etal-2007/>  There are also some reports of patients being treated with [[etretinate]], a drug typically prescribed to treat [[psoriasis]].<ref name=Bahadir-etal-2006/> In some cases, calcifications in the brain can lead to abnormal electrical activity among neurons.  Some patients are given anti-seizure medication to help deal with these abnormalities.  [[Tracheostomy]] is often used to relieve upper respiratory tract infections. [[Carbon dioxide]] laser surgery of thickened [[vocal folds|vocal cords]] and beaded eyelid papules have improved these symptoms for patients.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>  The discovery of the mutations of the ECM1 gene has opened the possibility of gene therapy or a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] EMC1 protein for Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease treatment, but neither of these two options are currently available.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is typically not a life-threatening condition.<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/> The life expectancy of these patients is normal as long as the potential side effects of thickening mucosa, such as respiratory obstruction, are properly addressed.<ref name=Appenzeller-etal-2006-Neuroimaging16/> Although this may require a tracheostomy or carbon dioxide laser surgery, such steps can help ensure that individuals with Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease are able to live a full life.  Oral [[dimethyl sulfoxide]]&nbsp;(DMSO) has been shown to reduce skin lesions, helping to minimize discomfort for these individuals.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\n== Incidence ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is very rare; there are fewer than 300 reported cases in [[medical literature]].<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/> Although Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease can be found worldwide, almost a quarter of reported diagnoses are in [[South Africa]].<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/> Many of these are in patients of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[German people|German]], and [[Khoisan]] ancestry.<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/><ref name=Hamada-etal-2002/> This high frequency is thought to be due to the [[founder effect]].<ref name = Chan-etal-2007/> Due to its recessive genetic cause and the ability to be a carrier of the disease without symptoms, Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease often runs in families.  In some regions of South Africa, up to one in 12 individuals may be carriers of the disease.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>  Most of the case studies involving Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease patients involve only one to three cases and these cases are often in the same family.  Due to its low incidence, it is difficult to find a large enough number of cases to adequately study the disease.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1908, what appears to be the first case of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease was reported by [[Friedrich Siebenmann]], a professor of [[otolaryngology]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].  In 1925, [[Friedrich Miescher]], a Swiss dermatologist, reported on three similar patients.<ref name=Caro-1978/> An official report of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease was first described in 1929 by a Viennese dermatologist and otorhinolaryngologist, Urbach and Wiethe.<ref name = Hamada-etal-2002/> Its original name of 'lipoidosis cutis et mucosae' was changed to 'lipoid proteinosis cutis et mucosae' due to Urbach's belief that the condition was due to abnormal [[lipid]] and [[protein]] deposits within the tissues.<ref name = Hamada-etal-2002/> Some have debated as to whether or not the disease is actually a form of [[mucopolysaccharidosis]], [[amyloidosis]], or even [[porphyria]].  The discovery of the Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease causing mutation to the ECM1 gene has now provided a definitive way to differentiate Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease from these other conditions.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\n== Society ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is used as the main plot element in a 2013 Dutch novel, ''De angstjager'' (The Fear Hunter) by author [[Joris van Os]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uitgeverijdebrouwerij.nl/de-angstjager/|title=De Angstjager|first=Bravebox|last=www.bravebox.nl|date=|website=uitgeverijdebrouwerij.nl|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nReleased in 2015, ''A Fearless Life'' by author Joshua McCloskey is about a young woman's life living with Urbach-Wiethe.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Fearless Life|asin = B015ONZQ2Y|publisher = Joshua McCloskey|date = 2015-09-21|language = English|first = Joshua|last = McCloskey}}</ref>\n\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease and the case study of SM-046 are the source of the main plot elements in two stories in ''Movemind'' by author Robert New.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robertsnew.com/2018/06/25/whats-my-favourite-piece-of-my-writing/|title=What's my favourite piece of my writing?|author=|date=26 June 2018|website=robertsnew.com|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Movemind|asin = B07BQ9K92J|publisher = Tale Publishing|date = 2018-06-01|language = English|first = Robert|last = New}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[S.M.

The discovery that the loss of ECM1 expression leads to the symptoms associated with Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease suggests that ECM1 may contribute to skin adhesion, epidermal differentiation, and wound healing and scarring.<ref name=Hamada-etal-2002/>  It is also thought to play a role in endochondral bone formation, tumor biology, endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\nThe dermatological symptoms are caused by a buildup of a [[hyaline]] material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/> The nature of this material is unknown, but researchers have suggested that it may be a glycoprotein, a [[glycolipid]], an acid [[mucopolysaccharide]], altered [[collagen]] or elastic tissue.<ref name=Caro-1978/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is typically diagnosed by its clinical dermatological manifestations, particularly the beaded papules on the eyelids.  Doctors can also test the hyaline material with a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, as the material colors strongly for this stain.<ref name=Caro-1978/>\n\nImmunohistochemical skin labeling for [[antibody|antibodies]] for the ECM1 protein as labeling has been shown to be reduced in the skin of those affected by Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease.<ref name = Chan-etal-2007/>  Staining with anti-type IV collagen antibodies or anti-type VII collagen antibodies reveals bright, thick bands at the [[dermoepidermal junction]].<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\nNon-contrast [[computed tomography|CT scans]] can image calcifications, but this is not typically used as a means of diagnosing the disease.  This is partly due to the fact that not all Urbach-Wiethe patients exhibit calcifications, but also because similar lesions can be formed from other diseases such as [[herpes simplex]] and [[encephalitis]].  The discovery of mutations within the ECM1 gene has allowed the use of genetic testing to confirm initial clinical diagnoses of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease.  It also allows doctors to better distinguish between Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease and other similar diseases not caused by mutations in ECM1.\n\n== Treatment ==\nCurrently, there is no cure for Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease although there are some ways to individually treat many of its symptoms.  There has been some success with oral [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO) and intralesional [[heparin]], but this is not true in all cases.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/><ref name = Cinaz-1993/> D-[[penicillamine]] has also shown promise, but has yet to have been used extensively.<ref name = Chan-etal-2007/>  There are also some reports of patients being treated with [[etretinate]], a drug typically prescribed to treat [[psoriasis]].<ref name=Bahadir-etal-2006/> In some cases, calcifications in the brain can lead to abnormal electrical activity among neurons.  Some patients are given anti-seizure medication to help deal with these abnormalities.  [[Tracheostomy]] is often used to relieve upper respiratory tract infections. [[Carbon dioxide]] laser surgery of thickened [[vocal folds|vocal cords]] and beaded eyelid papules have improved these symptoms for patients.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>  The discovery of the mutations of the ECM1 gene has opened the possibility of gene therapy or a [[Recombinant DNA|recombinant]] EMC1 protein for Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease treatment, but neither of these two options are currently available.\n\n== Prognosis ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is typically not a life-threatening condition.<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/> The life expectancy of these patients is normal as long as the potential side effects of thickening mucosa, such as respiratory obstruction, are properly addressed.<ref name=Appenzeller-etal-2006-Neuroimaging16/> Although this may require a tracheostomy or carbon dioxide laser surgery, such steps can help ensure that individuals with Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease are able to live a full life.  Oral [[dimethyl sulfoxide]]&nbsp;(DMSO) has been shown to reduce skin lesions, helping to minimize discomfort for these individuals.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\n== Incidence ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is very rare; there are fewer than 300 reported cases in [[medical literature]].<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/> Although Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease can be found worldwide, almost a quarter of reported diagnoses are in [[South Africa]].<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/> Many of these are in patients of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[German people|German]], and [[Khoisan]] ancestry.<ref name=DiGiandomenico-etal-2006/><ref name=Hamada-etal-2002/> This high frequency is thought to be due to the [[founder effect]].<ref name = Chan-etal-2007/> Due to its recessive genetic cause and the ability to be a carrier of the disease without symptoms, Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease often runs in families.  In some regions of South Africa, up to one in 12 individuals may be carriers of the disease.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>  Most of the case studies involving Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease patients involve only one to three cases and these cases are often in the same family.  Due to its low incidence, it is difficult to find a large enough number of cases to adequately study the disease.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1908, what appears to be the first case of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease was reported by [[Friedrich Siebenmann]], a professor of [[otolaryngology]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]].  In 1925, [[Friedrich Miescher]], a Swiss dermatologist, reported on three similar patients.<ref name=Caro-1978/> An official report of Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease was first described in 1929 by a Viennese dermatologist and otorhinolaryngologist, Urbach and Wiethe.<ref name = Hamada-etal-2002/> Its original name of 'lipoidosis cutis et mucosae' was changed to 'lipoid proteinosis cutis et mucosae' due to Urbach's belief that the condition was due to abnormal [[lipid]] and [[protein]] deposits within the tissues.<ref name = Hamada-etal-2002/> Some have debated as to whether or not the disease is actually a form of [[mucopolysaccharidosis]], [[amyloidosis]], or even [[porphyria]].  The discovery of the Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease causing mutation to the ECM1 gene has now provided a definitive way to differentiate Urbach\u2013Wiethe disease from these other conditions.<ref name=Hamada-2002-C&ED/>\n\n== Society ==\nUrbach\u2013Wiethe disease is used as the main plot element in a 2013 Dutch novel, ''De angstjager'' (The Fear Hunter) by author [[Joris van Os]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uitgeverijdebrouwerij.nl/de-angstjager/|title=De Angstjager|first=Bravebox|last=www.bravebox.nl|date=|website=uitgeverijdebrouwerij.nl|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nReleased in 2015, ''A Fearless Life'' by author Joshua McCloskey is about a young woman's life living with Urbach-Wiethe.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Fearless Life|asin = B015ONZQ2Y|publisher = Joshua McCloskey|date = 2015-09-21|language = English|first = Joshua|last = McCloskey}}</ref>\n\nUrbach-Wiethe disease and the case study of SM-046 are the source of the main plot elements in two stories in ''Movemind'' by author Robert New. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://robertsnew.com/2018/06/25/whats-my-favourite-piece-of-my-writing/|title=What's my favourite piece of my writing?|author=|date=26 June 2018|website=robertsnew.com|access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite book|title = Movemind|asin = B07BQ9K92J|publisher = Tale Publishing|date = 2018-06-01|language = English|first = Robert|last = New}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[S.M.
