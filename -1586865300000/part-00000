[[Rashi]]<ref>on Genesis (37:1)</ref> comments on the subsequent elaboration on the story of Abraham that Abraham was the gem of the chronology of Genesis 11 which the Torah wanted to focus on. In the Jewish tradition, Genesis (11:26) teaches that Terah was 70 years old when he begat Abram. The Talmud<ref>Avodah Zara 9A</ref> says that Abraham was 52 years old at year 2000 AM ([[Anno Mundi]]), which means that he was born in the year 1948 AM. Rashi<ref>ad loc</ref> explains this based on Abram being born when Terah was 70. While it is a given in Jewish tradition that Genesis (11:26) relates that Abram was born when Terach was 70, which is the basis of the current Jewish year, there is yet a question whether Abram was born first as listed, or perhaps he is listed first because he was the wisest similar to Shem, Ham, and Jafeth where Shem was not the oldest, but was the wisest. [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] holds that Abram was the eldest,<ref>Seder Olam Rabbah, Chapter 2</ref> but the Talmud<ref>Sanhedrin 69B</ref> leaves the above question open.\n\n===Terah's occupation===\nAccording to rabbinical tradition Terah was a wicked (''[[Numbers Rabbah]]'' 19:1; 19:33), idolatrous priest ([[Midrash HaGadol]] on Genesis 11:28) who manufactured idols (''Eliyahu Rabbah'' 6, and ''[[Eliyahu Zuta]]'' 25). Abram, in opposition to his father\u2019s idol shop, smashed his father\u2019s idols and chased customers away. Terah then brought his unruly son before Nimrod, who threw him into a fiery furnace, yet Abram miraculously escaped ([[Genesis Rabba]] 38:13). The [[Zohar]] says that when God saved Abram from the furnace, Terah repented ([[Zohar]] Genesis 1:77b) and Rabbi Abba B. Kahana said that God assured Abram that his father Terah had a portion in the ''World to Come'' ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 30:4; 30:12).\n\n[[Hiyya bar Abba|Rabbi Hiyya]] relates this account in [[Genesis Rabba]]: \n:Terah left Abram to mind the store while he departed.  A woman came with a plateful of flour and asked Abram to offer it to the idols.  Abram then took a stick, broke the idols, and put the stick in the largest idol\u2019s hand.  When Terah returned, he demanded that Abram explain what he'd done.  Abram told his father that the idols fought among themselves and the largest broke the others with the stick.  \u201cWhy do you make sport of me?\u201d Terah cried, \u201cDo they have any knowledge?\u201d  Abram replied, \u201cListen to what you are saying!\u201d\n\n===Leader of the journey===\n\nTerah is identified as the person who arranged and led the family to embark on a mysterious journey to Canaan. It is shrouded in mystery to Jewish scholars as to why Terah began the journey and as to why the journey ended prematurely. It is suggested that he was a man in search of a greater truth that could possibly be found in the familiar<ref>Sforno, Bereishit 12:5</ref> land of Canaan, and that it was Abram who picked up the torch to continue his father's quest, that Terah himself was unable to achieve.<ref>Goldin, Shmuel.

Abram thus left [[Haran (biblical place)|Haran]] at age 75 well before Terah died. The Torah, however, relates Terah's death in Haran before Abram continues the journey to Canaan as an expression that he was not remiss in the [[Mitzvah]] of honoring a parent by leaving his aging father behind.<ref>Compare Rashi, ''Bereishis'' 11:32 with Bereishis ''Rabbah'' 39:7</ref> The significance of Terah not reaching Canaan, was a reflection of his character, a man who was unable to go \u201call the way\u201d. Though on a journey in the right direction, Terah fell short at arriving to the divine destination \u2014 in contrast to Abram, who did follow through and achieved the divine goal, and was not bound by his father\u2019s idolatrous past. Abram's following God\u2019s command to leave his father, thus absolved him from the Mitzvah of honoring parents, and as Abraham, he would go on to create a new lineage distinct from his ancestors.<ref>(''Haggadah shel Pesach'') \u2013 Levene, Osher C.

The Christian views of the time of Terah come from a passage in the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleref2|Acts|7:2\u20134|NIV}} where [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] said some things that contrast with Jewish Rabbinical views. He said that God appeared to Abraham in Mesopotamia, and directed him to leave the Chaldeans\u2014whereas most Rabbinical commentators see Terah as being the one who directed the family to leave [[Ur Kasdim]] from {{bibleref2|Genesis|11:31|NLT}}: \"Terah took his son Abram, his daughter-in-law Sarai (his son Abram's wife), and his grandson Lot (his son Haran's child) and left Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan.\" Stephen asserts that Abram left Haran after Terah died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+7:4&version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 7:4 - King James Version|author=|date=|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic tradition==\nIn some [[Islam]]ic sects, Abraham's father is believed to have been a disbelieving man,<ref name=\"Ibn Kathir, QAN\">[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]], [[Ibn Kathir]], ''Abraham and his father''</ref> due to his refusal to listen to the constant advice of his son. In fact, the earliest story involving Abraham in the [[Quran]] is his discussion with his ''ab'' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628}}, which can mean 'father'). The name given for this man in the Qur'an<ref>({{cite quran|6|74|style=ref|b=n}})</ref> is '\u0100zar' ({{lang-ar|\u0622\u0632\u0631}}), though Arab genealogists related the name of Abraham's father as 'T\u0101ra\u1e25' ({{lang-ar|\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u062d}}).<ref name=\"Ibn Kathir, QAN\"/><ref name=\"ABDILP\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]] |title=Was Azar the Father of Prophet Abraham? |url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/was-azar-father-prophet-abraham |website=Al-Islam.org |accessdate=2017-09-12 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs a father, Azar required his son's most sincere advice. Ibrahim, after receiving his first [[revelation]]s from [[God in Islam|Allah]], invited his father to the way of [[Islam]]. Abraham explained to him the faults of [[idolatry]],<ref>{{Cite quran|19|44|s=ns}}</ref> and why he was wrong to worship objects which could neither hear nor see.<ref>{{Cite quran|19|42|s=ns}}</ref> From the Quran 74/6, \"And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said to his ''ab'' Azar: Do you take idols as deities? Indeed, I see you and your people to be in manifest error.\" \nAbraham told his father that he had indeed received revelations from [[God]], knowledge which his father did not possess,<ref>{{Cite quran|19|43|s=ns}}</ref> and told him that belief in [[Allah]] would grant him immense rewards in both this life and the [[hereafter]]. Abraham concluded his preaching by warning Azar of the grave punishment he would face if he did not mend his ways.<ref>{{Cite quran|19|45|s=ns}}</ref> When Abraham offered his father the guidance and advice of Allah, he rejected it, and threatened to [[Stoning|stone]] him to death.<ref>{{Cite quran|19|46|s=ns}}</ref> Abraham prayed for his father<ref>{{Cite quran|19|47|s=ns}}</ref> to be forgiven by God, and although he continued to seek forgiveness, it was only because of a promise that he had made earlier to him. When it became clear that Azar's unrelenting hatred towards [[Tauhid|monotheism]] would never be fought, Abraham dissociated himself from him.<ref>{{Cite quran|9|114|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran states that the people of Abraham were [[Shirk (Islam)|idolaters]]. When Abraham was a young boy, he decided to finally teach his community a lesson. He said to himself that he had a plan for their idols, whilst they would be gone away.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|57|s=ns}}</ref> The Qur'an goes on to narrate that Abraham subsequently broke the idols, all except the largest, which he kept intact.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|58|s=ns}}</ref> When the people returned, they began questioning each other over the wreckage, until some of the people remembered that the youth, Abraham, had spoken of the idols earlier.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|60|s=ns}}</ref> When Abraham arrived, the people immediately began to question him, asking him whether he had anything to do with the broken idols. Abraham then, in a clever taunt, asked the people as to why they do not ask the largest of the idols, which, they believed, could indeed hear and speak.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|63|s=ns}}</ref> The people of Abraham were then confounded with shame, and admitted that the idols were incapable of anything.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|65|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nAfter the incident of the idol wreckage, the people of Abraham, while having admitted their fault, are said to have ignored Abraham's warning and instead retaliated by throwing him into a [[fire]] and exclaiming \"protect your gods\".<ref>{{Cite quran|21|68|s=ns}}</ref> Although the natural nature of fire is one of intense heat, God commanded the flame to be cool and peaceful for Abraham.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|69|s=ns}}</ref> Abraham, as a result, remained unhurt both physically and spiritually, having survived the fire of persecution. The people continued to taunt and persecute him, but to no avail, as the Qur'an says that it was they \"that lost most\".<ref>{{Cite quran|21|70|s=ns}}</ref> This means that Abraham came out unharmed and outstanded people.\n\n===Shi'ite views===\n\n====Terah as Abraham's father====\nThe [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] website ''[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|Al-Islam.org]]'' treats Azar as being Abraham's uncle, not his biological father.<ref name=\"ABDILP\"/> To justify this view, it references a passage of the Quran, which mentions that the sons of [[Jacob in Islam|Ya\u02bfq\u016bb]] (Jacob) referred to his uncle [[Ishmael in Islam|Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl]] (Ishmael), father [[Isaac in Islam|Is-\u1e25\u0101q]] (Isaac) and grandfather [[Abraham in Islam|Ibr\u0101h\u012bm]] (Abraham) as his ''\u0101b\u0101\u02be'' ({{lang-ar|\u0622\u0628\u064e\u0640\u0627\u0621}}):<ref name=\"Cite quran|2|124|e=141|s=ns\">{{cite quran|2|124|e=141|s=ns}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Were you there to see when death came upon Ya'qub?

Abram's following God\u2019s command to leave his father, thus absolved him from the Mitzvah of honoring parents, and as Abraham, he would go on to create a new lineage distinct from his ancestors.<ref>(''Haggadah shel Pesach'') \u2013 Levene, Osher C. ''People of the Book'', ({{ISBN|1568714467}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56871-446-2}}), 2004, p. 79-80</ref>\n\n==Samaritan tradition==\nIn the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] Terah dies aged 145 years and Abram leaves Haran after his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/interlinearpentateuch/online-samaritan-pentateuch-in-english/genesis|title=Google Sites|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com}}</ref>\n\n==Christian tradition==\nIn the Christian tradition Abram left Haran after Terah died. The Christian views of the time of Terah come from a passage in the [[New Testament]] at {{bibleref2|Acts|7:2\u20134|NIV}} where [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] said some things that contrast with Jewish Rabbinical views. He said that God appeared to Abraham in Mesopotamia, and directed him to leave the Chaldeans\u2014whereas most Rabbinical commentators see Terah as being the one who directed the family to leave [[Ur Kasdim]] from {{bibleref2|Genesis|11:31|NLT}}: \"Terah took his son Abram, his daughter-in-law Sarai (his son Abram's wife), and his grandson Lot (his son Haran's child) and left Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan.\" Stephen asserts that Abram left Haran after Terah died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+7:4&version=KJV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 7:4 - King James Version|author=|date=|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref>\n\n==Islamic tradition==\nIn some [[Islam]]ic sects, Abraham's father is believed to have been a disbelieving man,<ref name=\"Ibn Kathir, QAN\">[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]], [[Ibn Kathir]], ''Abraham and his father''</ref> due to his refusal to listen to the constant advice of his son. In fact, the earliest story involving Abraham in the [[Quran]] is his discussion with his ''ab'' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628}}, which can mean 'father'). The name given for this man in the Qur'an<ref>({{cite quran|6|74|style=ref|b=n}})</ref> is '\u0100zar' ({{lang-ar|\u0622\u0632\u0631}}), though Arab genealogists related the name of Abraham's father as 'T\u0101ra\u1e25' ({{lang-ar|\u062a\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u062d}}).<ref name=\"Ibn Kathir, QAN\"/><ref name=\"ABDILP\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]] |title=Was Azar the Father of Prophet Abraham? |url=https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/was-azar-father-prophet-abraham |website=Al-Islam.org |accessdate=2017-09-12 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs a father, Azar required his son's most sincere advice. Ibrahim, after receiving his first [[revelation]]s from [[God in Islam|Allah]], invited his father to the way of [[Islam]]. Abraham explained to him the faults of [[idolatry]],<ref>{{Cite quran|19|44|s=ns}}</ref> and why he was wrong to worship objects which could neither hear nor see.<ref>{{Cite quran|19|42|s=ns}}</ref> From the Quran 74/6, \"And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said to his ''ab'' Azar: Do you take idols as deities? Indeed, I see you and your people to be in manifest error.\" \nAbraham told his father that he had indeed received revelations from [[God]], knowledge which his father did not possess,<ref>{{Cite quran|19|43|s=ns}}</ref> and told him that belief in [[Allah]] would grant him immense rewards in both this life and the [[hereafter]]. Abraham concluded his preaching by warning Azar of the grave punishment he would face if he did not mend his ways.<ref>{{Cite quran|19|45|s=ns}}</ref> When Abraham offered his father the guidance and advice of Allah, he rejected it, and threatened to [[Stoning|stone]] him to death.<ref>{{Cite quran|19|46|s=ns}}</ref> Abraham prayed for his father<ref>{{Cite quran|19|47|s=ns}}</ref> to be forgiven by God, and although he continued to seek forgiveness, it was only because of a promise that he had made earlier to him. When it became clear that Azar's unrelenting hatred towards [[Tauhid|monotheism]] would never be fought, Abraham dissociated himself from him.<ref>{{Cite quran|9|114|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran states that the people of Abraham were [[Shirk (Islam)|idolaters]]. When Abraham was a young boy, he decided to finally teach his community a lesson. He said to himself that he had a plan for their idols, whilst they would be gone away.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|57|s=ns}}</ref> The Qur'an goes on to narrate that Abraham subsequently broke the idols, all except the largest, which he kept intact.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|58|s=ns}}</ref> When the people returned, they began questioning each other over the wreckage, until some of the people remembered that the youth, Abraham, had spoken of the idols earlier.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|60|s=ns}}</ref> When Abraham arrived, the people immediately began to question him, asking him whether he had anything to do with the broken idols. Abraham then, in a clever taunt, asked the people as to why they do not ask the largest of the idols, which, they believed, could indeed hear and speak.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|63|s=ns}}</ref> The people of Abraham were then confounded with shame, and admitted that the idols were incapable of anything.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|65|s=ns}}</ref>\n\nAfter the incident of the idol wreckage, the people of Abraham, while having admitted their fault, are said to have ignored Abraham's warning and instead retaliated by throwing him into a [[fire]] and exclaiming \"protect your gods\".<ref>{{Cite quran|21|68|s=ns}}</ref> Although the natural nature of fire is one of intense heat, God commanded the flame to be cool and peaceful for Abraham.<ref>{{Cite quran|21|69|s=ns}}</ref> Abraham, as a result, remained unhurt both physically and spiritually, having survived the fire of persecution. The people continued to taunt and persecute him, but to no avail, as the Qur'an says that it was they \"that lost most\".<ref>{{Cite quran|21|70|s=ns}}</ref> This means that Abraham came out unharmed and outstanded people.\n\n===Shi'ite views===\n\n====Terah as Abraham's father====\nThe [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] website ''[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project|Al-Islam.org]]'' treats Azar as being Abraham's uncle, not his biological father.<ref name=\"ABDILP\"/> To justify this view, it references a passage of the Quran, which mentions that the sons of [[Jacob in Islam|Ya\u02bfq\u016bb]] (Jacob) referred to his uncle [[Ishmael in Islam|Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl]] (Ishmael), father [[Isaac in Islam|Is-\u1e25\u0101q]] (Isaac) and grandfather [[Abraham in Islam|Ibr\u0101h\u012bm]] (Abraham) as his ''\u0101b\u0101\u02be'' ({{lang-ar|\u0622\u0628\u064e\u0640\u0627\u0621}}):<ref name=\"Cite quran|2|124|e=141|s=ns\">{{cite quran|2|124|e=141|s=ns}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Were you there to see when death came upon Ya'qub? When he said to his sons, \"What will you worship after I am gone?\" they replied, \"We shall worship your God and the God of your ''aba\u02be'', Ibrahim, Isma'il, and Is-haq, one single God: we devote ourselves to Him.\"|Qur'an, [[Al-Baqara|2]]:133<ref name=\"Cite quran|2|124|e=141|s=ns\"/>}}\n\nTherefore, the singular word ''ab'' does not always mean progenitor, and can be used for an adopter, uncle, step-father, or caretaker, unlike the word ''w\u0101lid'' ({{lang-ar|\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u0640\u062f}}, progenitor). Thus, ''Al-Islam.org'' denies that Abraham's biological father was 'Azar', and instead agreed with [[Ibn Kathir]] that he was the biblical figure 'Terah',<ref name=\"ABDILP\"/> who nevertheless treated him as a polytheist.<ref name=\"Ibn Kathir, QAN\"/>\n\nIn [[Dua]] Umme Dawood, a supplication recited by Shi'ite Muslims cited to be from the [[Imamah (Shia)|Imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the supplicant sends blessings on a person by the name of 'Taurakh'.<ref>[http://www.duas.org/ummedawoodline.htm#Who_was_Umm_D\u0101w\u016bd_ ''Duas.org'']</ref><ref>[http://www.wilayatmission.org/Duas/UmmDawood.pdf Wilayat Mission]</ref>\n\n====As Abraham's uncle ====\nIn contrast to ''Al-Islam.org'',<ref name=\"ABDILP\"/> Shi'ite scholar and jurist [[Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi]] believed{{when?|date=March 2020}} Terah to be the uncle of Abraham, not his father.<ref name=\"Modarresi 12-2017\">{{cite book |author=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi |authorlink1=Mohammad Taqi al-Modarresi |title=The Laws of Islam |date=26 March 2016 |publisher=Enlight Press |isbn=978-0-9942-4098-9 |url=http://almodarresi.com/en/books/pdf/TheLawsofIslam.pdf |access-date=22 December 2017 |ref=Modarresi |language=English}}</ref>{{rp|15}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n{{Characters and names in the Quran}}\n{{Adam to David|yes}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:21st-century BC people]]\n[[Category:Torah people]]\n[[Category:Abraham]]\n[[Category:Noach (parsha)]]\n", "name_user": "172.58.171.183", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added another reference)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terah"}

This term is used in diverse fields such as [[computer science]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[Internet slang]], [[evolutionary neuroscience]], and government.\n\n== Pronunciation and etymology ==\nThe word has alternate spellings (''[[Wikt:kludge|kludge]]'' and ''[[Wikt:kluge|kluge]]''), pronunciations ({{IPAc-en|k|l|\u028c|d\u0292}} and {{IPAc-en|k|l|u\u02d0|d\u0292}}, rhyming with ''judge'' and ''stooge'' respectively) and several proposed [[etymologies]].\n\n=== Jackson W. Granholm ===\nIn the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed., 1989), the ''kludge'' entry cites one source for this word's earliest recorded usage, definition and [[etymology]]: Jackson W. Granholm's 1962 \"How to Design a Kludge\" article, which appeared in the American [[computer magazine]] ''[[Datamation]]''.<ref>{{citation\n |title=Computer Oral History Collection, Jackson Granholm \n |author=Robina Mapstone \n |date=7 June 1973 \n |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History \n |url=http://www.invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/fa_cohc_tr_gran730607.pdf \n |format=pdf\n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130173342/http://invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/fa_cohc_tr_gran730607.pdf \n |archivedate=30 November 2006 \n}}</ref>\n<blockquote>'''kludge''' {{IPA|/klu\u02d0d\u0292/}} Also '''kluge'''. [J. W. Granholm's jocular invention: see first quot.; cf. also ''bodge'' v., ''fudge'' v.]<ref>This ''OED2'' defines these two ''kludge'' [[Cognate (etymology)|cognates]] as ''bodge'' \"to patch or mend clumsily\" and ''fudge'' \"to fit together or adjust in a clumsy, makeshift, or dishonest manner\".</ref><br>'An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole' (Granholm); esp. in ''Computing'', a machine, system, or program that has been improvised or 'bodged' together; a hastily improvised and poorly thought-out solution to a fault or 'bug'. ...</blockquote>\n\nAlthough ''OED'' accepts Granholm's definition and credits him with the invention, examples of its use before the 1960s exist.\n\nA source of some confusion has been Granholm's jocular citation of the wholly fictitious lexicographer, Phineas Burling, of the firm \"Fink and Wiggles\" (for [[Funk & Wagnalls]]) as confirming the Germanic origin of the word.\n\n<blockquote>A phone call to Phineas Burling can be revealing. Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word \"kludge\" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn (then Bishop's Lynn) and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields.\n\nThe word \"kludge\" is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German \"klug\" (Dutch ''kloog'', Swedish ''Klag'', Danish ''Klog'', Gothic ''Klaugen'', Lettish ''Kladnis'' and Sanskrit ''Veklaunn''), originally meaning \"smart\" or \"witty\". In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word \"Kludge\" eventually came to mean \"not so smart\" or \"pretty ridiculous\". Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, \"An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole.\"\n\nIt is in this latter sense that \"Kludge\" is used by computer hardware men. Today \"kludge\" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly. The amateur may readily presume that \"that's the way computers are\".<ref>{{cite book\n|title=How to Design a Kludge\n|author=Jackson W. Granholm\n|publisher=Datamation\n|date=February 1962\n|pages=30\u201331\n|url= http://neil.franklin.ch/Jokes_and_Fun/Kludge.html}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nClaims about derivation from the German adjective ''{{lang|de|klug}}'' (\"clever\") are unlikely for the following reasons:\n* There is no equivalent usage in German\n* Both pronunciations of the word contain the [[soft G|soft \"g\"]] ({{ipa|[[d\u0292]]}}), which is not present in German\n* The word emerges in English only in the 20th century\n* The alleged Swedish translation, ''klag'', is incorrect and would properly be spelled ''klok''.\n\n=== Yiddish ===\nAmerican [[Yiddish]] speakers use ''{{transl|yi|klug}}'' ({{lang|yi|{{linktext|\u05e7\u05dc\u05d5\u05d2}}}}) to mean \"too smart by half\", the reflected meaning of German ''{{lang|de|klug}}'' (\"clever\").  This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary, as well as the  pronunciation variation from German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/|title=Yiddish Dictionary Online \u05d9\u05d9\u05b4\u05d3\u05d9\u05e9 \u05f0\u05e2\u05e8\u05d8\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05b7\u05e4\u05bf\u05df \u05f0\u05e2\u05d1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== European surname ===\nIt may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge (be that German, Dutch or Scandinavian). Even if Burling's etymology were true, it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers, who began using the term in the 20th century, could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding 400 years.\n\nThis ''OED2'' entry also includes the verb ''kludge'' (\"to improvise with a kludge or kludges\") and ''kludgemanship'' (\"skill in designing or applying kludges\").\n\n=== Military jargon ===\nThe [[Jargon File]] (a.k.a. ''The New Hacker's Dictionary''), which is a [[glossary]] of computer programmer slang maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]], differentiates ''kludge'' from ''kluge'' and cites usage examples predating 1962.\n<blockquote>'''kludge'''\n# /kluhj/ n. Incorrect (though regrettably common) spelling of ''kluge'' (US).

The Jargon File gives possible etymologies from [[navy|naval]] slang (cf. [[jury rig]]) or printing equipment.\n\n''Kluge'' \"was common Navy slang in the [[World War II]] era for any piece of electronics that worked well on shore but consistently failed at sea\". A 1947 article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'' recorded the classic [[shaggy dog story]] \"'Murgatroyd the Kluge Maker' then current in the Armed Forces, in which a 'kluge' was a complex and puzzling artifact with a trivial function.\"<ref name=\"folklore\">{{cite book\n|title=Folklore from G.

Joe, New York Folklore Quarterly\n|volume=III, No. 4\n|pages=285\u2013297\n|author=Agnes Nolan Underwood\n|date=Winter 1947\n|publisher=New York Folklore Society}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''kluge'' as an overcomplicated or obscure contraption dates back at least to 1947, as evidenced by the article in the ''New York Folklore Quarterly'',<ref name=\"folklore\"/> but the term must have been in use long before that for the story to have any sense. The following purports to be a summary of the original article that is somewhat more complete than the one quoted above:\n\n<blockquote>On being drafted into the navy, Murgatroyd gave his profession as \"kluge maker\". Not wanting to seem ignorant, the clerk simply wrote this down. Whenever Murgatroyd was asked what he was doing, he said he was making a kluge, and actually he was one of the world's best kluge makers. Not wanting to seem ignorant, his superiors kept giving him commendations and promotions, until he reached the dizzy heights of commodore.\n\nOne day the admiral came to inspect the ship. When Murgatroyd explained he was a kluge maker, the admiral asked him what a kluge was&nbsp;\u2013 the first person ever to do so. Murgatroyd said it was hard to explain, but he would make one so the admiral could see what it was. After a couple of days, he returned with a complex object.\n\n\"Interesting,\" said the admiral, \"but what does it do?\" In reply, Murgatroyd dropped it over the side of the ship. As the thing sank, it went \"kluge\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://our-local.co.uk/index.php?topic=23170.5;wap2|title=Obsolete Occupations|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Jargon File further includes ''kluge around'' \"to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge\", ''kluge up'' \"to lash together a quick hack to perform a task\". After Granholm's 1962 \"How to Design a Kludge\" article popularized the ''kluge'' variant ''kludge'', both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes:\n<blockquote>The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as 'kludge'. ... British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning. </blockquote>\n\n=== Paper feeder ===\n\nAnother hypothesis dates to 1907, \"when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from [[Oslo, Norway]] named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm\". In 1919, the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which, by 1929, allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St. Paul, MN. While the automatic feeder was a success, unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being \"temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair&nbsp;\u2014 but oh, so clever!\" The Kluge brothers continued to innovate, and the company remained active as of 2017. Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name, it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions. The Free Online Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC) claims that the term kluge \"was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, was used exclusively for ''hardware'' kluges\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/kluge|title=FOLDOC \u2013 Computing Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin. FOLDOC goes on to say, \"[[TMRC]] and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang (see also [[foobar]]). It seems likely that 'kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war (many in MIT's venerable [[Building 20]], which housed TMRC until the building was demolished in 1999).\" This would explain the term's introduction to the software community.\n\n=== Acronym ===\n\nOther suggested [[folk etymologies]] or [[backronyms]] for ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' is from '''k'''lumsy, '''l'''ame, '''u'''gly, '''d'''umb, but '''g'''ood '''e'''nough, or '''k'''lutzy '''l'''ashup, '''u'''nder-'''g'''oing '''e'''ngineering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wordsimilarity.com/en/kludge|title=kludge - Synonyms of kludge {{!}} Antonyms of kludge {{!}} Definition of kludge {{!}} Example of kludge {{!}} Word Synonyms API {{!}} Word Similarity API|website=wordsimilarity.com|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''kludge'' would then seem to have independent origins, possibly in Britain. The terms tended to merge because of their similar pronunciations and meanings. However, ''kluge'' seems to have the sense of overcomplicated, while ''kludge'' has only the sense of poorly done.\n\nCf.

The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.<ref>''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film. Dialog between space crew and Ted approximately 30 minutes into the movie, following capsule power down. Ted says, \"I'm in Huntsville kludging up a simulator of the XRV.\" The film was based on the [[Marooned (novel)|1964 novel]] of the same name.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the ultimate kludge was the first [[United States|US]] [[space station]], [[Skylab]]. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], began development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the [[S-IVB]] stage of the [[Saturn 1B]] and [[Saturn V]] launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the [[Apollo Applications Program]], but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter.\n\nThe Airlock Module's manufacturer, [[McDonnell Douglas]], even recycled the hatch design from its [[Project Gemini|Gemini spacecraft]] and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module. The Skylab project, managed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later [[Johnson Space Center]]) as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight.  Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it \"the kludge\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Computer science ===\nIn modern [[computer science|computing]] terminology, a \"kludge\" (or often a \"'''hack'''\") is a solution to a problem, the performance of a task, or a fix to a system that is inefficient, inelegant (\"hacky\"), or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless (more or less) works. To \"kludge around something\" is to avoid a [[Computer bug|bug]] or some difficult condition by building a kludge, perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a [[workaround]], only without the grace. A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility, but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative. Note that a hack might be a kludge, but that ''hack'' could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Kidder\n|first=Tracey\n|title=The Soul of a New Machine\n|publisher=Avon\n|year=1982\n|isbn=978-0-380-59931-8|title-link=The Soul of a New Machine\n}}</ref> The Jargon File has a chapter dedicated to the historical significance of the word ''hack''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raymond |first1=Eric S. |title=The Jargon File: The Meaning of \u2018Hack\u2019 |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html |date=2004}}</ref>\n\nA kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of [[cruft]].\n\nSomething might be a kludge if it fails in [[corner case]]s, but this is a less common sense, as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage. More commonly, a kludge is a poorly working [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] which was expected to work adequately. An intimate knowledge of the context (i.e., problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment) is typically required to build a corner case kludge. As a consequence, they are sometimes ironically praised.\n\nAn anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s. The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long, increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}\n\nA variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a [[computer program]]. Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it, the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area, add code which divides by two when it is used, after the original code has been executed.\n\nIn computer networking, use of [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translation) (RFC 1918) or [[Port address translation|PAT]] (Port Address Translation) to cope with the  shortage of [[Internet Protocol|IPv4]] addresses is an example of a kludge.\n\nIn [[FidoNet]] terminology, ''kludge'' refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message.\n\n=== Evolutionary neuroscience ===\n{{see also|Evolutionary baggage}}\nThe ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' metaphor has been adapted in fields such as [[evolutionary neuroscience]], particularly in reference to the [[human brain]].\n\nThe neuroscientist [[David Linden]] discusses how [[intelligent design]] proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy.\n<blockquote>The transcendent aspects of our human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience (love, memory, dreams, and a predisposition for religious thought) result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history. It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings ''despite'' the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history. Rather, we have them precisely ''because'' of that history.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Linden\n|first=David J.\n|title=The Accidental Mind: How Brain Evolution Has Given Us Love, Memory, Dreams, and God\n|publisher=Belknap Press\n|year=2007\n|pages=[https://archive.org/details/accidentalmind0000lind/page/245 245\u2013246]\n|isbn=978-0-674-02478-6\n|url=https://archive.org/details/accidentalmind0000lind/page/245\n}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe research psychologist [[Gary Marcus]]'s book ''[[Kluge (book)|Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind]]'' compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like [[manifold vacuum]]-powered [[windshield wipers]]&nbsp;\u2013 when you accelerated or drove uphill, \"Your wipers slowed to a crawl, or even stopped working altogether.\"\n\n<blockquote>For instance, the vertebrate eye's [[retina]] that is installed backward, facing the back of the head rather than the front.

Granholm ===\nIn the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed., 1989), the ''kludge'' entry cites one source for this word's earliest recorded usage, definition and [[etymology]]: Jackson W. Granholm's 1962 \"How to Design a Kludge\" article, which appeared in the American [[computer magazine]] ''[[Datamation]]''.<ref>{{citation\n |title=Computer Oral History Collection, Jackson Granholm \n |author=Robina Mapstone \n |date=7 June 1973 \n |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History \n |url=http://www.invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/fa_cohc_tr_gran730607.pdf \n |format=pdf\n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130173342/http://invention.smithsonian.org/downloads/fa_cohc_tr_gran730607.pdf \n |archivedate=30 November 2006 \n}}</ref>\n<blockquote>'''kludge''' {{IPA|/klu\u02d0d\u0292/}} Also '''kluge'''.

Phineas Burling is the Chief calligrapher with the Fink and Wiggles Publishing Company, Inc. Fink and Wiggles are, of course, the well known publishers of the NEW MULTILINGUAL DICTIONARY. According to Burling, the word \"kludge\" first appeared in the English language in the early fifteen-hundreds. It was imported into the geographic region of the lowlands between King's Lynn (then Bishop's Lynn) and the Isle of Ely by Dutch settlers arriving there to reclaim tidelands of the Wash as rutabaga fields.\n\nThe word \"kludge\" is, according to Burling, derived from the same root as the German \"klug\" (Dutch ''kloog'', Swedish ''Klag'', Danish ''Klog'', Gothic ''Klaugen'', Lettish ''Kladnis'' and Sanskrit ''Veklaunn''), originally meaning \"smart\" or \"witty\". In the typical machinations of language in evolutionary growth, the word \"Kludge\" eventually came to mean \"not so smart\" or \"pretty ridiculous\". Today the leading definition given by the NEW MULTILINGUAL is, \"An ill-assorted collection of poorly-matching parts, forming a distressing whole.\"\n\nIt is in this latter sense that \"Kludge\" is used by computer hardware men. Today \"kludge\" forms one of the most beloved words in design terminology, and it stands ready for handy application to the work of anyone who gins up 110-volt circuitry to plug into the 220 VAC source. The building of a Kludge, however, is not work for amateurs. There is a certain, indefinable, masochistic finesse that must go into true Kludge building. The professional can spot it instantly. The amateur may readily presume that \"that's the way computers are\".<ref>{{cite book\n|title=How to Design a Kludge\n|author=Jackson W.

This may explain the idea of clever but clumsy and temporary, as well as the  pronunciation variation from German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/|title=Yiddish Dictionary Online \u05d9\u05d9\u05b4\u05d3\u05d9\u05e9 \u05f0\u05e2\u05e8\u05d8\u05e2\u05e8\u05d1\u05d5\u05da \u05d0\u05b7\u05e4\u05bf\u05df \u05f0\u05e2\u05d1|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== European surname ===\nIt may instead derive from the mispronunciation of European surname Kluge (be that German, Dutch or Scandinavian). Even if Burling's etymology were true, it is doubtful that the American military or computer engineers, who began using the term in the 20th century, could have been aware of a term that had fallen from use in East Anglia sometime in the preceding 400 years.\n\nThis ''OED2'' entry also includes the verb ''kludge'' (\"to improvise with a kludge or kludges\") and ''kludgemanship'' (\"skill in designing or applying kludges\").\n\n=== Military jargon ===\nThe [[Jargon File]] (a.k.a.

As the thing sank, it went \"kluge\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://our-local.co.uk/index.php?topic=23170.5;wap2|title=Obsolete Occupations|publisher=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Jargon File further includes ''kluge around'' \"to avoid a bug or difficult condition by inserting a kluge\", ''kluge up'' \"to lash together a quick hack to perform a task\". After Granholm's 1962 \"How to Design a Kludge\" article popularized the ''kluge'' variant ''kludge'', both were interchangeably used and confused. The Jargon File concludes:\n<blockquote>The result of this history is a tangle. Many younger U.S. hackers pronounce the word as /klooj/ but spell it, incorrectly for its meaning and pronunciation, as 'kludge'. ... British hackers mostly learned /kluhj/ orally, use it in a restricted negative sense and are at least consistent. European hackers have mostly learned the word from written American sources and tend to pronounce it /kluhj/ but use the wider American meaning! Some observers consider this mess appropriate in view of the word's meaning. </blockquote>\n\n=== Paper feeder ===\n\nAnother hypothesis dates to 1907, \"when John Brandtjen convinced two young machinists from [[Oslo, Norway]] named Abel and Eneval Kluge to service and install presses for his fledgling printing equipment firm\". In 1919, the brothers invented an automatic feeder for printing presses which, by 1929, allowed Brandtjen and Kluge to move into a 3-story building in St. Paul, MN. While the automatic feeder was a success, unverified sources claim that it developed a reputation for being \"temperamental, subject to frequent breakdowns, and devilishly difficult to repair&nbsp;\u2014 but oh, so clever!\" The Kluge brothers continued to innovate, and the company remained active as of 2017. Given that the feeder bore the Kluge name, it seems reasonable that it became a byword for over-complex mechanical contraptions. The Free Online Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC) claims that the term kluge \"was used in connection with computers as far back as the mid-1950s and, at that time, was used exclusively for ''hardware'' kluges\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foldoc.org/kluge|title=FOLDOC \u2013 Computing Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The fact that it was originally applied only to hardware again points back to the paper feeder as the origin. FOLDOC goes on to say, \"[[TMRC]] and the MIT hacker culture of the early 1960s seems to have developed in a milieu that remembered and still used some WWII military slang (see also [[foobar]]). It seems likely that 'kluge' came to MIT via alumni of the many military electronics projects run in Cambridge during the war (many in MIT's venerable [[Building 20]], which housed TMRC until the building was demolished in 1999).\" This would explain the term's introduction to the software community.\n\n=== Acronym ===\n\nOther suggested [[folk etymologies]] or [[backronyms]] for ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' is from '''k'''lumsy, '''l'''ame, '''u'''gly, '''d'''umb, but '''g'''ood '''e'''nough, or '''k'''lutzy '''l'''ashup, '''u'''nder-'''g'''oing '''e'''ngineering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wordsimilarity.com/en/kludge|title=kludge - Synonyms of kludge {{!}} Antonyms of kludge {{!}} Definition of kludge {{!}} Example of kludge {{!}} Word Synonyms API {{!}} Word Similarity API|website=wordsimilarity.com|access-date=2019-07-15}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''kludge'' would then seem to have independent origins, possibly in Britain. The terms tended to merge because of their similar pronunciations and meanings. However, ''kluge'' seems to have the sense of overcomplicated, while ''kludge'' has only the sense of poorly done.\n\nCf.

The term was in common enough use to appear in a fictional movie about the US space program.<ref>''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]'', a 1969 film. Dialog between space crew and Ted approximately 30 minutes into the movie, following capsule power down. Ted says, \"I'm in Huntsville kludging up a simulator of the XRV.\" The film was based on the [[Marooned (novel)|1964 novel]] of the same name.</ref>\n\nPerhaps the ultimate kludge was the first [[United States|US]] [[space station]], [[Skylab]]. Its two major components, the Saturn Workshop and the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]], began development as separate projects (the SWS was kludged from the [[S-IVB]] stage of the [[Saturn 1B]] and [[Saturn V]] launch vehicles, the ATM was kludged from an early design for the descent stage of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]]). Later the SWS and ATM were folded into the [[Apollo Applications Program]], but the components were to have been launched separately, then docked in orbit. In the final design, the SWS and ATM were launched together, but for the single-launch concept to work, the ATM had to pivot 90 degrees on a truss structure from its launch position to its on-orbit orientation, clearing the way for the crew to dock its [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] at the axial docking port of the Multiple Docking Adapter.\n\nThe Airlock Module's manufacturer, [[McDonnell Douglas]], even recycled the hatch design from its [[Project Gemini|Gemini spacecraft]] and kludged what was originally designed for the conical Gemini Command Module onto the cylindrical Skylab Airlock Module. The Skylab project, managed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]], was seen by the Manned Spacecraft Center (later [[Johnson Space Center]]) as an invasion of its historical role as the NASA center for manned spaceflight.  Thus, MSC personnel missed no opportunity to disparage the Skylab project, calling it \"the kludge\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n=== Computer science ===\nIn modern [[computer science|computing]] terminology, a \"kludge\" (or often a \"'''hack'''\") is a solution to a problem, the performance of a task, or a fix to a system that is inefficient, inelegant (\"hacky\"), or even unfathomable, but which nevertheless (more or less) works. To \"kludge around something\" is to avoid a [[Computer bug|bug]] or some difficult condition by building a kludge, perhaps relying on properties of the bug itself to assure proper operation. It is somewhat similar in spirit to a [[workaround]], only without the grace. A kludge is often used to change the behavior of a system after it is finished, without having to make fundamental changes. Sometimes the kludge is introduced in order to keep backwards compatibility, but often it is simply introduced because the kludge is an easier alternative. Note that a hack might be a kludge, but that ''hack'' could be, at least in computing, ironic praise, for a quick fix solution to a frustrating problem.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Kidder\n|first=Tracey\n|title=The Soul of a New Machine\n|publisher=Avon\n|year=1982\n|isbn=978-0-380-59931-8|title-link=The Soul of a New Machine\n}}</ref> The Jargon File has a chapter dedicated to the historical significance of the word ''hack''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raymond |first1=Eric S. |title=The Jargon File: The Meaning of \u2018Hack\u2019 |url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/meaning-of-hack.html |date=2004}}</ref>\n\nA kludge is often used to fix an unanticipated problem in an earlier kludge; this is essentially a kind of [[cruft]].\n\nSomething might be a kludge if it fails in [[corner case]]s, but this is a less common sense, as such situations are not expected to come up in typical usage. More commonly, a kludge is a poorly working [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] which was expected to work adequately. An intimate knowledge of the context (i.e., problem domain and/or the kludge's execution environment) is typically required to build a corner case kludge. As a consequence, they are sometimes ironically praised.\n\nAn anecdotal example of a kludge involved a computer part supposedly manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] during the 1960s. The part needed slightly delayed receipt of a signal to work. Rather than setting up a timing system, the kludge was to make the internal wires extra-long, increasing the distance and thus increasing the time the electrical signal took to reach its destination.{{Citation needed|date = January 2015}}\n\nA variation on this use of kludge is evasion of an unknown problem or bug in a [[computer program]]. Rather than continue to struggle to find out exactly what is causing the bug and how to fix it, the programmer may hack the problem by the simple kludge of writing new code which compensates. For example, if a variable keeps ending up doubled in a certain code area, add code which divides by two when it is used, after the original code has been executed.\n\nIn computer networking, use of [[Network address translation|NAT]] (Network Address Translation) (RFC 1918) or [[Port address translation|PAT]] (Port Address Translation) to cope with the  shortage of [[Internet Protocol|IPv4]] addresses is an example of a kludge.\n\nIn [[FidoNet]] terminology, ''kludge'' refers to a piece of control data embedded inside a message.\n\n=== Evolutionary neuroscience ===\n{{see also|Evolutionary baggage}}\nThe ''kludge'' or ''kluge'' metaphor has been adapted in fields such as [[evolutionary neuroscience]], particularly in reference to the [[human brain]].\n\nThe neuroscientist [[David Linden]] discusses how [[intelligent design]] proponents have misconstrued brain anatomy.\n<blockquote>The transcendent aspects of our human experience, the things that touch our emotional and cognitive core, were not given to us by a Great Engineer. These are not the latest design features of an impeccably crafted brain. Rather, at every turn, brain design has been a kludge, a workaround, a jumble, a pastiche. The things we hold highest in our human experience (love, memory, dreams, and a predisposition for religious thought) result from a particular agglomeration of ad hoc solutions that have been piled on through millions of years of evolution history. It's not that we have fundamentally human thoughts and feelings ''despite'' the kludgy design of the brain as molded by the twists and turns of evolutionary history. Rather, we have them precisely ''because'' of that history.<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Linden\n|first=David J.\n|title=The Accidental Mind: How Brain Evolution Has Given Us Love, Memory, Dreams, and God\n|publisher=Belknap Press\n|year=2007\n|pages=[https://archive.org/details/accidentalmind0000lind/page/245 245\u2013246]\n|isbn=978-0-674-02478-6\n|url=https://archive.org/details/accidentalmind0000lind/page/245\n}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe research psychologist [[Gary Marcus]]'s book ''[[Kluge (book)|Kluge: The Haphazard Construction of the Human Mind]]'' compares evolutionary kluges with engineering ones like [[manifold vacuum]]-powered [[windshield wipers]]&nbsp;\u2013 when you accelerated or drove uphill, \"Your wipers slowed to a crawl, or even stopped working altogether.\"\n\n<blockquote>For instance, the vertebrate eye's [[retina]] that is installed backward, facing the back of the head rather than the front.

Founded in June 2015, the team made its debut in the [[Major Arena Soccer League]] with the [[2015\u201316 Major Arena Soccer League season|2015\u201316 season]].<ref name=\"crgz150611\"/><ref name=\"kgan150611\"/> The team's name and logo were revealed at a press conference on July 16, 2015.<ref name=\"crgz150716\"/><ref name=\"kwwl150716\"/>\n\nThe team shared its ownership group with the [[Cedar Rapids Titans]] of the [[Indoor Football League]],<ref name=\"crgz150611\"/><ref name=\"kwwl150716\"/> and sponsored an outdoor team the [[Cedar Rapids Rampage United]] that were a part of the [[Premier League of America]].<ref>http://cedarrapidsrampage.com/archives/838#more-838</ref>\n\n==History==\nFormer [[Chicago Storm]] assistant and [[Rockford Rampage]] head coach Jeff Kraft was named the first head coach in franchise history. In the first home pre-season match in Cedar Rapids, the Rampage would lose 11-6 to the [[St. Louis Ambush (2013\u2013)|St. Louis Ambush]] at the U.S. Cellular Center on October 30th, 2015. \n\nThe first regular season MASL game in Rampage history was November 6th, 2015 at the [[Missouri Comets]]. The game saw first goal in franchise history, scored by forward Elmo Neto. The Rampage would go on to lose in overtime, 8-7. After an 0-7 start to the season (and two overtime losses) the Rampage would get their first win in a 9-7 comeback victory over the Ambush. Cedar Rapids had at one point trailed 7-2 in the third quarter, but used the quickest hat-trick from start-to-finish in MASL history by forward Alex Megson (41 seconds apart) to get back in the game. Player/assistant coach Carlos \u201cChile\u201d Farias would score the tying and winning goals. Midway through the season, the Rampage would acquire forward Gordy Gurson who would go on to become arguably the face of the franchise. A much improved side would win four games the second half of the year and finish 5-15. \n\nThe [[2016\u201317 Major Arena Soccer League season]] would be a turn-around season for the club. Kraft would be let go as head coach before the season, and [[Hewerton Moreira]] was promoted to player-coach. Moreira would go on to finish second in the MASL record books for assists in a season with 29, and the Rampage would have their first winning record with a 12-8 mark, highlighted by wins over the Milwaukee Rampage and defending-and-eventual champions, [[Baltimore Blast]]. The [[Chicago Mustangs (2012\u2013)|Chicago Mustangs]] would edge Cedar Rapids for the last playoff spot, and would also beat the Rampage in the a match that would tie the league record for fewest goals in a match (3-1). \n\nWith the Mustangs voluntarily relegating themselves to [[MASL2]], the Central would be cleared of the Rampage\u2019s biggest nemesis for the [[2017-18 Major Arena Soccer League season]]. Hewerton would leave to become the player-coach of St. Louis, and Jonathan Greenfield would be promoted to role of player-coach. The Rampage would start out with three narrow losses before a run of five straight wins to put them in contention for the Central Division title. A tumultuous December would see drama on and off the field. Bad weather, undesirable home dates, and sponsorship problems saw attendance dip. On the field, goalkeeper Brett Petricek was released and would sign with the Comets, and Greenfield would leave to play for the Baltimore Blast. Former [[Chicago Riot]] goalkeeper and Rockford Rampage goalkeeper/assistant Ante Cop was hired as the new head coach. Cop would lose his first match as head coach on December 31st, 2017, 3-2 to the Baltimore Blast and his next three games after that. However, rookie goalkeeper Rainer Hauss and the rest of the team would thrive under Cop, winning five of their last seven matches. In that stretch, they would clinch their first ever playoff berth on February 16th, 2018 with a 6-5 home win over the Baltimore Blast. \n\nWith reports that the team was for sale, and a conflict with the U.S. Cellular Center, the Rampage played their first \u201chome\u201d playoff match at The [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Villa Park, Illinois. The match would go on to be considered one of the greatest in Ron Newman Cup Playoffs history. The Rampage would battle the Milwaukee Wave in a seesaw affair, including a Mario Alvarez hat-trick and a late game-tying goal from Osvaldo Rojas to send the game to overtime where the Rampage would eventually lose. The second leg in Milwaukee was also back and forth, with a double-brace of four goals by Gordy Gurson, but ended in another one-goal Wave win to take the series. Gurson would be named 3rd Team All-MASL and Hauss would be named goalkeeper on the MASL All-Rookie Team. \n\nThe team folded in 2018, and ownership reformed with many of the same players in Florida as the [[Orlando SeaWolves]].\n\n==Year-by-Year==\n{| class =\"wikitable \"\n|-\n!Season\n!League\n!Record\n!Pct.\n!GF\n!GA\n!Finish\n!Playoffs\n!Avg.

(sports)|franchise]] based in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]. Founded in June 2015, the team made its debut in the [[Major Arena Soccer League]] with the [[2015\u201316 Major Arena Soccer League season|2015\u201316 season]].<ref name=\"crgz150611\"/><ref name=\"kgan150611\"/> The team's name and logo were revealed at a press conference on July 16, 2015.<ref name=\"crgz150716\"/><ref name=\"kwwl150716\"/>\n\nThe team shared its ownership group with the [[Cedar Rapids Titans]] of the [[Indoor Football League]],<ref name=\"crgz150611\"/><ref name=\"kwwl150716\"/> and sponsored an outdoor team the [[Cedar Rapids Rampage United]] that were a part of the [[Premier League of America]].<ref>http://cedarrapidsrampage.com/archives/838#more-838</ref>\n\n==History==\nFormer [[Chicago Storm]] assistant and [[Rockford Rampage]] head coach Jeff Kraft was named the first head coach in franchise history. In the first home pre-season match in Cedar Rapids, the Rampage would lose 11-6 to the [[St. Louis Ambush]] at the U.S. Cellular Center on October 30th, 2015. \n\nThe first regular season MASL game in Rampage history was November 6th, 2015 at the [[Missouri Comets]]. The game saw first goal in franchise history, scored by forward Elmo Neto. The Rampage would go on to lose in overtime, 8-7. After an 0-7 start to the season (and two overtime losses) the Rampage would get their first win in a 9-7 comeback victory over the Ambush. Cedar Rapids had at one point trailed 7-2 in the third quarter, but used the quickest hat-trick from start-to-finish in MASL history by forward Alex Megson (41 seconds apart) to get back in the game. Player/assistant coach Carlos \u201cChile\u201d Farias would score the tying and winning goals. Midway through the season, the Rampage would acquire forward Gordy Gurson who would go on to become arguably the face of the franchise. A much improved side would win four games the second half of the year and finish 5-15. \n\nThe [[2016\u201317 Major Arena Soccer League season]] would be a turn-around season for the club. Kraft would be let go as head coach before the season, and [[Hewerton Moreira]] was promoted to player-coach. Moreira would go on to finish second in the MASL record books for assists in a season with 29, and the Rampage would have their first winning record with a 12-8 mark, highlighted by wins over the Milwaukee Rampage and defending-and-eventual champions, [[Baltimore Blast]]. The [[Chicago Mustangs]] would edge Cedar Rapids for the last playoff spot, and would also beat the Rampage in the a match that would tie the league record for fewest goals in a match (3-1). \n\nWith the Mustangs voluntarily relegating themselves to [[MASL2]], the Central would be cleared of the Rampage\u2019s biggest nemesis for the [[2017-18 Major Arena Soccer League season]]. Hewerton would leave to become the player-coach of St. Louis, and Jonathan Greenfield would be promoted to role of player-coach. The Rampage would start out with three narrow losses before a run of five straight wins to put them in contention for the Central Division title. A tumultuous December would see drama on and off the field. Bad weather, undesirable home dates, and sponsorship problems saw attendance dip. On the field, goalkeeper Brett Petricek was released and would sign with the Comets, and Greenfield would leave to play for the Baltimore Blast. Former [[Chicago Riot]] goalkeeper and Rockford Rampage goalkeeper/assistant Ante Cop was hired as the new head coach. Cop would lose his first match as head coach on December 31st, 2017, 3-2 to the Baltimore Blast and his next three games after that. However, rookie goalkeeper Rainer Hauss and the rest of the team would thrive under Cop, winning five of their last seven matches. In that stretch, they would clinch their first ever playoff berth on February 16th, 2018 with a 6-5 home win over the Baltimore Blast. \n\nWith reports that the team was for sale, and a conflict with the U.S. Cellular Center, the Rampage played their first \u201chome\u201d playoff match at The [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Villa Park, Illinois. The match would go on to be considered one of the greatest in Ron Newman Cup Playoffs history. The Rampage would battle the Milwaukee Wave in a seesaw affair, including a Mario Alvarez hat-trick and a late game-tying goal from Osvaldo Rojas to send the game to overtime where the Rampage would eventually lose. The second leg in Milwaukee was also back and forth, with a double-brace of four goals by Gordy Gurson, but ended in another one-goal Wave win to take the series. Gurson would be named 3rd Team All-MASL and Hauss would be named goalkeeper on the MASL All-Rookie Team. \n\nThe team folded in 2018, and ownership reformed with many of the same players in Florida as the [[Orlando SeaWolves]].\n\n==Year-by-Year==\n{| class =\"wikitable \"\n|-\n!Season\n!League\n!Record\n!Pct.\n!GF\n!GA\n!Finish\n!Playoffs\n!Avg.
