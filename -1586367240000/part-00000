Edmund was always a loyal supporter of his eldest half-brother King [[Edward II]], which placed him in conflict with that monarch's wife Queen [[Isabella of France]] and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]]. Edmund was executed in 1330 after Edward II was deposed and his widow and four children (including Joan, who was only two years old) were placed under house arrest in [[Arundel Castle]] in Sussex, which had been granted to Edmund in 1326 by his half-brother the king following the execution of the rebel [[Edmund FitzAlan, 9th Earl of Arundel]]. It was a time of great strain for the widowed Countess of Kent and her four children. They received respite after the new king, [[Edward III]] (Joan's half-first cousin), attained adulthood and took charge of affairs. He took on the responsibility for the family and looked after them well.\n\n==Early marriages==\n[[File:Holland OfWeare Devon Arms.png|thumb|Arms of Holland of Upholland: ''Azure sem\u00e9e-de-lys argent, a lion rampant of the second''.

The following winter (1340 or 1341), while Holland was overseas, Joan's family arranged for her to marry [[William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|William Montagu]], son and heir of [[William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury]]. It is not known if the 13-year-old Joan confided to anyone about her first marriage before marrying Montagu, who was her own age.

He was buried in the church of [[Austin Friars, London|Austin Friars]], London.\n\nDescendants of Joan of Kent through her children Joan Holland and Thomas Holland include [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]] (mother of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]), Richard, Duke of York, Edward IV, Richard III, and queens consort [[Anne Neville]], [[Elizabeth of York]], and [[Catherine Parr]]. At the Battle of Bosworth, Richard III,  Henry Tudor, and the commander of Tudor's army, the Earl of Oxford were all descendants of Joan of Kent. \n\nWhen the last of Joan's siblings died in 1352, the lands and titles of her parents devolved upon her, and she became the 4th [[Earl of Kent|Countess of Kent]] and 5th [[Baroness Wake of Liddell]]. Her husband Holland was created Earl of Kent in right of his wife in 1360.\n\n==Marriage to the Black Prince==\nHer first husband Thomas Holland died in 1360. Some may infer that evidence of a long-held desire by [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1330-1376) (son of her half-first cousin King Edward III) for Joan may be found in the record of his presenting her with a silver cup, part of the booty from one of his early military campaigns. Although one generation removed from her, he was probably only 3 years younger as the exact date of Joan's birth is undocumented. It is suggested that Edward's parents did not favour a marriage between their son and their former ward but this may be ameliorated by the fact that King Edward assisted his son in acquiring all four of the needed dispensations for Edward to marry Joan.  Queen Philippa (wife of Edward III) had made a [[favourite]] of Joan in her childhood.   Both she and the King may have been concerned about the legitimacy of any resulting children but such concerns were remediated by a second ruling of Pope Clement's successor upholding the initial ruling on Joan's previous marriage(s).   In addition, Edward and Joan were within the prohibited degrees of [[consanguinity]]. Further complicating matters was the fact that Edward was godfather to Joan's son by Thomas Holland. .\n\nAt the King's request, the Pope granted the dispensations (4) allowing the two to be legally married. Matters moved fast and Joan was officially married to the Prince barely nine months after Holland's death, the official ceremony occurring on 10 October 1361 at [[Windsor Castle]], with the King and Queen in attendance. The [[Simon Islip|Archbishop of Canterbury]] presided.\n\nIn 1362 the Black Prince was invested as Prince of [[Aquitaine]], a region of France that had belonged to the English Crown since the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] to King [[Henry II of England]]. He and Joan moved to [[Bordeaux]], the capital of the principality, where they spent the next nine years. Two sons were born during this period to the royal couple. The elder son [[Edward of Angoul\u00eame]] (27 January 1365 \u2013 1370) died at the age of six. At about the time of the birth of their younger son, the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], the Black Prince was lured into a battle on behalf of King [[Peter of Castile]] and achieved one of his greatest victories; however, King Peter was later killed and there was no money to pay the troops. In the meantime the Princess was forced to raise another army as her husband's enemies were threatening Aquitaine in his absence.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Transition to Dowager Princess of Wales==\nBy 1371 the Black Prince was no longer able to perform his duties as Prince of Aquitaine due to illness, and shortly after burying their elder son the couple returned to England, where the [[Black Death]] was wreaking havoc. In 1372 the Black Prince forced himself to attempt one final, abortive campaign in the hope of saving his father's French possessions but the exertion left his health completely shattered. He returned to England and on 7 June 1376, a week before his forty-sixth birthday, he died in his bed at the [[Palace of Westminster]].\n\nJoan's son Prince Richard was next in line to succeed his grandfather. One year later, King Edward III died on 21 June 1377, and Richard acceded to the throne as Richard II; he was crowned the following month, at the age of 10. Early in his reign, the young King faced the challenge of the [[Peasants' Revolt]]. The [[Lollard]]s, religious reformers led by [[John Wyclif]], had enjoyed Joan's support, but the violent climax of the popular movement for reform reduced the feisty Joan to a state of terror, while leaving the King with an improved reputation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nAs the King's mother, Joan did exercise much influence behind the scenes, and was recognised as doing such during the early years of her son's reign. She also enjoyed a certain prestige and dignity among the people as an elderly, royal dowager. For example, in 1381 on her return to London (via her [[Wickhambreaux]] estate in Kent) from a pilgrimage to [[Thomas Becket]]'s shrine at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], she found her way barred by [[Wat Tyler]] and his mob of rebels on [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]; however, she was not only let through unharmed, but was saluted with kisses and provided with an escort for the rest of her journey.\n\nIn January 1382, Richard II married [[Anne of Bohemia]], daughter of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of Bohemia.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral Crypt.jpg|thumb|Crypt of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], intended as Joan's burial place. The monument of the Black Prince is above]]\n[[John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter]] was Joan's son by her first marriage; his wife [[Elizabeth of Lancaster, Duchess of Exeter|Elizabeth of Lancaster]] was a daughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], brother of the Black Prince. In 1385 while campaigning with his half-brother King Richard II in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], John Holland became involved in a quarrel with Sir [[Ralph Stafford (knight)|Ralph Stafford]], son of the [[Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford|2nd Earl of Stafford]], a favourite of the queen, [[Anne of Bohemia]]. Stafford was killed and John Holland sought sanctuary at the [[shrine]] of [[St John of Beverley]]. On the King's return, Holland was condemned to death. Joan pleaded with her royal son for four days to spare his half-brother and on the fifth day (the exact date in August is not known), she died, at [[Wallingford Castle]]. King Richard then relented and pardoned Holland, who was sent on a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nJoan was buried beside her first husband, as requested in her will, at the [[Greyfriars, Stamford|Greyfriars]]<ref>the site of the present hospital</ref> in [[Stamford, England|Stamford]], Lincolnshire. The Black Prince had built a [[chantry chapel]] for her in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral in Kent (where he himself was buried), with ceiling bosses sculpted with likenesses of her face. Another boss in the north nave aisle is also said to show her face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finestoneminiatures.com/catalog/catalog_72.htm|title=72: Fair Maid of Kent roof boss, Canterbury Cathedral, north nave aisle|publisher=Fine Stone Miniatures|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional depictions==\nJoan of Kent is a leading character in:\n*''[[The Life and Death of Jack Straw]]'' (1593) \u2013 an anonymous early modern play about the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 (as the queen mother).\n*[[Emma Campion]] \u2013 ''A Triple Knot'' (2014) \n*[[Gordon R.

He was buried in the church of [[Austin Friars, London|Austin Friars]], London.\n\nDescendants of Joan of Kent through her children Joan Holland and Thomas Holland include [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby]] (mother of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]), Richard, Duke of York, Edward IV, Richard III, and queens consort [[Anne Neville]], [[Elizabeth of York]], and [[Catherine Parr]]. At the Battle of Bosworth, Richard III,  Henry Tudor, and the commander of Tudor's army, the Earl of Oxford were all descendants of Joan of Kent. \n\nWhen the last of Joan's siblings died in 1352, the lands and titles of her parents devolved upon her, and she became the 4th [[Earl of Kent|Countess of Kent]] and 5th [[Baroness Wake of Liddell]]. Her husband Holland was created Earl of Kent in right of his wife in 1360.\n\n==Marriage to the Black Prince==\nHer first husband Thomas Holland died in 1360. Some may infer that evidence of a long-held desire by [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1330-1376) (son of her half-first cousin King Edward III) for Joan may be found in the record of his presenting her with a silver cup, part of the booty from one of his early military campaigns. Although one generation removed from her, he was probably only 3 years younger as the exact date of Joan's birth is undocumented. It is suggested that Edward's parents did not favour a marriage between their son and their former ward but this may be ameliorated by the fact that King Edward assisted his son in acquiring all four of the needed dispensations for Edward to marry Joan.  Queen Philippa (wife of Edward III) had made a [[favourite]] of Joan in her childhood.   Both she and the King may have been concerned about the legitimacy of any resulting children but such concerns were remediated by a second ruling of Pope Clement's successor upholding the initial ruling on Joan's previous marriage(s).   In addition, Edward and Joan were within the prohibited degrees of [[consanguinity]]. Further complicating matters was the fact that Edward was godfather to Joan's son by Thomas Holland. .\n\nAt the King's request, the Pope granted the dispensations (4) allowing the two to be legally married. Matters moved fast and Joan was officially married to the Prince barely nine months after Holland's death, the official ceremony occurring on 10 October 1361 at [[Windsor Castle]], with the King and Queen in attendance. The [[Simon Islip|Archbishop of Canterbury]] presided.\n\nIn 1362 the Black Prince was invested as Prince of [[Aquitaine]], a region of France that had belonged to the English Crown since the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] to King [[Henry II of England]]. He and Joan moved to [[Bordeaux]], the capital of the principality, where they spent the next nine years. Two sons were born during this period to the royal couple. The elder son [[Edward of Angoul\u00eame]] (27 January 1365 \u2013 1370) died at the age of six. At about the time of the birth of their younger son, the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], the Black Prince was lured into a battle on behalf of King [[Peter of Castile]] and achieved one of his greatest victories; however, King Peter was later killed and there was no money to pay the troops. In the meantime the Princess was forced to raise another army as her husband's enemies were threatening Aquitaine in his absence.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Transition to Dowager Princess of Wales==\nBy 1371 the Black Prince was no longer able to perform his duties as Prince of Aquitaine due to illness, and shortly after burying their elder son the couple returned to England, where the [[Black Death]] was wreaking havoc. In 1372 the Black Prince forced himself to attempt one final, abortive campaign in the hope of saving his father's French possessions but the exertion left his health completely shattered. He returned to England and on 7 June 1376, a week before his forty-sixth birthday, he died in his bed at the [[Palace of Westminster]].\n\nJoan's son Prince Richard was next in line to succeed his grandfather. One year later, King Edward III died on 21 June 1377, and Richard acceded to the throne as Richard II; he was crowned the following month, at the age of 10. Early in his reign, the young King faced the challenge of the [[Peasants' Revolt]]. The [[Lollard]]s, religious reformers led by [[John Wyclif]], had enjoyed Joan's support, but the violent climax of the popular movement for reform reduced the feisty Joan to a state of terror, while leaving the King with an improved reputation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nAs the King's mother, Joan did exercise much influence behind the scenes, and was recognised as doing such during the early years of her son's reign. She also enjoyed a certain prestige and dignity among the people as an elderly, royal dowager. For example, in 1381 on her return to London (via her [[Wickhambreaux]] estate in Kent) from a pilgrimage to [[Thomas Becket]]'s shrine at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], she found her way barred by [[Wat Tyler]] and his mob of rebels on [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]]; however, she was not only let through unharmed, but was saluted with kisses and provided with an escort for the rest of her journey.\n\nIn January 1382, Richard II married [[Anne of Bohemia]], daughter of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of Bohemia.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral Crypt.jpg|thumb|Crypt of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], intended as Joan's burial place. The monument of the Black Prince is above]]\n[[John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter]] was Joan's son by her first marriage; his wife [[Elizabeth of Lancaster, Duchess of Exeter|Elizabeth of Lancaster]] was a daughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster]], brother of the Black Prince. In 1385 while campaigning with his half-brother King Richard II in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], John Holland became involved in a quarrel with Sir [[Ralph Stafford (knight)|Ralph Stafford]], son of the [[Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford|2nd Earl of Stafford]], a favourite of the queen, [[Anne of Bohemia]]. Stafford was killed and John Holland sought sanctuary at the [[shrine]] of [[St John of Beverley]]. On the King's return, Holland was condemned to death. Joan pleaded with her royal son for four days to spare his half-brother and on the fifth day (the exact date in August is not known), she died, at [[Wallingford Castle]]. King Richard then relented and pardoned Holland, who was sent on a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nJoan was buried beside her first husband, as requested in her will, at the [[Greyfriars, Stamford|Greyfriars]]<ref>the site of the present hospital</ref> in [[Stamford, England|Stamford]], Lincolnshire.

PCR was invented in 1983 by the American biochemist [[Kary Mullis]]. It is fundamental to much of genetic testing including analysis of ancient samples of DNA and identification of infectious agents. Using PCR, copies of very small amounts of [[DNA sequences]] are exponentially amplified in a series or cycles of temperature changes. PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in [[medical laboratory]] and clinical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including biomedical research and criminal forensics.<ref name=\"Saiki1\">{{Cite journal|last1=Saiki|first1=R.|last2=Scharf|first2=S.|last3=Faloona|first3=F.|last4=Mullis|first4=K.|last5=Horn|first5=G.|last6=Erlich|first6=H.|last7=Arnheim|first7=N.|year=1985|title=Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia|journal=Science|volume=230|issue=4732|pages=1350\u20131354|doi=10.1126/science.2999980|pmid=2999980}}</ref><ref name=\"Saiki2\">{{Cite journal|last1=Saiki|first1=R.|last2=Gelfand|first2=D.|last3=Stoffel|first3=S.|last4=Scharf|first4=S.|last5=Higuchi|first5=R.|last6=Horn|first6=G.|last7=Mullis|first7=K.|last8=Erlich|first8=H.|year=1988|title=Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase|journal=Science|volume=239|issue=4839|pages=487\u2013491|doi=10.1126/science.2448875|pmid=2448875|bibcode=1988Sci...239..487S}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of PCR methods rely on [[Thermal cycler|thermal cycling]]. Thermal cycling exposes reactants to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature-dependent reactions \u2013 specifically, [[DNA melting]] and [[enzyme]]-driven DNA replication. PCR employs two main reagents \u2013 [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] (which are short single strand DNA fragments known as [[oligonucleotide]]s that are a [[Complementary DNA|complementary]] sequence to the target DNA region) and a [[DNA polymerase]]. In the first step of PCR, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called [[Nucleic acid denaturation]]. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA. The two DNA strands then become [[DNA#Polymerases|templates]] for DNA polymerase to [[enzyme|enzymatically]] assemble a new DNA strand from free [[nucleotide]]s, the building blocks of DNA. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a [[chain reaction]] in which the original DNA template is [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] amplified.\n\nAlmost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as [[Taq polymerase]], an enzyme originally isolated from the [[thermophile|thermophilic]] bacterium ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]''. If the polymerase used was heat-susceptible, it would denature under the high temperatures of the denaturation step. Before the use of Taq polymerase, DNA polymerase had to be manually added every cycle, which was a tedious and costly process.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1525/abt.2012.74.4.9| title=Determining Annealing Temperatures for Polymerase Chain Reaction| journal=The American Biology Teacher| volume=74| issue=4| pages=256\u2013260| year=2012}}</ref>\n\nApplications of the technique include [[DNA cloning]] for [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]], gene cloning and manipulation, gene mutagenesis; construction of DNA-based [[phylogeny|phylogenies]], or functional analysis of [[gene]]s; [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of [[hereditary disease]]s; amplification of ancient DNA;<ref name=\":0\"/> analysis of genetic fingerprints for [[DNA profiling]] (for example, in [[forensic science]] and [[parentage testing]]); and detection of [[pathogen]]s in [[nucleic acid test]]s for the diagnosis of [[infectious disease]]s.\n\n[[Image:PCR masina kasutamine.jpg|thumb|Placing a strip of eight PCR tubes into a [[thermal cycler]]]]\n\n==Principles==\n[[Image:G-Storm thermal cycler.jpg|thumb|A [[thermal cycler]] for PCR]]\n[[Image:Primitive PCR machine for scrap.JPG|thumb|An older, three-temperature [[thermal cycler]] for PCR]]\nPCR amplifies a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target).

The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to achieve the temperatures required at each step of the reaction (see below). Many modern thermal cyclers make use of the [[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier effect]], which permits both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes permit favorable [[thermal conductivity]] to allow for rapid thermal equilibration. Most thermal cyclers have heated lids to prevent condensation at the top of the reaction tube. Older thermal cyclers lacking a heated lid require a layer of oil on top of the reaction mixture or a ball of wax inside the tube.\n\n===Procedure===\nTypically, PCR consists of a series of 20\u201340 repeated temperature changes, called thermal cycles, with each cycle commonly consisting of two or three discrete temperature steps (see figure below). The cycling is often preceded by a single temperature step at a very high temperature (>{{convert|90|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}), and followed by one hold at the end for final product extension or brief storage. The temperatures used and the length of time they are applied in each cycle depend on a variety of parameters, including the enzyme used for DNA synthesis, the concentration of bivalent ions and dNTPs in the reaction, and the [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (''T<sub>m</sub>'') of the primers.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rychlik W, Spencer WJ, Rhoads RE | title=Optimization of the annealing temperature for DNA amplification in vitro| journal=Nucleic Acids Res| year=1990 | pages=6409\u20136412|volume=18|pmid=2243783 | doi = 10.1093/nar/18.21.6409 | issue=21 | pmc=332522}}</ref> The individual steps common to most PCR methods are as follows:\n\n* ''Initialization'': This step is only required for DNA polymerases that require heat activation by [[Polymerase chain reaction#Variations|hot-start PCR]].<ref name=antibody_hot_start>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sharkey | first1 = D.

This causes [[DNA melting]], or denaturation, of the double-stranded DNA template by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, yielding two single-stranded DNA molecules. \n* ''[[Annealing (biology)|Annealing]]'': In the next step, the reaction temperature is lowered to {{convert|50|\u2013|65|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 20\u201340 seconds, allowing annealing of the primers to each of the single-stranded DNA templates. Two different primers are typically included in the reaction mixture: one for each of the two single-stranded complements containing the target region. The primers are single-stranded sequences themselves, but are much shorter than the length of the target region, complementing only very short sequences at the 3' end of each strand.\n\n: It is critical to determine a proper temperature for the annealing step because efficiency and specificity are strongly affected by the annealing temperature. This temperature must be low enough to allow for [[DNA\u2013DNA hybridization|hybridization]] of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific, i.e., the primer should bind ''only'' to a perfectly complementary part of the strand, and nowhere else. If the temperature is too low, the primer may bind imperfectly. If it is too high, the primer may not bind at all. A typical annealing temperature is about 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b0C below the ''T<sub>m</sub>'' of the primers used. Stable hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are formed only when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence. During this step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation.\n\n* ''Extension/elongation'': The temperature at this step depends on the DNA polymerase used; the optimum [[Enzyme|activity]] temperature for the thermostable DNA polymerase of [[Taq polymerase|Taq (Thermus aquaticus) polymerase]] is approximately {{convert|75|\u2013|80|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}},<ref name=\"Chien et al.\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Chien A, Edgar DB, Trela JM |year= 1976|title=Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus|journal=J.

In this step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding free dNTPs from the reaction mixture that are complementary to the template in the 5'-to-3' direction, [[condensation reaction|condensing]] the 5'-[[phosphate group]] of the dNTPs with the 3'-[[hydroxy group]] at the end of the nascent (elongating) DNA strand. The precise time required for elongation depends both on the DNA polymerase used and on the length of the DNA target region to amplify. As a rule of thumb, at their optimal temperature, most DNA polymerases polymerize a thousand bases per minute. Under optimal conditions (i.e., if there are no limitations due to limiting substrates or reagents), at each extension/elongation step, the number of DNA target sequences is doubled. With each successive cycle, the original template strands plus all newly generated strands become template strands for the next round of elongation, leading to exponential (geometric) amplification of the specific DNA target region.\n\n: The processes of denaturation, annealing and elongation constitute a single cycle. Multiple cycles are required to amplify the DNA target to millions of copies. The formula used to calculate the number of DNA copies formed after a given number of cycles is 2<sup>n</sup>, where ''n'' is the number of cycles. Thus, a reaction set for 30 cycles results in 2<sup>30</sup>, or {{formatnum:{{#expr:2^30}}}}, copies of the original double-stranded DNA target region.\n\n* ''Final elongation'': This single step is optional, but is performed at a temperature of {{convert|70|\u2013|74|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (the temperature range required for optimal activity of most polymerases used in PCR) for 5\u201315 minutes after the last PCR cycle to ensure that any remaining single-stranded DNA is fully elongated.\n* ''Final hold'': The final step cools the reaction chamber to {{convert|4|\u2013|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for an indefinite time, and may be employed for short-term storage of the PCR products.\n\n[[File:Polymerase chain reaction.svg|frameless|center|Schematic drawing of a complete PCR cycle|835x835px]]\n[[Image:Roland Gel.JPG|thumb|[[Ethidium bromide]]-stained PCR products after [[gel electrophoresis]].

Thus, the entire PCR process can further be divided into three stages based on reaction progress:\n* ''Exponential amplification'': At every cycle, the amount of product is doubled (assuming 100% reaction efficiency). After 30 cycles, a single copy of DNA can be increased up to 1,000,000,000 (one billion) copies.

Quantitative PCR is an established tool for DNA quantification that measures the accumulation of DNA product after each round of PCR amplification.\n\nqPCR allows the quantification and detection of a specific DNA sequence in real time since it measures concentration while the synthesis process is taking place. There are two methods for simultaneous detection and quantification. The first method consists of using [[fluorophore|fluorescent]] dyes that are retained nonspecifically in between the double strands. The second method involves probes that code for specific sequences and are fluorescently labeled. Detection of DNA using these methods can only be seen after the hybridization of probes with its complementary DNA takes place. An interesting technique combination is real-time PCR and reverse transcription. This sophisticated technique, called RT-qPCR, allows for the quantification of a small quantity of RNA. Through this combined technique, mRNA is converted to cDNA, which is further quantified using qPCR.

However, antibodies don't appear until many weeks after infection, maternal antibodies mask the infection of a newborn, and therapeutic agents to fight the infection don't affect the antibodies.

PCR-based tests have allowed detection of small numbers of disease organisms (both live or dead), in convenient [[Sputum|samples]].  Detailed genetic analysis can also be used to detect antibiotic resistance, allowing immediate and effective therapy.  The effects of therapy can also be immediately evaluated.\n* The spread of a ''[[Influenza|disease]] organism'' through populations of [[Chicken|domestic]] or [[Goose|wild]] animals can be monitored by PCR testing.  In many cases, the appearance of new virulent [[H5N1|sub-types]] can be detected and monitored.  The sub-types of an organism that were responsible for [[Influenza pandemic|earlier epidemics]] can also be determined by PCR analysis.\n*Viral DNA can be detected by PCR. The primers used must be specific to the targeted sequences in the DNA of a virus, and PCR can be used for diagnostic analyses or DNA sequencing of the viral genome. The high sensitivity of PCR permits virus detection soon after infection and even before the onset of disease.<ref name=\"Cai2014\"/> Such early detection may give physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The amount of virus (\"[[viral load]]\") in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques (see below).\n*Diseases such as pertussis (or [[whooping cough]]) are cause by the bacteria [[Bordetella pertussis]].

Minute samples of DNA can be isolated from a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|crime scene]], and [[Combined DNA Index System|compared]] to that from suspects, or from a [[National DNA database|DNA database]] of earlier evidence or convicts.  Simpler versions of these tests are often used to rapidly rule out suspects during a criminal investigation.  Evidence from decades-old crimes can be tested, confirming or [[Innocence Project|exonerating]] the people originally convicted.\n* Forensic DNA typing has been an effective way of identifying or exonerating criminal suspects due to analysis of evidence discovered at a crime scene. The human genome has many repetitive regions that can be found within gene sequences or in non-coding regions of the genome. Specifically, up to 40% of human DNA is repetitive.<ref name=\":0\"/> There are two distinct categories for these repetitive, non-coding regions in the genome. The first category is called variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), which are 10\u2013100 base pairs long and the second category is called short tandem repeats (STR) and these consist of repeated 2\u201310 base pair sections.  PCR is used to amplify several well-known VNTRs and STRs using primers that flank each of the repetitive regions. The sizes of the fragments obtained from any individual for each of the STRs will indicate which alleles are present. By analyzing several STRs for an individual, a set of alleles for each person will be found that statistically is likely to be unique.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology|last=Ninfa|first=Alexander|last2=Ballou|first2=David|last3=Benore|first3=Marilee|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=978-0470087664|location=United States|pages=408\u2013410}}</ref>  Researchers have identified the complete sequence of the human genome.

PCR is a very powerful and significant analytical tool to use for forensic DNA typing because researchers only need a very small amount of the target DNA to be used for analysis. For example, a single human hair with attached hair follicle has enough DNA to conduct the analysis. Similarly, a few sperm, skin samples from under the fingernails, or a small amount of blood can provide enough DNA for conclusive analysis.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Less discriminating forms of [[DNA fingerprinting]] can help in ''[[DNA paternity testing]]'', where an individual is matched with their close relatives.  DNA from unidentified human remains can be tested, and compared with that from possible parents, siblings, or children.  Similar testing can be used to confirm the biological parents of an adopted (or kidnapped) child.  The actual biological father of a [[Anna Nicole Smith|newborn]] can also be [[DNA paternity testing|confirmed]] (or ruled out).\n* The PCR AMGX/AMGY design has been shown to not only facilitating in amplifying DNA sequences from a very minuscule amount of genome.

This ability of PCR augments many methods, such as generating ''[[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] [[Hybridization probe|probes]]'' for [[Southern blot|Southern]] or [[northern blot]] hybridization.  PCR supplies these techniques with large amounts of pure DNA, sometimes as a single strand, enabling analysis even from very small amounts of starting material.\n* The task of ''[[DNA sequencing]]'' can also be assisted by PCR.  Known segments of DNA can easily be produced from a patient with a genetic disease mutation.  Modifications to the amplification technique can extract segments from a completely unknown genome, or can generate just a single strand of an area of interest.\n* PCR has numerous applications to the more traditional process of ''[[DNA cloning]]''.  It can extract segments for insertion into a vector from a larger genome, which may be only available in small quantities.  Using a single set of 'vector primers', it can also analyze or extract fragments that have already been inserted into vectors.  Some alterations to the PCR protocol can ''generate mutations'' (general or site-directed) of an inserted fragment.\n* ''[[Sequence-tagged site]]s'' is a process where PCR is used as an indicator that a particular segment of a genome is present in a particular clone.  The [[Human Genome Project]] found this application vital to mapping the cosmid clones they were sequencing, and to coordinating the results from different laboratories.\n* An exciting application of PCR is the [[Phylogeny|phylogenic]] analysis of DNA from ''[[Ancient DNA|ancient sources]]'', such as that found in the recovered bones of [[Neanderthal]]s, from frozen tissues of [[mammoth]]s, or from the brain of Egyptian mummies. Have been amplified and sequenced.<ref name=\"Schochetman 1988 1154\u20131157\"/> In some cases the highly degraded DNA from these sources might be reassembled during the early stages of amplification.\n* A common application of PCR is the study of patterns of ''[[gene expression]]''.  Tissues (or even individual cells) can be analyzed at different stages to see which genes have become active, or which have been switched off.  This application can also use [[quantitative PCR]] to quantitate the actual levels of expression\n* The ability of PCR to simultaneously amplify several loci from individual sperm<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=2568090|pmc=1683385|year=1989|last1=Boehnke|first1=M.|title=Fine-structure genetic mapping of human chromosomes using the polymerase chain reaction on single sperm: Experimental design considerations|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=45|issue=1|pages=21\u201332|last2=Arnheim|first2=N.|last3=Li|first3=H.|last4=Collins|first4=F.

Rare crossover events between very close loci have been directly observed by analyzing thousands of individual sperms.  Similarly, unusual deletions, insertions, translocations, or inversions can be analyzed, all without having to wait (or pay) for the long and laborious processes of fertilization, embryogenesis, etc.\n* [[Site-directed mutagenesis]]: PCR can be used to create mutant genes with mutations chosen by scientists at will.  These mutations can be chosen in order to understand how proteins accomplish their functions, and to change or improve protein function.\n\n== Advantages ==\nPCR has a number of advantages. It is fairly simple to understand and to use, and produces results rapidly. The technique is highly sensitive with the potential to produce millions to billions of copies of a specific product for sequencing, cloning, and analysis. qRT-PCR shares the same advantages as the PCR, with an added advantage of quantification of the synthesized product.

The DNA polymerases initially employed for [[in vitro]] experiments presaging PCR were unable to withstand these high temperatures.<ref name=\"Saiki1\"/> So the early procedures for DNA replication were very inefficient and time-consuming, and required large amounts of DNA polymerase and continuous handling throughout the process.\n\nThe discovery in 1976 of [[Taq polymerase]]\u2014a DNA polymerase purified from the [[Thermophile|thermophilic bacterium]], ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'', which naturally lives in hot ({{convert|50|to|80|C|F}}) environments<ref name=\"Chien et al.\"/> such as hot springs\u2014paved the way for dramatic improvements of the PCR method. The DNA polymerase isolated from ''T. aquaticus'' is stable at high temperatures remaining active even after DNA denaturation,<ref name=\"Lawyer et al.\"/> thus obviating the need to add new DNA polymerase after each cycle.<ref name=\"Saiki2\"/> This allowed an automated thermocycler-based process for DNA amplification.\n\n===Patent disputes===\nThe PCR technique was patented by [[Kary Mullis]] and assigned to [[Cetus Corporation]], where Mullis worked when he invented the technique in 1983. The ''Taq'' polymerase enzyme was also covered by patents. There have been several high-profile lawsuits related to the technique, including an unsuccessful lawsuit brought by [[DuPont]]. The Swiss pharmaceutical company [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] purchased the rights to the patents in 1992 and currently holds those that are still protected.\n\nA related patent battle over the Taq polymerase enzyme is still ongoing in several jurisdictions around the world between Roche and [[Promega]].

PCR was invented in 1983 by the American biochemist [[Kary Mullis]]. It is fundamental to much of genetic testing including analysis of ancient samples of DNA and identification of infectious agents. Using PCR, copies of very small amounts of [[DNA sequences]] are exponentially amplified in a series or cycles of temperature changes.

Thermal cycling exposes reactants to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature-dependent reactions \u2013 specifically, [[DNA melting]] and [[enzyme]]-driven DNA replication. PCR employs two main reagents \u2013 [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] (which are short single strand DNA fragments known as [[oligonucleotide]]s that are a [[Complementary DNA|complementary]] sequence to the target DNA region) and a [[DNA polymerase]]. In the first step of PCR, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called [[Nucleic acid denaturation]]. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA. The two DNA strands then become [[DNA#Polymerases|templates]] for DNA polymerase to [[enzyme|enzymatically]] assemble a new DNA strand from free [[nucleotide]]s, the building blocks of DNA. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a [[chain reaction]] in which the original DNA template is [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] amplified.\n\nAlmost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as [[Taq polymerase]], an enzyme originally isolated from the [[thermophile|thermophilic]] bacterium ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]''. If the polymerase used was heat-susceptible, it would denature under the high temperatures of the denaturation step. Before the use of Taq polymerase, DNA polymerase had to be manually added every cycle, which was a tedious and costly process.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1525/abt.2012.74.4.9| title=Determining Annealing Temperatures for Polymerase Chain Reaction| journal=The American Biology Teacher| volume=74| issue=4| pages=256\u2013260| year=2012}}</ref>\n\nApplications of the technique include [[DNA cloning]] for [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]], gene cloning and manipulation, gene mutagenesis; construction of DNA-based [[phylogeny|phylogenies]], or functional analysis of [[gene]]s; [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and [[monitoring (medicine)|monitoring]] of [[hereditary disease]]s; amplification of ancient DNA;<ref name=\":0\"/> analysis of genetic fingerprints for [[DNA profiling]] (for example, in [[forensic science]] and [[parentage testing]]); and detection of [[pathogen]]s in [[nucleic acid test]]s for the diagnosis of [[infectious disease]]s.\n\n[[Image:PCR masina kasutamine.jpg|thumb|Placing a strip of eight PCR tubes into a [[thermal cycler]]]]\n\n==Principles==\n[[Image:G-Storm thermal cycler.jpg|thumb|A [[thermal cycler]] for PCR]]\n[[Image:Primitive PCR machine for scrap.JPG|thumb|An older, three-temperature [[thermal cycler]] for PCR]]\nPCR amplifies a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target).

The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to achieve the temperatures required at each step of the reaction (see below). Many modern thermal cyclers make use of the [[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier effect]], which permits both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes permit favorable [[thermal conductivity]] to allow for rapid thermal equilibration. Most thermal cyclers have heated lids to prevent condensation at the top of the reaction tube. Older thermal cyclers lacking a heated lid require a layer of oil on top of the reaction mixture or a ball of wax inside the tube.\n\n===Procedure===\nTypically, PCR consists of a series of 20\u201340 repeated temperature changes, called thermal cycles, with each cycle commonly consisting of two or three discrete temperature steps (see figure below). The cycling is often preceded by a single temperature step at a very high temperature (>{{convert|90|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}), and followed by one hold at the end for final product extension or brief storage. The temperatures used and the length of time they are applied in each cycle depend on a variety of parameters, including the enzyme used for DNA synthesis, the concentration of bivalent ions and dNTPs in the reaction, and the [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (''T<sub>m</sub>'') of the primers.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rychlik W, Spencer WJ, Rhoads RE | title=Optimization of the annealing temperature for DNA amplification in vitro| journal=Nucleic Acids Res| year=1990 | pages=6409\u20136412|volume=18|pmid=2243783 | doi = 10.1093/nar/18.21.6409 | issue=21 | pmc=332522}}</ref> The individual steps common to most PCR methods are as follows:\n\n* ''Initialization'': This step is only required for DNA polymerases that require heat activation by [[Polymerase chain reaction#Variations|hot-start PCR]].<ref name=antibody_hot_start>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sharkey | first1 = D.

This causes [[DNA melting]], or denaturation, of the double-stranded DNA template by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary bases, yielding two single-stranded DNA molecules. \n* ''[[Annealing (biology)|Annealing]]'': In the next step, the reaction temperature is lowered to {{convert|50|\u2013|65|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 20\u201340 seconds, allowing annealing of the primers to each of the single-stranded DNA templates. Two different primers are typically included in the reaction mixture: one for each of the two single-stranded complements containing the target region. The primers are single-stranded sequences themselves, but are much shorter than the length of the target region, complementing only very short sequences at the 3' end of each strand.\n\n: It is critical to determine a proper temperature for the annealing step because efficiency and specificity are strongly affected by the annealing temperature. This temperature must be low enough to allow for [[DNA\u2013DNA hybridization|hybridization]] of the primer to the strand, but high enough for the hybridization to be specific, i.e., the primer should bind ''only'' to a perfectly complementary part of the strand, and nowhere else. If the temperature is too low, the primer may bind imperfectly. If it is too high, the primer may not bind at all. A typical annealing temperature is about 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b0C below the ''T<sub>m</sub>'' of the primers used. Stable hydrogen bonds between complementary bases are formed only when the primer sequence very closely matches the template sequence. During this step, the polymerase binds to the primer-template hybrid and begins DNA formation.\n\n* ''Extension/elongation'': The temperature at this step depends on the DNA polymerase used; the optimum [[Enzyme|activity]] temperature for the thermostable DNA polymerase of [[Taq polymerase|Taq (Thermus aquaticus) polymerase]] is approximately {{convert|75|\u2013|80|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}},<ref name=\"Chien et al.\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Chien A, Edgar DB, Trela JM |year= 1976|title=Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus|journal=J.

In this step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand complementary to the DNA template strand by adding free dNTPs from the reaction mixture that are complementary to the template in the 5'-to-3' direction, [[condensation reaction|condensing]] the 5'-[[phosphate group]] of the dNTPs with the 3'-[[hydroxy group]] at the end of the nascent (elongating) DNA strand. The precise time required for elongation depends both on the DNA polymerase used and on the length of the DNA target region to amplify. As a rule of thumb, at their optimal temperature, most DNA polymerases polymerize a thousand bases per minute. Under optimal conditions (i.e., if there are no limitations due to limiting substrates or reagents), at each extension/elongation step, the number of DNA target sequences is doubled. With each successive cycle, the original template strands plus all newly generated strands become template strands for the next round of elongation, leading to exponential (geometric) amplification of the specific DNA target region.\n\n: The processes of denaturation, annealing and elongation constitute a single cycle. Multiple cycles are required to amplify the DNA target to millions of copies. The formula used to calculate the number of DNA copies formed after a given number of cycles is 2<sup>n</sup>, where ''n'' is the number of cycles. Thus, a reaction set for 30 cycles results in 2<sup>30</sup>, or {{formatnum:{{#expr:2^30}}}}, copies of the original double-stranded DNA target region.\n\n* ''Final elongation'': This single step is optional, but is performed at a temperature of {{convert|70|\u2013|74|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} (the temperature range required for optimal activity of most polymerases used in PCR) for 5\u201315 minutes after the last PCR cycle to ensure that any remaining single-stranded DNA is fully elongated.\n* ''Final hold'': The final step cools the reaction chamber to {{convert|4|\u2013|15|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for an indefinite time, and may be employed for short-term storage of the PCR products.\n\n[[File:Polymerase chain reaction.svg|frameless|center|Schematic drawing of a complete PCR cycle|835x835px]]\n[[Image:Roland Gel.JPG|thumb|[[Ethidium bromide]]-stained PCR products after [[gel electrophoresis]]. Two sets of primers were used to amplify a target sequence from three different tissue samples.

The size(s) of PCR products is determined by comparison with a [[DNA ladder]], a molecular weight marker which contains DNA fragments of known size run on the gel alongside the PCR products.\n[[File:Tucker PCR.png|center|Tucker PCR]]\n\n===Stages===\nAs with other chemical reactions, the reaction rate and efficiency of PCR are affected by limiting factors. Thus, the entire PCR process can further be divided into three stages based on reaction progress:\n* ''Exponential amplification'': At every cycle, the amount of product is doubled (assuming 100% reaction efficiency). After 30 cycles, a single copy of DNA can be increased up to 1,000,000,000 (one billion) copies. In a sense, then, the replication of a discrete strand of DNA is being manipulated in a tube under controlled conditions.<ref name=\"Schochetman 1988 1154\u20131157\">{{Cite journal|last=Schochetman|first=Gerald|last2=Ou|first2=Chin-Yih|last3=Jones|first3=Wanda K.|date=1988|title=Polymerase Chain Reaction|journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases|volume=158|issue=6|pages=1154\u20131157|doi=10.1093/infdis/158.6.1154|jstor=30137034|pmid=2461996}}</ref> The reaction is very sensitive: only minute quantities of DNA must be present.\n* ''Leveling off stage'': The reaction slows as the DNA polymerase loses activity and as consumption of reagents, such as dNTPs and primers, causes them to become more limited.\n* ''Plateau'': No more product accumulates due to exhaustion of reagents and enzyme.\n\n==Optimization==\n{{Main|PCR optimization}}\nIn practice, PCR can fail for various reasons, in part due to its sensitivity to contamination causing amplification of spurious DNA products.

Quantitative PCR is an established tool for DNA quantification that measures the accumulation of DNA product after each round of PCR amplification.\n\nqPCR allows the quantification and detection of a specific DNA sequence in real time since it measures concentration while the synthesis process is taking place. There are two methods for simultaneous detection and quantification. The first method consists of using [[fluorophore|fluorescent]] dyes that are retained nonspecifically in between the double strands. The second method involves probes that code for specific sequences and are fluorescently labeled. Detection of DNA using these methods can only be seen after the hybridization of probes with its complementary DNA takes place. An interesting technique combination is real-time PCR and reverse transcription. This sophisticated technique, called RT-qPCR, allows for the quantification of a small quantity of RNA. Through this combined technique, mRNA is converted to cDNA, which is further quantified using qPCR.

PCR-based tests have allowed detection of small numbers of disease organisms (both live or dead), in convenient [[Sputum|samples]].  Detailed genetic analysis can also be used to detect antibiotic resistance, allowing immediate and effective therapy.  The effects of therapy can also be immediately evaluated.\n* The spread of a ''[[Influenza|disease]] organism'' through populations of [[Chicken|domestic]] or [[Goose|wild]] animals can be monitored by PCR testing.  In many cases, the appearance of new virulent [[H5N1|sub-types]] can be detected and monitored.  The sub-types of an organism that were responsible for [[Influenza pandemic|earlier epidemics]] can also be determined by PCR analysis.\n*Viral DNA can be detected by PCR.

The high sensitivity of PCR permits virus detection soon after infection and even before the onset of disease.<ref name=\"Cai2014\"/> Such early detection may give physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The amount of virus (\"[[viral load]]\") in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques (see below).\n*Diseases such as pertussis (or whooping cough) are cause by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. This bacteria is marked by a serious acute respiratory infection that affects various animals and humans and has led to the deaths of many young children.

Minute samples of DNA can be isolated from a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|crime scene]], and [[Combined DNA Index System|compared]] to that from suspects, or from a [[National DNA database|DNA database]] of earlier evidence or convicts.  Simpler versions of these tests are often used to rapidly rule out suspects during a criminal investigation.  Evidence from decades-old crimes can be tested, confirming or [[Innocence Project|exonerating]] the people originally convicted.\n* Forensic DNA typing has been an effective way of identifying or exonerating criminal suspects due to analysis of evidence discovered at a crime scene. The human genome has many repetitive regions that can be found within gene sequences or in non-coding regions of the genome. Specifically, up to 40% of human DNA is repetitive.<ref name=\":0\"/> There are two distinct categories for these repetitive, non-coding regions in the genome. The first category is called variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), which are 10\u2013100 base pairs long and the second category is called short tandem repeats (STR) and these consist of repeated 2\u201310 base pair sections.  PCR is used to amplify several well-known VNTRs and STRs using primers that flank each of the repetitive regions. The sizes of the fragments obtained from any individual for each of the STRs will indicate which alleles are present. By analyzing several STRs for an individual, a set of alleles for each person will be found that statistically is likely to be unique.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology|last=Ninfa|first=Alexander|last2=Ballou|first2=David|last3=Benore|first3=Marilee|publisher=Wiley|year=2009|isbn=978-0470087664|location=United States|pages=408\u2013410}}</ref>  Researchers have identified the complete sequence of the human genome.

PCR is a very powerful and significant analytical tool to use for forensic DNA typing because researchers only need a very small amount of the target DNA to be used for analysis. For example, a single human hair with attached hair follicle has enough DNA to conduct the analysis. Similarly, a few sperm, skin samples from under the fingernails, or a small amount of blood can provide enough DNA for conclusive analysis.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Less discriminating forms of [[DNA fingerprinting]] can help in ''[[DNA paternity testing]]'', where an individual is matched with their close relatives.

Similar testing can be used to confirm the biological parents of an adopted (or kidnapped) child.  The actual biological father of a [[Anna Nicole Smith|newborn]] can also be [[DNA paternity testing|confirmed]] (or ruled out).\n* The PCR AMGX/AMGY design has been shown to not only facilitating in amplifying DNA sequences from a very minuscule amount of genome.

This ability of PCR augments many methods, such as generating ''[[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridization]] [[Hybridization probe|probes]]'' for [[Southern blot|Southern]] or [[northern blot]] hybridization.  PCR supplies these techniques with large amounts of pure DNA, sometimes as a single strand, enabling analysis even from very small amounts of starting material.\n* The task of ''[[DNA sequencing]]'' can also be assisted by PCR.  Known segments of DNA can easily be produced from a patient with a genetic disease mutation.  Modifications to the amplification technique can extract segments from a completely unknown genome, or can generate just a single strand of an area of interest.\n* PCR has numerous applications to the more traditional process of ''[[DNA cloning]]''.  It can extract segments for insertion into a vector from a larger genome, which may be only available in small quantities.  Using a single set of 'vector primers', it can also analyze or extract fragments that have already been inserted into vectors.  Some alterations to the PCR protocol can ''generate mutations'' (general or site-directed) of an inserted fragment.\n* ''[[Sequence-tagged site]]s'' is a process where PCR is used as an indicator that a particular segment of a genome is present in a particular clone.  The [[Human Genome Project]] found this application vital to mapping the cosmid clones they were sequencing, and to coordinating the results from different laboratories.\n* An exciting application of PCR is the [[Phylogeny|phylogenic]] analysis of DNA from ''[[Ancient DNA|ancient sources]]'', such as that found in the recovered bones of [[Neanderthal]]s, from frozen tissues of [[mammoth]]s, or from the brain of Egyptian mummies. Have been amplified and sequenced.<ref name=\"Schochetman 1988 1154\u20131157\"/> In some cases the highly degraded DNA from these sources might be reassembled during the early stages of amplification.\n* A common application of PCR is the study of patterns of ''[[gene expression]]''.  Tissues (or even individual cells) can be analyzed at different stages to see which genes have become active, or which have been switched off.  This application can also use [[quantitative PCR]] to quantitate the actual levels of expression\n* The ability of PCR to simultaneously amplify several loci from individual sperm<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=2568090|pmc=1683385|year=1989|last1=Boehnke|first1=M.|title=Fine-structure genetic mapping of human chromosomes using the polymerase chain reaction on single sperm: Experimental design considerations|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=45|issue=1|pages=21\u201332|last2=Arnheim|first2=N.|last3=Li|first3=H.|last4=Collins|first4=F.

Rare crossover events between very close loci have been directly observed by analyzing thousands of individual sperms.  Similarly, unusual deletions, insertions, translocations, or inversions can be analyzed, all without having to wait (or pay) for the long and laborious processes of fertilization, embryogenesis, etc.\n* [[Site-directed mutagenesis]]: PCR can be used to create mutant genes with mutations chosen by scientists at will.  These mutations can be chosen in order to understand how proteins accomplish their functions, and to change or improve protein function.\n\n== Advantages ==\nPCR has a number of advantages. It is fairly simple to understand and to use, and produces results rapidly. The technique is highly sensitive with the potential to produce millions to billions of copies of a specific product for sequencing, cloning, and analysis. qRT-PCR shares the same advantages as the PCR, with an added advantage of quantification of the synthesized product.

It requires prior knowledge of a DNA sequence, including differences between [[allele]]s, and uses primers whose 3' ends encompass the SNV (base pair buffer around SNV usually incorporated).

By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test-run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes.

Two sets of primers are used in two successive PCRs. In the first reaction, one pair of primers is used to generate DNA products, which besides the intended target, may still consist of non-specifically amplified DNA fragments. The product(s) are then used in a second PCR with a set of primers whose binding sites are completely or partially different from and located 3' of each of the primers used in the first reaction.

Quantitative PCR methods use fluorescent dyes, such as Sybr Green, EvaGreen or [[fluorophore]]-containing DNA probes, such as [[TaqMan]], to measure the amount of amplified product in real time.

The DNA polymerases initially employed for [[in vitro]] experiments presaging PCR were unable to withstand these high temperatures.<ref name=\"Saiki1\"/> So the early procedures for DNA replication were very inefficient and time-consuming, and required large amounts of DNA polymerase and continuous handling throughout the process.\n\nThe discovery in 1976 of [[Taq polymerase]]\u2014a DNA polymerase purified from the [[Thermophile|thermophilic bacterium]], ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]'', which naturally lives in hot ({{convert|50|to|80|C|F}}) environments<ref name=\"Chien et al.\"/> such as hot springs\u2014paved the way for dramatic improvements of the PCR method. The DNA polymerase isolated from ''T. aquaticus'' is stable at high temperatures remaining active even after DNA denaturation,<ref name=\"Lawyer et al.\"/> thus obviating the need to add new DNA polymerase after each cycle.<ref name=\"Saiki2\"/> This allowed an automated thermocycler-based process for DNA amplification.\n\n===Patent disputes===\nThe PCR technique was patented by [[Kary Mullis]] and assigned to [[Cetus Corporation]], where Mullis worked when he invented the technique in 1983. The ''Taq'' polymerase enzyme was also covered by patents. There have been several high-profile lawsuits related to the technique, including an unsuccessful lawsuit brought by [[DuPont]]. The Swiss pharmaceutical company [[Hoffmann-La Roche]] purchased the rights to the patents in 1992 and currently holds those that are still protected.\n\nA related patent battle over the Taq polymerase enzyme is still ongoing in several jurisdictions around the world between Roche and [[Promega]]. The legal arguments have extended beyond the lives of the original PCR and Taq polymerase patents, which expired on March 28, 2005.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.genengnews.com/magazine/49/advice-on-how-to-survive-the-taq-wars/ |title=Advice on How to Survive the Taq Wars|journal=GEN Genetic Engineering News \u2013 Biobusiness Channel|date=May 1, 2006 |volume=26|issue= 9}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biology}}\n*[[DNA spiking]]\n*[[Loop-mediated isothermal amplification]]\n*[[Selector-technique]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Library resources box\n |onlinebooks=no\n |by=no\n |lcheading=Polymerase chain reaction}}\n\n<!--PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Therefore, no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member. Other characteristics Lee and DeVore proposed were [[flux]] in territorial boundaries as well as in [[demography|demographic]] composition.\n\nAt the same conference, [[Marshall Sahlins]] presented a paper entitled, \"[[Original affluent society|Notes on the Original Affluent Society]]\", in which he challenged the popular view of hunter-gatherers lives as \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\", as [[Thomas Hobbes]] had put it in 1651.\nAccording to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that hunter-gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more [[leisure]] than typical members of industrial society, and they still ate well.

The researchers estimated that the average Gini coefficient amongst hunter-gatherers was 0.25, equivalent to the country of Denmark in 2007. In addition, wealth transmission across generations was also a feature of hunter-gatherers, meaning that \"wealthy\" hunter-gatherers, within the context of their communities, were more likely to have children as wealthy as them than poorer members of their community and indeed hunter-gatherer societies demonstrate an understanding of social stratification. Thus while the researchers agreed that hunter-gatherers were more egalitarian than modern societies, prior characterisations of them living in a state of egalitarian primitive communism were inaccurate and misleading.<ref>Smith, Eric Alden, Kim Hill, Frank W.

Therefore, no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member. Other characteristics Lee and DeVore proposed were [[flux]] in territorial boundaries as well as in [[demography|demographic]] composition.\n\nAt the same conference, [[Marshall Sahlins]] presented a paper entitled, \"[[Original affluent society|Notes on the Original Affluent Society]]\", in which he challenged the popular view of hunter-gatherers lives as \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\", as [[Thomas Hobbes]] had put it in 1651.\nAccording to Sahlins, ethnographic data indicated that hunter-gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more [[leisure]] than typical members of industrial society, and they still ate well.

The researchers estimated that the average Gini coefficient amongst hunter-gatherers was 0.25, equivalent to the country of Denmark in 2007. In addition, wealth transmission across generations was also a feature of hunter-gatherers, meaning that \"wealthy\" hunter-gatherers, within the context of their communities, were more likely to have children as wealthy as them than poorer members of their community and indeed hunter-gatherer societies demonstrate an understanding of social stratification. Thus while the researchers agreed that hunter-gatherers were more egalitarian than modern societies, prior characterisations of them living in a state of egalitarian primitive communism were inaccurate and misleading.<ref>Smith, Eric Alden, Kim Hill, Frank W.
