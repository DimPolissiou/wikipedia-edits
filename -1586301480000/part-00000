Benjamin Fisz]]. The film documented the events of the [[Battle of Britain]]. The film drew many respected British actors to accept roles as key figures of the battle, including [[Sir Laurence Olivier]] as [[Sir Hugh Dowding]] and [[Trevor Howard]] as [[Keith Park]].<ref name=\"BOBFilm\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/05/19/battle_of_britain_SE_1969_dvd_review.shtml Battle of Britain: Special Edition DVD (1969)] BBC. Retrieved: 22 December 2011</ref> It also starred [[Michael Caine]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Squadron Leaders.<ref name=\"BOBFilm\"/> The script by [[James Kennaway]] and [[Wilfred Greatorex]] was based on the book ''The Narrow Margin'' by [[Derek Wood (author)|Derek Wood]] and Derek Dempster.\n\nThe film endeavoured to be an accurate account of the Battle of Britain, when in the summer and autumn of 1940 the British [[RAF]] inflicted a strategic defeat on the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and so ensured the cancellation of [[Operation Sea Lion]] \u2013 [[Adolf Hitler]]'s plan to invade Britain. The film is notable for its spectacular flying sequences, in contrast with the unsatisfactory model work seen in ''[[Angels One Five]]'' (1952). It was on a far larger scale than had been seen on film before and this made the film's production very expensive.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[Battle of France]] in June 1940, [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilots evacuate a small airfield in advance of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Blitzkrieg]]''. The pilots, along with [[Great Britain|British]] and [[france|French]] military, leave just as German aircraft arrive and execute a heavy strafing attack. RAF [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Hugh Dowding]] ([[Laurence Olivier]]), realising that an imminent invasion of Great Britain will require every available aircraft and airman to counter it, stops additional aircraft being deployed to France so that they are available to defend Britain. In the next dramatic scene, French civilians watch in grim despair as a convoy of German troops marches into France and takes control.\n\nAt the deserted beaches of [[Dunkirk]], the [[BBC]] reports [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]'s declaration that \"what [[General Weygand]] called the 'Battle of France' is over, the [[Battle of Britain]] is about to begin\". [[Luftwaffe Inspector-General Field Marshal Milch]] arrives to inspect a large German airfield in captured France. Hundreds of [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber aircraft are stationed under Luftwaffe General [[Albert Kesselring|Kesselring]]'s command.\n\n[[Luftwaffe]] commanders are stunned when the [[F\u00fchrer]] informs them that the British are not their \"natural enemy\" and delays their attack while attempting a diplomatic settlement. In neutral [[Switzerland]], the German ambassador, Baron von Richter ([[Curd J\u00fcrgens]]) officially proposes new peace terms to his British counterpart, [[David Victor Kelly|Sir David Kelly]] ([[Ralph Richardson]]), stating that continuing to fight the \"masters\" of Europe is hopeless. Kelly's brave retort, \"Don't threaten or dictate to us until you're marching up Whitehall ... and even then we won't listen\", is followed by a private comment to his wife that von Richter is probably correct. In England, commanders celebrate their good fortune, using the delay to build up their strength and continually train their pilots and ground controllers.\n\nThe wait finally ends when Luftwaffe pilots receive orders to move to the front, where troops are preparing for a [[Operation Sea Lion|sea-borne invasion]]. The campaign begins with the Luftwaffe launching an early morning assault on \"[[Adlertag|Eagle Day]]\". The plan is to destroy the RAF on the ground before they have time to launch their [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] fighters.\n\nEagle Day proves highly successful, with attacks on British [[radar]] installations by [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka dive bombers]]. Two radar stations are put out of action and a number of British airfields are damaged or destroyed but British losses are relatively light. A grueling battle of attrition ensues, with the RAF airfields under repeated attack while inflicting heavy, but non-critical, damage on the attacking forces.\n\nAdding to the RAF's problems is a battle between the commanding officers of [[No. 11 Group RAF|11 Group]], [[Keith Park]] ([[Trevor Howard]]), and [[No. 12 Group RAF|12 Group]], [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]] ([[Patrick Wymark]]). 12 Group is tasked with protecting 11 Group's airfields while 11 Group meets the enemy, but in raid after raid 12 Group aircraft are nowhere to be seen. Called to meet Dowding, Leigh-Mallory explains that the \"[[Big Wing]]\" tactic takes time for form up, while Park complains that the tactic simply is not working. Dowding ends the debate noting a critical shortage of pilots, wearily remarking, \"We're fighting for survival, and losing.\"\n\nThe turning point occurs when a squadron of German bombers becomes lost in bad weather at night and drops bombs on [[London]]. In retaliation, the RAF attacks [[Berlin]]. Though the damage is negligible, an enraged [[Adolf Hitler]] publicly orders [[The Blitz|London to be razed]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] (Hein Riess) arrives in France to personally command the attack, confident that the end of the battle nears. Their first attack skirts the RAF, who are still defending their airfields to the south, and they bomb unopposed. Night time attacks follow and London burns.\n\nMeanwhile, to supplement Commonwealth forces, the RAF has been forming units of foreign pilots who have escaped German-occupied countries; the main difficulty is their lack of English-language skills. While on a training flight, a [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Free Polish]] squadron accidentally runs into an unescorted flight of German bombers. Ignoring the commands of their British training officer, they peel off one by one and shoot down several of the bombers with unorthodox aggressive tactics. Park rewards them by elevating them to operational status, leading Dowding to do the same for the [[Canadians|Canadian]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] squadrons as well.\n\nWhile discussing the day's events, Park and Dowding examine the German switch to London. Given a respite, Park notes that he will be able to repair his airfields and bring his squadrons back to full strength. Dowding adds that 12 Group units north of London are now all within range, while enemy fighters are at the extreme edge of their own range. He concludes that \"turning on London could be the German's biggest blunder.\"\n\nThe next German daytime raid is met by a massive response; watching his formations build up in 11 Group's operations room, [[John Verney, 20th Baron Willoughby de Broke|Wing Commander Willoughby]] ([[Robert Flemyng]]) wryly states \"this should give them something to think about.\" RAF fighters arranged into large groups, attack en masse, overwhelming the German raids. Luftwaffe losses are now critical and G\u00f6ring is incensed, ordering his fighters remain with the bombers, an order the pilots hate because it robs them of the mobility required to keep the British squadrons off the German bombers. Losses continue to mount on both sides.\n\nThe climactic [[Battle of Britain Day|air battle of 15 September 1940]] arrives, with [[Winston Churchill]] in attendance at 11 Group's operations room. In the underground bunker, British ground control personnel order every squadron into the air to meet the massive attack. Intense combat in the sky over London follows, with both sides taking heavy losses. The outcome is so confused that Dowding refuses to comment on the events.\n\nThe next day the RAF anxiously await a raid that never comes. Likewise the Luftwaffe is disheartened by heavy losses and also await orders that never come to resume raiding. Two German anti-aircraft gunners, who had earlier observed a French port teeming with [[Kriegsmarine]] vessels and landing barges, now observe a deserted harbour basin. G\u00f6ring leaves the front, accusing his commanders of betrayal. Dowding looks out over the gardens and up to the sky where the words of Winston Churchill appear onscreen: ''\"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\"''<ref>{{YouTube|id=eYoERWmZdZ8#t=1m36s|title=Battle of Britain \u2013 Finale}} Retrieved: 27 March 2011.</ref>\n\n==Cast==\nThe ''Battle of Britain'' has a large [[all-star]] international cast.

In September 1965 producers [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[S. Benjamin Fisz]] contacted former [[RAF Bomber Command]] [[Group Captain]] [[T.G. 'Hamish' Mahaddie]] to find the aircraft and arrange their use.<ref name=\"Hankin p. 48.\">Hankin 1968, p. 48.</ref> Eventually 100 aircraft were employed, called the \"35th largest air force in the world\".<ref name=\"Hankin p. 49.\">Hankin 1968, p. 49.</ref> With Mahaddie's help, the producers located 109 Spitfires in the UK, of which 27 were available although only 12 could be made flyable. Mahaddie negotiated use of six Hawker Hurricanes, of which three were flying.<ref>Schnepf 1970, p. 25.</ref> The film helped preserve these aircraft, including a rare Spitfire Mk II which had been a gate guardian at [[RAF Colerne]] in Wiltshire.<ref name=\"Hankin p. 48.\" />\n\nDuring the actual aerial conflict, all RAF Spitfires were [[Supermarine Spitfire variants#Mk I (Type 300)|Spitfire Mk I]] and Mark II variants. However, only one Mk Ia and one Mk IIa (the latter with a Battle of Britain combat record) could be made airworthy, so the producers had to use seven other different marks, all of them built later in the war. To achieve commonality, the production made some modifications to \"standardise\" the Spitfires, including adding elliptical wingtips, period canopies and other changes. To classic aircraft fans, they became known as [[British military aircraft designation systems|\"Mark]] Haddies\" (a play on Grp. Capt. Mahaddie's name).<ref name=\"Hankin p. 48.\" /> A pair of two-seat trainer Spitfires were camera platforms to achieve realistic aerial footage inside the battle scenes.<ref>Schnepf 1970, p. 45.</ref> A rare Hawker Hurricane XII had been restored by Canadian Bob Diemert, who flew the aircraft in the film.

It was fitted with camera positions in what were formerly the aircraft's nose, tail and waist gun positions. An additional camera, on an articulating arm, was mounted in the aircraft's bomb bay and allowed 360-degree shots from below the aircraft. The top gun turret was replaced with a clear dome for the aerial director, who would co-ordinate the other aircraft by radio.<ref name=\"flight-04-04-1968\">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200505.html \"It's 1940 Again\",] ''[[Flight International|Flight]]'', Volume 93, Issue 3082, 4 April 1968.

They also located 27 [[Hispano Aviacion Ha 1112|Hispano Aviaci\u00f3n HA-1112 M1L 'Buchon']] single-engined fighters, a Spanish version of the German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]].

Although most of these replicas were destroyed during filming, a small number were made available to museums in the UK.<ref name=\"Rudhall May 1988 p. 10.\">Rudhall May 1988, p. 10.</ref>\n\nThe other need was for models in aerial sequences, and art director and model maker John Siddall was asked by the producer to create and head a team specifically for this because of his contacts in the modelling community. {{#tag:ref|Modellers included Mick Charles, Jack Morton and Chris Ohlson. Siddall was told by production that the models would not get any credit because they didn't want it generally known that models were used in the film. |group=Note}} A test flight was arranged at [[Lasham Airfield]] in the UK and a model was flown down the runway close behind a large American estate car with a cameraman in the rear.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  This test proved successful, leading to many radio-controlled models being constructed in the band rehearsal room at Pinewood Studios. Over a period of two years, a total of 82 Spitfires, Hurricanes, Messerschmitts and He 111s were built.<ref name=\"Rudhall August 1988 p. 35.\" /> Radio-controlled Heinkel He 111 models were flown to depict bombers being destroyed over the [[English Channel]]. When reviewing the footage of the first crash, the producers noticed a trailing-wire antenna; this was explained by an added cutaway in which the control wires of a Heinkel are seen shot loose.<ref name=\"Rudhall May 1988 p. 10.\" />\n\n===Releases===\nThe quote from the 20 August 1940 speech was changed when the movie was released on DVD in 2003. Onscreen, instead of the quote about \"The Few,\" this Churchill quote appears: \"This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\"<ref>Battle of Britain DVD, MGM Home Entertainment, Inc., 2003; minute 130, just before the credits roll</ref> The 2004 Special Edition, however, reverts to the quotation about [[The Few]]: \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\"\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nThe film is generally faithful to events and, although merging some characters, it sticks to the orthodox view \u2013 that the Germans threw away strategic advantage by switching bombing from RAF airfields to London in revenge for RAF raids on [[Berlin]].\n\nSome later scholarship has cast doubt on one or another aspect of the orthodox view, arguing either: (a) that the switch to bombing London was made not for reasons of revenge but because the Germans thought they had already defeated RAF Fighter Command or (b) that accelerated British aircraft production meant that the prospect of a German victory was never likely (this view seems doubtful, in part because the issue was the number of pilots).<ref>Robinson 1987, p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe film includes a sequence which relates the events of 15 August 1940, in which the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attempted to overwhelm fighter defences by simultaneous attacks on northern and southern England, the ''Luftwaffe'' reasoning that \"even a Spitfire can't be in two places at once\".  North East England was attacked by 65 Heinkel He 111s escorted by 34 Messerschmitt Bf 110s and [[RAF Driffield]] was attacked by 50 unescorted Junkers Ju. 88s. Out of 115 bombers and 35 fighters sent, 16 bombers and seven fighters were lost. As a result of these casualties, ''Luftflotte'' 5 did not appear in strength again in the campaign.<ref>[http://www.battleofbritain1940.net/document-32.html \"Document 32.\"] ''Battle of Britain Historical Society''.

The scene in the operation room in which the British listen to their fighters' wireless transmissions is dramatic licence. The operations room received information by telephone from the sector airfields. The scenes at the end, where the RAF pilots are seen suddenly idle and left awaiting the return of the ''Luftwaffe'' raids, are more licence; the fighting fizzled out through late September, although daylight raids continued for some weeks after the 15 September engagement. 31 October 1940 is regarded as the official end on the British side.\n\n[[File:Dorniervictoriastation.jpg|thumb|left|Zehbe's Dornier falling on Victoria Station after being rammed by [[Flight Sergeant]] [[Ray Holmes]], 15 September 1940]] The Edward Fox character \"Pilot Officer Archie\", is based on [[Ray Holmes]] of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF]]. On 15 September 1940, now known as \"[[Battle of Britain Day]]\", Holmes used his [[Hawker Hurricane]] to destroy a [[Dornier Do 17]] bomber over London by ramming but at the loss of his own aircraft (and almost his own life) in one of the defining moments of the [[Battle of Britain]]. Holmes, making a head-on attack, found his guns inoperative. He flew his plane into the top-side of the German bomber, cutting off the rear tail section with his wing and causing the bomber to dive out of control and crash. The Dornier pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack, while the injured Holmes bailed out of his plane and survived.<ref>''Those Other Eagles'', Shores, (2004)</ref> As the RAF did not practice ramming as an air combat tactic, this was considered an impromptu manoeuvre and an act of selfless courage. Holmes was feted by the press as a [[war hero]] who saved [[Buckingham Palace]]. This event became one of the defining moments of the [[Battle of Britain]] and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from [[Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] who had witnessed the event.<ref>[http://members.lycos.co.uk/ErnieBurton/Pilots/Ogilvie_Alfred_Keith \"Alfred Keith Ogilvie Battle of Britain Pilot with 609 Squadron.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030509004522/http://members.lycos.co.uk/ErnieBurton/Pilots/Ogilvie_Alfred_Keith |date=9 May 2003 }} ''lycos.co.uk''. Retrieved: 25 July 2009.</ref> This event is depicted, with considerable artistic licence, in the film.\n\nThe confrontation between Dowding and [[Keith Park]] and [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]] is fictitious, though there were undoubted tensions between the two sides. The film does not mention that, following the Battle of Britain, Dowding and Park were replaced by [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]] and Leigh-Mallory, despite Dowding and Park having demonstrated that Leigh-Mallory's \"Big Wing\" strategy was unworkable.<ref>Deighton, Len. ''Fighter: The True Story of the Battle of Britain.'' New York: Ballantine Books, 1979. {{ISBN|0-06-100802-8}}.</ref>\n\nOne omission is at the end of the film, when casualties are listed.  The film does not mention losses by the ''[[Corpo Aereo Italiano]]'', an Italian [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] that took part, nor is its participation mentioned during the film. One anomalous entry in the list of pilots who served with the RAF is a [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestinian]] pilot described by the credits as ''Israeli'', even though the [[State of Israel]] was only created in 1948. This referred to [[George Goodman (RAF officer)|George Goodman]], an ace born in [[Haifa]] while [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] was under British administration, who was killed in action in 1941. There was no attempt to recreate tracer rounds. G\u00f6ring's train in the film is Spanish rather than French (the RENFE markings are just visible on its tender) and the steam locomotive shown did not come into service on Spanish National Railways ([[RENFE]]) until 1951.\n\nThe character Major Falke is based on ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Adolf Galland]], a famous ace during the Second World War, who did ask ''[[Reichsmarshall]]'' G\u00f6ring for \"an outfit of Spitfires for my squadron\".{{Sfn | Mosley | 1969 | p = 99}} Galland explained in his autobiography that his request was only a way to upset G\u00f6ring, because he was \"unbelievably vexed at the lack of understanding and stubbornness with the command (i.e. G\u00f6ring) who gave us orders we could not execute\". Galland did feel that the Spitfire was more manoeuvrable than the Me 109, which he felt made it more suitable as a defensive fighter but he also states that \"fundamentally I preferred the Bf 109\".<ref>Galland 2005, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> Galland was upset about the director's decision not to use the real names. While making the film, Galland was joined by his friend [[Robert Stanford Tuck]].{{Sfn | Baker | 1996 | p = 304}}\n\nDuring filming, Galland, who was acting as a German technical adviser, took exception to a scene where Kesselring is shown giving the Nazi salute, rather than the standard military salute. Journalist [[Leonard Mosley]] witnessed Galland spoiling the shooting and having to be escorted off the set. Galland subsequently threatened to withdraw from the production, warning \"dire consequences for the film if the scene stayed in\".{{sfn|Mosley|1969|p=105}} When the finished scene was screened before Galland and his lawyer, he was persuaded to accept the scene after all.{{sfn|Mosley|1969|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\n==Musical score==\nAs recounted in Mervyn Cooke's ''A History of Film Music'' (2008), the film has two musical scores. The first was written by [[William Walton|Sir William Walton]], then in his late 60s, and conducted by [[Malcolm Arnold]], who also assisted Walton with the orchestration - notably the music accompanying the Blitz sequences,<ref name=\"Tierney p. 153\">Tierney 1984, p. 153.</ref> and some sections of \"Battle in the Air\", which may have involved some compositional \"patches\" by Arnold.<ref>Conway, Paul. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2000/jan00/battle.htm \"Battle of Britain: Ron Goodwin and William Walton.\"] ''Classical Music on the Web.'' Retrieved: 7 March 2014.</ref> Aside from the undoubted originality and impact of \"The Battle in the Air\" sequence, and an opening march (conducted at the sessions by Walton)<ref name=\"Kennedy p. 238\">Kennedy 1989, p. 238.</ref> which was described by a journalist present at its recording as \"a grand patriotic tune to out-type and out-glory any that Sir William has yet written, whether for films or coronations\",<ref name=\"Tierney p. 153\"/> much of Walton's score involves parodies of the horncall from Wagner's ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]''.\n\nHowever, [[Arnold Picker|Arnold]] and [[David V. Picker|David Picker]] - the brothers in charge of United Artists - insisted on having the music tracks sent to them in New York; their verdict on hearing the music, unaccompanied by the film, was that it was unsuitable and that a composer known to them should be hired to write a replacement score.<ref name=\"Kennedy p. 238\" /> The music department at [[United Artists]] furthermore objected that the score was too short to fill an LP recording which was intended to be marketed with the film.<ref>Kennedy 1989, pp. 238-239.</ref> As a result, [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] - who had scored several James Bond films - was approached, but he declined.<ref>Kennedy 1989, p. 239.</ref> The job was finally accepted by [[Ron Goodwin]], who also served as conductor. Producer [[S. Benjamin Fisz]] and actor Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] protested against this decision, and Olivier threatened to take his name from the credits. In the end, one segment of the Walton score, \"Battle in the Air\", which depicted the climactic air battles of 15 September 1940, was retained in the final cut, as well as a few bars of his march edited into the final scene before the credits roll. The Walton score for the battle sequence was played with no sound effects of aircraft engines or gunfire, giving the segment a transcendent, lyrical quality.\n\nPrime Minister [[Edward Heath]] retrieved Walton's manuscript from United Artists in 1972, presenting it to the composer at Walton's 70th birthday party held at [[10 Downing Street]]. Tapes of the Walton score were believed lost forever until being rediscovered in 1990 in the sound mixer's garage. Since then the score has been restored and released on compact disc. The option to watch the film with the complete Walton score was included on the Region 2 special edition DVD of the film, which was released in June 2004 and the Region A Blu-ray released on June 3, 2008.\n\nRon Goodwin's score opens with the \"Luftwaffe March\", later retitled \"[[Aces High (music)|Aces High]]\", in the style of a traditional German military march in 6/8 time.  The march places heavy emphasis on the \"oom-pah\" sound of tubas and lower-pitched horns on the first and second beats and has the [[glockenspiel]] double the horns in the melody. Because of the great length of this sequence, which shows a Luftwaffe general's inspection of a Heinkel squadron in occupied France, the \"Aces High\" has three separate bridges between choruses of the main theme, one of which recurs several times in a gently sentimental variation. Despite its origin in a representation of a tyrannical threat to democracy, the march has become a popular British march tune, like the ''[[Dambusters March]]''; an adaptation was first played by a British military band in 1974 by the Corps of Drums of the Royal Pioneer Corps and is now<ref>(R.P.C. Corps of Drums)</ref> frequently played at military parades and by marching bands in [[Northern Ireland]]. American radio personality and convicted [[Watergate]] conspirator [[G. Gordon Liddy]] has used the march as [[bumper music]] on his syndicated radio programme.\n\nReporting on the film's premiere, ''The Times'' commented: \"Handsomely shot, soberly put together, it is weighed down somewhat by a platitudinous score from Ron Goodwin. The only sequence of the rejected Walton score, the Battle in the Air, turned down allegedly because it was not long enough to fill an LP, is not perhaps vintage Walton, but at least lifts the film with moments of sharp excitement.\"<ref>''The Times'', 29 April 1971, p. 3.</ref><ref>Tierney 1984, p. 154.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn the United Kingdom, filming of the aerial battle scenes over London and the home counties had generated considerable pre-release publicity. Pre-release publicity included the film's quad posters on prominent billboard locations and features in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Magazine and local press. However, the film was released at a time when anti-war feeling stirred by the [[Vietnam War]] was running high, together with cynicism among post-war generations about the heroism of those who participated in the Battle of Britain. \n\nThe film's premiere was held at the [[Dominion Theatre]] in London on September 15, 1969 and was attended by 350 Battle of Britain veterans, including Air Chief Marshall Lord Dowding.<ref name=ukrev/>\n\nIt received mixed reviews in the UK<ref name=ukrev>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 24, 1969|page=6|title='Battle Of Britain's' Mixed Reviews In London, Hot B.O., Notables Attend}}</ref> and was not well received by American critics either. The [[Evening Standard]] called it \"an absorbing rather than a stirring film\", [[The Times]] noted that it was \"a discreet mixture of all possible approaches, tastefully done, not unintelligent, eminently respectable, and for the most part deadly dull\" while [[The Guardian]] was less impressed calling it \"neither a very good movie nor a very formidable piece of history\".<ref name=ukrev/> [[Vincent Canby]] wrote in the New York Times that \"'Battle of Britain,' which opened yesterday at the DeMille, 86th Street East and 34th Street East Theaters, is a homage to those airmen who, in 1940, broke the back of the threatened Nazi invasion. It is also one of those all-star non-movies, of a somewhat lower order than '[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]],' that attempt to recapitulate history, but add nothing to one's understanding. The mixture of minor-key fiction and restaged fact is\u2014for me, anyway\u2014never particularly satisfying, since it is denied the prerogatives and possibilities of both the documentary and the fiction film.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (21 October 1969).

Benjamin Fisz]]. The film documented the events of the [[Battle of Britain]]. The film drew many respected British actors to accept roles as key figures of the battle, including [[Sir Laurence Olivier]] as [[Sir Hugh Dowding]] and [[Trevor Howard]] as [[Keith Park]].<ref name=\"BOBFilm\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/05/19/battle_of_britain_SE_1969_dvd_review.shtml Battle of Britain: Special Edition DVD (1969)] BBC. Retrieved: 22 December 2011</ref> It also starred [[Michael Caine]], [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Squadron Leaders.<ref name=\"BOBFilm\"/> The script by [[James Kennaway]] and [[Wilfred Greatorex]] was based on the book ''The Narrow Margin'' by [[Derek Wood (author)|Derek Wood]] and Derek Dempster.\n\nThe film endeavoured to be an accurate account of the Battle of Britain, when in the summer and autumn of 1940 the British [[RAF]] inflicted a strategic defeat on the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and so ensured the cancellation of [[Operation Sea Lion]] \u2013 [[Adolf Hitler]]'s plan to invade Britain. The film is notable for its spectacular flying sequences, in contrast with the unsatisfactory model work seen in ''[[Angels One Five]]'' (1952). It was on a far larger scale than had been seen on film before and this made the film's production very expensive.\n\n==Plot==\nDuring the [[Battle of France]] in June 1940, [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilots evacuate a small airfield in advance of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Blitzkrieg]]''. The pilots, along with [[Great Britain|British]] and [[france|French]] military, leave just as German aircraft arrive and execute a heavy strafing attack. RAF [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Hugh Dowding]] ([[Laurence Olivier]]), realising that an imminent invasion of Great Britain will require every available aircraft and airman to counter it, stops additional aircraft being deployed to France so that they are available to defend Britain. In the next dramatic scene, French civilians watch in grim despair as a convoy of German troops marches into France and takes control.\n\nAt the deserted beaches of [[Dunkirk]], the [[BBC]] reports [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]]'s declaration that \"what [[General Weygand]] called the 'Battle of France' is over, the [[Battle of Britain]] is about to begin\". [[Luftwaffe Inspector-General Field Marshal Milch]] arrives to inspect a large German airfield in captured France. Hundreds of [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber aircraft are stationed under Luftwaffe General [[Albert Kesselring|Kesselring]]'s command.\n\n[[Luftwaffe]] commanders are stunned when the [[F\u00fchrer]] informs them that the British are not their \"natural enemy\" and delays their attack while attempting a diplomatic settlement. In neutral [[Switzerland]], the German ambassador, Baron von Richter ([[Curd J\u00fcrgens]]) officially proposes new peace terms to his British counterpart, [[David Victor Kelly|Sir David Kelly]] ([[Ralph Richardson]]), stating that continuing to fight the \"masters\" of Europe is hopeless. Kelly's brave retort, \"Don't threaten or dictate to us until you're marching up Whitehall ... and even then we won't listen\", is followed by a private comment to his wife that von Richter is probably correct. In England, commanders celebrate their good fortune, using the delay to build up their strength and continually train their pilots and ground controllers.\n\nThe wait finally ends when Luftwaffe pilots receive orders to move to the front, where troops are preparing for a [[Operation Sea Lion|sea-borne invasion]]. The campaign begins with the Luftwaffe launching an early morning assault on \"[[Adlertag|Eagle Day]]\". The plan is to destroy the RAF on the ground before they have time to launch their [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] fighters.\n\nEagle Day proves highly successful, with attacks on British [[radar]] installations by [[Junkers Ju 87|Stuka dive bombers]]. Two radar stations are put out of action and a number of British airfields are damaged or destroyed but British losses are relatively light. A grueling battle of attrition ensues, with the RAF airfields under repeated attack while inflicting heavy, but non-critical, damage on the attacking forces.\n\nAdding to the RAF's problems is a battle between the commanding officers of [[No. 11 Group RAF|11 Group]], [[Keith Park]] ([[Trevor Howard]]), and [[No. 12 Group RAF|12 Group]], [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]] ([[Patrick Wymark]]). 12 Group is tasked with protecting 11 Group's airfields while 11 Group meets the enemy, but in raid after raid 12 Group aircraft are nowhere to be seen. Called to meet Dowding, Leigh-Mallory explains that the \"[[Big Wing]]\" tactic takes time for form up, while Park complains that the tactic simply is not working. Dowding ends the debate noting a critical shortage of pilots, wearily remarking, \"We're fighting for survival, and losing.\"\n\nThe turning point occurs when a squadron of German bombers becomes lost in bad weather at night and drops bombs on [[London]]. In retaliation, the RAF attacks [[Berlin]]. Though the damage is negligible, an enraged [[Adolf Hitler]] publicly orders [[The Blitz|London to be razed]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] (Hein Riess) arrives in France to personally command the attack, confident that the end of the battle nears. Their first attack skirts the RAF, who are still defending their airfields to the south, and they bomb unopposed. Night time attacks follow and London burns.\n\nMeanwhile, to supplement Commonwealth forces, the RAF has been forming units of foreign pilots who have escaped German-occupied countries; the main difficulty is their lack of English-language skills. While on a training flight, a [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Free Polish]] squadron accidentally runs into an unescorted flight of German bombers. Ignoring the commands of their British training officer, they peel off one by one and shoot down several of the bombers with unorthodox aggressive tactics. Park rewards them by elevating them to operational status, leading Dowding to do the same for the [[Canadians|Canadian]] and [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] squadrons as well.\n\nWhile discussing the day's events, Park and Dowding examine the German switch to London. Given a respite, Park notes that he will be able to repair his airfields and bring his squadrons back to full strength. Dowding adds that 12 Group units north of London are now all within range, while enemy fighters are at the extreme edge of their own range. He concludes that \"turning on London could be the German's biggest blunder.\"\n\nThe next German daytime raid is met by a massive response; watching his formations build up in 11 Group's operations room, [[John Verney, 20th Baron Willoughby de Broke|Wing Commander Willoughby]] ([[Robert Flemyng]]) wryly states \"this should give them something to think about.\" RAF fighters arranged into large groups, attack en masse, overwhelming the German raids. Luftwaffe losses are now critical and G\u00f6ring is incensed, ordering his fighters remain with the bombers, an order the pilots hate because it robs them of the mobility required to keep the British squadrons off the German bombers. Losses continue to mount on both sides.\n\nThe climactic [[Battle of Britain Day|air battle of 15 September 1940]] arrives, with [[Winston Churchill]] in attendance at 11 Group's operations room. In the underground bunker, British ground control personnel order every squadron into the air to meet the massive attack. Intense combat in the sky over London follows, with both sides taking heavy losses. The outcome is so confused that Dowding refuses to comment on the events.\n\nThe next day the RAF anxiously await a raid that never comes. Likewise the Luftwaffe is disheartened by heavy losses and also await orders that never come to resume raiding. Two German anti-aircraft gunners, who had earlier observed a French port teeming with [[Kriegsmarine]] vessels and landing barges, now observe a deserted harbour basin. G\u00f6ring leaves the front, accusing his commanders of betrayal. Dowding looks out over the gardens and up to the sky where the words of Winston Churchill appear onscreen: ''\"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\"''<ref>{{YouTube|id=eYoERWmZdZ8#t=1m36s|title=Battle of Britain \u2013 Finale}} Retrieved: 27 March 2011.</ref>\n\n==Cast==\nThe ''Battle of Britain'' has a large [[all-star]] international cast.

In September 1965 producers [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[S. Benjamin Fisz]] contacted former [[RAF Bomber Command]] [[Group Captain]] [[T.G. 'Hamish' Mahaddie]] to find the aircraft and arrange their use.<ref name=\"Hankin p. 48.\">Hankin 1968, p. 48.</ref> Eventually 100 aircraft were employed, called the \"35th largest air force in the world\".<ref name=\"Hankin p. 49.\">Hankin 1968, p. 49.</ref> With Mahaddie's help, the producers located 109 Spitfires in the UK, of which 27 were available although only 12 could be made flyable. Mahaddie negotiated use of six Hawker Hurricanes, of which three were flying.<ref>Schnepf 1970, p. 25.</ref> The film helped preserve these aircraft, including a rare Spitfire Mk II which had been a gate guardian at [[RAF Colerne]] in Wiltshire.<ref name=\"Hankin p. 48.\" />\n\nDuring the actual aerial conflict, all RAF Spitfires were [[Supermarine Spitfire variants#Mk I (Type 300)|Spitfire Mk I]] and Mark II variants. However, only one Mk Ia and one Mk IIa (the latter with a Battle of Britain combat record) could be made airworthy, so the producers had to use seven other different marks, all of them built later in the war. To achieve commonality, the production made some modifications to \"standardise\" the Spitfires, including adding elliptical wingtips, period canopies and other changes. To classic aircraft fans, they became known as [[British military aircraft designation systems|\"Mark]] Haddies\" (a play on Grp. Capt. Mahaddie's name).<ref name=\"Hankin p. 48.\" /> A pair of two-seat trainer Spitfires were camera platforms to achieve realistic aerial footage inside the battle scenes.<ref>Schnepf 1970, p. 45.</ref> A rare Hawker Hurricane XII had been restored by Canadian Bob Diemert, who flew the aircraft in the film.

It was fitted with camera positions in what were formerly the aircraft's nose, tail and waist gun positions. An additional camera, on an articulating arm, was mounted in the aircraft's bomb bay and allowed 360-degree shots from below the aircraft. The top gun turret was replaced with a clear dome for the aerial director, who would co-ordinate the other aircraft by radio.<ref name=\"flight-04-04-1968\">[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200505.html \"It's 1940 Again\",] ''[[Flight International|Flight]]'', Volume 93, Issue 3082, 4 April 1968.

Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's original office, with the original furniture, was used.\n\n===Aircraft models===\nPermission was granted to the producers to use the [[Royal Air Force Museum London|Royal Air Force Museum's]] [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bomber (one of only two that survive intact).<ref name=\"RAF museum\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090416160834/http://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/london/collections/aircraft/aircraft_histories/78-AF-657%20%20Junkers%20JU-87.pdf \"Junkers Ju-87 G2 494083/8474M.\"] ''RAF Museum''.

The first requirement was for set decoration replicas. Production of full-size wood and fibreglass Hurricanes, Spitfires and Bf 109s commenced in a sort of production line set up at [[Pinewood Studios]]. A number of the replicas were fitted with motorcycle engines to enable them to taxi. Although most of these replicas were destroyed during filming, a small number were made available to museums in the UK.<ref name=\"Rudhall May 1988 p. 10.\">Rudhall May 1988, p. 10.</ref>\n\nThe other need was for models in aerial sequences, and art director and model maker John Siddall was asked by the producer to create and head a team specifically for this because of his contacts in the modelling community. {{#tag:ref|Modellers included Mick Charles, Jack Morton and Chris Ohlson. Siddall was told by production that the models would not get any credit because they didn't want it generally known that models were used in the film. |group=Note}} A test flight was arranged at [[Lasham Airfield]] in the UK and a model was flown down the runway close behind a large American estate car with a cameraman in the rear.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}  This test proved successful, leading to many radio-controlled models being constructed in the band rehearsal room at Pinewood Studios.

Onscreen, instead of the quote about \"The Few,\" this Churchill quote appears: \"This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\"<ref>Battle of Britain DVD, MGM Home Entertainment, Inc., 2003; minute 130, just before the credits roll</ref> The 2004 Special Edition, however, reverts to the quotation about [[The Few]]: \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.\"\n\n==Historical accuracy==\nThe film is generally faithful to events and, although merging some characters, it sticks to the orthodox view \u2013 that the Germans threw away strategic advantage by switching bombing from RAF airfields to London in revenge for RAF raids on [[Berlin]].\n\nSome later scholarship has cast doubt on one or another aspect of the orthodox view, arguing either: (a) that the switch to bombing London was made not for reasons of revenge but because the Germans thought they had already defeated RAF Fighter Command or (b) that accelerated British aircraft production meant that the prospect of a German victory was never likely (this view seems doubtful, in part because the issue was the number of pilots).<ref>Robinson 1987, p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe film includes a sequence which relates the events of 15 August 1940, in which the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attempted to overwhelm fighter defences by simultaneous attacks on northern and southern England, the ''Luftwaffe'' reasoning that \"even a Spitfire can't be in two places at once\".  North East England was attacked by 65 Heinkel He 111s escorted by 34 Messerschmitt Bf 110s and [[RAF Driffield]] was attacked by 50 unescorted Junkers Ju. 88s. Out of 115 bombers and 35 fighters sent, 16 bombers and seven fighters were lost. As a result of these casualties, ''Luftflotte'' 5 did not appear in strength again in the campaign.<ref>[http://www.battleofbritain1940.net/document-32.html \"Document 32.\"] ''Battle of Britain Historical Society''.

The scene in the operation room in which the British listen to their fighters' wireless transmissions is dramatic licence. The operations room received information by telephone from the sector airfields. The scenes at the end, where the RAF pilots are seen suddenly idle and left awaiting the return of the ''Luftwaffe'' raids, are more licence; the fighting fizzled out through late September, although daylight raids continued for some weeks after the 15 September engagement. 31 October 1940 is regarded as the official end on the British side.\n\n[[File:Dorniervictoriastation.jpg|thumb|left|Zehbe's Dornier falling on Victoria Station after being rammed by [[Flight Sergeant]] [[Ray Holmes]], 15 September 1940]] The Edward Fox character \"Pilot Officer Archie\", is based on [[Ray Holmes]] of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF]]. On 15 September 1940, now known as \"[[Battle of Britain Day]]\", Holmes used his [[Hawker Hurricane]] to destroy a [[Dornier Do 17]] bomber over London by ramming but at the loss of his own aircraft (and almost his own life) in one of the defining moments of the [[Battle of Britain]]. Holmes, making a head-on attack, found his guns inoperative. He flew his plane into the top-side of the German bomber, cutting off the rear tail section with his wing and causing the bomber to dive out of control and crash. The Dornier pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, bailed out, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack, while the injured Holmes bailed out of his plane and survived.<ref>''Those Other Eagles'', Shores, (2004)</ref> As the RAF did not practice ramming as an air combat tactic, this was considered an impromptu manoeuvre and an act of selfless courage. Holmes was feted by the press as a [[war hero]] who saved [[Buckingham Palace]]. This event became one of the defining moments of the [[Battle of Britain]] and elicited a congratulatory note to the RAF from [[Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] who had witnessed the event.<ref>[http://members.lycos.co.uk/ErnieBurton/Pilots/Ogilvie_Alfred_Keith \"Alfred Keith Ogilvie Battle of Britain Pilot with 609 Squadron.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030509004522/http://members.lycos.co.uk/ErnieBurton/Pilots/Ogilvie_Alfred_Keith |date=9 May 2003 }} ''lycos.co.uk''.

The film does not mention that, following the Battle of Britain, Dowding and Park were replaced by [[Sholto Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas of Kirtleside|Sholto Douglas]] and Leigh-Mallory, despite Dowding and Park having demonstrated that Leigh-Mallory's \"Big Wing\" strategy was unworkable.<ref>Deighton, Len. ''Fighter: The True Story of the Battle of Britain.'' New York: Ballantine Books, 1979. {{ISBN|0-06-100802-8}}.</ref>\n\nOne omission is at the end of the film, when casualties are listed.  The film does not mention losses by the ''[[Corpo Aereo Italiano]]'', an Italian [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] that took part, nor is its participation mentioned during the film. One anomalous entry in the list of pilots who served with the RAF is a [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestinian]] pilot described by the credits as ''Israeli'', even though the [[State of Israel]] was only created in 1948. This referred to [[George Goodman (RAF officer)|George Goodman]], an ace born in [[Haifa]] while [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] was under British administration, who was killed in action in 1941. There was no attempt to recreate tracer rounds. G\u00f6ring's train in the film is Spanish rather than French (the RENFE markings are just visible on its tender) and the steam locomotive shown did not come into service on Spanish National Railways ([[RENFE]]) until 1951.\n\nThe character Major Falke is based on ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Adolf Galland]], a famous ace during the Second World War, who did ask ''[[Reichsmarshall]]'' G\u00f6ring for \"an outfit of Spitfires for my squadron\".{{Sfn | Mosley | 1969 | p = 99}} Galland explained in his autobiography that his request was only a way to upset G\u00f6ring, because he was \"unbelievably vexed at the lack of understanding and stubbornness with the command (i.e. G\u00f6ring) who gave us orders we could not execute\". Galland did feel that the Spitfire was more manoeuvrable than the Me 109, which he felt made it more suitable as a defensive fighter but he also states that \"fundamentally I preferred the Bf 109\".<ref>Galland 2005, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> Galland was upset about the director's decision not to use the real names. While making the film, Galland was joined by his friend [[Robert Stanford Tuck]].{{Sfn | Baker | 1996 | p = 304}}\n\nDuring filming, Galland, who was acting as a German technical adviser, took exception to a scene where Kesselring is shown giving the Nazi salute, rather than the standard military salute. Journalist [[Leonard Mosley]] witnessed Galland spoiling the shooting and having to be escorted off the set. Galland subsequently threatened to withdraw from the production, warning \"dire consequences for the film if the scene stayed in\".{{sfn|Mosley|1969|p=105}} When the finished scene was screened before Galland and his lawyer, he was persuaded to accept the scene after all.{{sfn|Mosley|1969|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\n==Musical score==\nAs recounted in Mervyn Cooke's ''A History of Film Music'' (2008), the film has two musical scores. The first was written by [[William Walton|Sir William Walton]], then in his late 60s, and conducted by [[Malcolm Arnold]], who also assisted Walton with the orchestration - notably the music accompanying the Blitz sequences,<ref name=\"Tierney p. 153\">Tierney 1984, p. 153.</ref> and some sections of \"Battle in the Air\", which may have involved some compositional \"patches\" by Arnold.<ref>Conway, Paul. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2000/jan00/battle.htm \"Battle of Britain: Ron Goodwin and William Walton.\"] ''Classical Music on the Web.'' Retrieved: 7 March 2014.</ref> Aside from the undoubted originality and impact of \"The Battle in the Air\" sequence, and an opening march (conducted at the sessions by Walton)<ref name=\"Kennedy p. 238\">Kennedy 1989, p. 238.</ref> which was described by a journalist present at its recording as \"a grand patriotic tune to out-type and out-glory any that Sir William has yet written, whether for films or coronations\",<ref name=\"Tierney p. 153\"/> much of Walton's score involves parodies of the horncall from Wagner's ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]]''.\n\nHowever, [[Arnold Picker|Arnold]] and [[David V. Picker|David Picker]] - the brothers in charge of United Artists - insisted on having the music tracks sent to them in New York; their verdict on hearing the music, unaccompanied by the film, was that it was unsuitable and that a composer known to them should be hired to write a replacement score.<ref name=\"Kennedy p. 238\" /> The music department at [[United Artists]] furthermore objected that the score was too short to fill an LP recording which was intended to be marketed with the film.<ref>Kennedy 1989, pp. 238-239.</ref> As a result, [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] - who had scored several James Bond films - was approached, but he declined.<ref>Kennedy 1989, p. 239.</ref> The job was finally accepted by [[Ron Goodwin]], who also served as conductor. Producer [[S. Benjamin Fisz]] and actor Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] protested against this decision, and Olivier threatened to take his name from the credits. In the end, one segment of the Walton score, \"Battle in the Air\", which depicted the climactic air battles of 15 September 1940, was retained in the final cut, as well as a few bars of his march edited into the final scene before the credits roll. The Walton score for the battle sequence was played with no sound effects of aircraft engines or gunfire, giving the segment a transcendent, lyrical quality.\n\nPrime Minister [[Edward Heath]] retrieved Walton's manuscript from United Artists in 1972, presenting it to the composer at Walton's 70th birthday party held at [[10 Downing Street]]. Tapes of the Walton score were believed lost forever until being rediscovered in 1990 in the sound mixer's garage. Since then the score has been restored and released on compact disc. The option to watch the film with the complete Walton score was included on the Region 2 special edition DVD of the film, which was released in June 2004 and the Region A Blu-ray released on June 3, 2008.\n\nRon Goodwin's score opens with the \"Luftwaffe March\", later retitled \"[[Aces High (music)|Aces High]]\", in the style of a traditional German military march in 6/8 time.  The march places heavy emphasis on the \"oom-pah\" sound of tubas and lower-pitched horns on the first and second beats and has the [[glockenspiel]] double the horns in the melody. Because of the great length of this sequence, which shows a Luftwaffe general's inspection of a Heinkel squadron in occupied France, the \"Aces High\" has three separate bridges between choruses of the main theme, one of which recurs several times in a gently sentimental variation. Despite its origin in a representation of a tyrannical threat to democracy, the march has become a popular British march tune, like the ''[[Dambusters March]]''; an adaptation was first played by a British military band in 1974 by the Corps of Drums of the Royal Pioneer Corps and is now<ref>(R.P.C. Corps of Drums)</ref> frequently played at military parades and by marching bands in [[Northern Ireland]]. American radio personality and convicted [[Watergate]] conspirator [[G. Gordon Liddy]] has used the march as [[bumper music]] on his syndicated radio programme.\n\nReporting on the film's premiere, ''The Times'' commented: \"Handsomely shot, soberly put together, it is weighed down somewhat by a platitudinous score from Ron Goodwin. The only sequence of the rejected Walton score, the Battle in the Air, turned down allegedly because it was not long enough to fill an LP, is not perhaps vintage Walton, but at least lifts the film with moments of sharp excitement.\"<ref>''The Times'', 29 April 1971, p. 3.</ref><ref>Tierney 1984, p. 154.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nIn the United Kingdom, filming of the aerial battle scenes over London and the home counties had generated considerable pre-release publicity. Pre-release publicity included the film's quad posters on prominent billboard locations and features in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Magazine and local press. However, the film was released at a time when anti-war feeling stirred by the [[Vietnam War]] was running high, together with cynicism among post-war generations about the heroism of those who participated in the Battle of Britain. \n\nThe film's premiere was held at the [[Dominion Theatre]] in London on September 15, 1969 and was attended by 350 Battle of Britain veterans, including Air Chief Marshall Lord Dowding.<ref name=ukrev/>\n\nIt received mixed reviews in the UK<ref name=ukrev>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=September 24, 1969|page=6|title='Battle Of Britain's' Mixed Reviews In London, Hot B.O., Notables Attend}}</ref> and was not well received by American critics either. The [[Evening Standard]] called it \"an absorbing rather than a stirring film\", [[The Times]] noted that it was \"a discreet mixture of all possible approaches, tastefully done, not unintelligent, eminently respectable, and for the most part deadly dull\" while [[The Guardian]] was less impressed calling it \"neither a very good movie nor a very formidable piece of history\".<ref name=ukrev/> [[Vincent Canby]] wrote in the New York Times that \"'Battle of Britain,' which opened yesterday at the DeMille, 86th Street East and 34th Street East Theaters, is a homage to those airmen who, in 1940, broke the back of the threatened Nazi invasion. It is also one of those all-star non-movies, of a somewhat lower order than '[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]],' that attempt to recapitulate history, but add nothing to one's understanding.

Bradshaw]],<ref>Wynne Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BhXLTe3d5I4C&pg=PA52 ''Trail Riding Arizona'']</ref> who first crossed the area in 1862. A former [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|forty-niner]], Bradshaw knew that the northern gold mines were rapidly becoming exhausted and that the flood of refugees from the area would need a more direct trail from the south across the desert to the new strike at La Paz. Without a direct trail, it would be necessary to travel a great distance southeast to [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], then north up the river to La Paz. Bradshaw was also aware of the financial possibilities that could be found in a gold [[boomtown]]. In May 1862, Bradshaw and eight other men set out to find a direct route to La Paz.\n\nOriginally {{convert|180|mi|km}} long, the western trailhead began east of San Bernardino in the [[San Gorgonio Pass]].  Bradshaw and his party traveled southeast through Agua Caliente, now [[Palm Springs]], and then South to the village of where the [[Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians|Torres Martinez Indian Reservation]] is now located.  There Bradshaw was befriended by [[Cabazon Band of Mission Indians|Cabazon]], a chief of the Cahuilla Indians of the [[Salton Sink]], and a [[Maricopa people|Maricopa]] from Arizona who was visiting the Cahuilla villages.  They provided Bradshaw with the knowledge of the route of their ancient trade route through the Colorado Desert, including the location of springs and water holes.\n\nArmed with this information, Bradshaw traveled eastward near present-day [[Mecca]] at the northern tip of the Salton Sink, to [[Bitter Spring (Riverside County)|Bitter Spring]] at the foothills of the [[Orocopia Mountains]] and on 5 miles to an existing stage stop called \"[[Dos Palmas Spring]].\"  Leaving Dos Palmas, the men continued through the pass eastward between the Orocopia and [[Chocolate Mountains|Chocolate]] mountain ranges, briefly skirting the southern end of the [[Chuckwalla Mountains|Chuckwalla]] range, crossed through a gap in the [[Mule Mountains (California)|Mule Mountains]] and reaching the [[Palo Verde Valley]] two miles southwest of the modern community of [[Ripley, California|Ripley]]. Despite the fact that the trail crossed mostly barren desert, water was reasonably plentiful with water holes found at roughly {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} intervals at [[Canyon Springs]], [[Tabaseca Tanks]], [[Chuckwalla Springs]] and [[Mule Spring]].\n\nCrossing the Palo Verde Valley to the northwest they crossed a slough of the Colorado River called Laguna, and Willow Springs Station, to [[Bradshaw's Ferry]], the crossing point of the [[Colorado River]] to [[Mineral City, Arizona|Mineral City]] east of what is now [[Blythe, California|Blythe]].  Once they crossed the Colorado River, the party rode upstream for approximately five miles to the gold fields of La Paz.\n\nBetween 1862 and 1877, the Bradshaw Trail was the main stagecoach and wagon route between Southern California and the gold fields of La Paz and other places in western Arizona.  The [[La Paz - Wikenburg Road]] connected the Bradshaw Trail to the interior of Arizona Territory and the mining districts there.  Olive City was the first Bradshaw ferry crossing for the trail from 1862 to 1864.  With the founding of Mineral City, that became the new Bradshaw ferry crossing, and Mineral City became part of Ehrenberg when it was established in 1866.  From 1870 the trail ended and connected with the toll road to Wickenburg at Ehrenberg as La Paz, became a ghost town when its mines played out.\n\n== The trail today ==\nThe remaining fragment mostly crosses public land save for the extreme eastern end of the trail at [[Ripley, California|Ripley]], where it intersects 30th Avenue, {{convert|2|mi|km}} west of SR&nbsp;78.  Use of a [[four wheel drive]] vehicle is recommended to traverse the trail and no amenities may be found on the trail itself.\n\nAnother consideration is the [[Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range]] which borders a part of the Bradshaw Trail to the south.  This is a live [[bombing range]] and is clearly posted as such.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Arizona|California Roads|U.S. Roads}}\n* [[Wiley's Well]]{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n===Bibliography===\n* Gunther, Jane Davies.

Bradshaw]],<ref>Wynne Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BhXLTe3d5I4C&pg=PA52 ''Trail Riding Arizona'']</ref> who first crossed the area in 1862. A former [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|forty-niner]], Bradshaw knew that the northern gold mines were rapidly becoming exhausted and that the flood of refugees from the area would need a more direct trail from the south across the desert to the new strike at La Paz. Without a direct trail, it would be necessary to travel a great distance southeast to [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], then north up the river to La Paz. Bradshaw was also aware of the financial possibilities that could be found in a gold [[boomtown]]. In May 1862, Bradshaw and eight other men set out to find a direct route to La Paz.\n\nOriginally {{convert|180|mi|km}} long, the western trailhead began east of San Bernardino in the [[San Gorgonio Pass]].  Bradshaw and his party traveled southeast through Agua Caliente, now [[Palm Springs]], and then South to the village of where the [[Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians|Torres Martinez Indian Reservation]] is now located.  There Bradshaw was befriended by [[Cabazon Band of Mission Indians|Cabazon]], a chief of the Cahuilla Indians of the [[Salton Sink]], and a [[Maricopa people|Maricopa]] from Arizona who was visiting the Cahuilla villages.  They provided Bradshaw with the knowledge of the route of their ancient trade route through the Colorado Desert, including the location of springs and water holes.\n\nArmed with this information, Bradshaw traveled eastward near present-day [[Mecca]] at the northern tip of the Salton Sink, to [[Bitter Spring (Riverside County)|Bitter Spring]] at the foothills of the [[Orocopia Mountains]] and on 5 miles to an existing stage stop called \"[[Dos Palmas Spring]].\"  Leaving Dos Palmas, the men continued through the pass eastward between the Orocopia and [[Chocolate Mountains|Chocolate]] mountain ranges, briefly skirting the southern end of the [[Chuckwalla Mountains|Chuckwalla]] range, crossed through a gap in the [[Mule Mountains (California)|Mule Mountains]] and reaching the [[Palo Verde Valley]] two miles southwest of the modern community of [[Ripley, California|Ripley]]. Despite the fact that the trail crossed mostly barren desert, water was reasonably plentiful with water holes found at roughly {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} intervals at [[Canyon Springs]], [[Tabaseca Tanks]], [[Chuckwalla Springs]] and [[Mule Spring]].\n\nCrossing the Palo Verde Valley to the northwest they crossed a slough of the Colorado River called Laguna, and Willow Springs Station, to [[Bradshaw's Ferry]], the crossing point of the [[Colorado River]] to [[Mineral City, Arizona|Mineral City]] east of what is now [[Blythe, California|Blythe]].  Once they crossed the Colorado River, the party rode upstream for approximately five miles to the gold fields of La Paz.\n\nBetween 1862 and 1877, the Bradshaw Trail was the main stagecoach and wagon route between Southern California and the gold fields of La Paz and other places in western Arizona.  The [[La Paz - Wikenburg Road]] connected the Bradshaw Trail to the interior of Arizona Territory and the mining districts there.  Olive City was the first Bradshaw ferry crossing for the trail from 1862 to 1864.  With the founding of Mineral City, that became the new Bradshaw ferry crossing, and Mineral City became part of Ehrenberg when it was established in 1866.  From 1870 the trail ended and connected with the toll road to Wickenburg at Ehrenberg as La Paz, became a ghost town when its mines played out.\n\n== The trail today ==\nThe remaining fragment mostly crosses public land save for the extreme eastern end of the trail at [[Ripley, California|Ripley]], where it intersects 30th Avenue, {{convert|2|mi|km}} west of SR&nbsp;78.  Use of a [[four wheel drive]] vehicle is recommended to traverse the trail and no amenities may be found on the trail itself.\n\nAnother consideration is the [[Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range]] which borders a part of the Bradshaw Trail to the south.  This is a live [[bombing range]] and is clearly posted as such.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Arizona|California Roads|U.S. Roads}}\n* [[Wiley's Well]]{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n===Bibliography===\n* Gunther, Jane Davies.

I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to.
