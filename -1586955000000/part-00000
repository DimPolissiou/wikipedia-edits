{"title_page": "Top Storey Club", "text_new": "The '''Top Storey Club''' was a nightclub in [[Bolton]], [[Greater Manchester]], UK. It achieved notoriety for a fire which occurred in May 1961 in which 19 people perished.\n\n==The club==\n\nThe club was located on Crown Street in Bolton and was on the top floors of an old mill warehouse building. From the street front, the building had three floors but the warehouse was built on a slope so the rear had eight floors looking out on to the [[River Croal]] which at this point ran in a brick-lined channel. The club was opened in December 1960 by Stanley Wilcock, who rented the building, using the lower floors for his business, making kitchen furniture. In March 1961, Wilcock sold his interest in the nightclub which occupied the top two floors of the warehouse to two [[Manchester]] businessmen; Denis Wilson and Richard Sorrensen. Wilcock retained the lower floors for his furniture business.<ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.turnbullfiresafety.com/index.php?p=1_26| title = The Top Storey Club Fire 1961| accessdate = 9 January 2014}}</ref> The club was small with just a few tables where customers could sit and listen or dance to tape-recorded music. The maximum occupancy was about 200.\n\nThe owners of the building learnt of the nightclub's availability from an advertisement in the [[Bolton Evening News]] and were concerned the building would be unsuitable for such use. On 1 May 1961 at 10.35pm, one of the owners, Norman Balshaw went to the club and told Wilson and Sorrensen that the club was not to be continued, and they must vacate by 24 June.<ref name = Bolarc>Details of Coroner\u2019s Inquest, 30 January 1961 - June 13, 1961, Folder ABZ/73/1, Bolton Archive</ref>\n\n==The fire==\n\nOn the night of the fire, the club was quiet with it being a Monday. Between 20 and 25 people were in the club. At 11pm, less than half an hour after the visit by the owner, the manager Bill Bohannon smelt smoke. He went down the single wooden staircase, which was the only means of access and egress. Upon arriving at the ground floor, he saw smoke coming under the door leading to the furniture workshop. He kicked the door down and was confronted with a raging inferno.  The intensity of the fire prevented him returning upstairs, but he managed to escape. This inferno quickly spread up the stairs towards the club. As there was no other means of escape, some customers took to jumping from the windows. The windows available were those at the back, where there was an eight-floor drop onto bricks by the river channel.<ref>Bolton Evening News, May 2, 1961</ref>\n\nBolton Fire Brigade arrived within three minutes, but were unable to enter due to the intense fire. It was not possible to access the back with ladders, due to the river, and the turntable ladder was not long enough to bridge the river to reach the upper floors. Bolton were backed up by fire engines from [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], [[Horwich]] (Lancashire County Fire Brigade) and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] (Bury Fire Brigade). The blaze took 2.5 hours to bring under control and allow the firemen to bridge the burnt staircase with their ladders gaining access to the top floors.<ref>Bolton News, 20 June 2001</ref> The scene was, as one fireman said, \u201chorrific,\u201d with 14 people dead in the club. Of those in the club at the time of the fire, the manager Bill Bohannon escaped, 14 died in the club, five died from jump injuries and two, maybe three, jumped and survived. The number is not clear due to difficulty in accessing the river channel and a comment that someone who had jumped was seen running away.

This was an inward opening loading bay door, which would have given access to the outside front of the building and a drop of 2 floors, but the fitting of a false dance floor in the club prevented it from opening. It was disclosed the door could be opened but it needed to be lifted over the false floor for it to open, <ref name = Glasher />  something customers in their panic had never thought about. If this door had been opened all victims would probably have escaped. It was established that the blaze was so intense due to the highly flammable solvents and paints used in the furniture workshop. The cause of death was given as smoke inhalation. The fire never fully reached the top floor but the hot gases and smoke soon filled the whole building. Despite an investigation by the Police and Fire Brigade, no actual cause for the fire could be given and the [[Coroner]] recorded an [[open verdict]].<ref name = Bolarc /><ref name = Bolarc2 />\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nFollowing the fire, there was an outcry, and questions were asked in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972, when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].

He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972, when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.

He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses.

The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing.

Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

Unlike ''The Daily Show'', Oliver tends to explore one concept in depth but retains the appearance of commercial breaks to intercut larger topics with smaller segments that are not necessarily related to the topic at hand. The show is taped in front of a [[studio audience]], and HBO offers a limited number of free tickets to attend each week's ''Last Week Tonight'' taping. As of March 15, 2020, the show is being filmed with no live audience at an unspecified studio location due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nThe show's theme starts off every episode containing images relating to it or the world at large with satirical captions written in [[dog Latin]]. Each episode covers a small handful of shorter segments, and then one main segment. While the short segments almost always relate to recent news, the episode's main segment usually covers in length and detail a political issue, even if that issue did not have news media attention during the preceding week. On occasion, the short segments are omitted and the main segment takes up the entirety of the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10989154/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-season-3|last=Framke|first=Caroline|title=John Oliver on making Last Week Tonight and why he won't focus on the 2016 election|website=Vox|date=February 14, 2016|accessdate=March 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320052802/http://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10989154/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-season-3|archive-date=March 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOliver injects humor into his presentation, including satirical [[analogies]], and allusions to popular culture and celebrities. The show includes a panel in the upper-left corner that frequently displays a photo or graphic for that accompanies subject at hand, which aids in the humor. A full-screen graphic will show and play a video clip (such as excerpts from news show or documentaries) when Oliver is citing it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/why-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-is-the-next-generation-of-late-night-23696/|title=Why 'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' is The Next Generation of Late Night|last=Miller|first=Liz Shannon|website=IndieWire|language=en|date=July 29, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904015651/http://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/why-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-is-the-next-generation-of-late-night-23696/|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He often coins [[hashtag|hashtags]] related to his segment for use in [[social media]], some of which go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]].<ref name=Emertainment>{{cite web|url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/how-john-oliver-gets-social-media-right-while-the-rest-of-traditional-media-fails/|last=Solomon|first=Emily|title=How John Oliver Gets Social Media Right While the Rest of Traditional Media Fails|work=Emertainment Monthly|date=April 12, 2015|accessdate=June 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404222905/http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/how-john-oliver-gets-social-media-right-while-the-rest-of-traditional-media-fails/|archive-date=April 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA recurring element of the show is Oliver's use of mascots. The mascots used in the show include Jeff the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat, Hoots the NSA Owl, Taryn the Tinder Chicken, and the Last Week Tonight puppets.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ranker.com/list/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-mascots/ranker-tv | title=All the Mascot Costumes from Last Week Tonight, Ranked}}</ref> Oliver told Vulture in February 2019, \"I mean, the truth of the mascots is that we have a gigantic room filled with spectacular mascot costumes now.

Some of the episodes will follow up the main segment with another video compilation or news story. Oliver's speech is broken up with video compilations of recent news clips, or recurring segments, into which Oliver segues with the slogan, \"And now, this.\" Oliver has also ended some segments with mock trailers for fictional TV shows or commercials that satirize the subject of his speech.\n\n=== Celebrity guests===\nThe show frequently features one or more celebrity guests in its segments to help Oliver better get his point on the week's topic across. Guests have featured in many different capacities including giving monologues directly to camera, being interviewed by Oliver, playing musical numbers, participating in comedic skits with or without Oliver, or starring in fictitious parody [[Public service announcement|PSAs]]. On the show, guests are sometimes seen in the Last Week Tonight studio itself doing their part during the show's main taping, while at other times they are seen in video clips that were pre-recorded at a different location and later included in the show. Oliver often interviews personalities who were directly involved in or impacted by the issues being discussed in the show to get their first-hand experiences and viewpoints on the issue. Some of the famous personalities Oliver has interviewed include [[Edward Snowden]], the [[14th Dalai Lama|14th]] [[Dalai Lama]], [[Anita Hill|Professor Anita Hill]] and [[Monica Lewinsky]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver episodes}}\n{{:List of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver episodes}}\n\n==YouTube channel==\n''Last Week Tonight'' has a [[YouTube]] channel where videos are intermittently (depending on series) added after a show has aired.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight |title=Last Week Tonight channel |access-date=March 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313183030/https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight |archive-date=March 13, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the videos are of the main segment from each episode.

He then confessed the statement was not true and for the first time mentioned a book compiling his favorite history lies.\n\nA couple of weeks later, he published a web-exclusive video  based on that reference, expanding the content for a book called \"Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies\", to be released in the following spring. At the end of the mini-segment, however, he confesses again that the entire book was also a lie.\n\nIn what seems a continuation of the lie saga, the book surprisingly appeared on Amazon UK in October 2018.\n\nThe book description reads as follow: <blockquote>There is absolutely nothing more fun than lying confidently about history. Lying is incredibly fun. In fact, the only thing that feels better than lying to someone is lying to someone, then regaining their trust, and then lying to them again. This book, for example, was promised to be released in April 2016. But that was a lie. The plan was always October 2018. Because, you know, now is a time in history when lying openly gets you elected to office. </blockquote><blockquote>In this book, you will find plenty of plausible but completely unverifiable nonsense. Almost like watching Fox News but with a better sense of humour. Hopefully, it will teach you much about nothing other than the true joy of lying to people. Honestly, there has never been a better moment in history to be a liar. We have reached a point where truths have become lies and lies are now the truth. So learn from the greatest and get inspired by the best lies in history. </blockquote><blockquote>*NB: Most profits from this book are going to finance railway infrastructure under the English Channel.

Oliver used his book as a platform to criticize Pence's positions on LGBT issues, as it featured a rabbit in a same-sex relationship.<ref name=\"Daily Beast Bundo\">{{cite news |last=Stern |first=Marlow |date=March 19, 2018 |title=John Oliver Trolls Vice President Mike Pence With Gay Children's Book of His Pet Bunny |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-oliver-trolls-vice-president-mike-pence-with-gay-childrens-book-of-his-pet-bunny |work=Daily Beast |location= |access-date=March 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319104738/https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-oliver-trolls-vice-president-mike-pence-with-gay-childrens-book-of-his-pet-bunny |archive-date=March 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The book became the number-one book and e-book on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] the next day, and the top-selling audiobook on [[Audible (store)|Audible]].<ref name=\"Politico Bundo\">{{cite news |last=Nelson |first=Louis |date=March 19, 2018 |title=Comey's memoir tops Amazon's best-sellers list |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/19/james-comey-memoir-sales-470281 |work=Politico |location= |access-date=March 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319140528/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/19/james-comey-memoir-sales-470281 |archive-date=March 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/john-oliver-marlon-bundo-book-mike-pence-troll|title=John Oliver's Gay-Bunny Book Is Outselling the Mike Pence Book It's Trolling|first=Hillary|last=Busis|website=Vanity Fair|date=March 20, 2018|accessdate=June 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Russell Crowe's jockstrap===\n{{main|Russell Crowe's jockstrap}}\n[[Russell Crowe's jockstrap]] became a notable piece of memorabilia when it was purchased by the ''Last Week Tonight with John Oliver'' and then donated to a Blockbuster Video shop. The jockstrap reappeared in a skit in the final episode of the 2018 season of the show.\n\n===Robocalls===\nThe March 10, 2019, episode dealt primarily with [[robocalls]], and how the problem had mushroomed in recent years since being increasingly deregulated under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC Chairman]] [[Ajit Pai]]. To prove the point of how easy it was for any company to begin flooding anyone with robocalls, Oliver had one of his IT techs develop a system in which all of the FCC chairs would, at regular intervals on their personal phone numbers, receive a robocall followed immediately by [[bagpipe]] music. Oliver freely admitted his astonishment at just how easy this was to accomplish; the IT technician tasked with setting the system up told him they needed only 15 minutes to complete the project, doing so on a minimal budget. And per the very FCC regulations currently in place, Oliver quickly scrolled a section of fine print on screen at a random time during the segment, in which his office address was randomly embedded, and each FCC chair was required to send him an official letter to that address, notifying him in writing that they wished to have him cease all robocalls forthwith. Oliver was also flabbergasted at discovering that while tens of millions of dollars in fines were levied against companies for violating robocall regulations, only a few thousand dollars have ever been collected, effectively giving the companies free rein to continue robocalling unabated.\n\n===''Guinness World Records''===\nThe main story of the August 11, 2019 episode was [[Turkmenistan]] and its autocratic leader [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]]. The last portion of the segment centered around Berdimuhamedow's obsession with ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', with the Turkmen capital of [[Ashgabat]] being home to the most buildings with white marble cladding, the largest indoor [[Ferris wheel]], and the largest statue of a horse's head, among others. Oliver found that ''Guinness World Records'' received sums of money ranging from US$12,000 to US$500,000 from companies and authoritarian nations to set records for publicity. He ended the show with a 600 square foot [[marble cake]] adorned with a picture of Berdimuhamedow falling from a horse; he had requested a Guinness adjudicator to certify it as the world's largest marble cake, a record previously set by [[Betty Crocker]] in Saudi Arabia in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/09/a-gift-fresh-from-the-heart-in-saudi-arabia/|title=A gift 'fresh from the heart' in Saudi Arabia|website=General Mills|language=en|date=September 27, 2017|access-date=August 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815165112/https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/09/a-gift-fresh-from-the-heart-in-saudi-arabia/|archive-date=August 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Guinness refused, stating that because their brand was \"aligned with kids and families\", they would not send an adjudicator; Oliver mockingly commented that he didn't \"run a brutal enough dictatorship to meet Guinness World Records' high ethical standards\". Oliver claimed that Guinness offered to certify it after the fact only if he signed an agreement not to criticize their practices on the show, which Oliver dismissed as \"ridiculous\".<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9QYu8LtH2E |title=Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver |date=August 11, 2019 |author=HBO |access-date=August 15, 2019 |via=YouTube |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815170404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9QYu8LtH2E&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=August 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/|title=John Oliver Bakes Very Large Cake to Annoy Turkmenistan|website=Time|language=en|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814150445/https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/|archive-date=August 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Guinness called Oliver's allegations \"false and unfair\", claiming that they did not send an adjudicator because they felt the cake was specifically for the purpose of mocking a record holder, stating it was their policy \"not to partake in any activities which may belittle their achievements or subject them to ridicule\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/8/guinness-world-records-on-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-586398/|title=Guinness World Records on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|date=August 12, 2019|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813023105/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/8/guinness-world-records-on-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-586398/|archive-date=August 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Narendra Modi===\n\nJohn Oliver extensively satirized Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] in a broadcast which went online on February 23, 2020 calling him a temporary symbol of hate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIXUhZ2AWs |title=Last Week Tonight With John Oliver |publisher=Last Week Tonight |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was during a visit of US President [[Donald Trump]] to India, and in an [[Namaste Trump|organized rally]] which unexpectedly coincided with [[North East Delhi riots|large-scale violence in Delhi]], the country's capital.

Unlike ''The Daily Show'', Oliver tends to explore one concept in depth but retains the appearance of commercial breaks to intercut larger topics with smaller segments that are not necessarily related to the topic at hand. The show is taped in front of a [[studio audience]], and HBO offers a limited number of free tickets to attend each week's ''Last Week Tonight'' taping. As of March 15, 2020 the show is being filmed with no live audience at an unspecified studio location due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nThe show's theme starts off every episode containing images relating to it or the world at large with satirical captions written in [[dog Latin]]. Each episode covers a small handful of shorter segments, and then one main segment. While the short segments almost always relate to recent news, the episode's main segment usually covers in length and detail a political issue, even if that issue did not have news media attention during the preceding week. On occasion, the short segments are omitted and the main segment takes up the entirety of the episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10989154/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-season-3|last=Framke|first=Caroline|title=John Oliver on making Last Week Tonight and why he won't focus on the 2016 election|website=Vox|date=February 14, 2016|accessdate=March 21, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320052802/http://www.vox.com/2016/2/14/10989154/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-season-3|archive-date=March 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOliver injects humor into his presentation, including satirical [[analogies]], and allusions to popular culture and celebrities. The show includes a panel in the upper-left corner that frequently displays a photo or graphic for that accompanies subject at hand, which aids in the humor. A full-screen graphic will show and play a video clip (such as excerpts from news show or documentaries) when Oliver is citing it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/why-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-is-the-next-generation-of-late-night-23696/|title=Why 'Last Week Tonight With John Oliver' is The Next Generation of Late Night|last=Miller|first=Liz Shannon|website=IndieWire|language=en|date=July 29, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904015651/http://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/why-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-is-the-next-generation-of-late-night-23696/|archive-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> He often coins [[hashtag|hashtags]] related to his segment for use in [[social media]], some of which go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]].<ref name=Emertainment>{{cite web|url=http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/how-john-oliver-gets-social-media-right-while-the-rest-of-traditional-media-fails/|last=Solomon|first=Emily|title=How John Oliver Gets Social Media Right While the Rest of Traditional Media Fails|work=Emertainment Monthly|date=April 12, 2015|accessdate=June 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404222905/http://emertainmentmonthly.com/index.php/how-john-oliver-gets-social-media-right-while-the-rest-of-traditional-media-fails/|archive-date=April 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA recurring element of the show is Oliver's use of mascots. The mascots used in the show include Jeff the Diseased Lung in a Cowboy Hat, Hoots the NSA Owl, Taryn the Tinder Chicken, and the Last Week Tonight puppets.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.ranker.com/list/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-mascots/ranker-tv | title=All the Mascot Costumes from Last Week Tonight, Ranked}}</ref> Oliver told Vulture in February 2019, \"I mean, the truth of the mascots is that we have a gigantic room filled with spectacular mascot costumes now.

Some of the episodes will follow up the main segment with another video compilation or news story. Oliver's speech is broken up with video compilations of recent news clips, or recurring segments, into which Oliver segues with the slogan, \"And now, this.\" Oliver has also ended some segments with mock trailers for fictional TV shows or commercials that satirize the subject of his speech.\n\n=== Celebrity guests===\nThe show frequently features one or more celebrity guests in its segments to help Oliver better get his point on the week's topic across. Guests have featured in many different capacities including giving monologues directly to camera, being interviewed by Oliver, playing musical numbers, participating in comedic skits with or without Oliver, or starring in fictitious parody [[Public service announcement|PSAs]]. On the show, guests are sometimes seen in the Last Week Tonight studio itself doing their part during the show's main taping, while at other times they are seen in video clips that were pre-recorded at a different location and later included in the show. Oliver often interviews personalities who were directly involved in or impacted by the issues being discussed in the show to get their first-hand experiences and viewpoints on the issue. Some of the famous personalities Oliver has interviewed include [[Edward Snowden]], the [[14th Dalai Lama|14th]] [[Dalai Lama]], [[Anita Hill|Professor Anita Hill]] and [[Monica Lewinsky]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver episodes}}\n{{:List of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver episodes}}\n\n==YouTube channel==\n''Last Week Tonight'' has a [[YouTube]] channel where videos are intermittently (depending on series) added after a show has aired.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight |title=Last Week Tonight channel |access-date=March 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313183030/https://www.youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight |archive-date=March 13, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Most of the videos are of the main segment from each episode.

During the eighteen-minute segment, Oliver discusses tobacco industry trends and practices. He also introduces Jeff the Diseased Lung, a mascot he created for the American global cigarette and tobacco company [[Philip Morris International]], the makers of [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] brand of cigarettes. The anthropomorphic diseased lung, who smokes and coughs, has been compared to Joe Camel and the [[Marlboro Man]]. Oliver and his team promoted the cartoon character by sending shirts with Jeff's image to [[Togo]] and displaying billboards in [[Uruguay]], and by encouraging use of the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which trended on Twitter following the broadcast.\n\nThe segment received widespread media coverage, with several outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and change perceptions about smoking through the creation of the mascot. The mascot later made an appearance at a protest organized by the \"Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids\" in New York City in May 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicaldaily.com/john-olivers-jeff-diseased-lung-hits-times-square-anti-smoking-awareness-flash-mob-332252|last=Olson|first=Samantha|title=John Oliver's 'Jeff The Diseased Lung' Hits Times Square For Anti-Smoking Awareness Flash Mob|date=May 6, 2015|work=Medical Daily|access-date=September 3, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915181858/http://www.medicaldaily.com/john-olivers-jeff-diseased-lung-hits-times-square-anti-smoking-awareness-flash-mob-332252|archive-date=September 15, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickbuttsday.org/index.php/updates/detail/2015_05_22_nyc|title=Youth advocates head to New York City to #StopMarlboro - Kick Butts Day|last=Olmstead|first=Erica|website=Kick Butts Day|date=May 22, 2015|access-date=September 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619163701/https://www.kickbuttsday.org/index.php/updates/detail/2015_05_22_nyc|archive-date=June 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPhilip Morris International issued a response to the segment, stating that it included \"many mischaracterizations\" of the company.<ref name=Parker>{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Ryan|title=John Oliver targets cigarettes on 'Last Week Tonight'; Philip Morris reacts|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-philip-morris-john-oliver-20150216-story.html|accessdate=November 24, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122195954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-philip-morris-john-oliver-20150216-story.html|archive-date=November 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies ===\nIn the Mandatory Minimums segment that aired on July 25, 2015, John Oliver talked about the controversial history of presidential pardoning, claiming that Abraham Lincoln once pardoned a man convicted of bestiality because he was intoxicated at the time; the man in question being John Wilkes Booth. He then confessed the statement was not true and for the first time mentioned a book compiling his favorite history lies.\n\nA couple of weeks later, he published a web-exclusive video  based on that reference, expanding the content for a book called \"Stranger Than Truth: John Oliver's 101 Favorite History Lies\", to be released in the following spring. At the end of the mini-segment, however, he confesses again that the entire book was also a lie.\n\nIn what seems a continuation of the lie saga, the book surprisingly appeared on Amazon UK in October 2018.\n\nThe book description reads as follow: <blockquote>There is absolutely nothing more fun than lying confidently about history. Lying is incredibly fun. In fact, the only thing that feels better than lying to someone is lying to someone, then regaining their trust, and then lying to them again. This book, for example, was promised to be released in April 2016. But that was a lie. The plan was always October 2018. Because, you know, now is a time in history when lying openly gets you elected to office. </blockquote><blockquote>In this book, you will find plenty of plausible but completely unverifiable nonsense. Almost like watching Fox News but with a better sense of humour. Hopefully, it will teach you much about nothing other than the true joy of lying to people. Honestly, there has never been a better moment in history to be a liar. We have reached a point where truths have become lies and lies are now the truth. So learn from the greatest and get inspired by the best lies in history. </blockquote><blockquote>*NB: Most profits from this book are going to finance railway infrastructure under the English Channel.

He did this partly as a way to demonstrate how \"disturbingly easy\" it is, in terms of paperwork, to set up a [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] religious organization as viewed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

The jockstrap reappeared in a skit in the final episode of the 2018 season of the show.\n\n===Robocalls===\nThe March 10, 2019, episode dealt primarily with [[robocalls]], and how the problem had mushroomed in recent years since being increasingly deregulated under [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC Chairman]] [[Ajit Pai]]. To prove the point of how easy it was for any company to begin flooding anyone with robocalls, Oliver had one of his IT techs develop a system in which all of the FCC chairs would, at regular intervals on their personal phone numbers, receive a robocall followed immediately by [[bagpipe]] music. Oliver freely admitted his astonishment at just how easy this was to accomplish; the IT technician tasked with setting the system up told him they needed only 15 minutes to complete the project, doing so on a minimal budget. And per the very FCC regulations currently in place, Oliver quickly scrolled a section of fine print on screen at a random time during the segment, in which his office address was randomly embedded, and each FCC chair was required to send him an official letter to that address, notifying him in writing that they wished to have him cease all robocalls forthwith. Oliver was also flabbergasted at discovering that while tens of millions of dollars in fines were levied against companies for violating robocall regulations, only a few thousand dollars have ever been collected, effectively giving the companies free rein to continue robocalling unabated.\n\n===''Guinness World Records''===\nThe main story of the August 11, 2019 episode was [[Turkmenistan]] and its autocratic leader [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]]. The last portion of the segment centered around Berdimuhamedow's obsession with ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', with the Turkmen capital of [[Ashgabat]] being home to the most buildings with white marble cladding, the largest indoor [[Ferris wheel]], and the largest statue of a horse's head, among others. Oliver found that ''Guinness World Records'' received sums of money ranging from US$12,000 to US$500,000 from companies and authoritarian nations to set records for publicity. He ended the show with a 600 square foot [[marble cake]] adorned with a picture of Berdimuhamedow falling from a horse; he had requested a Guinness adjudicator to certify it as the world's largest marble cake, a record previously set by [[Betty Crocker]] in Saudi Arabia in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/09/a-gift-fresh-from-the-heart-in-saudi-arabia/|title=A gift 'fresh from the heart' in Saudi Arabia|website=General Mills|language=en|date=September 27, 2017|access-date=August 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815165112/https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/09/a-gift-fresh-from-the-heart-in-saudi-arabia/|archive-date=August 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Guinness refused, stating that because their brand was \"aligned with kids and families\", they would not send an adjudicator; Oliver mockingly commented that he didn't \"run a brutal enough dictatorship to meet Guinness World Records' high ethical standards\". Oliver claimed that Guinness offered to certify it after the fact only if he signed an agreement not to criticize their practices on the show, which Oliver dismissed as \"ridiculous\".<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9QYu8LtH2E |title=Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver |date=August 11, 2019 |author=HBO |access-date=August 15, 2019 |via=YouTube |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815170404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9QYu8LtH2E&gl=US&hl=en |archive-date=August 15, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/|title=John Oliver Bakes Very Large Cake to Annoy Turkmenistan|website=Time|language=en|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814150445/https://time.com/5648682/john-oliver-turkmenistan-cake/|archive-date=August 14, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Guinness called Oliver's allegations \"false and unfair\", claiming that they did not send an adjudicator because they felt the cake was specifically for the purpose of mocking a record holder, stating it was their policy \"not to partake in any activities which may belittle their achievements or subject them to ridicule\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/8/guinness-world-records-on-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-586398/|title=Guinness World Records on Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|date=August 12, 2019|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190813023105/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/8/guinness-world-records-on-last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver-586398/|archive-date=August 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Narendra Modi===\n\nJohn Oliver extensively satirized Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] in a broadcast which went online on February 23, 2020 calling him a temporary symbol of hate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVIXUhZ2AWs |title=Last Week Tonight With John Oliver |publisher=Last Week Tonight |accessdate=March 8, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> This was during a visit of US President [[Donald Trump]] to India, and in an [[Namaste Trump|organized rally]] which unexpectedly coincided with [[North East Delhi riots|large-scale violence in Delhi]], the country's capital.

{"title_page": "Dialer", "text_new": "A '''dialer''' ([[American English]]) or '''dialler''' ([[British English]]) is an electronic device that is connected to a [[telephone]] line to monitor the dialed numbers and alter them to seamlessly provide services that otherwise require lengthy [[trunk prefix|National]] or [[International access code|International]] access codes to be dialed. A dialer automatically inserts and modifies the numbers depending on the time of day, country or area code dialed, allowing the user to subscribe to the service providers who offer the best rates.  For example, a dialer could be programmed to use one service provider for international calls and another for cellular calls.  This process is known as prefix insertion or [[least cost routing]].  A line powered dialer does not need any external power but instead takes the power it needs from the telephone line.\n\nAnother type of dialer is a [[computer program]] which creates a connection to the [[Internet]] or another [[computer network]] over the analog [[telephone]] or [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN). Many [[operating system]]s already contain such a program for connections through the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP), such as [[WvDial]].\n\nMany [[internet service provider]]s offer installation CDs to simplify the process of setting up a proper [[Internet connection]]. They either create an entry in the OS's dialer or install a separate dialer (as the [[AOL]] software does).\n\nIn recent years, the term \"dialer\" often refers specifically to dialers that connect without the user's full knowledge as to cost, with the creator of the dialer intending to commit [[fraud]].\n\n== Dialing modes==\nIn Call Centers there are several dialling modes depending on how the call is placed. 'Manual Dialing' refers to calls that are placed manually by an agent.\n\nThere are 4 different dialing modes depending on how software dialers selects the contacts that are going to be called and starts making the calls. Automated dialers such as those sold by [[Noble Systems Corporation|Noble Systems]], [[Avaya]], and Convoso (formerly SafeSoft Solutions) can place calls using *preview*, *power*, [[auto dialing]], or [[predictive dialing]]. The dialing modes are defined according to the campaign and type of business.\n\n===Preview===\nPreview dialing enables agents to first view the available information about the customer and decide when to place the call. In addition to the information about the customer, agents may also view all the history of the customer with the contact center. After viewing the information about the customer, the agent requests the system to make the call.\n\nFor example, preview dialing is useful in debt collection campaigns to allow agents to view information about the customer and define a strategy before starting to talk to the customer.\nThe system delivers preview calls to agents automatically, taking into account the priority of the call and the skills of the agent to handle the call. Preview dialing keeps agents from dialing calls manually.\n\n===Predictive===\n[[Predictive dialing]] is a state-of-the-art pacing mode used to call a large number of customers within a short period of time.  Predictive dialing optimizes the time of agents by reducing the idle times between connected calls and freeing agents from dialing calls. Predictive dialing gathers statistics concerning the duration of calls, how long it takes for calls to be answered, and how often are calls answered. When an agent is about to become idle, the system places several calls.\n\nPredictive dialing campaigns can achieve agent productivity of 50 minutes per hour and nuisance ratios of 3% or less. The system is continually updating predictive dialing probabilities and monitoring nuisance ratios for performance and compliance with legislation.\nFor example, predictive dialing is useful in sales campaigns to call a large number of contacts and maximizing the working time of agents.\n\nThe performance of predictive dialing takes into consideration the accuracy of the contact lists and the policies on nuisance calls. If the contact list is poor, the performance of the predictive dialing campaign is at risk as agents are not connected to live contacts and are not able to do business.\n\n===Power IVR===\nPower IVR is used to deliver a pre-recorded message to a large call list. When a call is answered, Power IVR will play the audio file, and then collect touch tone key responses or speech command at the end of the message, and then transfer the call to an agent or remove the caller from the call list. In other words, IVR is a technology that allows a computer to interact with humans through the use of voice and [[Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|DTMF]] tones input via keypad.\n\n===Voice Drop===\nVoice drop is same as Power IVR, except it will not wait for the touch tone key responses or speech command at the end of the message, after playing the message, call is dropped, mostly this is used for payment reminders and similar.\n\n== Fraudulent dialer ==\nDialers are necessary to connect to the internet (at least for non-[[Broadband Internet access|broadband connections]]), but some dialers are designed to connect to premium-rate numbers. The providers of such dialers often search for [[Software security vulnerability|security holes]] in the [[operating system]] installed on the user's computer and use them to set the computer up to dial up through their number, so as to make money from the calls. Alternatively, some dialers inform the user what it is that they are doing, with the promise of special content, accessible only via the special number. Examples of this content include software for download, (usually [[Piracy|illegal]]) [[trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] posing as [[MP3]]s, trojans posing as [[pornography]], or '[[Black hat hacking|underground]]' programs such as [[Software crack|cracks]] and [[keygen]]s.\n\nThe cost of setting up such a service is relatively low, amounting to a few thousand dollars for telecommunications equipment, whereupon the unscrupulous operator will typically take 90% of the cost of a premium rate call, with very few overheads of their own.\n\nUsers with [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]]s (or similar [[Broadband Internet access|broadband connection]]s) are usually not affected. A dialer can be downloaded and installed, but dialing in is not possible as there are no regular phone numbers in the DSL network and users will not typically have their dial-up modem, if any, connected to a phone line. However, if an [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] adapter or additional analog [[modem]] is installed, the dialer might still be able to get a connection.\n\nMalicious dialers can be identified by the following characteristics: {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n*A [[download]] [[Pop-up ad|popup]] opens when opening a website.\n*On the website there is only a small hint, if any, about the price.\n*The download starts even if the cancel button has been clicked.\n*The dialer installs as default connection without any notice.\n*The dialer creates unwanted connections by itself and without user interaction.\n*The dialer does not show any notice about the price (only few do) before dialing in.\n*The high price of the connection is not being shown while connected\n*The dialer cannot be uninstalled, or only with serious effort.\n\n=== Installation routes ===\n\nComputers running Microsoft Windows without anti-virus software or proper updates could be vulnerable to [[Visual Basic]]-[[Script (computer programming)|script]]s which install a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] which changes values in the [[Windows Registry]] and sets [[Internet Explorer]] security settings in a way that [[ActiveX]] controls can be downloaded from the Internet without warning. After this change is made, when a user accesses a malicious page or email message, it can start installing the dialer. The script also disables the [[modem]] [[Loudspeaker|speaker]] and messages that normally come up while dialing into a [[Computer network|network]]. Users of [[Microsoft Office Outlook]], [[Outlook Express]] and [[Internet Explorer]] are especially affected if running [[ActiveX]] controls and [[JavaScript]] is allowed and the latest security patches from [[Microsoft]] have not been installed.\nIn March 2004, there were malicious dialers that could be installed through fake [[anti-virus software]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. [[E-mail spam]] from a so-called \"AntiVirus Team\" for example, contained download links to programs named \"downloadtool.exe\" or \"antivirus.exe\", which are malicious dialers. Other ways of transmission include electronic greeting cards that link to pages that tricks the user to install [[ActiveX]] controls, which in turn install dialers in the background.\n\nTherefore, links in [[Spam (e-mail)|spam emails]] should never be opened, automatically started [[downloads]] should be canceled as soon as discovered, and one should check on each dial-up to the Internet to see whether the displayed phone number is unchanged. Another way to protect oneself is to disable premium numbers through one's [[Telephone company|phone]] services, but of course this disables all such services.\n\nOne should never run foreign code in a privileged environment unless the source is trustworthy. It is also advisable to protect oneself with anti-malware programs.\n\n== German regulatory law ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\nOn 15 August 2003, a new law came into effect in [[Germany]] called \"Gesetz zur Bek\u00e4mpfung des Missbrauchs von (0)190er/(0)900er Mehrwertdiensterufnummern\" (\"Law for the combat of misuse of (0)190/(0)900 value added service numbers\").\n\nThe law contains the following regulations:\n*Forced price notices for service providers.\n*Maximum price limits, legitimacy checks and automatic disconnects.\n*Registration of dialers.\n*Blocking of dialers.\n*Right of information for consumers from the [[:de:RegTP|RegTP]].\n\nOn 4 March 2004 the [[Germany|German]] [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Supreme Court]] in [[Karlsruhe]] decided that fees for the usage of dialers do not have to be paid if it was used without the user's knowledge.\n\n== United Kingdom regulatory law ==\nIn December 2016, Ofcom (The Office of Communications) announced changes to their call centre regulations. These focused on the persistent use of dialers to make call to residential telephone numbers.

A dialer automatically inserts and modifies the numbers depending on the time of day, country or area code dialed, allowing the user to subscribe to the service providers who offer the best rates.  For example, a dialer could be programmed to use one service provider for international calls and another for cellular calls.  This process is known as prefix insertion or [[least cost routing]].  A line powered dialer does not need any external power but instead takes the power it needs from the telephone line.\n\nAnother type of dialer is a [[computer program]] which creates a connection to the [[Internet]] or another [[computer network]] over the analog [[telephone]] or [[Integrated Services Digital Network]] (ISDN). Many [[operating system]]s already contain such a program for connections through the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP), such as [[WvDial]].\n\nMany [[internet service provider]]s offer installation CDs to simplify the process of setting up a proper [[Internet connection]]. They either create an entry in the OS's dialer or install a separate dialer (as the [[AOL]] software does).\n\nIn recent years, the term \"dialer\" often refers specifically to dialers that connect without the user's full knowledge as to cost, with the creator of the dialer intending to commit [[fraud]].\n\n== Dialing modes==\nIn Call Centers there are several dialling modes depending on how the call is placed. 'Manual Dialing' refers to calls that are placed manually by an agent.\n\nThere are 4 different dialing modes depending on how software dialers selects the contacts that are going to be called and starts making the calls. Automated dialers such as those sold by [[Noble Systems Corporation|Noble Systems]], [[Avaya]], and Convoso (formerly SafeSoft Solutions) can place calls using *preview*, *power*, [[auto dialing]], or [[predictive dialing]].
