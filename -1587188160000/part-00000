FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel. Emil Junker was the club chairman and it was his second consecutive season as president.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Fernand Jaccard]] who had taken over as first team coach during the previous season stayed on as player-manager this season. Basel played a total of 33 matches in their 1937\u201338 season. 22 of these matches were in the [[Swiss Super League|Nationalliga]], three in the [[Swiss Cup]] and eight were friendly matches. Of these eight friendlies six were played at home in the [[Landhof]], one in [[Espenmoos]] as guests to [[FC St. Gallen]] and one as guests to [[Le Havre AC]] in the north of France. Four of the friendlies were won, one was drawn and three ended with a defeat.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz Saison 1937/38\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1937/38 | title = Bilanz Saison 1937/38 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe number of teams in the [[1937\u201338 Nationalliga]] was reduced by one team in comparison to the previous season. Thus 12 teams contested the championship this year, which was played as a round-robin, one team to be relegated and only one promoted from the two 1. Liga groups. Basel played an even and consistent season. 22 league games in total, 12 of them ended with a victory, three ended in a draw and the team suffered seven defeats. With 27 points Basel ended the season in fourth position, three points less than [[FC Lugano|Lugano]] who became Swiss champions. \n\nThe young forward [[Numa Monnard]], who had transferred in at the beginning of the season from [[Cantonal Neuchatel]], was the teams top goal scorer. With 20 goals he was the Nationalliga top scorer as well. He played 21 league games and in each of his first eight games he scored at least one goal. In the league match against [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne-Sport]] on 12 September 1937 he scored  a hat-trick as Basel won by four goals to nil.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-fcb-ls 1937/38\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=28089 | title = FC Basel - FC Lausanne-Sport 4:0 (4:0) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> In total, including cup and friendlies, Monnard played 29 games for Basel, in which he netted 34 times.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Numa Monnard - Saison 1937/38\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/spieler?command=spiele&id=8955&saison=1937/38 | title = Numa Monnard - Saison 1937/38 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1st principal round of the [[Swiss Cup]], as Basel played against lower tier FC Breite, Monard scored five times.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-breite-fcb cup 1937/38\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=28109 | title = FC Breite - FC Basel 2:10 (1:3) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> In the next cup round Monard scored a hat-trick against [[AC Bellinzona|Bellinzona]].

FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel. Emil Junker was the club chairman and it was his second consecutive season as president.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Fernand Jaccard]] who had taken over as first team coach during the previous season stayed on as player-manager this season. Basel played a total of 33 matches in their 1937\u201338 season. 22 of these matches were in the [[Swiss Super League|Nationalliga]], three in the [[Swiss Cup]] and eight were friendly matches. Of these eight friendlies six were played at home in the [[Landhof]], one in [[Espenmoos]] as guests to [[FC St. Gallen]] and one as guests to [[Le Havre AC]] in the north of France. Four of the friendlies were won, one was drawn and three ended with a defeat.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz Saison 1937/38\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1937/38 | title = Bilanz Saison 1937/38 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe number of teams in the [[1937\u201338 Nationalliga]] was reduced by one team in comparison to the previous season. Thus 12 teams contested the championship this year, which was played as a round-robin, one team to be relegated and only one promoted from the two 1. Liga groups. Basel played an even and consistent season. 22 league games in total, 12 of them ended with a victory, three ended in a draw and the team suffered seven defeats.

Baring-Gould]]'s timeline of the Sherlock Holmes canon, the events of \"Milverton\" occurred in 1899.<ref name=\"redmond\">{{cite web|last=Redmond|first=Chris|year=2000|title=Sherlockian.Net: William S. Baring-Gould|url= http://www.sherlockian.net/societies/baringgould.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217123004/http://www.sherlockian.net/societies/baringgould.html|archivedate=17 February 2005|accessdate=13 December 2019}}</ref> This was nine years after the strange death of [[Charles Augustus Howell]], the real-life inspiration for the character of Milverton (see below).\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton by Sidney Paget 2.jpg|thumb|(l. to r.) Watson, Holmes and Charles Augustus Milverton.]]\nHolmes is hired by the [[d\u00e9butante]] Lady Eva Blackwell to retrieve compromising letters from a [[blackmail]]er: Milverton, who causes Holmes more revulsion than any of the 50-odd murderers in his career. Milverton is \"the king of blackmailers\". He demands \u00a37,000 (over \u00a3800,000 in 2015) for the letters, which if given to third parties would cause a scandal that would end Lady Eva's marriage engagement. Holmes offers \u00a32,000, all Lady Eva can pay, but Milverton insists on \u00a37,000. It is worth \u00a37,000 to him, he explains, to make an example of Lady Eva; it is in his long-term interest to ensure that his future blackmail victims would be more \"open to reason\" and pay him what he wants, knowing he will destroy them if they do not. Holmes resolves to recover the letters by whatever means necessary, as Milverton has placed himself outside the bounds of morality.\n\nHolmes visits Milverton's [[Hampstead]] house, disguised as a [[plumber]], in order to learn the plan of the house and Milverton's daily routine. He cultivates the acquaintance of Milverton's housemaid and even becomes engaged to marry her. This rather shocks Watson, but Holmes assures him that he has a hated rival who will step in when the plumber disappears. Holmes has learned where Milverton keeps his blackmail papers (a safe in his study), and plans to [[burglary|burgle]] Milverton's house that night. Watson comes along.\n\nThey break into the study, but just as Holmes opens the safe, Milverton enters the study, even though he should be in bed asleep. Holmes and Watson hide behind a curtain, while Milverton has a midnight meeting with a supposed maidservant offering to sell letters that would compromise her mistress.\n\n[[File:The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton by Sidney Paget 5.jpg|thumb|Milverton's death]]\nThe woman is actually one of Milverton's former victims, whose broken-hearted husband died when she wouldn't pay Milverton and he revealed her secret. Now she avenges her husband by shooting Milverton to death, then stamps on his face.\n\nWatson instinctively begins to rush out and stop the shooting, but Holmes restrains him. Holmes understands, and Watson instantly realises, \"that it was no affair of ours; that justice had overtaken a villain...\" The woman runs away, and Milverton's household is roused by the shots. During his final confrontation, Milverton's entire cache of blackmail papers had been in a safe with its door slightly ajar.  Holmes now feeds this mass of compromising material into Milverton's burning fireplace, despite the risk of being discovered and caught.\n\nThen Holmes and Watson escape through the garden and over the wall. Watson has to kick himself free from a pursuer who has grabbed his leg.\n\nThe next morning, [[Inspector Lestrade]] calls at Baker Street to ask for Holmes' help in investigating Milverton's murder, which he ascribes to the two burglars seen escaping over the garden wall. He has a description of one of them: \"a middle-aged, strongly built man-square jaw, thick neck, moustache...\" Holmes calls that vague. \"Why, it might be a description of Watson!\" he says, which amuses Lestrade. But Holmes refuses Lestrade's request: \"my sympathies are with the criminals, and I will not handle the case.\"\n\nLater, Holmes recognises the face of the woman who killed Milverton. He shows Watson her photograph displayed in a shop-window among those of other celebrities. Watson recognises the name of her famous husband, but Holmes signals silence with a finger to his lips. Watson assures his readers that the killer in question is beyond the reach of the law [i.e deceased] and that certain details have been disguised to hurt no one.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe story, along with \"[[The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax]]\", \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]\", and \"[[The Red-Headed League]]\", provided the source material for the play ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (play)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kabatchnik|first=Amnon|title=Sherlock Holmes on the Stage|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2008|page=54|ISBN=9781461707226}}</ref>\n\nThe story was faithfully adapted in the 1965 BBC series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1965 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' with [[Douglas Wilmer]] as Holmes, and [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] as Milverton.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barnes|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Barnes (writer) |title=Sherlock Holmes on Screen |year=2011 |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |page=187 |ISBN=9780857687760}}</ref> The only difference from the story is the identity of Milverton's killer.\n\n\"Charles Augustus Milverton\" was dramatised for [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1993 by [[Bert Coules]] as part of his complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring [[Clive Merrison]] as Holmes and [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as Watson, and featuring [[Peter Vaughan]] as Milverton.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://merrisonholmes.com/return.php\n|title=The Return of Sherlock Holmes\n|accessdate=12 December 2016\n|website=The BBC complete audio Sherlock Holmes \n|author=Bert Coules}}</ref>      \n\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] TV series ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson]]'' featured the case under the name \"The King of Blackmail\". It was the first of the three episodes concerning [[Professor Moriarty]].<ref name=\"barnes2\">{{cite book |last=Barnes|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Barnes (writer) |title=Sherlock Holmes on Screen |year=2011 |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |pages=139-141 |ISBN=9780857687760}}</ref> Apparently, Milverton (played by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753523/ Boris Ryzhukhin]) was a member of the gang, since certain papers were recovered from his office which helped implicate the Professor.<ref name=\"barnes2\"/> The husband of the lady who kills Milverton is stated to be named Lord Christopher Huxley, aged 42, with Holmes reading an article about his death at the beginning of the episode. Holmes approaches the lady (played by [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0659523/ Valentina Panina]) later to obtain the aforementioned papers which she took with her.

Watson, Holmes and Charles Augustus Milverton.]]\nHolmes is hired by the [[d\u00e9butante]] Lady Eva Blackwell to retrieve compromising letters from a [[blackmail]]er: Milverton, who causes Holmes more revulsion than any of the 50-odd murderers in his career. Milverton is \"the king of blackmailers\". He demands \u00a37,000 (over \u00a3800,000 in 2015) for the letters, which if given to third parties would cause a scandal that would end Lady Eva's marriage engagement. Holmes offers \u00a32,000, all Lady Eva can pay, but Milverton insists on \u00a37,000. It is worth \u00a37,000 to him, he explains, to make an example of Lady Eva; it is in his long-term interest to ensure that his future blackmail victims would be more \"open to reason\" and pay him what he wants, knowing he will destroy them if they do not. Holmes resolves to recover the letters by whatever means necessary, as Milverton has placed himself outside the bounds of morality.\n\nHolmes visits Milverton's [[Hampstead]] house, disguised as a [[plumber]], in order to learn the plan of the house and Milverton's daily routine. He cultivates the acquaintance of Milverton's housemaid and even becomes engaged to marry her. This rather shocks Watson, but Holmes assures him that he has a hated rival who will step in when the plumber disappears. Holmes has learned where Milverton keeps his blackmail papers (a safe in his study), and plans to [[burglary|burgle]] Milverton's house that night. Watson comes along.\n\nThey break into the study, but just as Holmes opens the safe, Milverton enters the study, even though he should be in bed asleep. Holmes and Watson hide behind a curtain, while Milverton has a midnight meeting with a supposed maidservant offering to sell letters that would compromise her mistress.\n\n[[File:The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton by Sidney Paget 5.jpg|thumb|Milverton's death]]\nThe woman is actually one of Milverton's former victims, whose broken-hearted husband died when she wouldn't pay Milverton and he revealed her secret. Now she avenges her husband by shooting Milverton to death, then stamps on his face.\n\nWatson instinctively begins to rush out and stop the shooting, but Holmes restrains him. Holmes understands, and Watson instantly realises, \"that it was no affair of ours; that justice had overtaken a villain...\" The woman runs away, and Milverton's household is roused by the shots. During his final confrontation, Milverton's entire cache of blackmail papers had been in a safe with its door slightly ajar.  Holmes now feeds this mass of compromising material into Milverton's burning fireplace, despite the risk of being discovered and caught.\n\nThen Holmes and Watson escape through the garden and over the wall. Watson has to kick himself free from a pursuer who has grabbed his leg.\n\nThe next morning, [[Inspector Lestrade]] calls at Baker Street to ask for Holmes' help in investigating Milverton's murder, which he ascribes to the two burglars seen escaping over the garden wall. He has a description of one of them: \"a middle-aged, strongly built man-square jaw, thick neck, moustache...\" Holmes calls that vague. \"Why, it might be a description of Watson!\" he says, which amuses Lestrade. But Holmes refuses Lestrade's request: \"my sympathies are with the criminals, and I will not handle the case.\"\n\nLater, Holmes recognises the face of the woman who killed Milverton. He shows Watson her photograph displayed in a shop-window among those of other celebrities. Watson recognises the name of her famous husband, but Holmes signals silence with a finger to his lips. Watson assures his readers that the killer in question is beyond the reach of the law [i.e deceased] and that certain details have been disguised to hurt no one.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe story, along with \"[[The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax]]\", \"[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]\", and \"[[The Red-Headed League]]\", provided the source material for the play ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (play)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kabatchnik|first=Amnon|title=Sherlock Holmes on the Stage|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2008|page=54|ISBN=9781461707226}}</ref>\n\nThe story was faithfully adapted in the 1965 BBC series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1965 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' with [[Douglas Wilmer]] as Holmes, and [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]] as Milverton.<ref>{{cite book |last=Barnes|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Barnes (writer) |title=Sherlock Holmes on Screen |year=2011 |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |page=187 |ISBN=9780857687760}}</ref> The only difference from the story is the identity of Milverton's killer.\n\n\"Charles Augustus Milverton\" was dramatised for [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1993 by [[Bert Coules]] as part of his complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring [[Clive Merrison]] as Holmes and [[Michael Williams (actor)|Michael Williams]] as Watson, and featuring [[Peter Vaughan]] as Milverton.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://merrisonholmes.com/return.php\n|title=The Return of Sherlock Holmes\n|accessdate=12 December 2016\n|website=The BBC complete audio Sherlock Holmes \n|author=Bert Coules}}</ref>      \n\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] TV series ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson]]'' featured the case under the name \"The King of Blackmail\".

See note in 'Early life' for more information.--> actress, businesswoman, and humanitarian. She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s, and was one of the most popular stars of [[classical Hollywood cinema]] in the 1950s. She continued her career successfully into the 1960s, and remained a well-known public figure for the rest of her life. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named her the seventh-[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female screen legend]].\n\nBorn in London to socially prominent American parents, Taylor moved with her family to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939. She made her acting debut in a minor role in the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[There's One Born Every Minute]]'' (1942) but the studio ended her contract after a year. She was then signed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and became a popular teen star after appearing in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944). She transitioned to more mature roles in the 1950s, when she starred in the comedy ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the drama ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951).\n\nDespite being one of MGM's most bankable stars, Taylor wished to end her career in the early 1950s. She resented the studio's control and disliked many of the films to which she was assigned. She began receiving roles she enjoyed more in the mid-1950s, beginning with the epic drama ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), and starred in several critically and commercially successful films in the following years. These included two film adaptations of plays by [[Tennessee Williams]]: ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959); Taylor won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] for Best Actress for the latter. Although she disliked her role as a [[call girl]] in ''[[BUtterfield 8]]''<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE - UPPER CASE \"BU\" IS CORRECT --> (1960), her last film for MGM, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.\n\nDuring the filming, Taylor and co-star [[Richard Burton]] began an extramarital affair, which caused a scandal. Despite public disapproval, she and Burton  continued their relationship and were married in 1964. Dubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the media, they starred in 11 films together, including ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' (1963), ''[[The Sandpiper]]'' (1965), ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1967 film)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1967), and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (1966). Taylor received the best reviews of her career for ''Woolf'', winning her second Academy Award and several other awards for her performance. She and Burton divorced in 1974, but reconciled soon after, and remarried in 1975. The second marriage ended in divorce in 1976.\n\nTaylor's acting career began to decline in the late 1960s, although she continued starring in films until the mid-1970s, after which she focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, United States Senator [[John Warner]] (R-Virginia). In the 1980s, she acted in her first substantial stage roles and in several television films and series. She also became the first celebrity to launch a perfume brand. Taylor was one of the first celebrities to take part in [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] activism. She co-founded the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] in 1985, and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in 1991. From the early 1990s until her death, she dedicated her time to philanthropy, for which she received several accolades, including the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]].\n\nThroughout her career, Taylor's personal life was the subject of constant media attention.

She began her career as a child actress in the early 1940s, and was one of the most popular stars of [[classical Hollywood cinema]] in the 1950s. She continued her career successfully into the 1960s, and remained a well-known public figure for the rest of her life. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] named her the seventh-[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female screen legend]].\n\nBorn in London to socially prominent American parents, Taylor moved with her family to [[Los Angeles]] in 1939. She made her acting debut in a minor role in the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[There's One Born Every Minute]]'' (1942) but the studio ended her contract after a year. She was then signed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], and became a popular teen star after appearing in ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'' (1944). She transitioned to more mature roles in the 1950s, when she starred in the comedy ''[[Father of the Bride (1950 film)|Father of the Bride]]'' (1950) and received critical acclaim for her performance in the drama ''[[A Place in the Sun (film)|A Place in the Sun]]'' (1951).\n\nDespite being one of MGM's most bankable stars, Taylor wished to end her career in the early 1950s. She resented the studio's control and disliked many of the films to which she was assigned. She began receiving roles she enjoyed more in the mid-1950s, beginning with the epic drama ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), and starred in several critically and commercially successful films in the following years. These included two film adaptations of plays by [[Tennessee Williams]]: ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958 film)|Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'' (1958), and ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959); Taylor won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] for Best Actress for the latter. Although she disliked her role as a [[call girl]] in ''[[BUtterfield 8]]''<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE - UPPER CASE \"BU\" IS CORRECT --> (1960), her last film for MGM, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her performance.\n\nDuring the filming, Taylor and co-star [[Richard Burton]] began an extramarital affair, which caused a scandal. Despite public disapproval, she and Burton  continued their relationship and were married in 1964. Dubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the media, they starred in 11 films together, including ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'' (1963), ''[[The Sandpiper]]'' (1965), ''[[The Taming of the Shrew (1967 film)|The Taming of the Shrew]]'' (1967), and ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (film)|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' (1966). Taylor received the best reviews of her career for ''Woolf'', winning her second Academy Award and several other awards for her performance. She and Burton divorced in 1974, but reconciled soon after, and remarried in 1975. The second marriage ended in divorce in 1976.\n\nTaylor's acting career began to decline in the late 1960s, although she continued starring in films until the mid-1970s, after which she focused on supporting the career of her sixth husband, United States Senator [[John Warner]] (R-Virginia). In the 1980s, she acted in her first substantial stage roles and in several television films and series. She also became the first celebrity to launch a perfume brand. Taylor was one of the first celebrities to take part in [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] activism. She co-founded the [[American Foundation for AIDS Research]] in 1985, and the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation in 1991. From the early 1990s until her death, she dedicated her time to philanthropy, for which she received several accolades, including the [[Presidential Citizens Medal]].\n\nThroughout her career, Taylor's personal life was the subject of constant media attention.
