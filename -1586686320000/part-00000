Although he's claimed as a son by various families, a rich Duchess believes the true family Gaston belongs to is the Renauds. Gaston travels to the Renauds' estate alongside his lawyer, Huspar. A docile character, Gaston discovers his former identity of Jacques Renaud: a cruel and violent young man who used to kill animals for sport. He learns that immediately prior to the war he pushed his best friend, Marcel, down a flight of stairs, breaking his back, shortly after seeing him kiss the maid Juliette, with whom Jacques had been intimate. Gaston has difficulty reconciling his current personality with that of his past. His brother's wife, Valentine (with whom he had an affair during adolescence), tells him about a tiny scar on his shoulder, sustained when Valentine attacked him with a hat pin in a fit of jealousy. Gaston sees this scar in a mirror but doesn't tell Valentine about it. Soon thereafter, numerous families arrive at the Renaud estate, searching for their lost loved one from the war. Gaston spots a young boy. This boy, who is the only surviving member of the Madensales, a family who died in a boating accident when he was an infant, is searching for his long-lost nephew who happens to be much older than himself. Gaston tells the young boy about the scar on his shoulder and fabricates a story about the scar belonging to the boy's long-lost nephew. Gaston leaves the Renauds to become a member of the boy's family, later writing a letter to Jacques' brother Georges, stating that their Jacques is dead and they need not search for him any longer.\n\n==Inspiration and reception==\nInspired by the story of an amnesiac soldier, [[Anthelme Mangin]], who was claimed by over a dozen families,<ref>Jean Yves Le Naour, ''Le Soldat inconnu vivant'', Hachette Litt\u00e9rature, Paris 2002</ref> the play was first presented on 16 February 1937 and was Anouilh's first major hit with critics and audiences alike.

By the age of twelve, however, he had become an apprentice to the competent [[mannerism|mannerist]] painter [[Denis Calvaert]], in whose studio he met [[Guido Reni]]. He soon followed Reni to the so-called \"Academy\" run by [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]], [[Agostino Carracci|Agostino]], and [[Ludovico Carracci|Ludovico]] Carracci. This studio fostered the careers of many painters of the [[Bolognese School (painting)|Bolognese school]], including [[Domenichino]], [[Lucio Massari|Massari]], [[Giovanni Battista Viola|Viola]], [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]], [[Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi]], [[Pietro Faccini]], [[Remigio Cantagallina]], and [[Guido Reni|Reni]].\n\n==Mature work in Rome==\n[[Image:The Baptism of Christ (Albani).jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Baptism of Christ'' c.1640 ([[State Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]\n\nIn 1600, Albani moved to Rome to work on the fresco decoration of the gallery of the [[Palazzo Farnese]], which was being completed by the studio of Annibale Carracci. At this time, Rome, under  [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] ''Aldobrandini'' (1592\u20131605) was exhibiting some degree of administrative stability and renewed artistic patronage. While Pope Clement had been born into a Florentine family resident in [[Urbino]], his family was allied by marriage to the [[Emilia-Romagna]] and the Farnese, since [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma]] had married [[Margherita Aldobrandini]]. Parma, like Bologna, being part of the Region of Emilia-Romagna, it was not surprising that [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Cardinal Odoardo Farnese]], Ranuccio's brother, chose to   patronise the  Carraccis from Bologna, thereby establishing Bolognese dominance of Roman [[fresco]] painting for nearly two decades.\n\nAlbani became one of Annibale's most prominent apprentices. Using Annibale's designs and assisted by Lanfranco and [[Sisto Badalocchio]], Albani completed frescoes for the San Diego Chapel in [[San Giacomo degli Spagnoli]] between 1602 and 1607. In 1606\u20137, Albani completed the frescoes in the [[Palazzo Mattei di Giove]] in Rome. He later completed two other frescoes in the same palace, also on the theme of ''Life of Joseph''.\n\nIn 1609, he completed the ceiling of a large hall with ''Fall of Phaeton and Council of the Gods'' for the [[Palazzo Giustiniani, Rome|Palazzo Giustiniani]] (now Palazzo Odescalchi) at [[Bassano (di Sutri) Romano]]. This work was commissioned by [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], also famous as a  patron of [[Caravaggio]].\n\nDuring 1612\u201314, Albani completed the Choir frescoes at the  church of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] which had just been remodelled by [[Pietro da Cortona]]. In 1616 he painted ceiling frescoes of ''Apollo and the Seasons'' at [[Palazzo Verospi]] in [[Via del Corso]] for the cardinal [[Fabrizio Verospi]].\n\nIn his later years, Albani developed a mutual, though respectful, rivalry with the more successful Guido Reni, who was also heavily patronized by the Aldobrandini, and under whom Albani had worked under at the chapel of the [[Palazzo del Quirinale]].\n\nAlbani's best frescoes are those on mythological subjects. Among the best of his sacred subjects are a ''St Sebastian'' and an ''Assumption of the Virgin'', both in the church of [[San Sebastiano fuori le Mura]] in Rome. He was among the  Italian painters to devote himself to painting cabinet pictures. His mythological subjects include ''The Sleeping Venus'', ''Diana in the Bath'', ''Dana\u00eb Reclining'', ''Galatea on the Sea'', and ''Europa on the Bull''. A rare etching, the ''Death of Dido'', is attributed to him. [[Carlo Cignani]], [[Andrea Sacchi]], [[Francesco Mola]], and [[Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi]] were among his students. Following the death of his wife he returned to Bologna, where he married a second time and lived until his death.\n\n==Legacy==\nAlbani never acquired the monumentality or tenebrism that was quaking the contemporary world of painters, and is often derided for his lyric, cherubim-filled sweetness, which often has not yet shaken the mannerist elegance.

By the age of twelve, however, he had become an apprentice to the competent [[mannerism|mannerist]] painter [[Denis Calvaert]], in whose studio he met [[Guido Reni]]. He soon followed Reni to the so-called \"Academy\" run by [[Annibale Carracci|Annibale]], [[Agostino Carracci|Agostino]], and [[Ludovico Carracci|Ludovico]] Carracci. This studio fostered the careers of many painters of the [[Bolognese School (painting)|Bolognese school]], including [[Domenichino]], [[Lucio Massari|Massari]], [[Giovanni Battista Viola|Viola]], [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]], [[Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi]], [[Pietro Faccini]], [[Remigio Cantagallina]], and [[Guido Reni|Reni]].\n\n==Mature work in Rome==\n[[Image:The Baptism of Christ (Albani).jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Baptism of Christ'' c.1640 ([[State Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]]]\n\nIn 1600, Albani moved to Rome to work on the fresco decoration of the gallery of the [[Palazzo Farnese]], which was being completed by the studio of Annibale Carracci. At this time, Rome, under  [[Pope Clement VIII|Clement VIII]] ''Aldobrandini'' (1592\u20131605) was exhibiting some degree of administrative stability and renewed artistic patronage. While Pope Clement had been born into a Florentine family resident in [[Urbino]], his family was allied by marriage to the [[Emilia-Romagna]] and the Farnese, since [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma]] had married [[Margherita Aldobrandini]]. Parma, like Bologna, being part of the Region of Emilia-Romagna, it was not surprising that [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Cardinal Odoardo Farnese]], Ranuccio's brother, chose to   patronise the  Carraccis from Bologna, thereby establishing Bolognese dominance of Roman [[fresco]] painting for nearly two decades.\n\nAlbani became one of Annibale's most prominent apprentices. Using Annibale's designs and assisted by Lanfranco and [[Sisto Badalocchio]], Albani completed frescoes for the San Diego Chapel in [[San Giacomo degli Spagnoli]] between 1602 and 1607. In 1606\u20137, Albani completed the frescoes in the [[Palazzo Mattei di Giove]] in Rome. He later completed two other frescoes in the same palace, also on the theme of ''Life of Joseph''.\n\nIn 1609, he completed the ceiling of a large hall with ''Fall of Phaeton and Council of the Gods'' for the [[Palazzo Giustiniani, Rome|Palazzo Giustiniani]] (now Palazzo Odescalchi) at [[Bassano (di Sutri) Romano]]. This work was commissioned by [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], also famous as a  patron of [[Caravaggio]].\n\nDuring 1612\u201314, Albani completed the Choir frescoes at the  church of [[Santa Maria della Pace]] which had just been remodelled by [[Pietro da Cortona]]. In 1616 he painted ceiling frescoes of ''Apollo and the Seasons'' at [[Palazzo Verospi]] in [[Via del Corso]] for the cardinal [[Fabrizio Verospi]].\n\nIn his later years, Albani developed a mutual, though respectful, rivalry with the more successful Guido Reni, who was also heavily patronized by the Aldobrandini, and under whom Albani had worked under at the chapel of the [[Palazzo del Quirinale]].\n\nAlbani's best frescoes are those on mythological subjects. Among the best of his sacred subjects are a ''St Sebastian'' and an ''Assumption of the Virgin'', both in the church of [[San Sebastiano fuori le Mura]] in Rome. He was among the  Italian painters to devote himself to painting cabinet pictures. His mythological subjects include ''The Sleeping Venus'', ''Diana in the Bath'', ''Dana\u00eb Reclining'', ''Galatea on the Sea'', and ''Europa on the Bull''. A rare etching, the ''Death of Dido'', is attributed to him. [[Carlo Cignani]], [[Andrea Sacchi]], [[Francesco Mola]], and [[Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi]] were among his students. Following the death of his wife he returned to Bologna, where he married a second time and lived until his death.\n\n==Legacy==\nAlbani never acquired the monumentality or tenebrism that was quaking the contemporary world of painters, and is often derided often for his lyric, cherubim-filled sweetness, which often has not yet shaken the mannerist elegance. While Albani's thematic would have appealed to [[Poussin]], he lacked the Frenchman's muscular drama. His style sometimes seems to have more in common with the decorative [[Rococo]] than with the painting of his own time.\n\nAmong his pupils were his brother [[Giovanni Battista Albani]], and others including [[Giacinto Bellini]], [[Girolamo Bonini]], [[Giacinto Campagna]], [[Antonio Catalani (Romano)|Antonio Catalani]], [[Carlo Cignani]], [[Giovanni Maria Galli]], [[Filippo Menzani]], [[Bartolommeo Morelli]],  [[Andrea Sacchi]], [[Andrea Sghizzi]], [[Giovanni Battista Speranza]], [[Antonio Maria del Sole]], [[Emilio Taruffi]], and [[Francesco Vaccaro]].<ref>Hobbes, p.3</ref>\n\n==Major works==\n*Frescoes in Hall of Aeneas -<small>[[Palazzo Fava]], Bologna </small>\n*Frescoes in [[Oratory of San Colombano, Bologna|Oratory of San Colombano]] -<small> Bologna</small>\n*Frescoes in Hall of Aeneas (1601\u20131602) -<small> [[Palazzo Doria Pamphilj]], Rome </small>\n*Frescoes for [[San Giacomo degli Spagnoli]] (1602\u20131607) -<small> Museo del Prado and in Museum of Barcelona</small>\n*''Holy Family with Angels'' (1608\u20131610) -<small> MFA, Boston </small>\n*Allegorical canvases of the seasons [http://www.wga.hu/html/a/albani/1spring.html ''Spring''], [http://www.wga.hu/html/a/albani/2summer.html ''Summer''], [http://www.wga.hu/html/a/albani/3autumn.html ''Fall''] and [http://www.wga.hu/html/a/albani/4winter.html ''Winter''] (1616\u20131617) -<small>  [[Galleria Borghese]], Rome</small>\n*''[[Nativity of the Virgin (Francesco Albani)|Nativity of the Virgin]]'' (1598) -<small>  Pinacoteca, Museo Capitolino, Rome</small>\n*''Baptism of Christ'' (c. 1620) -<small> [[Oil painting|Oil on canvas]], 428.5 x 224.5&nbsp;cm, [[Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna]]</small>\n*''Diana and Actaeon'' (1625\u20131630) -<small> [[Panel painting|Oil on wood]] [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]], 74,5 x 99,5&nbsp;cm, [[Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden]]</small>\n*''Four Elements ''(1628\u20131630) -<small> Pinacoteca, Turin </small>\n*''Holy Family with Angels'' (1630\u20131635) -<small> Oil on canvas, 57 x 43&nbsp;cm, [[Palazzo Pitti, Florence]]</small>\n*''Self-Portrait'' (c. 1630) -<small> Oil on canvas, 75 x 59.5&nbsp;cm, Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna</small>\n*''Venus Attended by Nymphs and Cupids'' (1633) -<small>Oil on canvas, 114 x 171&nbsp;cm, Prado, Madrid)[http://www.wga.hu/html/a/albani/venus.html] </small>\n*''Annunciation'' (1633) -<small> Church of [[San Bartolomeo, Bologna]]</small>\n*''The Annunciation'' -<small> [[Oil on copper]], 62 x 47&nbsp;cm, Hermitage, St. Petersburg</small>[http://www.wga.hu/html/a/albani/annuncia.html]\n*''Madonna with Child in Glory with Sts.

These trams were followed by specially designed vehicles like the [[Stadtbahnwagen B|Stadtbahn B]] series. By the 1980s virtually all cities had abandoned the long-term goal of establishing a full-scale metro system due to the excessive costs associated with converting the tramways. Most ''Stadtbahn'' systems are now a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban and peripheral areas and a more metro-like mode of operation in city centres, with underground stations. This 20th century ''Stadtbahn'' concept eventually spread from Germany to other European countries,<ref name=\"newscientist\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgKLfKjjft8C&lpg=PA699&dq=&pg=PA699#v=onepage&q&f=false | author = Ian Yearsley | title=Trams are coming back | journal=[[New Scientist]] | publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. | quote = <!-- But West Germany, like other nations, experienced phenomenal growth in private car ownership.

The [[Berlin Stadtbahn]] line is an elevated heavy rail line linking the East and the West. Long distance, regional, suburban, and urban services ([[S-Bahn]]) are operated on it.\n\nThe [[Wiener Stadtbahn]] (Vienna) was in the beginning a system of heavy rail lines circling the city, free of level crossings, operated by steam trains. After World War I the ''Wiental'', ''Donaukanal'' and ''G\u00fcrtel'' lines were converted into an electric light rail system with tram-like two-axle cars (which on line 18G until 1945 switched into the tram network at Gumpendorfer Strasse station). In the 1970s to 1990s the infrastructure was updated, and the lines were partially relocated: they are now part of the [[Vienna U-Bahn]] services 'U4' and 'U6'. The ''Vorortelinie'' line remained heavy rail and is now part of the [[Vienna S-Bahn]].\n\n=== 1960s: modern ''Stadtbahn'' ===\nSince the 1960s the term ''Stadtbahn'' has become identified with a second, now dominant, meaning, which is a reference to underground urban rail network that is used by conventional trams but planned at the outset to be eventually converted into a metro system (which may or may not be implemented in the end).\n\nPost-World War II transport policies in West German cities aimed for a separation of public and private transport. The conflicts that arose between increasing car usage and the existing tramway systems led to the so-called 'second level' concept for future light rail schemes.  This concept focused on the grade separation, i.e., elevation and/or tunneling of tram lines.\n\n[[Munich U-Bahn|Munich]] and [[Nuremberg U-Bahn|Nuremberg]] decided to build pure, full-scale [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (metro) systems. [[Berlin U-Bahn|Berlin]] and [[Hamburg U-Bahn|Hamburg]] planned expansions of their existing U-Bahn networks, while most West German cities decided to upgrade their tramway networks step by step, linking new 'second level' infrastructure to existing sections.  While some cities regarded this solution as an interim step that would lead to a fully separated [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (metro) network independent of other forms of transport, others planned for a lesser degree of separation, one that would accommodate additional tram-like sections in the long run. For both the interim and the long-term based concepts, the following terms came into use: \"U-Stra\u00dfenbahn\" or \"Untergrund-Stra\u00dfenbahn\" (underground tramway, abbreviated as \"U-Strab\"), \"Schnellstra\u00dfenbahn\" (rapid tramway) and finally ''Stadtbahn''. (In French-speaking countries, these concepts were also known as \"[[premetro|pre-metro]]\", stressing their interim nature.)\n\nSome operators and cities decided to identify the term ''Stadtbahn'' with the eventual goal of installing an [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] so that both the original U-Bahn logo (e.g. [[Frankfurt U-Bahn]], [[Cologne Stadtbahn]], [[Hanover Stadtbahn]]) and the derived ''U-Stadtbahn'' logos (e.g. [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Stuttgart Stadtbahn]]; see example above) mark station entries and stops. The numbering scheme for ''Stadtbahn'' services was prefixed with a 'U', except in the [[Cologne Stadtbahn]], [[Bielefeld Stadtbahn]], and [[Hanover Stadtbahn]].\n\n=== 1980s: Renaissance of the tramway ===\nBy the 1980s conventional tramways had been seen by decision-makers as overloaded systems for almost two decades.  However, public attention focused on them at this time for two reasons.\n\nThe ''Stadtbahn'' cities' second level plans faced unexpected complications in the form of lengthy construction work, budgetary problems for tunnel projects, and protests against elevated sections. At the same time, the smaller cities which had not started Stadtbahn plans reassessed their options in relation to their existing tram systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nEast German cities had no 1960s-style Stadtbahn plans in place, and the fleets and the infrastructure were in need of massive investment and improvement.  After the reunification of Germany in 1990, the use of the ''Stadtbahn'' term became popular in the former East Germany as well, as in [[Erfurt]] and [[Dresden]].\n\n''Stadtbahn'' in this wider meaning is thus not a clearly defined concept, but a vague one linked to a set of attributes, much in the same way that \"Stra\u00dfenbahn\" (tram) is linked to very different, sometimes mutually incompatible attributes.{{clarify|reason=The main definition of 'Stadtbahn' and 'light rail' is operation in exclusive rights-of-way - that is not vague.|date=October 2013}} A system that is called ''Stadtbahn'' today may not have all of the Stadtbahn attributes:  barrier-free access, higher cruising speed than tramways, doors on both sides of the train, driver's cabs on both ends, higher operating voltage, wider cars with comfortable seats, and so on.\n\n=== 1990s: The tram goes railway ===\nIn 1992 [[Karlsruhe]] started an innovative new service, using both heavy and light rail infrastructure, to link the wider region to the city. The vehicles were designed to comply with technical specifications for the (federal) heavy railway and for light rail (communal tramways). Such vehicles are called Dual-System Light Rail Vehicles. The meaning of Stadtbahn was enlarged to encompass this new type of \"[[tram-train]]\" service. In other regions, stimulated by the Karlsruhe example and planning to copy it, other terms are in use: Stadt-Umland-Bahn (city-to-region railway, e.g. [[Erlangen]], also in discussion to connect the nearer surroundings of [[Munich]], as far as not supplied with S-Bahn services so far, with the existing public transport there), ''Regional-Stadtbahn'' (regional light rail, e.g. [[Braunschweig]]).\n\nStra\u00dfenbahn (tram) and Stadtbahn in the [[Karlsruhe]] region are differentiated more by the nature of their city-border crossings only, and not by the technical dimension (Dual-System Light Rail Vehicles). Only those services that extend into the suburbs are called Stadtbahn. They are represented by the 'S' logo that is used for 'S-Bahn' (Stadtschnellbahn) in the rest of Germany and therefore partially conflict with it, as it has acquired a second meaning in Karlsruhe.\n\n=== 2000s: The Tram logo ===\n[[File:Tram-Logo.svg|thumb|144px|left|The Tram logo]]\nAs part of the redevelopment of their main city [[railway station|station]]s, national railway company [[Deutsche Bahn]] adopted a new logo to indicate ''Stra\u00dfenbahn'' (tram) connections: a square containing the word 'Tram'. Although the design is the same nationwide, the colour varies from city to city to match local public transport operators' systems of colour-coding. The logo is part of the 'S logo scheme' initially developed by [[Berlin]] public transport operator [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe|BVG]], based on the established logos for urban metro ('U', for ''U-Bahn'') and suburban metro ('S', for ''S-Bahn'') and including bus ('Bus') and ferry ('F', for ''F\u00e4hre'') operations.\n\nAs the new logos became part of the information systems at more and more main railway stations, an increasing number of cities and public transport operators came to accept and adopt the scheme. As far as the ''Stadtbahn'' terminology problem is concerned, however, the scheme serves only to add further confusion to the matter, since there is no nationwide logo for ''Stadtbahn'' services. The result appears to be a contraction in the use of the term ''Stadtbahn'', especially in cities where it has been used in its wider 1980s 'light-rail system' meaning.\n\nIn cities where ''Stadtbahn'' has the 1960s '[[premetro|pre-metro]]' meaning, both the 'U' (for U-Bahn) and the 'Tram' logo are used on city maps (to indicate the location of stops) and on railway station signage (to indicate connections). The 'U' Logo is normally used both where stops or stations are underground and where they serve 'second-level' pre-metro type lines. In cities which prefix all their ''Stadtbahn'' line numbers with a 'U' (e.g. [[Stuttgart]]), the 'U' logo is used at stops on services that are essentially 'classic' tram lines, not 'second-level' at all.\n\n== Regionalstadtbahn ==\nThe concept of ''Regionalstadtbahnen'' (also known by ''RegioStadtbahn'' or other names) arose as a result of the harmonisation or integration of railway lines into Stadtbahn networks. In the area of Cologne\u2013Bonn a single operational system (of so-called above ground lines or ''Hochflurstrecken'') was created by the [[Cologne Stadtbahn]] and the [[Bonn Stadtbahn]], opened in 1974, from the conversion of two former railway lines (the [[Rheinuferbahn]] and [[Vorgebirgsbahn]] belonging to the old [[K\u00f6ln-Bonner Eisenbahnen]]). Further developments led to ''[[tram-train]]'' networks that rather resembled an [[S-Bahn]]. This idea was first realised in 1992 in Karlsruhe ([[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]]), where as part of the [[Karlsruhe model]] even so-called [[Mehrsystemfahrzeug|dual system]] [[railbuses]] were used, which in addition to the [[direct current]] of Stra\u00dfenbahn lines (750 V) could also draw power from the 15-kV-[[alternating current]] from normal [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] catenary. In Karlsruhe this network reached as far as [[Heilbronn]], {{convert|84|km|mi}} away, where a Stadtbahn network was created going out from this line. Both in Karlsruhe and in Heilbronn the Stadtbahn filled both the roles of a classic tramway system as well as an S-Bahn. The Karlsruhe mixed-operation concept was also adopted by the [[Saarbahn]] in [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]. This model is today referred to in France as the [[tram-train]].\n\n[[File:Zwickau TrainTram.jpg|thumb|[[Zwickau]] diesel tram-train ([[Vogtlandbahn]])]]\n\nOther Stadtbahn networks in Germany without tunnels, but which incorporate railway lines, are found in:\n\n* [[Kassel]] ([[Kassel RegioTram]] with hybrid railcars for the transition between electrified and non-electrified routes)\n* [[Zwickau]] (Diesel railbuses of the [[Vogtlandbahn]] on [[Trams in Zwickau|tramways in the city centre]])\n* [[Chemnitz]] ([[Variotram]]s [[Trams in Chemnitz|trams]] fitted with railway equipment, which City-Bahn Chemnitz runs daily on the Chemnitz\u2013[[Stollberg/Erzgeb.]] line)\n* [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] ([[Trams in Gotha]]/Th\u00fcringerwaldbahn), above ground tramway (24&nbsp;km long), in existence since 1924, to [[Waltershausen]], [[Friedrichroda]] and [[Bad Tabarz]]\n* [[Nordhausen]] in the [[South Harz]]. This [[Trams in Nordhausen|tramway]] network run by the ''[[Harz Narrow Gauge Railways]]'' is notable because it supplements the diesel-hybrid cars with steam engines.\n\n== Legal terms ==\nAlthough a precise legal definition of ''Stadtbahn'' was planned in the 1970s, there is currently no such definition. By law, the [[BOStrab]] regulates all ''Stadtbahn'' systems as [[tram]] systems, as long as they are light rail rather than heavy rail.\n\n== Difference between Stadtbahn and S-Bahn in Germany ==\nWhile the names ''Stadtbahn'' and ''S-Bahn'' have common origin (''\"rapid urban train\"''), their meaning today is different. [[S-Bahn]] is [[commuter rail]], usually integrated into the railway network and mostly operated by the German national railway company [[Deutsche Bahn]].\n\n''Stadtbahn'', on the other hand, generally use [[light rail]] vehicles (either [[high-floor]] or [[low-floor]]), and are usually integrated into the tram network, though the Stadtbahn portions do not operate with [[street running]] like trams do.\n\nThey also differ in legal status: S-Bahn systems are governed under the rail rules of the [[Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsordnung]] (EBO, ''\"Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Railways\"''), while Stadtbahn systems are tramways by law governed under the regulations of [[Verordnung \u00fcber den Bau und Betrieb der Stra\u00dfenbahnen]] (BOStrab, ''\"Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Trams\"'').\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tram]]\n* [[Light rail]]\n* [[Premetro]]\n* [[Light metro]]\n* [[Tram-train]]\n* [[Train categories in Europe]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Stadtbahn systems}}\n\n{{Urban public transport in Germany}}\n\n[[Category:Rapid transit in Germany]]\n[[Category:Tram transport in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the type of light rail system|suburban metro rail systems|S-Bahn|the railway line through Berlin|Berlin Stadtbahn}}\n{{italic title}}\n[[File:Stadtbahn.svg|right|thumb|Stadtbahn logo as used in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]]]\n\nA '''''{{lang|de|Stadtbahn}}''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0283tat\u02ccba\u02d0n}}; [[German language|German]] for \"city railway\"; plural ''{{lang|de|Stadtbahnen}}'') is a type of [[rail transport]]. One type of transport originated in the 19th century, firstly in [[Berlin Stadtbahn|Berlin]] and followed by [[Wiener Stadtbahn|Vienna]], where rail routes where created that could be used independantly from other traffic.\n\nAgain in the 1960s and 1970s ''Stadtbahn'' networks were created but now by upgrading [[tram]]ways or [[light rail]]ways. This process includes adding segments built to [[rapid transit]] standards \u2013usually as part of a process of conversion to a [[rapid transit|metro]] railway\u2013 mainly by the building of metro-grade [[tunnel]]s in the central city area.{{citation needed|reason=A cite is needed for this claim - in general, Stadtbahns are considered \"light rail\" systems, not \"premetros\".|date=April 2014}} In the first years after the opening of the tunnel sections, often regular trams vehicles (but adapted for tunnel service) were used. These trams were followed by specially designed vehicles like the [[Stadtbahnwagen B|Stadtbahn B]] series. By the 1980s virtually all cities had abandoned the long-term goal of establishing a full-scale metro system due to the excessive costs associated with converting the tramways. Most ''Stadtbahn'' systems are now a mixture of tramway-like operations in suburban and peripheral areas and a more metro-like mode of operation in city centres, with underground stations. This 20th century ''Stadtbahn'' concept eventually spread from Germany to other European countries,<ref name=\"newscientist\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgKLfKjjft8C&lpg=PA699&dq=&pg=PA699#v=onepage&q&f=false | author = Ian Yearsley | title=Trams are coming back | journal=[[New Scientist]] | publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. | quote = <!-- But West Germany, like other nations, experienced phenomenal growth in private car ownership.

The [[Berlin Stadtbahn]] line is an elevated heavy rail line linking the East and the West. Long distance, regional, suburban, and urban services ([[S-Bahn]]) are operated on it.\n\nThe [[Wiener Stadtbahn]] (Vienna) was in the beginning a system of heavy rail lines circling the city, free of level crossings, operated by steam trains. After World War I the ''Wiental'', ''Donaukanal'' and ''G\u00fcrtel'' lines were converted into an electric light rail system with tram-like two-axle cars (which on line 18G until 1945 switched into the tram network at Gumpendorfer Strasse station). In the 1970s to 1990s the infrastructure was updated, and the lines were partially relocated: they are now part of the [[Vienna U-Bahn]] services 'U4' and 'U6'. The ''Vorortelinie'' line remained heavy rail and is now part of the [[Vienna S-Bahn]].\n\n=== 1960s: modern ''Stadtbahn'' ===\nSince the 1960s the term ''Stadtbahn'' has become identified with a second, now dominant, meaning, which is a reference to underground urban rail network that is used by conventional trams but planned at the outset to be eventually converted into a metro system (which may or may not be implemented in the end).\n\nPost-World War II transport policies in West German cities aimed for a separation of public and private transport. The conflicts that arose between increasing car usage and the existing tramway systems led to the so-called 'second level' concept for future light rail schemes.  This concept focused on the grade separation, i.e., elevation and/or tunneling of tram lines.\n\n[[Munich U-Bahn|Munich]] and [[Nuremberg U-Bahn|Nuremberg]] decided to build pure, full-scale [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (metro) systems. [[Berlin U-Bahn|Berlin]] and [[Hamburg U-Bahn|Hamburg]] planned expansions of their existing U-Bahn networks, while most West German cities decided to upgrade their tramway networks step by step, linking new 'second level' infrastructure to existing sections.  While some cities regarded this solution as an interim step that would lead to a fully separated [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (metro) network independent of other forms of transport, others planned for a lesser degree of separation, one that would accommodate additional tram-like sections in the long run. For both the interim and the long-term based concepts, the following terms came into use: \"U-Stra\u00dfenbahn\" or \"Untergrund-Stra\u00dfenbahn\" (underground tramway, abbreviated as \"U-Strab\"), \"Schnellstra\u00dfenbahn\" (rapid tramway) and finally ''Stadtbahn''. (In French-speaking countries, these concepts were also known as \"[[premetro|pre-metro]]\", stressing their interim nature.)\n\nSome operators and cities decided to identify the term ''Stadtbahn'' with the eventual goal of installing an [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] so that both the original U-Bahn logo (e.g. [[Frankfurt U-Bahn]], [[Cologne Stadtbahn]], [[Hanover Stadtbahn]]) and the derived ''U-Stadtbahn'' logos (e.g. [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Stuttgart Stadtbahn]]; see example above) mark station entries and stops. The numbering scheme for ''Stadtbahn'' services was prefixed with a 'U', except in the [[Cologne Stadtbahn]], [[Bielefeld Stadtbahn]], and [[Hanover Stadtbahn]].\n\n=== 1980s: Renaissance of the tramway ===\nBy the 1980s conventional tramways had been seen by decision-makers as overloaded systems for almost two decades.  However, public attention focused on them at this time for two reasons.\n\nThe ''Stadtbahn'' cities' second level plans faced unexpected complications in the form of lengthy construction work, budgetary problems for tunnel projects, and protests against elevated sections. At the same time, the smaller cities which had not started Stadtbahn plans reassessed their options in relation to their existing tram systems.{{cn|date=November 2018}}\n\nEast German cities had no 1960s-style Stadtbahn plans in place, and the fleets and the infrastructure were in need of massive investment and improvement.

The characters can be extensively customized with mods, armours, and they can acquire new skills after they [[Experience level|level up]]. A  [[permadeath]] system was featured in the game.

The word ''pajama'' (as '' pai jamahs,'' ''Paee-jams'' and variants) is recorded in English use in the first half of the nineteenth century.  They did not become a fashion in Britain and the Western world as sleeping attire for men until the Victorian period, from about 1870.<ref>Lewis, Ivor. 1991.

The classic account of the Shang comes from texts such as the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  According to the traditional chronology based on calculations made approximately 2,000 years ago by [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], the Shang ruled from 1766 to 1122&nbsp;BC, but according to the chronology based upon the \"current text\" of ''Bamboo Annals'', they ruled from 1556 to 1046&nbsp;BC. The [[Xia\u2013Shang\u2013Zhou Chronology Project]] dated them from c. 1600 to 1046&nbsp;BC based on the carbon 14 dates of the Erligang site.\n\nThe Shang dynasty is the earliest dynasty of traditional Chinese history firmly supported by archaeological evidence. Excavation at the [[Yinxu|Ruins of Yin]] (near modern-day [[Anyang]]), which has been identified as the last Shang capital, uncovered eleven major royal tombs and the foundations of palaces and ritual sites, containing weapons of war and remains from both animal and human sacrifices.  Tens of thousands of [[bronze]], [[jade]], [[stone]], [[bone]], and [[ceramic]] artifacts have been found.\n\nThe Anyang site has yielded the earliest known body of [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], mostly [[divination]]s inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s \u2013 turtle shells, ox [[scapula]]e, or other bones. More than 20,000 were discovered in the initial scientific excavations during the 1920s and 1930s, and over four times as many have been found since.  The inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of [[History of China|Chinese civilization]].{{sfnp|Keightley|2000}}\n\n==Traditional accounts==\nMany events concerning the Shang dynasty are mentioned in various [[Chinese classics]], including the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' and the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''.  Working from all the available documents, the [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]] assembled a sequential account of the Shang dynasty as part of his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  His history describes some events in detail, while in other cases only the name of a king is given.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=233\u2013235}}  A closely related, but slightly different, account is given by the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.  The ''Annals'' were interred in 296&nbsp;BC, but the text has a complex history and the authenticity of the surviving versions is controversial.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978b}}\n\nThe name ''Y\u012bn'' (\u6bb7) is used by Sima Qian for the dynasty, and in the \"current text\" version of the ''Bamboo Annals'' for both the dynasty and its final capital. It has been a popular name for the Shang throughout history. Since the ''Records of Emperors and Kings'' by [[Huangfu Mi]] (3rd century AD), it has often been used specifically to describe the later half of the Shang dynasty. In Japan and Korea, the Shang are still referred to almost exclusively as the Yin (''In'') dynasty. However, it seems to have been a [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] name for the earlier dynasty.  The word does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as ''Sh\u0101ng'' (\u5546), and the capital as ''D\u00e0y\u00ec Sh\u0101ng'' (\u5927\u9091\u5546 \"Great Settlement Shang\").{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=232}}  It also does not appear in securely-dated Western Zhou bronze inscriptions.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978a|p=xiv}}\n\n===Founding myth===\nThe founding myth of the Shang dynasty is described by Sima Qian in the ''Annals of the Yin''.  In the text, a woman named [[Jiandi]] (\u7c21\u72c4), who was the second wife of [[Emperor Ku]], swallowed an egg dropped by a black bird (\u7384\u9ce5) and subsequently gave birth miraculously to [[Xie of Shang|Xie]] (\u5070) \u2014 also appearing as Qi (\u5951).  Xie is said to have helped [[Yu the Great]] to control the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] and for his service to have been granted a place called Shang as a fief.<ref>{{harvp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}, with additional details from the ''Historical Records''.</ref>\n\n===Dynastic course===\nIn the ''Annals of the Yin'', Sima Qian writes that the dynasty was founded 13 generations after [[Xie of Shang|Xie]], when Xie's descendant [[Tang of Shang|Tang]] overthrew the impious and cruel final [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] ruler in the [[Battle of Mingtiao]].  The ''Records'' recount events from the reigns of Tang, [[Tai Jia]], [[Tai Wu]], [[Pan Geng]], [[Wu Ding]], [[Wu Yi of Shang|Wu Yi]] and the depraved final king [[King Zhou of Shang|Di Xin]], but the rest of the Shang rulers are merely mentioned by name.  According to the ''Records'', the Shang moved their capital five times, with the final move to Yin in the reign of Pan Geng inaugurating the golden age of the dynasty.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}\n\nDi Xin, the last Shang king, is said to have committed suicide after his army was defeated by [[King Wu of Zhou|Wu of Zhou]]. Legends say that his army and his equipped slaves betrayed him by joining the Zhou rebels in the decisive [[Battle of Muye]]. According to the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' and [[Mencius]] the battle was very bloody. The classic, [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' retells the story of the war between Shang and Zhou as a conflict with rival factions of gods supporting different sides in the war.\n\nAfter the Shang were defeated, King Wu allowed Di Xin's son [[Wu Geng]] to rule the Shang as a [[vassal]] kingdom.  However, Zhou Wu sent three of his brothers and an army to ensure that Wu Geng would not rebel.<ref>[http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 \u90b6\u3001\u9118\u4e8c\u570b\u8003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617081821/http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 |date=17 June 2011 }} (Bei, Yong two national test)</ref><ref>[http://ch.shvoong.com/humanities/1230377-%E5%91%A8%E5%88%9D-%E4%B8%89%E7%9B%91-%E4%B8%8E%E9%82%B6-%E9%84%98-%E5%8D%AB%E5%9C%B0%E6%9C%9B%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6/ \u5468\u521d\"\u4e09\u76d1\"\u4e0e\u90b6\u3001\u9118\u3001\u536b\u5730\u671b\u7814\u7a76] (Bei, Yong, Wei \u2013 looking at the research)</ref><ref>[http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html \"\u4e09\u76d1\"\u4eba\u7269\u7586\u5730\u53ca\u5176\u5730\u671b\u8fa8\u6790 \u2014\u2014\u517c\u8bba\u5eb7\u53d4\u7684\u59cb\u5c01\u5730\u95ee\u9898] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509022308/http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html |date=9 May 2011 }} (breaking ground on Kangshu problem)</ref> After Zhou Wu's death, the Shang joined the [[Rebellion of the Three Guards]] against the [[Duke of Zhou]], but the rebellion collapsed after three years, leaving Zhou in control of Shang territory.\n\n===Descendants of the Shang royal family===\nAfter Shang's collapse, Zhou's rulers forcibly relocated \"Yin diehards\" (\u6bb7\u9811) and scattered them throughout Zhou territory.<ref>[http://www.guoxue.com/jrxz/lztdzdxl/yuan231.htm \u4e00 \u88ab\u5265\u524a\u8005\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u578b] (Expoited by the presence of...)</ref> Some surviving members of the Shang royal family collectively changed their surname from the ancestral name Zi (\u5b50) to the name of their fallen dynasty, Yin.

Over time, court rituals to appease spirits developed, and in addition to his secular duties, the king would serve as the head of the [[ancestor worship]] cult. Often, the king would even perform oracle bone divinations himself, especially near the end of the dynasty. Evidence from excavations of the royal tombs indicates that royalty were buried with articles of value, presumably for use in the afterlife. Perhaps for the same reason, hundreds of commoners, who may have been [[Slavery|slave]]s, were buried alive with the royal corpse.\n\nA line of hereditary Shang kings ruled over much of northern China, and Shang troops fought frequent wars with neighboring settlements and nomadic herdsmen from the inner Asian [[steppe]]s. The Shang king, in his oracular divinations, repeatedly showed concern about the ''fang'' groups, the barbarians living outside of the civilized ''tu'' regions, which made up the center of Shang territory.{{Clarify|reason=are tu areas all of Shang or only the Shang heartland?|date=September 2010}}  In particular, the ''tufang'' group of the [[Yan Mountains|Yanshan]] region were regularly mentioned as hostile to the Shang.{{sfnp|Sun|2006}}\n\nApart from their role as the head military commanders, Shang kings also asserted their social supremacy by acting as the high priests of society and leading the divination ceremonies.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}} As the oracle bone texts reveal, the Shang kings were viewed as the best qualified members of society to offer sacrifices to their royal ancestors and to the high god [[Shangdi|Di]], who in their beliefs was responsible for the rain, wind, and thunder.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Shang bronze masks, 16-14th.JPG|thumb|Chinese Shang dynasty bronze face masks, 16th\u201314th century BC]]\nShang religious rituals featured divination and sacrifice.  The degree to which [[shamanism]] was a central aspect of Shang religion is a subject of debate.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}{{sfnp|Keightley|1998}}\n\nThere were six main recipients of sacrifice: (1) Di (the High God), (2) nature powers like the sun and mountain powers, (3) former lords, deceased humans who had been added to the dynastic pantheon, (4) pre-dynastic ancestors, (5) dynastic ancestors, and (6) royal wives who were ancestors of the present king.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nThe Shang believed that their ancestors held power over them and performed divination rituals to secure their approval for planned actions.{{sfnp|Keightley|2004}}  Divination involved cracking a turtle carapace or ox scapula to answer a question, and to then record the response to that question on the bone itself.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  It is unknown what criteria the diviners used to determine the response, but it is believed to be the sound or pattern of the cracks on the bone. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Shang also seem to have believed in an afterlife, as evidenced by the elaborate burial tombs built for deceased rulers.  Often \"carriages, utensils, sacrificial vessels, [and] weapons\" would be included in the tomb.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  A king's burial involved the burial of up to several hundred humans and horses as well to accompany the king into the afterlife, in some cases even numbering four hundred.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  Finally, tombs included ornaments such as jade, which the Shang may have believed to protect against decay or confer immortality.\n\nThe Shang religion was highly bureaucratic and meticulously ordered.  Oracle bones contained descriptions of the date, ritual, person, ancestor, and questions associated with the divination.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  Tombs displayed highly ordered arrangements of bones, with groups of skeletons laid out facing the same direction.\n\n===Bronze working===\n{{main|Chinese ritual bronzes}}\n[[File:Bronze square ding (cauldron) with human faces.jpg|thumb|right|Shang dynasty bronze vessel ding (sacrificial vessel)]]\nChinese bronze casting and pottery advanced during the Shang dynasty, with bronze typically being used for ritually significant, rather than primarily utilitarian, items.\nAs far back as c. 1500&nbsp;BC, the early Shang dynasty engaged in large-scale production of [[bronze]]-ware vessels and weapons.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} This production required a large labor force that could handle the mining, refining, and transportation of the necessary [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] ores. This in turn created a need for official managers that could oversee both hard-laborers and skilled artisans and craftsmen.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} The Shang royal court and aristocrats required a vast number of different bronze vessels for various ceremonial purposes and events of religious [[divination]].{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}}  Ceremonial rules even decreed how many bronze containers of each type a nobleman or noblewoman of a certain rank could own. With the increased amount of bronze available, the army could also better equip itself with an assortment of bronze weaponry. Bronze was also used for the fittings of [[spoke]]-wheeled [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]s, which appeared in China around 1200&nbsp;BC.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Dinastia shang, tipode ding biansato, xiii-xii sec. ac.JPG|A Shang dynasty bronze ''ding'' vessel\nFile:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|The Shang dynasty [[Houmuwu Ding]] is the heaviest piece of bronze work found in China so far.\nFile:Liu Ding.jpg|A late Shang dynasty bronze ''ding'' vessel with [[taotie]] motif\nFile:Gu wine vessel from the Shang Dynasty.jpg|Bronze ''g\u016b'' ritual wine vessel\nFile:La Tigresse, bronze vessel to preserve drink.

The classic account of the Shang comes from texts such as the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  According to the traditional chronology based on calculations made approximately 2,000 years ago by [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], the Shang ruled from 1766 to 1122&nbsp;BC, but according to the chronology based upon the \"current text\" of ''Bamboo Annals'', they ruled from 1556 to 1046&nbsp;BC. The [[Xia\u2013Shang\u2013Zhou Chronology Project]] dated them from c. 1600 to 1046&nbsp;BC based on the carbon 14 dates of the Erligang site.\n\nThe Shang dynasty is the earliest dynasty of traditional Chinese history firmly supported by archaeological evidence. Excavation at the [[Yinxu|Ruins of Yin]] (near modern-day [[Anyang]]), which has been identified as the last Shang capital, uncovered eleven major royal tombs and the foundations of palaces and ritual sites, containing weapons of war and remains from both animal and human sacrifices.  Tens of thousands of [[bronze]], [[jade]], [[stone]], [[bone]], and [[ceramic]] artifacts have been found.\n\nThe Anyang site has yielded the earliest known body of [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], mostly [[divination]]s inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s \u2013 turtle shells, ox [[scapula]]e, or other bones. More than 20,000 were discovered in the initial scientific excavations during the 1920s and 1930s, and over four times as many have been found since.  The inscriptions provide critical insight into many topics from the politics, economy, and religious practices to the art and medicine of this early stage of [[History of China|Chinese civilization]].{{sfnp|Keightley|2000}}\n\n==Traditional accounts==\nMany events concerning the Shang dynasty are mentioned in various [[Chinese classics]], including the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' and the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''.  Working from all the available documents, the [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]] assembled a sequential account of the Shang dynasty as part of his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''.  His history describes some events in detail, while in other cases only the name of a king is given.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=233\u2013235}}  A closely related, but slightly different, account is given by the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]''.  The ''Annals'' were interred in 296&nbsp;BC, but the text has a complex history and the authenticity of the surviving versions is controversial.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978b}}\n\nThe name ''Y\u012bn'' (\u6bb7) is used by Sima Qian for the dynasty, and in the \"current text\" version of the ''Bamboo Annals'' for both the dynasty and its final capital. It has been a popular name for the Shang throughout history. Since the ''Records of Emperors and Kings'' by [[Huangfu Mi]] (3rd century AD), it has often been used specifically to describe the later half of the Shang dynasty. In Japan and Korea, the Shang are still referred to almost exclusively as the Yin (''In'') dynasty. However, it seems to have been a [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] name for the earlier dynasty.  The word does not appear in the oracle bones, which refer to the state as ''Sh\u0101ng'' (\u5546), and the capital as ''D\u00e0y\u00ec Sh\u0101ng'' (\u5927\u9091\u5546 \"Great Settlement Shang\").{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=232}}  It also does not appear in securely-dated Western Zhou bronze inscriptions.{{sfnp|Keightley|1978a|p=xiv}}\n\n===Founding myth===\nThe founding myth of the Shang dynasty is described by Sima Qian in the ''Annals of the Yin''.  In the text, a woman named [[Jiandi]] (\u7c21\u72c4), who was the second wife of [[Emperor Ku]], swallowed an egg dropped by a black bird (\u7384\u9ce5) and subsequently gave birth miraculously to [[Xie of Shang|Xie]] (\u5070) \u2014 also appearing as Qi (\u5951).  Xie is said to have helped [[Yu the Great]] to control the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]] and for his service to have been granted a place called Shang as a fief.<ref>{{harvp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}, with additional details from the ''Historical Records''.</ref>\n\n===Dynastic course===\nIn the ''Annals of the Yin'', Sima Qian writes that the dynasty was founded 13 generations after [[Xie of Shang|Xie]], when Xie's descendant [[Tang of Shang|Tang]] overthrew the impious and cruel final [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] ruler in the [[Battle of Mingtiao]].  The ''Records'' recount events from the reigns of Tang, [[Tai Jia]], [[Tai Wu]], [[Pan Geng]], [[Wu Ding]], [[Wu Yi of Shang|Wu Yi]] and the depraved final king [[King Zhou of Shang|Di Xin]], but the rest of the Shang rulers are merely mentioned by name.  According to the ''Records'', the Shang moved their capital five times, with the final move to Yin in the reign of Pan Geng inaugurating the golden age of the dynasty.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|p=233}}\n\nDi Xin, the last Shang king, is said to have committed suicide after his army was defeated by [[King Wu of Zhou|Wu of Zhou]]. Legends say that his army and his equipped slaves betrayed him by joining the Zhou rebels in the decisive [[Battle of Muye]]. According to the ''[[Yi Zhou Shu]]'' and [[Mencius]] the battle was very bloody. The classic, [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' retells the story of the war between Shang and Zhou as a conflict with rival factions of gods supporting different sides in the war.\n\nAfter the Shang were defeated, King Wu allowed Di Xin's son [[Wu Geng]] to rule the Shang as a [[vassal]] kingdom.  However, Zhou Wu sent three of his brothers and an army to ensure that Wu Geng would not rebel.<ref>[http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 \u90b6\u3001\u9118\u4e8c\u570b\u8003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617081821/http://www.pkucn.com/redirect.php?tid=228246 |date=17 June 2011 }} (Bei, Yong two national test)</ref><ref>[http://ch.shvoong.com/humanities/1230377-%E5%91%A8%E5%88%9D-%E4%B8%89%E7%9B%91-%E4%B8%8E%E9%82%B6-%E9%84%98-%E5%8D%AB%E5%9C%B0%E6%9C%9B%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6/ \u5468\u521d\"\u4e09\u76d1\"\u4e0e\u90b6\u3001\u9118\u3001\u536b\u5730\u671b\u7814\u7a76] (Bei, Yong, Wei \u2013 looking at the research)</ref><ref>[http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html \"\u4e09\u76d1\"\u4eba\u7269\u7586\u5730\u53ca\u5176\u5730\u671b\u8fa8\u6790 \u2014\u2014\u517c\u8bba\u5eb7\u53d4\u7684\u59cb\u5c01\u5730\u95ee\u9898] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509022308/http://www.csscipaper.com/chinahistory/xianqin/110612.html |date=9 May 2011 }} (breaking ground on Kangshu problem)</ref> After Zhou Wu's death, the Shang joined the [[Rebellion of the Three Guards]] against the [[Duke of Zhou]], but the rebellion collapsed after three years, leaving Zhou in control of Shang territory.\n\n===Descendants of the Shang royal family===\nAfter Shang's collapse, Zhou's rulers forcibly relocated \"Yin diehards\" (\u6bb7\u9811) and scattered them throughout Zhou territory.<ref>[http://www.guoxue.com/jrxz/lztdzdxl/yuan231.htm \u4e00 \u88ab\u5265\u524a\u8005\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u578b] (Expoited by the presence of...)</ref> Some surviving members of the Shang royal family collectively changed their surname from the ancestral name Zi (\u5b50) to the name of their fallen dynasty, Yin.

Over time, court rituals to appease spirits developed, and in addition to his secular duties, the king would serve as the head of the [[ancestor worship]] cult. Often, the king would even perform oracle bone divinations himself, especially near the end of the dynasty. Evidence from excavations of the royal tombs indicates that royalty were buried with articles of value, presumably for use in the afterlife. Perhaps for the same reason, hundreds of commoners, who may have been [[Slavery|slave]]s, were buried alive with the royal corpse.\n\nA line of hereditary Shang kings ruled over much of northern China, and Shang troops fought frequent wars with neighboring settlements and nomadic herdsmen from the inner Asian [[steppe]]s. The Shang king, in his oracular divinations, repeatedly showed concern about the ''fang'' groups, the barbarians living outside of the civilized ''tu'' regions, which made up the center of Shang territory.{{Clarify|reason=are tu areas all of Shang or only the Shang heartland?|date=September 2010}}  In particular, the ''tufang'' group of the [[Yan Mountains|Yanshan]] region were regularly mentioned as hostile to the Shang.{{sfnp|Sun|2006}}\n\nApart from their role as the head military commanders, Shang kings also asserted their social supremacy by acting as the high priests of society and leading the divination ceremonies.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}} As the oracle bone texts reveal, the Shang kings were viewed as the best qualified members of society to offer sacrifices to their royal ancestors and to the high god [[Shangdi|Di]], who in their beliefs was responsible for the rain, wind, and thunder.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Shang bronze masks, 16-14th.JPG|thumb|Chinese Shang dynasty bronze face masks, 16th\u201314th century BC]]\nShang religious rituals featured divination and sacrifice.  The degree to which [[shamanism]] was a central aspect of Shang religion is a subject of debate.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}{{sfnp|Keightley|1998}}\n\nThere were six main recipients of sacrifice: (1) Di (the High God), (2) nature powers like the sun and mountain powers, (3) former lords, deceased humans who had been added to the dynastic pantheon, (4) pre-dynastic ancestors, (5) dynastic ancestors, and (6) royal wives who were ancestors of the present king.{{sfnp|Keightley|1999|pp=253\u2013254}}\n\nThe Shang believed that their ancestors held power over them and performed divination rituals to secure their approval for planned actions.{{sfnp|Keightley|2004}}  Divination involved cracking a turtle carapace or ox scapula to answer a question, and to then record the response to that question on the bone itself.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  It is unknown what criteria the diviners used to determine the response, but it is believed to be the sound or pattern of the cracks on the bone. {{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe Shang also seem to have believed in an afterlife, as evidenced by the elaborate burial tombs built for deceased rulers.  Often \"carriages, utensils, sacrificial vessels, [and] weapons\" would be included in the tomb.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  A king's burial involved the burial of up to several hundred humans and horses as well to accompany the king into the afterlife, in some cases even numbering four hundred.{{sfnp|Smith|1961}}  Finally, tombs included ornaments such as jade, which the Shang may have believed to protect against decay or confer immortality.\n\nThe Shang religion was highly bureaucratic and meticulously ordered.  Oracle bones contained descriptions of the date, ritual, person, ancestor, and questions associated with the divination.{{sfnp|Chang|1994}}  Tombs displayed highly ordered arrangements of bones, with groups of skeletons laid out facing the same direction.\n\n===Bronze working===\n{{main|Chinese ritual bronzes}}\n[[File:Bronze square ding (cauldron) with human faces.jpg|thumb|right|Shang dynasty bronze vessel ding (sacrificial vessel)]]\nChinese bronze casting and pottery advanced during the Shang dynasty, with bronze typically being used for ritually significant, rather than primarily utilitarian, items.\nAs far back as c. 1500&nbsp;BC, the early Shang dynasty engaged in large-scale production of [[bronze]]-ware vessels and weapons.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} This production required a large labor force that could handle the mining, refining, and transportation of the necessary [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] ores. This in turn created a need for official managers that could oversee both hard-laborers and skilled artisans and craftsmen.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}} The Shang royal court and aristocrats required a vast number of different bronze vessels for various ceremonial purposes and events of religious [[divination]].{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=17}}  Ceremonial rules even decreed how many bronze containers of each type a nobleman or noblewoman of a certain rank could own. With the increased amount of bronze available, the army could also better equip itself with an assortment of bronze weaponry. Bronze was also used for the fittings of [[spoke]]-wheeled [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariot]]s, which appeared in China around 1200&nbsp;BC.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Dinastia shang, tipode ding biansato, xiii-xii sec. ac.JPG|A Shang dynasty bronze ''ding'' vessel\nFile:HouMuWuDingFullView.jpg|The Shang dynasty [[Houmuwu Ding]] is the heaviest piece of bronze work found in China so far.\nFile:Liu Ding.jpg|A late Shang dynasty bronze ''ding'' vessel with [[taotie]] motif\nFile:Gu wine vessel from the Shang Dynasty.jpg|Bronze ''g\u016b'' ritual wine vessel\nFile:La Tigresse, bronze vessel to preserve drink.

Whilst part of it can be managed; however, some of it is beyond the ability of the operator or manufacturers to eliminate.\n\nIn order of importance, the three types of sound a firearm generates are:\n*Mechanical noise generated by the internal moving parts of the [[firearm action]] \u2014 this is usually quite faint and hardly noticeable when masked by other loud noises\n*[[Muzzle blast]] \u2014 [[shockwave]] generated by high-pressure gases escaping and expanding from the muzzle after the [[projectile]] exits the barrel and breaks the functional [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] restraining the gas inside the [[gun barrel#Bore|bore]]\n*[[Sonic boom]] \u2014 sharp [[bullwhip]]-cracking sound associated with high-frequency shockwaves caused by an object (in this case, the [[bullet]]) flying [[supersonic]]ally through the air\n\nA suppressor can only affect the noise generated by the muzzle blast, while using [[subsonic ammunition]]s can negate the sonic boom.  The mechanical noise, despite being very faint, can only be mitigated but is nearly impossible to eliminate.  For these reasons, it is difficult to completely silence any firearm, or achieve an acceptable{{clarify|date=June 2018}} level of noise suppression in [[revolver]]s that function under standard operating principles due to the looser gas seal between the barrel and the [[cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]].  Some revolvers have technical features that enable suppression and include the Russian [[Nagant M1895]] and [[OTs-38]] revolvers, and the [[S&W QSPR]].\n\nMuzzle blast generated by firearm discharge depends on the [[heat of combustion|combustion energy]] released by the [[propellant]] within the [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], which is directly proportional to the powder load within the casing (assuming a completely efficient burning of the powder).  Therefore, the greater the case capacity (e.g. a [[magnum cartridge]]), the louder the muzzle blast and consequently a more efficient or larger silencer system is required.  A gunshot (the combination of the sonic boom, the vacuum release, and hot gases) will almost always be louder than the sound of the action cycling of an [[semi-automatic firearm|autoloading firearm]].  Alan C. Paulson, a renowned firearms specialist, claimed to have encountered an integrally suppressed .22 LR gun that had such a quiet report {{clarify|date=August 2019}} ,<ref name=\"Paulson\"/> although this is somewhat uncommon.  Properly evaluating the sound generated by a firearm can only be done using a [[Decibel Meters|decibel meter]] in conjunction with a [[frequency spectrum]] analyzer during live tests.\n\nIn shorter barreled firearms, the bullet usually leaves the barrel before the propellents are completely burnt, leaving unburnt elements within the [[ejecta]]e that gets ignited when coming into contact with fresh air outside of the barrel, producing a secondary muzzle blast that can be very loud.  A shorter barrel also means that the bullet spends less time within the barrel, thus less energy gets transferred to the bullet, and a higher proportion of the propellent combustion energy gets retained within the bore and later released from the muzzle, producing a louder bang.  Hence a suppressor is more necessary for shorter firearms if noises are a significant concern.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:ReflexSuppressor-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a centerfire rifle silencer, showing expansion chamber \"reflexed\" (going back around) the rifle barrel, and four sound baffles.

In the actual silencer, the baffles are oriented at 90 degrees to each other about the axis of bullet travel. (The illustration cannot demonstrate this well.)]]\n[[File:Navy-HushPuppy-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a pistol silencer, showing expansion chamber wrapped around inner suppressor assembly, and four wipes. The bullet pushes a bullet-diameter hole through the wipes, trapping propellant gas behind it entirely until the bullet has passed through the wipe completely]]\n[[File:Patent DE1553874 07-Oct-1971 Handfeuerwaffe mit Schalldaempfer Heckler und Koch.png|thumb|Cross section drawing of an \"integral\" sound suppressor in part designed and built into the suppressed firearm.]]\n\nThe silencer is typically a hollow metal tube manufactured from [[steel]], [[aluminum]], or [[titanium]] and contains expansion chambers. This device, typically cylindrical in shape, attaches to the [[muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] of a [[pistol]], [[submachine gun]], or [[rifle]]. Some \"can\"-type silencers (so-called as they often resemble a [[beverage can]]) may be detached by the user and attached to a different firearm. Another type is the \"integral\" suppressor, which typically consists of an expansion chamber or chambers surrounding the barrel. The barrel has openings or \"ports\" which bleed off gases into the chambers. This type of silencer is part of the firearm (thus the term \"integral\"), and maintenance of the suppressor requires that the firearm be at least partially disassembled.<ref name=\"Heard2011\"/>\n\n[[File:Huntertown Kestrel 5.56 disassembled.JPG|thumb|left|Firearm suppressor disassembled to show blast chamber, baffles, and sections of the outer tube]]\n\nBoth types of silencers reduce noise by allowing the rapidly expanding gases from the firing of the cartridge to be decelerated and cooled through a series of hollow chambers. The trapped gas exits the suppressor over a longer period of time and at a greatly reduced speed, producing less noise signature. The chambers are divided by either ''baffles'' or ''wipes''. There are typically at least four and up to perhaps fifteen chambers in a suppressor, depending on the intended use and design details. Often, a single, larger expansion chamber is located at the muzzle end of a can-type silencer, which allows the propellant gas to expand considerably and slow down before it encounters the baffles or wipes. This larger chamber may be \"reflexed\" toward the rear of the barrel to minimize the overall length of the combined firearm and silencer, especially with longer weapons such as rifles.\n\nSilencers vary greatly in size and efficiency. One disposable type developed in the 1980s by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for [[9\u00d719mm]] pistols was {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} in outside diameter, and was designed for six shots with standard ammunition or up to thirty shots with [[speed of sound|subsonic]] (slower than the speed of sound) [[ammunition]]. In contrast, one suppressor designed for rifles firing the powerful [[.50 BMG|.50 caliber (BMG)]] cartridge is {{convert|509|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=\"Barrett\"/>\n\nTwo ancillary advantages to the silencer are recoil reduction and flash suppression. Muzzle flash is reduced by both being contained in the suppressor and through the arresting of unburned powder that would normally burn in the air, adding to the flash. Recoil reduction results from the slowing of propellant gasses, which can contribute 30\u201350% of recoil velocity. However, some suppressors can increase the backpressure produced by the propellant gasses. This can cause them to function somewhat like a [[muzzle booster]] and thus increase the felt recoil. The weight of the silencer and the location of that additional weight at the muzzle reduce recoil through basic mass as well as muzzle flip due to the location of this mass.\n\n===Components===\n\n===Baffles and spacers===\nBaffles are usually circular metal dividers which separate the expansion chambers. Each baffle has a hole in its center to permit the passage of the bullet through the silencer and toward the target. The hole is typically at least 1&nbsp;mm larger than the bullet caliber to minimize the risk of the bullet hitting the baffle in what is known as a \"baffle strike\". Baffles are typically made of stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, or alloys such as [[Inconel]], and are either [[machining|machined]] out of solid metal or [[stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] out of sheet metal. A few silencers for low-powered cartridges such as the [[.22 Long Rifle]] have successfully used plastic baffles (certain models by Vaime and others).<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|186\u2013187}}\n\nThere are several unique baffle designs. M, K, Z, monolithic core<ref name=\"Sparrow\"/> and \u03a9 (Omega) are the most prevalent. M-type is the crudest and comprises an inverted [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. K forms slanted obstructions diverging from the sidewalls, creating [[turbulence]] across the [[gauge (bore diameter)|bore]]line. Z is expensive to machine and includes \"pockets\" of dead airspace along the sidewalls which trap expanded gases and hold them thereby lengthening the time that the gases cool before exiting. Omega-type baffles form a series of spaced cones drawing gas away from the boreline and incorporate a scalloped mouth creating cross-bore turbulence, which is in turn directed to a \"mouse-hole\" opening between the baffle stack and sidewall.\n\nPropellant gas heats and erodes the baffles, causing wear, which is worsened by high rates of fire. Aluminum baffles are seldom used with fully [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]]s, because service life is unacceptably short. Some modern suppressors using steel or high-temperature alloy baffles can endure extended periods of fully automatic fire without damage. The highest-quality rifle suppressors available today have a claimed service life of greater than 30,000 rounds.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|363\u2013364}} Baffles have not been given any specific angles, a specific size, or weight to meet any standards; they are created on a trial and error basis.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nSpacers separate baffles and keep them aligned at a specified distance from each other inside the silencer. Many baffles and spacers are manufactured as a single assembly and several suppressor designs have all the baffles attached together with spacers as a one-piece helical baffle stack. Modern baffles are usually carefully shaped to divert the propellant gases effectively into the chambers. This shaping can be a slanted flat surface, canted at an angle to the bore, or a conical or otherwise curved surface. One popular technique is to have alternating angled surfaces through the stack of baffles.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\n===Wipes and packing material===\nWipes are inner dividers intended to touch the bullet as it passes through the silencer, and are typically made of [[rubber]], [[plastic]], or [[foam]]. Each wipe may either have a hole drilled in it before use, a pattern stamped into its surface at the point where the bullet will strike it, or it may simply be punched through by the bullet. Wipes typically last for a small number of firings (perhaps no more than five) before their performance is significantly degraded. While many suppressors used wipes in the [[Vietnam War]] era, most modern suppressors do not use them as anything that touches the projectile has significant accuracy implications. All \"wipes\" deteriorate quickly and require disassembly and spare parts replacement.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/>\n\n\"Wet\" silencers or \"wet cans\" use a small quantity of water, [[oil]], [[petroleum|grease]], or [[gel]] in the expansion chambers to cool the propellant gases and reduce their volume (see [[ideal gas law]]). The coolant lasts only a few shots before it must be replenished, but can greatly increase the effectiveness of the suppressor. Water is most effective, due to its high [[heat of vaporization]], but it can run or evaporate out of the silencer. Grease, while messier and less effective than water, can be left in the suppressor indefinitely without losing effectiveness. Oil is the least effective and least preferable, as it runs while being as messy as grease, and leaves behind a fine mist of [[aerosol]]ized oil after each shot. Water-based gels, such as wire-pulling lubricant gel, are a good compromise; they offer the efficacy of water with less mess, as they do not run or drip. However, they take longer to apply, as they must be cleared from the bore of the suppressor to ensure a clear path for the bullet (grease requires this step as well). Generally, only pistol silencers are shot wet, as rifle silencers handle such high pressure and heat that the liquid is gone within 1\u20133 shots. Many manufacturers will not warranty their rifle suppressors for \"wet\" fire, as some feel this may even result in a dangerous over-pressurization of the silencer.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nPacking materials such as metal [[mesh]], [[steel wool]], or [[washer (hardware)|metal washers]] may be used to fill the chambers and further dissipate and cool the gases. These are somewhat more effective than empty chambers, but less effective than wet designs.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|130}} Metal mesh, if properly used, may last for hundreds or thousands of shots of spaced semi-automatic fire; however, steel wool usually degrades within ten shots, with stainless steel wool lasting longer than regular steel wool. Like wipes, packing materials are rarely found in modern silencers.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nWipes, packing materials and purpose-designed wet cans have been generally abandoned in 21st-century suppressor design because they decrease overall accuracy and require excessive cleaning and maintenance.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/> The instructions from several manufacturers state that their suppressors need not be cleaned at all.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Which manufacturers? Where is this stated?}} Furthermore, legal changes in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s made it much more difficult for end-users to legally replace internal silencer parts, and the newer designs reflect this reality.<ref name=\"Explosives\"/>\n\n===Attachment===\n[[File:AOW and SBR suppressed.jpg|thumb|Silenced 12 gauge shotgun and 7.62\u00d739&nbsp;mm rifle]]\nApart from integral silencers which are integrated as a part of the firearm's barrel, most suppressors have a \"female\" threaded end, which attaches to \"male\" threads cut into the exterior of the barrel. These types of silencers are mostly used on handguns and rifles chambered in .22LR. More powerful rifles may use this type of attachment, but harsh recoil may cause the suppressor to over-tighten to the barrel and the suppressor can become difficult to remove.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> [[SilencerCo]]'s Salvo silencer for shotguns attaches via internal barrel threading normally used to mount removable [[Choke (firearms)|chokes]].<ref>Waldron, Len. \"SilencerCo Salvo 12 Gauge Suppressor Review.\" ''Guns &''\n Ammo''.

In these designs, effects known as [[frequency shifting]] and [[interference (wave propagation)|phase cancellation]] (or destructive interference) are used in an attempt to make the suppressor quieter. These effects are achieved by separating the flow of gases and causing them to collide with each other or by venting them through precision-made holes. The intended effect of frequency shifting is to shift audible sound waves frequencies into [[ultrasound]] (above 20 [[Hertz|kHz]]), beyond the range of human hearing. The Russian [[AN-94]] assault rifle has a muzzle attachment that claims apparent noise reduction by venting some gases through a \"dog-whistle\" type channel. Phase cancellation occurs when similar sound waves encounter each other 180\u00b0 out of phase, cancelling the amplitude of the wave and eliminating the pressure variations perceived as sound.\n\nAn alternate method under development is called the anti-phase destructive interference generator.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} The process involves duplication of the sound waves generated by the muzzle blast, which are then used to create an anti-phase auditory signal. Currently, this is a muzzle attached device, and is only being tested to cancel out the gunshot sound of the firearm. The devices tested incorporate multiple microphones, speakers and an auditory processor. The first shot fired is recorded, and then played back precisely out of sync(180 degrees out of phase) with each subsequent shot. This has proven successful with small caliber(.17-.22) rifles, but the amplitude has not been matched efficiently with larger cartridges. With the use of subsonic ammunition, the resultant sound waves effectively cancel each other out, and with the exception of the sound of the action cycling, completely eliminate any gunshot sound. In the current development stage, this has worked only in close proximity to the shooter, and the pressure wave(p-wave) can still be felt. Each time a different type of ammunition or firearm is used, the device needs recalibration.\n\nTaking advantage of either property requires that the silencer be designed within the specification of the muzzle blast in mind. For example, the velocity of the sound waves is a major factor. This figure can change significantly between different cartridges and barrel lengths.\n\nHowever, these concepts are controversial because a muzzle blast creates [[white noise|broadband noise]] rather than [[pure tone]]s, and phase cancellation in particular is therefore extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve. Some suppressor manufacturers claim to use phase cancellation in their designs.<ref name=\"WebbDoherty2010\"/>\n\nFrom a physics standpoint, supersonic cartridge loads are impractical to suppress past the levels that are merely hearing-safe for the shooter due to the sonic boom emitted by the bullet, and cartridges such as [[.22 LR]] and [[.45 ACP]] have long been recognized as the easiest to suppress even if using technology dating back to the 1940s.<ref name=\"assassin\"/><ref name=\"Supersonic\"/>\n\n===Captive-piston silencer===\nAnother silencer technology uses a captive piston cartridge; examples are the Smith & Wesson [[Quiet Special Purpose Revolver]] (QSPR) and the Soviet and Russian [[PSS silent pistol]],<ref name=sadj>{{cite web |url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/beyond-quiet-the-russian-pss-captive-piston-pistol/ |title=Beyond Quiet: The Russian PSS Captive Piston Pistol (2 Web pages)|website=Small Arms Defense Journa|date=16 August 2011|author= |accessdate= 14 June 2019}}</ref> [[OTs-38 Stechkin silent revolver]] and the MTs-116M suppressed sniper rifle, a 12.7mm silenced development of the 7.62mm MTs-116M.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a22862616/russia-silent-sniper-rifle/ |title=The Science of Russia's New Silent Sniper Rifle |website=Popular Mechanics|date=25 August 2018 |author=David Hambling |accessdate= 14 June 2019}}</ref> The large calibre allows the bullet to be fired at subsonic speed, eliminating a major source of noise, while retaining accuracy, range, and effectiveness. All these weapons use special, very expensive, captive-piston ammunition; the QSPR used ammunition which resembled metal-cased .410-bore shotgun shells. The cartridge case internally works as a piston to trap the gases; the piston pushes the bullet, but the gases are retained in the cartridge case instead of being expelled noisily; in tests of the PSS the sound pressure level was 124.6&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]], similar to a suppressed .22 rimfire pistol.<ref name=sadj/> The ammunition itself, rather than the weapon, is silent; in the US each individual round is considered to be a silencer, subject to regulations on silencers.<ref name=sadj/>\n\n===Improvised silencers===\nImprovised silencers have been made from a variety of materials.

Other sounds emanating from the weapon remain unchanged. Even subsonic bullets make distinct sounds by their passage through the air and striking targets, and supersonic bullets produce a small sonic boom, resulting in a \"ballistic crack\". Semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms also make distinct noises as their actions cycle, ejecting the fired cartridge case and loading a new round.\n\nAside from reductions in volume, suppressors tend to alter the sound to something that is not identifiable as a gunshot.<ref name=\"Dougherty2012\"/> This reduces or eliminates attention drawn to the shooter. A Finnish expression dating from the [[Winter War]] says that \"A silencer does not make a soldier silent, but it does make him invisible.\"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Guns & Weapons for Law Enforcement|year= 2004|issue=8|title=Finland's Silenced .338 Long-Range Sniper:Sako TRG42 Rifle and BR-Tuote T8M Reflex Suppressor|first= Al |last=Paulson|publisher=Harris Publications|location=New York|volume=1|url=http://www.canadiantactical.ca/PaulsonArticle2.html}}</ref> Silencers are particularly useful in enclosed spaces where the sound, flash and pressure effects of a weapon being fired are amplified. Such effects may disorient the shooter, affecting [[situational awareness]], concentration and accuracy, and can permanently damage hearing very quickly.<ref name=\"Dater2007\"/>\n\nAs the suppressed sound of firing is overshadowed by ballistic crack, observers can be deceived as to the location of the shooter, often from 90 to 180 degrees from his actual location. However, [[counter-sniper tactics]] can include [[gunfire locator]]s, such as the U.S. [[Boomerang (mobile shooter detection system)|Boomerang]] system, where sensitive microphones are coupled to computers running algorithms, and use the ballistic crack to detect and localize the origin of the shot.\n\nThere are many advantages in using a silencer that are not related to the sound.\n\nHunters using [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire rifles]] find silencers bring various important benefits that outweigh the extra weight and resulting change in the firearm's center of gravity. The most important advantage of a suppressor is the hearing protection for the shooter as well as their companions. Many hunters have suffered permanent hearing damage due to someone else firing a high-caliber gun too closely without warning.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=National Hearing Conservation Association|year= 2017|title=NHCA Position Statement, Recreational Firearm Noise |first=Michael |last=Stewart |first2=Deanna K. |last2=Meinke |first3=Gregory A. |last3=Flamme |first4=William J. |last4=Murphy |first5=Donald S. |last5=Finan |first6=James E. |last6=Lankford |first7=Stephen M. |last7= Tasko |url=https://www.hearingconservation.org/assets/docs/NHCA_position_paper_on_firea.pdf}}</ref> By reducing noise, recoil and muzzle-blast, it also enables the firer to follow through calmly on their first shot and fire a further carefully aimed shot without delay if necessary. [[Wildlife]] of all kinds are often confused as to the direction of the source of a well-suppressed shot. In the field, however, the comparatively large size of a centerfire rifle suppressor can cause unwanted noise if it bumps or rubs against vegetation or rocks, so many users cover them with [[neoprene]] sleeves.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/>\n\nSilencers reduce firing [[recoil]] significantly, primarily by diverting and trapping the propellant gas. The gas generally has much less mass than the projectile, but it exits the muzzle at multiples of the projectile velocity, so reducing the speed and quantity of the gas expelled can significantly reduce the total [[momentum]] of the matter (gas and projectile) leaving the barrel, the negation of which, because momentum is [[Conservation of momentum|conserved]], is transferred to the gun as recoil. Paulson ''et al.'', discussing low-velocity pistol calibers, suggest the recoil reduction is around 15%.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|38\u201340}} With high-velocity calibers, recoil reduction runs in the range of 20\u201330%.<ref name=\"MarkWhite\"/> The added mass of the suppressor\u2014normally 300 to 500&nbsp;grams\u2014also helps to manage the recoil.\n\nA suppressor also cools the hot gases coming out of the barrel enough that most of the [[lead]]-laced [[vapor]] that leaves the barrel [[condensation|condenses]] inside the silencer, reducing the amount of lead that might be inhaled by the shooter and others around them. However, in auto-loading actions this might be offset by increased [[back pressure]], which results in propellant gas blowing back into a shooter's face through the chamber during case ejection.<ref name=\"Emptormaven\"/>\n\n===Subsonic ammunition===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nIn weapons firing [[supersonic]] ammunition, the bullet itself produces a loud and very sharp sound as it leaves the muzzle in excess of the speed of sound and gradually reducing speed as it travels downrange. This is a small sonic boom, and is referred to in the firearm field as \"ballistic crack\" or \"sonic signature\". Subsonic ammunition eliminates this sound, but at the cost of lower velocity, resulting in decreased range and much decreased [[muzzle energy]] unless the bullet weight is increased, thus lessening effectiveness on the target. For example, if the muzzle velocity is reduced from {{cvt|820|m/s|order=flip}} (common for the [[.308 Winchester]], for example) to a subsonic {{cvt|290|m/s|order=flip}}, the muzzle energy is reduced by a factor of 8. Military marksmen and police units may use subsonic ammunition in suppressed rifles, when minimal noise is more important than range and energy.<ref name=\"sniper\"/>\n\nHowever, the numeric effectiveness of subsonic rounds is, again, misrepresented by media.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/> Independent testing of commercially available firearm suppressors with commercially available subsonic rounds has found that .308 subsonic rounds decreased the volume at the muzzle by 10 to 12&nbsp;dB when compared to the same caliber of suppressed supersonic ammunition.<ref name=\"results\" /> When combined with silencers, the subsonic .308 rounds metered between 121 and 137&nbsp;dB.\n\nThe ballistic crack depends on the speed of sound, which in turn depends mainly on air temperature. At sea level, an ambient temperature of {{convert|70|F}}, and under normal atmospheric conditions, the speed of sound is approximately {{convert|1140|ft/s}}. Bullets that travel near the speed of sound are considered [[transonic]], which means that the airflow over the surface of the bullet, which at points travels faster than the bullet itself, can break the speed of sound. [[Bullet#Pointed bullets|Pointed bullets]], which gradually displace air, can get closer to the speed of sound than round- or snub-nosed bullets before becoming transonic.\n\nSpecial cartridges have been developed for use with a silencer. These cartridges use very heavy bullets to make up for the energy lost by keeping the bullet subsonic. A good example of this is the [[.300 Whisper]] cartridge, which is formed from a necked-up [[.221 Remington Fireball]] cartridge case. The subsonic .300 Whisper fires up to a {{convert|250|gr}}, .30 caliber bullet at about {{convert|980|ft/s}}, generating about {{convert|533|ftlbf}} of energy at the muzzle. While this is similar to the energy available from the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, the reduced diameter and streamlined shape of the heavy .30 caliber bullet provides far better [[external ballistics|external ballistic]] performance, improving range substantially.\n\n[[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Parabellum]], a very popular caliber for suppressed shooting, can use almost any factory-loaded {{convert|147|gr}} weight round to achieve subsonic performance. These 147&nbsp;gr weight bullets typically have a velocity of {{convert|900|-|980|ft/s}}, which is less than the {{convert|1140|ft/s}} speed of sound.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\"/>\n[[File:AS Val & VSS Vintorez - RaceofHeroes-part2-34 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Integral silencer on [[VSS Vintorez]] sniper rifle and [[AS Val]] assault rifle]]\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/Russian [[Armor-piercing shot and shell#Small arms|armor-piercing]] [[9\u00d739mm]] ammunition used in rifles such as the [[AS Val]] has a high subsonic [[ballistic coefficient]], high retained downrange energy, high [[sectional density]], and moderate recoil.<ref name=\"Tilstra2014\"/>\n\nWithout using subsonic ammunition, the [[muzzle velocity]] of a supersonic bullet can be lowered by other means, before it leaves the barrel. Some silencer designs, referred to as \"integrals\", do this by allowing gas to bleed off along the length of the barrel before the projectile exits. The [[MP5SD]] is an example of this, with holes right after the chamber of the barrel used to reduce a regular 115 or 124&nbsp;gr ammunition to subsonic velocities.<ref name=\"Heard2011\"/>\n\n==Effectiveness==\n[[File:Silencerco Osprey 9, SWR Octane 45, and Silencerco Saker 5.56.JPG|thumb|Firearm silencers including the SilencerCo Osprey 9, SWR Octane 45, and SilencerCo Saker 5.56]]\n\nLive tests by independent reviewers of numerous commercially available suppressors find that even low-power, unsuppressed .22&nbsp;LR handguns produce gunshots over 160&nbsp;[[decibels]].<ref name=\"results\"/> A recent study of various suppressors reported peak sound pressure level reductions between 17&nbsp;dB and 24&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=William J.|last2=Flamme|first2=Gregory A.|last3=Campbell|first3=Adam R.|last4=Zechmann|first4=Edward L.|last5=Tasko|first5=Stephen M.|last6=Lankford|first6=James E.|last7=Meinke|first7=Deanna K.|last8=Finan|first8=Donald S.|last9=Stewart|first9=Michael|date=2018-01-26|title=The reduction of gunshot noise and auditory risk through the use of firearm suppressors and low-velocity ammunition|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=57|issue=sup1|pages=S28\u2013S41|doi=10.1080/14992027.2017.1407459|issn=1499-2027|pmid=29299940}}</ref> Another study evaluated two calibers of rifle and nine suppressors, .223 caliber [[AR-15 style rifle|AR-15]] (five suppressors) and .300 caliber AAC Blackout (four suppressors), and reported noise reduction of the peak sound level pressure between 7&nbsp;dB and 32&nbsp;dB.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lobarinas|first=Edward|last2=Scott|first2=Ryan|last3=Spankovich|first3=Christopher|last4=Prell|first4=Colleen G.

However, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] uses 140&nbsp;dB as the \"safety cutoff\" for [[impulse noise (audio)|impulsive noise]], which has led most U.S. manufacturers to advertise sub-140&nbsp;dB silencers as \"hearing safe\". Current OSHA standards would allow no more than sub-single-second exposure to impact noise over 130&nbsp;dB per 24 hours. That would equate to a single .308 round fired through a very efficient suppressor. This result effectively requires all users of silencers to wear additional ear protection.\n\nDecibel testing measures only the peak sound \"pressure\" noise, not duration or frequency. Limitations of dB testing become apparent in a comparison of sound between a [[.308 Winchester|.308 caliber]] rifle and a [[.300 Winchester Magnum]] rifle. The dB meter will show that both rifles produce the same decibel level of noise. Upon firing these rifles, however, it is clear that the .300 Winchester Magnum sounds much louder. What a dB meter does not show is that, although both rifles produce the same peak [[sound pressure level]] (SPL), the .300 Winchester Magnum holds its peak duration longer\u2014meaning that the .300 Winchester Magnum sound remains at full value longer, while the .308 peaks and falls off more quickly. Decibel meters fail in this and other regards when being used as the principal means to determine silencer capability. In a physical sense, dB meters essentially take a short-time average ([[Root mean square|RMS]] intensity of a sonic signal or impulse) over a specified period of time (sampling rate), and do not take into account the rate of increase of the sound wave packet (first derivative of packet envelope), which would in practice provide a better sense of the human [[Sound perception|perception of sound]].<ref name=\"AWC\"/>\n\nAlan C.

Whilst part of it can be managed; however, some of it is beyond the ability of the operator or manufacturers to eliminate.\n\nIn order of importance, the three types of sound a firearm generates are:\n*Mechanical noise generated by the internal moving parts of the [[firearm action]] \u2014 this is usually quite faint and hardly noticeable when masked by other loud noises\n*[[Muzzle blast]] \u2014 [[shockwave]] generated by high-pressure gases escaping and expanding from the muzzle after the [[projectile]] exits the barrel and breaks the functional [[seal (mechanical)|seal]] restraining the gas inside the [[gun barrel#Bore|bore]]\n*[[Sonic boom]] \u2014 sharp [[bullwhip]]-cracking sound associated with high-frequency shockwaves caused by an object (in this case, the [[bullet]]) flying [[supersonic]]ally through the air\n\nA suppressor can only affect the noise generated by the muzzle blast, while using [[subsonic ammunition]]s can negate the sonic boom.  The mechanical noise, despite being very faint, can only be mitigated but is nearly impossible to eliminate.  For these reasons, it is difficult to completely silence any firearm, or achieve an acceptable{{clarify|date=June 2018}} level of noise suppression in [[revolver]]s that function under standard operating principles due to the looser gas seal between the barrel and the [[cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]].  Some revolvers have technical features that enable suppression and include the Russian [[Nagant M1895]] and [[OTs-38]] revolvers, and the [[S&W QSPR]].\n\nMuzzle blast generated by firearm discharge depends on the [[heat of combustion|combustion energy]] released by the [[propellant]] within the [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], which is directly proportional to the powder load within the casing (assuming a completely efficient burning of the powder).  Therefore, the greater the case capacity (e.g. a [[magnum cartridge]]), the louder the muzzle blast and consequently a more efficient or larger silencer system is required.  A gunshot (the combination of the sonic boom, the vacuum release, and hot gases) will almost always be louder than the sound of the action cycling of an [[semi-automatic firearm|autoloading firearm]].  Alan C. Paulson, a renowned firearms specialist, claimed to have encountered an integrally suppressed .22 LR gun that had such a quiet report {{clarify|date=August 2019}} ,<ref name=\"Paulson\"/> although this is somewhat uncommon.  Properly evaluating the sound generated by a firearm can only be done using a [[Decibel Meters|decibel meter]] in conjunction with a [[frequency spectrum]] analyzer during live tests.\n\nIn shorter barreled firearms, the bullet usually leaves the barrel before the propellents are completely burnt, leaving unburnt elements within the [[ejecta]]e that gets ignited when coming into contact with fresh air outside of the barrel, producing a secondary muzzle blast that can be very loud.  A shorter barrel also means that the bullet spends less time within the barrel, thus less energy gets transfered to the bullet, and a higher proportion of the propellent combustion energy gets retained within the bore and later released from the muzzle, producing a louder bang.  Hence a suppressor is more necessary for shorter firearms if noises are a significant concern.\n\n==Design and construction==\n[[File:ReflexSuppressor-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a centerfire rifle silencer, showing expansion chamber \"reflexed\" (going back around) the rifle barrel, and four sound baffles.

These baffles use alternating angled flat surfaces to repeatedly deflect gas expanding through the silencer. In the actual silencer, the baffles are oriented at 90 degrees to each other about the axis of bullet travel. (The illustration cannot demonstrate this well.)]]\n[[File:Navy-HushPuppy-WP-Drwg.png|thumb|Cross-section drawing of a pistol silencer, showing expansion chamber wrapped around inner suppressor assembly, and four wipes. The bullet pushes a bullet-diameter hole through the wipes, trapping propellant gas behind it entirely until the bullet has passed through the wipe completely]]\n[[File:Patent DE1553874 07-Oct-1971 Handfeuerwaffe mit Schalldaempfer Heckler und Koch.png|thumb|Cross section drawing of an \"integral\" sound suppressor in part designed and built into the suppressed firearm.]]\n\nThe silencer is typically a hollow metal tube manufactured from [[steel]], [[aluminum]], or [[titanium]] and contains expansion chambers. This device, typically cylindrical in shape, attaches to the [[muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]] of a [[pistol]], [[submachine gun]], or [[rifle]]. Some \"can\"-type silencers (so-called as they often resemble a [[beverage can]]) may be detached by the user and attached to a different firearm. Another type is the \"integral\" suppressor, which typically consists of an expansion chamber or chambers surrounding the barrel. The barrel has openings or \"ports\" which bleed off gases into the chambers. This type of silencer is part of the firearm (thus the term \"integral\"), and maintenance of the suppressor requires that the firearm be at least partially disassembled.<ref name=\"Heard2011\"/>\n\n[[File:Huntertown Kestrel 5.56 disassembled.JPG|thumb|left|Firearm suppressor disassembled to show blast chamber, baffles, and sections of the outer tube]]\n\nBoth types of silencers reduce noise by allowing the rapidly expanding gases from the firing of the cartridge to be decelerated and cooled through a series of hollow chambers. The trapped gas exits the suppressor over a longer period of time and at a greatly reduced speed, producing less noise signature. The chambers are divided by either ''baffles'' or ''wipes''. There are typically at least four and up to perhaps fifteen chambers in a suppressor, depending on the intended use and design details. Often, a single, larger expansion chamber is located at the muzzle end of a can-type silencer, which allows the propellant gas to expand considerably and slow down before it encounters the baffles or wipes. This larger chamber may be \"reflexed\" toward the rear of the barrel to minimize the overall length of the combined firearm and silencer, especially with longer weapons such as rifles.\n\nSilencers vary greatly in size and efficiency. One disposable type developed in the 1980s by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] for [[9\u00d719mm]] pistols was {{convert|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} in outside diameter, and was designed for six shots with standard ammunition or up to thirty shots with [[speed of sound|subsonic]] (slower than the speed of sound) [[ammunition]]. In contrast, one suppressor designed for rifles firing the powerful [[.50 BMG|.50 caliber (BMG)]] cartridge is {{convert|509|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|76|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=\"Barrett\"/>\n\nTwo ancillary advantages to the silencer are recoil reduction and flash suppression. Muzzle flash is reduced by both being contained in the suppressor and through the arresting of unburned powder that would normally burn in the air, adding to the flash. Recoil reduction results from the slowing of propellant gasses, which can contribute 30\u201350% of recoil velocity. However, some suppressors can increase the backpressure produced by the propellant gasses. This can cause them to function somewhat like a [[muzzle booster]] and thus increase the felt recoil. The weight of the silencer and the location of that additional weight at the muzzle reduce recoil through basic mass as well as muzzle flip due to the location of this mass.\n\n===Components===\n\n===Baffles and spacers===\nBaffles are usually circular metal dividers which separate the expansion chambers. Each baffle has a hole in its center to permit the passage of the bullet through the silencer and toward the target. The hole is typically at least 1&nbsp;mm larger than the bullet caliber to minimize the risk of the bullet hitting the baffle in what is known as a \"baffle strike\". Baffles are typically made of stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, or alloys such as [[Inconel]], and are either [[machining|machined]] out of solid metal or [[stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] out of sheet metal. A few silencers for low-powered cartridges such as the [[.22 Long Rifle]] have successfully used plastic baffles (certain models by Vaime and others).<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|186\u2013187}}\n\nThere are several unique baffle designs. M, K, Z, monolithic core<ref name=\"Sparrow\"/> and \u03a9 (Omega) are the most prevalent. M-type is the crudest and comprises an inverted [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. K forms slanted obstructions diverging from the sidewalls, creating [[turbulence]] across the [[gauge (bore diameter)|bore]]line. Z is expensive to machine and includes \"pockets\" of dead airspace along the sidewalls which trap expanded gases and hold them thereby lengthening the time that the gases cool before exiting. Omega-type baffles form a series of spaced cones drawing gas away from the boreline and incorporate a scalloped mouth creating cross-bore turbulence, which is in turn directed to a \"mouse-hole\" opening between the baffle stack and sidewall.\n\nPropellant gas heats and erodes the baffles, causing wear, which is worsened by high rates of fire. Aluminum baffles are seldom used with fully [[automatic firearm|automatic weapon]]s, because service life is unacceptably short. Some modern suppressors using steel or high-temperature alloy baffles can endure extended periods of fully automatic fire without damage. The highest-quality rifle suppressors available today have a claimed service life of greater than 30,000 rounds.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|363\u2013364}} Baffles have not been given any specific angles, a specific size, or weight to meet any standards; they are created on a trial and error basis.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nSpacers separate baffles and keep them aligned at a specified distance from each other inside the silencer. Many baffles and spacers are manufactured as a single assembly and several suppressor designs have all the baffles attached together with spacers as a one-piece helical baffle stack. Modern baffles are usually carefully shaped to divert the propellant gases effectively into the chambers. This shaping can be a slanted flat surface, canted at an angle to the bore, or a conical or otherwise curved surface. One popular technique is to have alternating angled surfaces through the stack of baffles.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\n===Wipes and packing material===\nWipes are inner dividers intended to touch the bullet as it passes through the silencer, and are typically made of [[rubber]], [[plastic]], or [[foam]]. Each wipe may either have a hole drilled in it before use, a pattern stamped into its surface at the point where the bullet will strike it, or it may simply be punched through by the bullet. Wipes typically last for a small number of firings (perhaps no more than five) before their performance is significantly degraded. While many suppressors used wipes in the [[Vietnam War]] era, most modern suppressors do not use them as anything that touches the projectile has significant accuracy implications. All \"wipes\" deteriorate quickly and require disassembly and spare parts replacement.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/>\n\n\"Wet\" silencers or \"wet cans\" use a small quantity of water, [[oil]], [[petroleum|grease]], or [[gel]] in the expansion chambers to cool the propellant gases and reduce their volume (see [[ideal gas law]]). The coolant lasts only a few shots before it must be replenished, but can greatly increase the effectiveness of the suppressor. Water is most effective, due to its high [[heat of vaporization]], but it can run or evaporate out of the silencer. Grease, while messier and less effective than water, can be left in the suppressor indefinitely without losing effectiveness. Oil is the least effective and least preferable, as it runs while being as messy as grease, and leaves behind a fine mist of [[aerosol]]ized oil after each shot. Water-based gels, such as wire-pulling lubricant gel, are a good compromise; they offer the efficacy of water with less mess, as they do not run or drip. However, they take longer to apply, as they must be cleared from the bore of the suppressor to ensure a clear path for the bullet (grease requires this step as well). Generally, only pistol silencers are shot wet, as rifle silencers handle such high pressure and heat that the liquid is gone within 1\u20133 shots. Many manufacturers will not warranty their rifle suppressors for \"wet\" fire, as some feel this may even result in a dangerous over-pressurization of the silencer.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nPacking materials such as metal [[mesh]], [[steel wool]], or [[washer (hardware)|metal washers]] may be used to fill the chambers and further dissipate and cool the gases. These are somewhat more effective than empty chambers, but less effective than wet designs.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|130}} Metal mesh, if properly used, may last for hundreds or thousands of shots of spaced semi-automatic fire; however, steel wool usually degrades within ten shots, with stainless steel wool lasting longer than regular steel wool. Like wipes, packing materials are rarely found in modern silencers.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nWipes, packing materials and purpose-designed wet cans have been generally abandoned in 21st-century suppressor design because they decrease overall accuracy and require excessive cleaning and maintenance.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/> The instructions from several manufacturers state that their suppressors need not be cleaned at all.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Which manufacturers?

These types of silencers are mostly used on handguns and rifles chambered in .22LR. More powerful rifles may use this type of attachment, but harsh recoil may cause the suppressor to over-tighten to the barrel and the suppressor can become difficult to remove.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> [[SilencerCo]]'s Salvo silencer for shotguns attaches via internal barrel threading normally used to mount removable [[Choke (firearms)|chokes]].<ref>Waldron, Len. \"SilencerCo Salvo 12 Gauge Suppressor Review.\" ''Guns &''\n Ammo''.

In these designs, effects known as [[frequency shifting]] and [[interference (wave propagation)|phase cancellation]] (or destructive interference) are used in an attempt to make the suppressor quieter. These effects are achieved by separating the flow of gases and causing them to collide with each other or by venting them through precision-made holes. The intended effect of frequency shifting is to shift audible sound waves frequencies into [[ultrasound]] (above 20 [[Hertz|kHz]]), beyond the range of human hearing. The Russian [[AN-94]] assault rifle has a muzzle attachment that claims apparent noise reduction by venting some gases through a \"dog-whistle\" type channel. Phase cancellation occurs when similar sound waves encounter each other 180\u00b0 out of phase, cancelling the amplitude of the wave and eliminating the pressure variations perceived as sound.\n\nAn alternate method under development is called the anti-phase destructive interference generator.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} The process involves duplication of the sound waves generated by the muzzle blast, which are then used to create an anti-phase auditory signal. Currently, this is a muzzle attached device, and is only being tested to cancel out the gunshot sound of the firearm. The devices tested incorporate multiple microphones, speakers and an auditory processor. The first shot fired is recorded, and then played back precisely out of sync(180 degrees out of phase) with each subsequent shot. This has proven successful with small caliber(.17-.22) rifles, but the amplitude has not been matched efficiently with larger cartridges. With the use of subsonic ammunition, the resultant sound waves effectively cancel each other out, and with the exception of the sound of the action cycling, completely eliminate any gunshot sound. In the current development stage, this has worked only in close proximity to the shooter, and the pressure wave(p-wave) can still be felt. Each time a different type of ammunition or firearm is used, the device needs recalibration.\n\nTaking advantage of either property requires that the silencer be designed within the specification of the muzzle blast in mind. For example, the velocity of the sound waves is a major factor. This figure can change significantly between different cartridges and barrel lengths.\n\nHowever, these concepts are controversial because a muzzle blast creates [[white noise|broadband noise]] rather than [[pure tone]]s, and phase cancellation in particular is therefore extremely difficult (if not impossible) to achieve. Some suppressor manufacturers claim to use phase cancellation in their designs.<ref name=\"WebbDoherty2010\"/>\n\nFrom a physics standpoint, supersonic cartridge loads are impractical to suppress past the levels that are merely hearing-safe for the shooter due to the sonic boom emitted by the bullet, and cartridges such as [[.22 LR]] and [[.45 ACP]] have long been recognized as the easiest to suppress even if using technology dating back to the 1940s.<ref name=\"assassin\"/><ref name=\"Supersonic\"/>\n\n===Captive-piston silencer===\nAnother silencer technology uses a captive piston cartridge; examples are the Smith & Wesson [[Quiet Special Purpose Revolver]] (QSPR) and the Soviet and Russian [[PSS silent pistol]],<ref name=sadj>{{cite web |url=http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/beyond-quiet-the-russian-pss-captive-piston-pistol/ |title=Beyond Quiet: The Russian PSS Captive Piston Pistol (2 Web pages)|website=Small Arms Defense Journa|date=16 August 2011|author= |accessdate= 14 June 2019}}</ref> [[OTs-38 Stechkin silent revolver]] and the MTs-116M suppressed sniper rifle, a 12.7mm silenced development of the 7.62mm MTs-116M.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a22862616/russia-silent-sniper-rifle/ |title=The Science of Russia's New Silent Sniper Rifle |website=Popular Mechanics|date=25 August 2018 |author=David Hambling |accessdate= 14 June 2019}}</ref> The large calibre allows the bullet to be fired at subsonic speed, eliminating a major source of noise, while retaining accuracy, range, and effectiveness. All these weapons use special, very expensive, captive-piston ammunition; the QSPR used ammunition which resembled metal-cased .410-bore shotgun shells. The cartridge case internally works as a piston to trap the gases; the piston pushes the bullet, but the gases are retained in the cartridge case instead of being expelled noisily; in tests of the PSS the sound pressure level was 124.6&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]], similar to a suppressed .22 rimfire pistol.<ref name=sadj/> The ammunition itself, rather than the weapon, is silent; in the US each individual round is considered to be a silencer, subject to regulations on silencers.<ref name=sadj/>\n\n===Improvised silencers===\nImprovised silencers have been made from a variety of materials.

Other sounds emanating from the weapon remain unchanged. Even subsonic bullets make distinct sounds by their passage through the air and striking targets, and supersonic bullets produce a small sonic boom, resulting in a \"ballistic crack\". Semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms also make distinct noises as their actions cycle, ejecting the fired cartridge case and loading a new round.\n\nAside from reductions in volume, suppressors tend to alter the sound to something that is not identifiable as a gunshot.<ref name=\"Dougherty2012\"/> This reduces or eliminates attention drawn to the shooter. A Finnish expression dating from the [[Winter War]] says that \"A silencer does not make a soldier silent, but it does make him invisible.\"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Guns & Weapons for Law Enforcement|year= 2004|issue=8|title=Finland's Silenced .338 Long-Range Sniper:Sako TRG42 Rifle and BR-Tuote T8M Reflex Suppressor|first= Al |last=Paulson|publisher=Harris Publications|location=New York|volume=1|url=http://www.canadiantactical.ca/PaulsonArticle2.html}}</ref> Silencers are particularly useful in enclosed spaces where the sound, flash and pressure effects of a weapon being fired are amplified. Such effects may disorient the shooter, affecting [[situational awareness]], concentration and accuracy, and can permanently damage hearing very quickly.<ref name=\"Dater2007\"/>\n\nAs the suppressed sound of firing is overshadowed by ballistic crack, observers can be deceived as to the location of the shooter, often from 90 to 180 degrees from his actual location. However, [[counter-sniper tactics]] can include [[gunfire locator]]s, such as the U.S. [[Boomerang (mobile shooter detection system)|Boomerang]] system, where sensitive microphones are coupled to computers running algorithms, and use the ballistic crack to detect and localize the origin of the shot.\n\nThere are many advantages in using a silencer that are not related to the sound.\n\nHunters using [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire rifles]] find silencers bring various important benefits that outweigh the extra weight and resulting change in the firearm's center of gravity. The most important advantage of a suppressor is the hearing protection for the shooter as well as their companions. Many hunters have suffered permanent hearing damage due to someone else firing a high-caliber gun too closely without warning.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=National Hearing Conservation Association|year= 2017|title=NHCA Position Statement, Recreational Firearm Noise |first=Michael |last=Stewart |first2=Deanna K. |last2=Meinke |first3=Gregory A. |last3=Flamme |first4=William J. |last4=Murphy |first5=Donald S. |last5=Finan |first6=James E. |last6=Lankford |first7=Stephen M. |last7= Tasko |url=https://www.hearingconservation.org/assets/docs/NHCA_position_paper_on_firea.pdf}}</ref> By reducing noise, recoil and muzzle-blast, it also enables the firer to follow through calmly on their first shot and fire a further carefully aimed shot without delay if necessary. [[Wildlife]] of all kinds are often confused as to the direction of the source of a well-suppressed shot. In the field, however, the comparatively large size of a centerfire rifle suppressor can cause unwanted noise if it bumps or rubs against vegetation or rocks, so many users cover them with [[neoprene]] sleeves.<ref name=\"Mann2014\"/>\n\nSilencers reduce firing [[recoil]] significantly, primarily by diverting and trapping the propellant gas. The gas generally has much less mass than the projectile, but it exits the muzzle at multiples of the projectile velocity, so reducing the speed and quantity of the gas expelled can significantly reduce the total [[momentum]] of the matter (gas and projectile) leaving the barrel, the negation of which, because momentum is [[Conservation of momentum|conserved]], is transferred to the gun as recoil. Paulson ''et al.'', discussing low-velocity pistol calibers, suggest the recoil reduction is around 15%.<ref name=\"Paulson\"/>{{rp|38\u201340}} With high-velocity calibers, recoil reduction runs in the range of 20\u201330%.<ref name=\"MarkWhite\"/> The added mass of the suppressor\u2014normally 300 to 500&nbsp;grams\u2014also helps to manage the recoil.\n\nA suppressor also cools the hot gases coming out of the barrel enough that most of the [[lead]]-laced [[vapor]] that leaves the barrel [[condensation|condenses]] inside the silencer, reducing the amount of lead that might be inhaled by the shooter and others around them. However, in auto-loading actions this might be offset by increased [[back pressure]], which results in propellant gas blowing back into a shooter's face through the chamber during case ejection.<ref name=\"Emptormaven\"/>\n\n===Subsonic ammunition===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2019}}\nIn weapons firing [[supersonic]] ammunition, the bullet itself produces a loud and very sharp sound as it leaves the muzzle in excess of the speed of sound and gradually reducing speed as it travels downrange. This is a small sonic boom, and is referred to in the firearm field as \"ballistic crack\" or \"sonic signature\". Subsonic ammunition eliminates this sound, but at the cost of lower velocity, resulting in decreased range and much decreased [[muzzle energy]] unless the bullet weight is increased, thus lessening effectiveness on the target. For example, if the muzzle velocity is reduced from {{cvt|820|m/s|order=flip}} (common for the [[.308 Winchester]], for example) to a subsonic {{cvt|290|m/s|order=flip}}, the muzzle energy is reduced by a factor of 8. Military marksmen and police units may use subsonic ammunition in suppressed rifles, when minimal noise is more important than range and energy.<ref name=\"sniper\"/>\n\nHowever, the numeric effectiveness of subsonic rounds is, again, misrepresented by media.<ref name=\"Dockery2007\"/> Independent testing of commercially available firearm suppressors with commercially available subsonic rounds has found that .308 subsonic rounds decreased the volume at the muzzle by 10 to 12&nbsp;dB when compared to the same caliber of suppressed supersonic ammunition.<ref name=\"results\" /> When combined with silencers, the subsonic .308 rounds metered between 121 and 137&nbsp;dB.\n\nThe ballistic crack depends on the speed of sound, which in turn depends mainly on air temperature. At sea level, an ambient temperature of {{convert|70|F}}, and under normal atmospheric conditions, the speed of sound is approximately {{convert|1140|ft/s}}. Bullets that travel near the speed of sound are considered [[transonic]], which means that the airflow over the surface of the bullet, which at points travels faster than the bullet itself, can break the speed of sound. [[Bullet#Pointed bullets|Pointed bullets]], which gradually displace air, can get closer to the speed of sound than round- or snub-nosed bullets before becoming transonic.\n\nSpecial cartridges have been developed for use with a silencer. These cartridges use very heavy bullets to make up for the energy lost by keeping the bullet subsonic. A good example of this is the [[.300 Whisper]] cartridge, which is formed from a necked-up [[.221 Remington Fireball]] cartridge case. The subsonic .300 Whisper fires up to a {{convert|250|gr}}, .30 caliber bullet at about {{convert|980|ft/s}}, generating about {{convert|533|ftlbf}} of energy at the muzzle. While this is similar to the energy available from the .45 ACP pistol cartridge, the reduced diameter and streamlined shape of the heavy .30 caliber bullet provides far better [[external ballistics|external ballistic]] performance, improving range substantially.\n\n[[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9\u00d719&nbsp;mm Parabellum]], a very popular caliber for suppressed shooting, can use almost any factory-loaded {{convert|147|gr}} weight round to achieve subsonic performance. These 147&nbsp;gr weight bullets typically have a velocity of {{convert|900|-|980|ft/s}}, which is less than the {{convert|1140|ft/s}} speed of sound.<ref name=\"Ayoob2011\"/>\n[[File:AS Val & VSS Vintorez - RaceofHeroes-part2-34 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Integral silencer on [[VSS Vintorez]] sniper rifle and [[AS Val]] assault rifle]]\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]/Russian [[Armor-piercing shot and shell#Small arms|armor-piercing]] [[9\u00d739mm]] ammunition used in rifles such as the [[AS Val]] has a high subsonic [[ballistic coefficient]], high retained downrange energy, high [[sectional density]], and moderate recoil.<ref name=\"Tilstra2014\"/>\n\nWithout using subsonic ammunition, the [[muzzle velocity]] of a supersonic bullet can be lowered by other means, before it leaves the barrel. Some silencer designs, referred to as \"integrals\", do this by allowing gas to bleed off along the length of the barrel before the projectile exits. The [[MP5SD]] is an example of this, with holes right after the chamber of the barrel used to reduce a regular 115 or 124&nbsp;gr ammunition to subsonic velocities.<ref name=\"Heard2011\"/>\n\n==Effectiveness==\n[[File:Silencerco Osprey 9, SWR Octane 45, and Silencerco Saker 5.56.JPG|thumb|Firearm silencers including the SilencerCo Osprey 9, SWR Octane 45, and SilencerCo Saker 5.56]]\n\nLive tests by independent reviewers of numerous commercially available suppressors find that even low-power, unsuppressed .22&nbsp;LR handguns produce gunshots over 160&nbsp;[[decibels]].<ref name=\"results\"/> A recent study of various suppressors reported peak sound pressure level reductions between 17 dB and 24 dB.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=William J.|last2=Flamme|first2=Gregory A.|last3=Campbell|first3=Adam R.|last4=Zechmann|first4=Edward L.|last5=Tasko|first5=Stephen M.|last6=Lankford|first6=James E.|last7=Meinke|first7=Deanna K.|last8=Finan|first8=Donald S.|last9=Stewart|first9=Michael|date=2018-01-26|title=The reduction of gunshot noise and auditory risk through the use of firearm suppressors and low-velocity ammunition|journal=International Journal of Audiology|volume=57|issue=sup1|pages=S28\u2013S41|doi=10.1080/14992027.2017.1407459|issn=1499-2027|pmid=29299940}}</ref> Another study evaluated two calibers of rifle and nine suppressors, .223 caliber [[AR-15 style rifle|AR-15]] (five suppressors) and .300 caliber AAC Blackout (four suppressors), and reported noise reduction of the peak sound level pressure between 7 dB and 32 dB.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lobarinas|first=Edward|last2=Scott|first2=Ryan|last3=Spankovich|first3=Christopher|last4=Prell|first4=Colleen G.

However, the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] uses 140&nbsp;dB as the \"safety cutoff\" for [[impulse noise (audio)|impulsive noise]], which has led most U.S. manufacturers to advertise sub-140&nbsp;dB silencers as \"hearing safe\". Current OSHA standards would allow no more than sub-single-second exposure to impact noise over 130&nbsp;dB per 24 hours. That would equate to a single .308 round fired through a very efficient suppressor. This result effectively requires all users of silencers to wear additional ear protection.\n\nDecibel testing measures only the peak sound \"pressure\" noise, not duration or frequency. Limitations of dB testing become apparent in a comparison of sound between a [[.308 Winchester|.308 caliber]] rifle and a [[.300 Winchester Magnum]] rifle. The dB meter will show that both rifles produce the same decibel level of noise. Upon firing these rifles, however, it is clear that the .300 Winchester Magnum sounds much louder. What a dB meter does not show is that, although both rifles produce the same peak [[sound pressure level]] (SPL), the .300 Winchester Magnum holds its peak duration longer\u2014meaning that the .300 Winchester Magnum sound remains at full value longer, while the .308 peaks and falls off more quickly. Decibel meters fail in this and other regards when being used as the principal means to determine silencer capability. In a physical sense, dB meters essentially take a short-time average ([[Root mean square|RMS]] intensity of a sonic signal or impulse) over a specified period of time (sampling rate), and do not take into account the rate of increase of the sound wave packet (first derivative of packet envelope), which would in practice provide a better sense of the human [[Sound perception|perception of sound]].<ref name=\"AWC\"/>\n\nAlan C.

The [[Nissen fundoplication]], a surgical procedure for the treatment of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], is named after him. Nissen completed the first [[pneumonectomy]] by a Western physician in 1931. In 1948, he performed an abdominal surgery that extended the life of [[Albert Einstein]] by several years. He trained under German physicians [[Ludwig Aschoff]] and [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. Nissen wrote an autobiography published at Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt in 1969 called \u201cHelle Bl\u00e4tter, dunkle Bl\u00e4tter. Erinnerungen eines Chirurgen.\u201c ({{ISBN|978-3421014993}}) which was reviewed in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.<ref name=JACS>{{cite web|title=Review|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_College_of_Surgeons#Publications|publisher=JACS|accessdate=April 12, 2020}}</ref> A selection of his writings and lectures was published at Schattauer in 1997 under the title of \u201cF\u00fcnfzig Jahre erlebter Chirurgie: Ausgew\u00e4hlte Vortr\u00e4ge und Schriften.\u201c ({{ISBN|978-3794506156}}). \n\n==Biography==\nNissen was born in a Jewish-German family in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], [[Silesia]], [[German Empire]], in 1896. He was the son of Franz Nissen, a well-known surgeon. Rudolph Nissen pursued medical studies in [[Munich]], [[Marburg]] and [[Breslau]]. He then trained in pathology under influential physician [[Ludwig Aschoff]] at the [[University of Freiburg]]. During the [[First World War]] he served in a medical corps unit and was severely injured by a gunshot in his lung which led to lifelong problems with his lung. He finished his medical studies after the war. In 1921, he came to the [[University of Munich]] as an assistant to German surgeon [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. Six years later, Sauerbruch and Nissen moved to the [[Charit\u00e9]] at the University of Berlin. In 1933, Nissen became the surgery department head at [[Istanbul University]]. The move was prompted by Hitler's [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|Jewish boycott]],<ref name=Mishra>{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=R. K.|title=Laparoscopic Hernia Repair|year=2012|publisher=JP Medical Ltd.|isbn=9350258722|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3IpfIZv-F4C&pg=PA12}}</ref> although Nissen was at first not directly affected by anti-Jewish legislation because he had been an active World War I front soldier.\n\nNissen left Turkey for the United States in 1939. He was a surgery research fellow at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] for two years. He spent several years in New York as chair of the surgery programs at Jewish Hospital and [[Maimonides Medical Center]]. He was a department head at the [[University of Basel]] from 1952 to his retirement in 1967. He died in 1981 in [[Riehen]].<ref name=Schein>{{cite journal|last=Schein|first=Moshe, Schein, Heidi and Wise, Leslie|title=Rudolf Nissen: The man behind the fundoplication|journal=Surgery|year=1999|volume=125|issue=3|page=347|url=http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/elsevier/rudolf-nissen-the-man-behind-the-fundoplication-vh2IKGqhmH|accessdate=August 10, 2013|doi=10.1016/s0039-6060(99)70248-5}}</ref>\n\n==Surgical contributions==\n\n===Nissen fundoplication===\n[[File:Fundoplicatio nach Nissen Zeichnung.jpg|thumb|right|Nissen fundoplication]]\n{{main article|Nissen fundoplication}}\nWhile in Istanbul in 1936, Nissen excised an esophageal ulcer from a 28-year-old patient. The operation required Nissen to remove a portion of the lower esophagus and join the remaining esophagus to the stomach. In an effort to avoid the backflow of stomach contents into the patient's esophagus, Nissen wrapped (plicated) folds of the patient's upper stomach around the lower esophagus. Following the patient subsequently, Nissen noted that the patient's problems with heartburn improved after surgery.<ref name=Mishra/>\n\nThrough the 1940s and 1950s, Nissen treated many patients with [[hiatal hernia]]s using conventional methods developed by other surgeons. He even performed one of these procedures, an [[gastropexy|anterior gastropexy]], on eminent radiologist [[Gustav Peter Bucky|Gustav Bucky]]. Bucky was very ill when he presented to Nissen, but he completely recovered. Though Bucky remained asymptomatic for at least 15 years, many patients experienced relapses. By 1955, Nissen began to think back on the successful procedure in Istanbul. Now based in Basel, he operated on two patients with [[reflux esophagitis]], wrapping a portion of the stomach around the lower esophagus. He published the results of the two cases in 1956.<ref name=Mishra/>\n\n===Pneumonectomy===\n[[File:Abdominal aortic aneurysm.JPG|thumb|right|Abdominal aortic aneurysm]]\n{{main article|Pneumonectomy}}\nBy training under Sauerbruch, Nissen developed unique skill in surgery of the chest. Through his own mentoring by Polish-Austrian surgeon [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]], Sauerbruch had learned to perform thoracic surgery by use of a pressure chamber before it was possible to give anesthesia to patients through breathing tubes.<ref name=Granderath>{{cite book|last=Granderath, Frank, Kamolz, Thomas, and Pointer|first=Rudolph|title=Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: Principles of Disease, Diagnosis, and Treatment|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=3211323171|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbV09gYB6DkC&pg=PA163}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Nissen treated a 12-year-old girl who had sustained a [[crush injury]] to the chest with chronic pus production from the left lung. Nissen elected to perform left pneumonectomy, or removal of the lung. The first surgery was halted when the patient experienced [[asystole]] (\"flatline\").

The [[Nissen fundoplication]], a surgical procedure for the treatment of [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]], is named after him. Nissen completed the first [[pneumonectomy]] by a Western physician in 1931. In 1948, he performed an abdominal surgery that extended the life of [[Albert Einstein]] by several years. He trained under German physicians [[Ludwig Aschoff]] and [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. Nissen wrote an autobiography published at Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt in 1969 called \u201cHelle Bl\u00e4tter, dunkle Bl\u00e4tter. Erinnerungen eines Chirurgen.\u201c ({{ISBN|978-3421014993}}). A selection of his writings and lectures was published at Schattauer in 1997 under the title of \u201cF\u00fcnfzig Jahre erlebter Chirurgie: Ausgew\u00e4hlte Vortr\u00e4ge und Schriften.\u201c ({{ISBN|978-3794506156}}). \n\n==Biography==\nNissen was born in a Jewish-German family in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]], [[Silesia]], [[German Empire]], in 1896. He was the son of Franz Nissen, a well-known surgeon. Rudolph Nissen pursued medical studies in [[Munich]], [[Marburg]] and [[Breslau]]. He then trained in pathology under influential physician [[Ludwig Aschoff]] at the [[University of Freiburg]]. During the [[First World War]] he served in a medical corps unit and was severely injured by a gunshot in his lung which led to lifelong problems with his lung. He finished his medical studies after the war. In 1921, he came to the [[University of Munich]] as an assistant to German surgeon [[Ferdinand Sauerbruch]]. Six years later, Sauerbruch and Nissen moved to the [[Charit\u00e9]] at the University of Berlin. In 1933, Nissen became the surgery department head at [[Istanbul University]]. The move was prompted by Hitler's [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|Jewish boycott]],<ref name=Mishra>{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=R. K.|title=Laparoscopic Hernia Repair|year=2012|publisher=JP Medical Ltd.|isbn=9350258722|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x3IpfIZv-F4C&pg=PA12}}</ref> although Nissen was at first not directly affected by anti-Jewish legislation because he had been an active World War I front soldier.\n\nNissen left Turkey for the United States in 1939. He was a surgery research fellow at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] for two years. He spent several years in New York as chair of the surgery programs at Jewish Hospital and [[Maimonides Medical Center]]. He was a department head at the [[University of Basel]] from 1952 to his retirement in 1967. He died in 1981 in [[Riehen]].<ref name=Schein>{{cite journal|last=Schein|first=Moshe, Schein, Heidi and Wise, Leslie|title=Rudolf Nissen: The man behind the fundoplication|journal=Surgery|year=1999|volume=125|issue=3|page=347|url=http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/elsevier/rudolf-nissen-the-man-behind-the-fundoplication-vh2IKGqhmH|accessdate=August 10, 2013|doi=10.1016/s0039-6060(99)70248-5}}</ref>\n\n==Surgical contributions==\n\n===Nissen fundoplication===\n[[File:Fundoplicatio nach Nissen Zeichnung.jpg|thumb|right|Nissen fundoplication]]\n{{main article|Nissen fundoplication}}\nWhile in Istanbul in 1936, Nissen excised an esophageal ulcer from a 28-year-old patient. The operation required Nissen to remove a portion of the lower esophagus and join the remaining esophagus to the stomach. In an effort to avoid the backflow of stomach contents into the patient's esophagus, Nissen wrapped (plicated) folds of the patient's upper stomach around the lower esophagus. Following the patient subsequently, Nissen noted that the patient's problems with heartburn improved after surgery.<ref name=Mishra/>\n\nThrough the 1940s and 1950s, Nissen treated many patients with [[hiatal hernia]]s using conventional methods developed by other surgeons. He even performed one of these procedures, an [[gastropexy|anterior gastropexy]], on eminent radiologist [[Gustav Peter Bucky|Gustav Bucky]]. Bucky was very ill when he presented to Nissen, but he completely recovered. Though Bucky remained asymptomatic for at least 15 years, many patients experienced relapses. By 1955, Nissen began to think back on the successful procedure in Istanbul. Now based in Basel, he operated on two patients with [[reflux esophagitis]], wrapping a portion of the stomach around the lower esophagus. He published the results of the two cases in 1956.<ref name=Mishra/>\n\n===Pneumonectomy===\n[[File:Abdominal aortic aneurysm.JPG|thumb|right|Abdominal aortic aneurysm]]\n{{main article|Pneumonectomy}}\nBy training under Sauerbruch, Nissen developed unique skill in surgery of the chest. Through his own mentoring by Polish-Austrian surgeon [[Jan Mikulicz-Radecki]], Sauerbruch had learned to perform thoracic surgery by use of a pressure chamber before it was possible to give anesthesia to patients through breathing tubes.<ref name=Granderath>{{cite book|last=Granderath, Frank, Kamolz, Thomas, and Pointer|first=Rudolph|title=Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: Principles of Disease, Diagnosis, and Treatment|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=3211323171|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wbV09gYB6DkC&pg=PA163}}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Nissen treated a 12-year-old girl who had sustained a [[crush injury]] to the chest with chronic pus production from the left lung. Nissen elected to perform left pneumonectomy, or removal of the lung. The first surgery was halted when the patient experienced [[asystole]] (\"flatline\").
