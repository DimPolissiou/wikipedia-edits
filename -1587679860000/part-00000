He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.\n\nSusemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\n[[File:U.D.O.-performing-live-at-Norway-Rock-Festival-2009.JPG|210px|thumb|left|U.D.O. performing live at [[Norway Rock Festival]] in 2009]]\nIn 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist J\u00fcrgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song \"Metal Gods\".\n\nOn 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single \"Love Machine\". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.\n\nThe seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing J\u00fcrgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and \"Private Eye\", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song \"Dancing with an Angel\", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.

He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.\n\nSusemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\n[[File:U.D.O.-performing-live-at-Norway-Rock-Festival-2009.JPG|210px|thumb|left|U.D.O. performing live at [[Norway Rock Festival]] in 2009]]\nIn 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist J\u00fcrgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song \"Metal Gods\".\n\nOn 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single \"Love Machine\". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.\n\nThe seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing J\u00fcrgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and \"Private Eye\", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song \"Dancing with an Angel\", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.

While transistor count increases according to [[Moore's law]], overall performance rises only very slowly. According to Lanier, this is because human productivity in developing software increases only slightly, and software becomes more bloated and remains as error-prone as it ever was. \"Simply put, software just won't allow it. Code can't keep up with processing power now, and it never will.\"<ref name=Salon>{{Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/10/04/lanier/|title=Artificial Stupidity |last=Cave |first=Daniel |date=October 4, 2000|publisher=salon.com|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>\nAt the end he warns that the biggest problem of any theory (esp. ideology) is not that it is false, \"but when it claims to be the sole and utterly complete path to understanding life and reality.\" The impression of objective necessity paralyzes the ability of humans to walk out of or to fight the paradigm and causes the self-fulfilling destiny which spoils people.\n\n===Post-symbolic communication (2006)===\nSome of Lanier's speculation involves what he calls \"post-symbolic communication.\" In his April 2006 ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine column, he writes about [[cephalopod]]s (i.e., the various species of [[octopus]], [[squid]], and related [[mollusc]]s), many of which are able to [[morph (zoology)|morph]] their bodies, including changing the pigmentation and texture of their skin, as well as forming complex shape imitations with their limbs.

We might be genetically wired to be vulnerable to the lure of the mob. ... What's to stop an online mass of anonymous but connected people from suddenly turning into a mean mob, just like masses of people have time and time again in the history of every human culture? It's amazing that details in the design of online software can bring out such varied potentials in human behavior. It's time to think about that power on a moral basis.</blockquote>\n\nLanier argues that the search for deeper information in any area sooner or later requires that you find information that has been produced by a single person, or a few devoted individuals: \"You have to have a chance to sense personality in order for language to have its full meaning.\"<ref name=\"EdgeBeware\" /> That is, he sees limitations in the utility of an encyclopedia produced by only partially interested third parties as a form of communication.\n\n=== ''You Are Not a Gadget'' (2010) ===\n\nIn his book ''You Are Not a Gadget'' (2010), Lanier criticizes what he perceives as the hive mind of Web 2.0 ([[wisdom of the crowd]]) and describes the [[Open-source model|open source]] and [[open content]] expropriation of intellectual production as a form of \"Digital Maoism\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Kakutani |first=Michiko |title=A Rebel in Cyberspace, Fighting Collectivism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/books/15book.html|accessdate=2 December 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> Lanier accuses Web 2.0 developments of devaluing progress and innovation, as well as glorifying the collective at the expense of the individual. He criticizes Wikipedia and [[Linux]] as examples of this problem; Wikipedia for what he sees as: its \"mob rule\" by anonymous editors, the weakness of its non-scientific content, and [[Criticism of Wikipedia|its bullying of experts]]. \n\nLanier also argues that there are limitations to certain aspects of the open source and content movement in that they lack the ability to create anything truly new and innovative. For example, Lanier argues that the open source movement didn't create the iPhone. In another example, Lanier further accuses Web 2.0 of making search engines lazy, destroying the potential of innovative websites like [[Thinkquest]], and hampering the communication of ideas like mathematics to a wider audience. \n\nLanier further argues that the open source approach has destroyed opportunities for the middle class to finance content creation, and results in the concentration of wealth in a few individuals\u2014\"the lords of the clouds\"\u2014people who, more by virtue of luck rather than true innovation, manage to insert themselves as content concentrators at strategic times and locations in the cloud. In the book, Lanier also criticizes the [[MIDI]] Standard for musical instrument commonality.{{page needed|date=December 2019}} His comments brought rebukes from industry and artists knowledgeable of the standard and suggestions that Lanier published his comments merely as bait for debate{{Citation needed|reason=Where are these rebukes?|date=January 2018}}.\n\n=== ''Who Owns the Future?'' (2013) ===\n\nIn his book ''[[Who Owns the Future?]]'' (2013), Lanier posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies.  By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms \"Siren Servers,\" alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. \n\nFor example, he points to Google's translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. In another example, Lanier points out that in 1988, [[Kodak]] employed 140,000 people when it led the digital imaging industry. By 2012, Kodak had filed for bankruptcy due to free photo-sharing sites such as Instagram which employed only 13 people at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/books/2013/05/jaron_lanier_s_who_owns_the_future_review_facebookers_of_the_world_unite.html|title=Slate Book Review: Facebookers of the World, Unite!|author=Will Oremus|date=2013-05-03|work=Salon}}</ref>\n\nAs a solution to these problems, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson's [[Project Xanadu]]. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.\n\n=== ''Dawn of the New Everything'' (2017) ===\nIn his book ''Dawn of the New Everything: Encounters with Reality and Virtual Reality'' (2017), Lanier reflects on his upbringing in 1960s New Mexico, his lifelong relationship with technology, and his path to Silicon Valley. Part personal memoir and part rumination on virtual reality, Lanier highlights VR's versatility both in historical context and projects its functions into the future. \n\nLanier writes of VR's capacity to engage and inspire more than any other kind of technology (\"TV and video games draw people into a zombielike trance ... while VR is active and makes you tired after a while\"). He writes that the older, poorer VR equipment might have done an even better job at exposing one's own process of perception, since \"the best enjoyment of VR includes not really being convinced. Like when you go to a magic show.\" And he underscores how VR inherently helps the user focus on reality, rather than the virtual world, explaining that the best magic of VR happens in the moments right after the demo ends (his lab would often present flowers to visitors coming out of the headset, as the visitor would experience them as though for the first time). \n\nLanier cites modern VR's rich resume beyond gaming and entertainment: it has been used to treat war veterans overcoming PTSD; by doctors to perform intricate surgeries; by paraplegics wanting to feel the sense of flight; and as a mechanism to prototype almost every vehicle fabricated in the last two decades. Throughout the book Lanier intersperses fifty-one definitions of VR, illuminating its many uses, gifts, and pitfalls.\n\n=== ''Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now (2018)'' ===\nAs the name implies Lanier is concerned about the influence of social media and many of his criticisms of social media will feel familiar to observers of American politics and culture. In essence the claim is that platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have made us cruder, less empathetic, more tribal.  Lanier worries that our reliance on social media platforms is reducing our capacity for spirituality, that we are in essence turning into automated extensions of the platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/books/review/jaron-lanier-ten-arguments-for-deleting-your-social-media-accounts-right-now.html|title=Click 'Delete' to Save Your Soul|last=Foer|first=Franklin|date=2018-06-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{update section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Jaron lanier.JPG|thumb|left|Lanier performing at the Garden of Memory Solstice Concert in June, 2009]]\nAs a musician, Lanier has been active in the world of [[Contemporary classical music|new classical]] music since the late 1970s.

The Initiative demonstrated the first prototypes of [[tele-immersion]] in 2000 after a three-year development period. From 2001 to 2004, he was Visiting Scientist at [[Silicon Graphics]] Inc., where he developed solutions to core problems in [[telepresence]] and tele-immersion. He was also visiting scholar with the [[Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science#Computer Science|Department of Computer Science at Columbia University]] (1997\u20132001), a visiting artist with [[New York University]]'s [[Interactive Telecommunications Program]], and a founding member of the International Institute for Evolution and the Brain.<ref>{{cite web |last=McKenna |first=Barbara |title=Talking technology: A Q&A with the inventor of virtual reality|publisher=[[UC Santa Cruz]], Currents|date=2000-01-10|url=http://currents.ucsc.edu/99-00/01-10/lanier.html|accessdate=2008-01-09}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nJaron Lanier has one child, a daughter with his wife Lena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/07/11/the-visionary|title=Jaron Lanier, Visionary and Skeptic|first=Jennifer|last=Kahn|date=July 4, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2019|via=www.newyorker.com}}</ref>\n\n==Selected list of works in prose==\n\n=== \"One-Half of a Manifesto\" (2000) ===\n\nIn \"One-Half a Manifesto\", Lanier criticizes the claims made by writers such as [[Ray Kurzweil]], and opposes the prospect of so-called \"cybernetic totalism\", which is \"a cataclysm brought on when computers become ultra-intelligent masters of matter and life.\"<ref name=Edge1>{{Cite news|url=http://www.edge.org/conversation/one-half-a-manifesto|last=Lanier|title=One-Half a Manifesto |first=Jaron|date=November 10, 2000|publisher=edge.org|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Wired>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.12/lanier.html|title=One-Half of a Manifesto |last=Lanier|first=Jaron|date=December 2000|publisher=wired.com|accessdate=July 13, 2013}}</ref> Lanier's position is that humans may not be considered to be biological computers, i.e., they may not be compared to digital computers in any proper sense, and it is very unlikely that humans could be generally replaced by computers easily in a few decades, even economically. While transistor count increases according to [[Moore's law]], overall performance rises only very slowly. According to Lanier, this is because human productivity in developing software increases only slightly, and software becomes more bloated and remains as error-prone as it ever was. \"Simply put, software just won't allow it. Code can't keep up with processing power now, and it never will.\"<ref name=Salon>{{Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/10/04/lanier/|title=Artificial Stupidity |last=Cave |first=Daniel |date=October 4, 2000|publisher=salon.com|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}</ref>\nAt the end he warns that the biggest problem of any theory (esp. ideology) is not that it is false, \"but when it claims to be the sole and utterly complete path to understanding life and reality.\" The impression of objective necessity paralyzes the ability of humans to walk out of or to fight the paradigm and causes the self-fulfilling destiny which spoils people.\n\n===Post-symbolic communication (2006)===\nSome of Lanier's speculation involves what he calls \"post-symbolic communication.\" In his April 2006 ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine column, he writes about [[cephalopod]]s (i.e., the various species of [[octopus]], [[squid]], and related [[mollusc]]s), many of which are able to [[morph (zoology)|morph]] their bodies, including changing the pigmentation and texture of their skin, as well as forming complex shape imitations with their limbs.

We might be genetically wired to be vulnerable to the lure of the mob. ... What's to stop an online mass of anonymous but connected people from suddenly turning into a mean mob, just like masses of people have time and time again in the history of every human culture? It's amazing that details in the design of online software can bring out such varied potentials in human behavior. It's time to think about that power on a moral basis.</blockquote>\n\nLanier argues that the search for deeper information in any area sooner or later requires that you find information that has been produced by a single person, or a few devoted individuals: \"You have to have a chance to sense personality in order for language to have its full meaning.\"<ref name=\"EdgeBeware\" /> That is, he sees limitations in the utility of an encyclopedia produced by only partially interested third parties as a form of communication.\n\n=== ''You Are Not a Gadget'' (2010) ===\n\nIn his book ''You Are Not a Gadget'' (2010), Lanier criticizes what he perceives as the hive mind of Web 2.0 ([[wisdom of the crowd]]) and describes the [[Open-source model|open source]] and [[open content]] expropriation of intellectual production as a form of \"Digital Maoism\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Kakutani |first=Michiko |title=A Rebel in Cyberspace, Fighting Collectivism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/15/books/15book.html|accessdate=2 December 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> Lanier accuses Web 2.0 developments of devaluing progress and innovation, as well as glorifying the collective at the expense of the individual. He criticizes Wikipedia and [[Linux]] as examples of this problem; Wikipedia for what he sees as: its \"mob rule\" by anonymous editors, the weakness of its non-scientific content, and [[Criticism of Wikipedia|its bullying of experts]]. \n\nLanier also argues that there are limitations to certain aspects of the open source and content movement in that they lack the ability to create anything truly new and innovative. For example, Lanier argues that the open source movement didn't create the iPhone. In another example, Lanier further accuses Web 2.0 of making search engines lazy, destroying the potential of innovative websites like [[Thinkquest]], and hampering the communication of ideas like mathematics to a wider audience. \n\nLanier further argues that the open source approach has destroyed opportunities for the middle class to finance content creation, and results in the concentration of wealth in a few individuals\u2014\"the lords of the clouds\"\u2014people who, more by virtue of luck rather than true innovation, manage to insert themselves as content concentrators at strategic times and locations in the cloud. In the book, Lanier also criticizes the [[MIDI]] Standard for musical instrument commonality.{{page needed|date=December 2019}} His comments brought rebukes from industry and artists knowledgeable of the standard and suggestions that Lanier published his comments merely as bait for debate{{Citation needed|reason=Where are these rebukes?|date=January 2018}}.\n\n=== ''Who Owns the Future'' (2013) ===\n\nIn his book ''[[Who Owns the Future?]]'' (2013), Lanier posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies.  By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms \"Siren Servers,\" alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. \n\nFor example, he points to Google's translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. In another example, Lanier points out that in 1988, [[Kodak]] employed 140,000 people when it led the digital imaging industry. By 2012, Kodak had filed for bankruptcy due to free photo-sharing sites such as Instagram which employed only 13 people at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/books/2013/05/jaron_lanier_s_who_owns_the_future_review_facebookers_of_the_world_unite.html|title=Slate Book Review: Facebookers of the World, Unite!|author=Will Oremus|date=2013-05-03|work=Salon}}</ref>\n\nAs a solution to these problems, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson's [[Project Xanadu]]. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.\n\n=== ''Dawn of the New Everything'' (2017) ===\nIn his book ''Dawn of the New Everything: Encounters with Reality and Virtual Reality'' (2017), Lanier reflects on his upbringing in 1960s New Mexico, his lifelong relationship with technology, and his path to Silicon Valley. Part personal memoir and part rumination on virtual reality, Lanier highlights VR's versatility both in historical context and projects its functions into the future. \n\nLanier writes of VR's capacity to engage and inspire more than any other kind of technology (\"TV and video games draw people into a zombielike trance ... while VR is active and makes you tired after a while\"). He writes that the older, poorer VR equipment might have done an even better job at exposing one's own process of perception, since \"the best enjoyment of VR includes not really being convinced. Like when you go to a magic show.\" And he underscores how VR inherently helps the user focus on reality, rather than the virtual world, explaining that the best magic of VR happens in the moments right after the demo ends (his lab would often present flowers to visitors coming out of the headset, as the visitor would experience them as though for the first time). \n\nLanier cites modern VR's rich resume beyond gaming and entertainment: it has been used to treat war veterans overcoming PTSD; by doctors to perform intricate surgeries; by paraplegics wanting to feel the sense of flight; and as a mechanism to prototype almost every vehicle fabricated in the last two decades. Throughout the book Lanier intersperses fifty-one definitions of VR, illuminating its many uses, gifts, and pitfalls.\n\n=== ''Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now (2018)'' ===\nAs the name implies Lanier is concerned about the influence of social media and many of his criticisms of social media will feel familiar to observers of American politics and culture. In essence the claim is that platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have made us cruder, less empathetic, more tribal.  Lanier worries that our reliance on social media platforms is reducing our capacity for spirituality, that we are in essence turning into automated extensions of the platforms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/books/review/jaron-lanier-ten-arguments-for-deleting-your-social-media-accounts-right-now.html|title=Click 'Delete' to Save Your Soul|last=Foer|first=Franklin|date=2018-06-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-04-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{update section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Jaron lanier.JPG|thumb|left|Lanier performing at the Garden of Memory Solstice Concert in June, 2009]]\nAs a musician, Lanier has been active in the world of [[Contemporary classical music|new classical]] music since the late 1970s.
