Ovechkin has denied that version of events, while Malkin confirmed it. On 21 January 2008, in Pittsburgh, Ovechkin took a run at Malkin, which would have seemingly resulted in a devastating hit had Malkin not ducked out of the way just in time. The two would also not make eye contact at the 2008 NHL Awards Ceremony. Ovechkin has repeatedly denied \"having it out\" for Malkin.<ref name=\"Ovechkin/Malkin Feud\" />\n\nThe feud raised many concerns as to its effect on the league,<ref name=\"Ovechkin/Malkin Feud\" /> and the Russian national team at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.canadaeast.com/qmjhl/article/article/539330|title=Ovechkin Malkin feud turns nasty|date=14 January 2009|accessdate=3 February 2009|agency=Associated Press}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> On 24 January 2009, at the [[NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition|SuperSkills Competition]], Malkin assisted Ovechkin in his stunt during the [[NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition#Breakaway Challenge|Breakaway Challenge]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/penguins/s_608711.html|title=Malkin, Ovechkin put feud to rest|date=25 January 2009|work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=3 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203132149/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/penguins/s_608711.html|archivedate=3 February 2009|url-status=dead|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Malkin handed Ovechkin his props for the stunt as well as handing him his stick and pouring some sports drink down Ovechkin's throat.

A highly touted prospect, Ovechkin was selected by the Capitals first overall in the [[2004 NHL Entry Draft]].

It was [[epicenter|centered]] near the city of [[Muzaffarabad]], and also affected Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province and Indian-administered [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. It registered a [[moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 7.6 and had a maximum [[Modified Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of VIII (''Severe''). The earthquake also affected countries in the surrounding region where tremors were felt in [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]] and [[China|Chinese]] [[Xinjiang]]. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. It is considered the [[Lists_of_earthquakes#Deadliest_earthquakes|deadliest earthquake]] to hit [[South Asia]] since the [[1935 Quetta earthquake]].<ref name=\"Dawn_Quetta_2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/10/25/fea.htm|title=The great Quetta tragedy|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN Newspaper]]|date=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Earthquake==\nKashmir lies in the area of collision of the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[India Plate|Indian tectonic plates]]. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable [[seismicity]] in the region. The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the [[moment magnitude scale]], with its epicentre about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad.\n\n===Damage===\n[[File:earthquake Information for Pakistan.png|thumb|left|Map depicting regional tectonic plates]]\n\nMost of the devastation hit north Pakistan and [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]]. In Kashmir, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad.  Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.\n\nThe Pakistani government's official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could reach over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.\n\nAs Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck.  Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. Many people were also trapped in their homes and, because it was the month of [[Ramadan]], most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.\n\n[[File:USGS Shakemap - 2005 Kashmir earthquake.jpg|thumb|USGS Shakemap for the event]]\n\n:\"...a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now\", [[Kofi Annan]] said on 20 October with reference to the thousand remote villages in which people are in need of medical attention, food, clean water and shelter and the 120,000 survivors that have not yet been reached.\"<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1835627,00.html \"Thousands at risk of starving in earthquake aid shortfall\"] ''The Times'', 21 October 2005.

Four deaths were reported in [[Afghanistan]], including a young girl who died in [[Jalalabad]], after a wall collapsed on her. The quake was felt in [[Kabul]], but the effects were minimal there.\n\n===Aftershocks===\nThere were many secondary earthquakes in the region, mainly to the northwest of the original epicentre. A series of strong aftershocks occurred near [[Muzaffarabad]].<ref>[http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/pak-in-panic-as-quake-rocks-kashmir/153050 \"Pak in panic as quake rocks Kashmir\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208171252/http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/pak-in-panic-as-quake-rocks-kashmir/153050 |date=8 December 2015 }} Reuters, ''The Financial Express'', 19 October 2005.

In the initial phases of response, the Pakistan Medical corps, Corps of Engineers, Army aviation and a large number of infantry units played important roles. Lt. Gen Afzal, Maj. Gen. Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj. Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co-ordination. The relief work in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and [[Jaipal Singh]]. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international [[NGO]]s with high pay scales. The rest of the money pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called [[Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority]], which was made by then military regime to accommodate retired high military officials and while keeping the command of the reconstruction and rehabilitation authority directly under the military. The basic infrastructure, including tertiary care, health, education, road networks, water supply, waste management and other basic needs, was still underdeveloped and had not reached pre-earthquake status in the region.\n\nWell over [[United States dollar|US$]] 5.4 billion (400 billion [[Pakistani rupee]]s)<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pakistan Earthquake of October 2005: A Reminder of Human-Science Interaction in Natural Disasters Risk Management |author=Amr S.

It is considered the [[Lists_of_earthquakes#Deadliest_earthquakes|deadliest earthquake]] to hit [[South Asia]] since the [[1935 Quetta earthquake]].<ref name=\"Dawn_Quetta_2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/2005/10/25/fea.htm|title=The great Quetta tragedy|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN Newspaper]]|date=25 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Earthquake==\nKashmir lies in the area of collision of the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[India Plate|Indian tectonic plates]]. The geological activity born out of this collision, also responsible for the birth of the Himalayan mountain range, is the cause of unstable [[seismicity]] in the region. The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) measured its magnitude as a minimum of 7.6 on the [[moment magnitude scale]], with its epicentre about {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of the national capital Islamabad.\n\n===Damage===\n[[File:earthquake Information for Pakistan.png|thumb|left|Map depicting regional tectonic plates]]\n\nMost of the devastation hit north Pakistan and [[Pakistan administered Kashmir]]. In Kashmir, the three main districts were badly affected and Muzaffarabad, the state capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, was hardest hit in terms of casualties and destruction. Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad.  Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.\n\nThe Pakistani government's official death toll as of November 2005 stood at 87,350 although it is estimated that the death toll could reach over 100,000. Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.\n\nAs Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck.  Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. Many people were also trapped in their homes and, because it was the month of [[Ramadan]], most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.\n\n[[File:USGS Shakemap - 2005 Kashmir earthquake.jpg|thumb|USGS Shakemap for the event]]\n\n:\"...a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now\", [[Kofi Annan]] said on 20 October with reference to the thousand remote villages in which people are in need of medical attention, food, clean water and shelter and the 120,000 survivors that have not yet been reached.\"<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1835627,00.html \"Thousands at risk of starving in earthquake aid shortfall\"] ''The Times'', 21 October 2005.

Four deaths were reported in [[Afghanistan]], including a young girl who died in [[Jalalabad]], after a wall collapsed on her. The quake was felt in [[Kabul]], but the effects were minimal there.\n\n===Aftershocks===\nThere were many secondary earthquakes in the region, mainly to the northwest of the original epicentre.

In the initial phases of response, the Pakistan Medical corps, Corps of Engineers, Army aviation and a large number of infantry units played important roles. Lt. Gen Afzal, Maj. Gen. Imtiaz, and Maj. Gen Javid were the leaders of their formations. Maj. Gen Farrukh Seir was in charge of foreign relief co-ordination. The relief work in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] was led by IAS officers of the state administration, Bashir Runyal and [[Jaipal Singh]]. In early 2006, the Government of Pakistan organized a donors' conference to raise money for reconstruction and development of the area. A total of $6.2 billion was pledged and a large amount of the money was delivered in terms of services of international [[NGO]]s with high pay scales. The rest of the money pledged, which was given to the Government of Pakistan for reconstruction and development, was used by a reconstruction authority called [[Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority]], which was made by then military regime to accommodate retired high military officials and while keeping the command of the reconstruction and rehabilitation authority directly under the military. The basic infrastructure, including tertiary care, health, education, road networks, water supply, waste management and other basic needs, was still underdeveloped and had not reached pre-earthquake status in the region.\n\nWell over [[United States dollar|US$]] 5.4 billion (400 billion [[Pakistani rupee]]s)<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pakistan Earthquake of October 2005: A Reminder of Human-Science Interaction in Natural Disasters Risk Management |author=Amr S.

Two black men had been arrested as suspects in a rape, and attempted rape and murder. The alleged victims were two young white women and the father of one of them. When a mob seeking to lynch the men discovered the sheriff had transferred them out of the city, the whites furiously spread out to attack black neighborhoods, murdered black citizens on the streets, and destroyed black businesses and homes.  The state militia was called out to quell the rioting.\n\nThe riot, trials and aftermath are said to be one of the most well-documented examples<!-- Did both sources say this? that would be unusual --> of the complex intersection of race, class, and criminal justice in the United States.<ref name=Complex>{{cite book|title=In Lincoln's Shadow: the Springfield, Illinois, Race Riot of 1908|last=Senechal de la Roche|first=Roberta|publisher=Southern Illinois University|year=2008|page=10}}</ref><ref name=SoCalled>{{cite journal|title=The So-Called Race Riot at Springfield, Illinois|journal=Charities and the Commons|location=New York, NY|volume=XX|year=1908|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101066882646;view=1up;seq=729|pages=709\u2013711}}</ref>  In 2008 an [[NPR]] report on the centenary of the race riot said that the fact of its taking place in a Northern state, specifically in \"[[Emancipation Proclamation|The Land of Lincoln]]\", demonstrated that blacks were mistreated across the country, not just in the South, and described the event as a proxy for the story of race in America.<ref name=USstory>{{cite news|author=Cheryl Corley|title=Springfield, Ill., Marks Centenary Of Riots|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93606402|date=14 Aug 2008|publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref>\n\nAt least sixteen people died as a result of the riot: nine black residents, and seven white residents who were associated with the mob, five of whom were killed by state militia and two committed [[suicide]].

Many newspapers claimed that more 2,000 fled; which might have been likely during the attack and its immediate aftermath.

Shall men coldbloodedly stand up and demand for him the right to have a fair trial and be punished in the regular course of justice? So far as I am concerned he has put himself outside the pale of the law, human and divine...\n\nI have three daughters, but, so help me God, I had rather find either one of them killed by a tiger or a bear and gather up her bones and bury them, conscious that she had died in the purity of her maidenhood, than have her crawl to me and tell me the horrid story that she had been robbed of the jewel of her womanhood by a black fiend. The wild beast would only obey the instinct of nature, and we would hunt him down and kill him just as soon as possible. What shall we do with a man who has outbruted the brute and committed an act which is more cruel than death? Try him? Drag the victim into court, for she alone can furnish legal evidence, and make her testify to the fearful ordeal through which she has passed, undergoing a second crucifixion?  Our rule is to make the woman witness, prosecutor, judge, and jury...I am satisfied to get out of the world such creatures.}}\n\nIn the period after the end of Reconstruction, approximately 1897-1917, lynchings coincided with mass [[Lynching in the United States#Disenfranchisement (1877\u20131917)|disenfranchisement]] efforts throughout the country.

With the rising population of immigrants in urban centers, more immigrants began frequenting saloons.

For example, between May\u2013June 1907, neighboring [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]] had nearly 70 arrests for drunkenness.<ref name=Decatur>{{cite news|title=Only 14 Arrests for Drunkenness|newspaper=The Decatur Herald|location=Decatur, Illinois|date=8 Jun 1908}}</ref>  However, one year later, after Decatur had become \"dry,\" it had 80 percent fewer drinking arrests, and every man who had been arrested for drunkenness had obtained his liquor in Springfield.<ref name=Decatur/>\n\nThe drinking culture of Springfield fed into the pending attacks in two ways.  First, though Springfield was somewhat sheltered from the sluggish economy, the Panic did leave more men unemployed or underemployed.  Second, many of these men would frequent the saloons, where they would drink daily, binge drink, and abuse alcohol due to mental strain, financial pressure, shame and a feeling of helplessness that they were unable to protect, and provide, for their families.<ref name=Drinking>{{cite journal |author1=Ioana Popovici |author2=Michael T.

([[Belvidere, Illinois]]) 8 Oct 1907]]\nNewspapers were filled with reports of hostility and violence against blacks.

Immediately after Ballard's death, newspapers added his death \"to the long list of bloody murders which have stained the history of Springfield.<ref name=Burglar/> For example, on the day James first appeared before the special grand jury, his case was one of two murder cases brought to them. The other case was one of whites killing a white: Ira Dudley and Michael Lynch, a white livery driver and white miner, were both charged with the July 2 murder of Marcus Neil, when they allegedly hit him over the head with a club and fractured his skull.<ref name=Special/><ref name=LifeSentence/>\n\nSuch violence continued in the aftermath of the riot, further heightening tensions.<ref name=PreAttack1>{{cite news|title=Abuses Existed: Cruelty Shown by Authorities at Lincoln Institution for Feeble Minded|date=18 Jan 1908|newspaper=The Rock Island Argus and Daily Union|location=Rock Island, Illinois}}</ref><ref name=PreAttack2>{{cite news|title=Acquitted of Murder|date=14 Mar 1908|newspaper=Belvidere Daily Republican|location=Belvidere, Illinois}}</ref><ref name=Robbers>{{cite news|title=Springfield Fested with Bold Robbersy|date=18 Dec 1907|newspaper=The Decatur Herald}}</ref> On August 23, one week after the riot, Thomas Brady, a 70-year-old white man, was murdered in his sleep at his store on East Washington Street, where the riot had been intense.<ref name=Grady>{{cite news|title=Springfield Has Another Murder: Aged Man Killed with an Ax and His Room Mate Suspected, First Laid to a Negro, Caused Talk of More Riots and Blacks Again Became Uneasy|date=25 Aug 1908|newspaper=The Decatur Herald}}</ref><ref name=Grady/>  Although Grady's 26-year-old white employee, Frank Bryant, was guilty of the crime, prior to his capture, rumors circulated that Grady had been murdered by a black man.<ref name=Grady/>  The black population feared becoming targets again of whites on no evidence.<ref name=Grady/>\n\nThe riot violence spread beyond Springfield: whites in surrounding states arbitrarily attacked blacks in their towns.  For example, on August 16, a black man, George Mondie, was walking in [[Evansville, Indiana]], when he passed two white men discussing the riot in Springfield.

Aug 1908]]\n[[File:Billy Sunday Views.jpg|thumb|''Decatur Herald''. 19 Aug 1908]]\nThe whites of Springfield largely came to support the riot, and eventually showed sympathy for the attackers. Whites talked about how \"everybody knows that mob has made our families safe,\" boasting that the attacks were \"the best thing that ever happened to the Capital City,\" and celebrating that \"this was only the beginning of a crusade that shall make Springfield decent and keep it that way\":<ref name=Safe/><ref name=BestThingEver>{{cite news|title=Makes the Bad Lands Safe|date=18 Aug 1908|newspaper=The Decatur Herald}}</ref><ref name=Decent>{{cite news|title=Springfield Scum Driven to Winds|date=28 Aug 1908|newspaper=The Decatur Herald}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...\"Springfield had no shame.

This also meant that blacks were abruptly deprived of casual neighborhood gathering places.<ref name=Saloons/> Lee F.

For example, three coal mines, including Woodside and Tuxhorn, employed approximately 500 men, of which 30 percent were black.  Following the attacks, the 350 white miners went to the president of the Springfield United Mine Workers union, refusing to work with black miners, stating that they felt \"unsafe\" working with blacks underground.<ref name=Miners/><ref name=Miners2>{{cite news|title=Another Mine Closed|date=20 Aug 1908|newspaper=The Pantagraph |location=Bloomington, Illinois}}</ref>  The mines shut down for several days, only re-opening when mine executives threatened to bring in black strikebreakers if the white miners did not resume work.  Several other white employers also received letters in the mail, threatening their lives and property, if they did not dismiss their black employees or if they did business with blacks.<ref name=Indictments3/>\n\nBecause merchants refused to deliver provisions to blacks at Camp Lincoln, hesitated to serve blacks in town, or overcharged them when they did, the state purchased $10,000 (over $250,000 in 2018) worth of groceries to re-sell to blacks so they could have food.<ref name=Indy/><ref name=HallamFree/><ref name=Groceries>{{cite news|title=Ask Far to Other Towns|date=22 Aug 1908|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><ref name=FareRequest>{{cite news|title=Indicts Six More on Riots Charges: Ask Fare to Other Towns|date=28 Aug 1908|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|location=Chicago, Illinois}}</ref>\n\n====Social and political effects====\nWhite men immediately galvanized around the notion of restricting blacks from voting. From 1890 to 1908 legislatures of southern states had passed new constitutions and laws that raised barriers to voter registration, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising most blacks]] and excluding them from politics. This policy was enforced for decades, into the late 1960s.\n\nLocal discussions were similarly overt in intent:\n\n{{quote|The male citizen of the black belt in late years has come to pose as a political factor in Springfield.

Critical reactions toward the episode were largely positive, with reviewers praising the writing, acting and direction. The episode sparked controversy for showing the character of Irene Adler in the nude; carefully using camera angles to avoid exposing private areas, [[Watershed (television)|pre-watershed]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n\nContinuing the ending of [[The Great Game (Sherlock) | The Great Game]], [[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes| Sherlock Holmes]] ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) and [[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson | John Watson]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) are confronting [[List of Sherlock characters#James 'Jim' Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]).\nMoriarty intends at first to kill them, but as a phone call interrupts, he changes his mind, and dismisses the snipers.\n\nHolmes has become a minor celebrity after Watson blogs about the cases they solved.\nOne day, Holmes and Watson are brought to meet [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] ([[Mark Gatiss]]) in [[Buckingham Palace]].\nMycroft reveals that [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), took compromising photographs of herself and a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]].\nThe authority wants to retrieve Adler's [[smartphone]], which contains those photographs.\nHolmes and Watson try to get into Adler's home by deception, but she has been expecting them. Holmes meets Adler stark naked leaving him unable to deduce anything about her. \n\nAs Watson deliberately triggers the fire alarm, Holmes finds Adler's hidden safe, which Adler has glanced at nervously.\nSuddenly several [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operatives led by Neilson ([[Todd Boyce]]) break into the house and demand that Holmes open the safe.\nHolmes solves the password, and in subsequent chaos, some agents are killed, Holmes gets the phone first, and Adler then sedates Holmes, takes the phone instead, and escapes.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Holmes learns via text message that Adler has sent him her phone.\nConsidering the phone's importance, Holmes thinks she might die soon.\nIndeed, the police find a mutilated body, identified to be Adler.\n\nLater, on New Year's Eve, Watson is taken to see Adler, who is alive and faked her death.\nHolmes followed them and learns this, too.\nMeanwhile, Neilson's team holds [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] ([[Una Stubbs]]) hostage, and Holmes subdues Neilson.\nAdler comes, and reveals that she is still being hunted.\nShe asks Holmes to decipher a code stolen from [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]].\nSherlock effortlessly cracks it, revealing it to be [[airline seat]] allocation numbers. Adler conveys this information to Moriarty, who taunts Mycroft Holmes that he (Moriarty) now knows their plan.\n\nA government official brings Holmes to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].\nMycroft confirms that the government had planned to fly a plane full of corpses, so as not to alert the terrorists planning to bomb the plane that they know of their plans, reminiscent of the [[Coventry myth]].\nHowever, as Holmes unwittingly helped Adler (and thus Moriarty) crack the code, the scheme was foiled.\nAdler reveals a list of demands to Mycroft, including protection, in exchange for the contents of her phone.\nHowever, Holmes figures out the unlocking password to be \"SHER\", so that words on the screen together reads \"I AM SHER-LOCKED\".\nNow without her leverage, Adler pleads for protection, but Sherlock and Mycroft turn her down.\n\nSome months later, Mycroft informs Watson that Adler has been killed by terrorists, but intends to tell Holmes instead that she has entered a [[witness protection]] programme in America.\nHolmes asks for Adler's phone, and says that Adler's last text message was \"Goodbye, Mr Holmes\", suggesting her death.\nAfter Watson leaves, in the flashback it is shown that Holmes was disguised as the executioner and had rescued Adler.\n\n==Sources and allusions==\n[[File:Statue of Sherlock Holmes in Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sherlock Holmes in [[Edinburgh]]. \"A Scandal in Belgravia\" alludes to this 'classic' image of Holmes created by illustrator [[Sidney Paget]].]]\nThe episode is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's short story \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", and also alludes to several other adventures.<ref name=\"wollaston\"/><ref name=\"crompton\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8987577/The-timeless-appeal-of-Holmess-sexy-logic.html|title=The timeless appeal of Holmes's sexy logic|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=1 January 2012|first=Sarah|last=Crompton |accessdate=5 January 2012|location=London}}</ref> There are humorous references to numerous famous Holmes stories, such as \"[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter|The Greek Interpreter]]\" (in this episode, the \"Geek Interpreter\"),<ref name=\"RT\" /> \"[[The Adventure of the Speckled Band|The Speckled Band]]\" (in the episode, the \"Speckled Blonde\"),<ref name=\"crompton\"/> \"[[The Adventure of the Naval Treaty|The Naval Treaty]]\" (in the episode, \"The Navel Treatment\"), \"[[The Adventure of the Illustrious Client|The Illustrious Client]]\" and \"[[The Adventure of the Priory School|The Priory School]]\".

Although Chater's playing is on the actual soundtrack, Cumberbatch was required to appear to be an expert violinist. To achieve this, Chater was positioned on set so that she could synchronise her playing with his. She says, \"On set I need to see him; to play when he lifts his violin and stop when he stops. And he needs to see me; to copy my bowings, to ghost what I'm doing.

It was written by co-creator [[Steven Moffat]], and directed by [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]]. The episode was based on \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", a short story by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].\n\nThe episode depicts Sherlock Holmes' ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) confrontation with [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), a [[dominatrix]] who has compromising photographs taken with a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]]. The photographs are stored inside her [[mobile phone]], along with other valuable information which makes her a target of various political factions. Sherlock spends much of the episode keeping the device out of enemy hands while trying to deduce its password. Besides referring to the Doyle short story, the episode title names [[Belgravia]], a district of London adjacent to the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]].\n\nAfter its broadcast on BBC One, the episode was given consolidated figures of 10.663 million viewers in the United Kingdom. Critical reactions toward the episode were largely positive, with reviewers praising the writing, acting and direction. The episode sparked controversy for showing the character of Irene Adler in the nude; carefully using camera angles to avoid exposing private areas, [[Watershed (television)|pre-watershed]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n\nContinuing the ending of [[The Great Game (Sherlock) | The Great Game]], [[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes| Sherlock Holmes]] ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) and [[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson | John Watson]] ([[Martin Freeman]]) are confronting [[List of Sherlock characters#James 'Jim' Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]] ([[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]]).\nMoriarty intends at first to kill them, but as a phone call interrupts, he changes his mind, and dismisses the snipers.\n\nHolmes has become a minor celebrity after Watson blogs about the cases they solved.\nOne day, Holmes and Watson are brought to meet [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]] ([[Mark Gatiss]]) in [[Buckingham Palace]].\nMycroft reveals that [[List of Sherlock characters#Irene Adler|Irene Adler]] ([[Lara Pulver]]), took compromising photographs of herself and a female member of the [[British royalty|royal family]].\nThe authority wants to retrieve Adler's [[smartphone]], which contains those photographs.\nHolmes and Watson try to get into Adler's home by deception, but she has been expecting them. Holmes meets Adler stark naked leaving him unable to deduce anything about her. \n\nAs Watson deliberately triggers the fire alarm, Holmes finds Adler's hidden safe, which Adler has glanced at nervously.\nSuddenly several [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operatives led by Neilson ([[Todd Boyce]]) break into the house and demand that Holmes open the safe.\nHolmes solves the password, and in subsequent chaos, some agents are killed, Holmes gets the phone first, and Adler then sedates Holmes, takes the phone instead, and escapes.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Holmes learns via text message that Adler has sent him her phone.\nConsidering the phone's importance, Holmes thinks she might die soon.\nIndeed, the police find a mutilated body, identified to be Adler.\n\nLater, on New Year's Eve, Watson is taken to see Adler, who is alive and faked her death.\nHolmes followed them and learns this, too.\nMeanwhile, Neilson's team holds [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] ([[Una Stubbs]]) hostage, and Holmes subdues Neilson.\nAdler comes, and reveals that she is still being hunted.\nShe asks Holmes to decipher a code stolen from [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]].\nSherlock effortlessly cracks it, revealing it to be [[airline seat]] allocation numbers. Adler conveys this information to Moriarty, who taunts Mycroft Holmes that he (Moriarty) now knows their plan.\n\nA government official brings Holmes to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].\nMycroft confirms that the government had planned to fly a plane full of corpses, so as not to alert the terrorists planning to bomb the plane that they know of their plans, reminiscent of the [[Coventry myth]].\nHowever, as Holmes unwittingly helped Adler (and thus Moriarty) crack the code, the scheme was foiled.\nAdler reveals a list of demands to Mycroft, including protection, in exchange for the contents of her phone.\nHowever, Holmes figures out the unlocking password to be \"SHER\", so that words on the screen together reads \"I AM SHER-LOCKED\".\nNow without her leverage, Adler pleads for protection, but Sherlock and Mycroft turn her down.\n\nSome months later, Mycroft informs Watson that Adler has been killed by terrorists, but intends to tell Holmes instead that she has entered a [[witness protection]] programme in America.\nHolmes asks for Adler's phone, and says that Adler's last text message was \"Goodbye, Mr Holmes\", suggesting her death.\nAfter Watson leaves, in the flashback it is shown that Holmes was disguised as the executioner and had rescued Adler.\n\n==Sources and allusions==\n[[File:Statue of Sherlock Holmes in Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sherlock Holmes in [[Edinburgh]]. \"A Scandal in Belgravia\" alludes to this 'classic' image of Holmes created by illustrator [[Sidney Paget]].]]\nThe episode is based on Arthur Conan Doyle's short story \"[[A Scandal in Bohemia]]\", and also alludes to several other adventures.<ref name=\"wollaston\"/><ref name=\"crompton\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8987577/The-timeless-appeal-of-Holmess-sexy-logic.html|title=The timeless appeal of Holmes's sexy logic|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=1 January 2012|first=Sarah|last=Crompton |accessdate=5 January 2012|location=London}}</ref> There are humorous references to numerous famous Holmes stories, such as \"[[The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter|The Greek Interpreter]]\" (in this episode, the \"Geek Interpreter\"),<ref name=\"RT\" /> \"[[The Adventure of the Speckled Band|The Speckled Band]]\" (in the episode, the \"Speckled Blonde\"),<ref name=\"crompton\"/> \"[[The Adventure of the Naval Treaty|The Naval Treaty]]\" (in the episode, \"The Navel Treatment\"), \"[[The Adventure of the Illustrious Client|The Illustrious Client]]\" and \"[[The Adventure of the Priory School|The Priory School]]\".

Although Chater's playing is on the actual soundtrack, Cumberbatch was required to appear to be an expert violinist. To achieve this, Chater was positioned on set so that she could synchronise her playing with his. She says, \"On set I need to see him; to play when he lifts his violin and stop when he stops. And he needs to see me; to copy my bowings, to ghost what I'm doing. In one scene I have to stand outside on two boxes on a [[scissor lift]], watching him while he watches me out of the window.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2012/jan/04/how-taught-sherlock-holmes-violin?newsfeed=true |title=How I taught Sherlock Holmes to play the violin |first=Eos |last=Chater |authorlink=Eos Chater |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\n\"A Scandal in Belgravia\" was first broadcast on BBC One on Sunday, 1 January 2012.

It is ''Sherlock's'' highest rated episode since the show's first episode, \"[[A Study in Pink]]\", which attracted 7.5 million.
