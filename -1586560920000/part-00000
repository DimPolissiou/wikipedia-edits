Woodward|Charles Woodward]] established the first Woodward store at the corner of [[Main Street (Vancouver)|Main]] and [[Georgia Street]]s in [[Vancouver]] in 1892. On September 12, 1902, Woodward Department Stores Ltd. was incorporated and a new store was built on the corner of [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|Hastings]] and Abbott Streets. In 1926 a store was opened in [[Edmonton]] and by the late 1940's the company operated numerous stores in British Columbia and Alberta.\n\nWoodward's was a central feature of the retail scene in southwestern British Columbia for much of the twentieth century.  The chain was distinctive in that stores included a large [[supermarket]] known as the \"Food Floor\". When Woodward's sold the Food Floor chain - long known for its quality and its line of unusual specialitie - to [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], the flagship store\u2019s food floor became a reduced-size [[IGA (supermarkets)|IGA]] supermarket, as Safeway showed no interest in that location. Many western Canadians fondly remember Woodward's famous \"$1.49 Day\" sales (said aloud as \"dollar forty-nine day\"), held on the first Tuesday of every month. These sales were advertised widely on radio and in newspapers, including a distinctive jingle used for years after it was introduced in April 1958,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZAdMdIMlmI |title=The $1.49 Day Man (YouTube interview) |first1=Theresa |last1=McManus |first2=Tony |last2=Antonias |work=[[Glacier Media#Community Media|New Westminster Record]] |quote=I was creative director at [[CKNW]].

(Tony Antonias) |date=February 6, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref> and offered everything from canvas-top running shoes to bath oil for the one price.\n\nMost Woodward's locations were converted to [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson\u2019s Bay]] or [[Zellers]] stores by the end of 1993. Other major retailers took over several stores, and the remaining locations were either closed or were divided into mall retail space.\n\nWoodward's also operated two stand alone Furniture Fair stores in Burnaby (which became [[Costco]]'s first location in Canada in 1985) and Edmonton in the 1970s. There were also discount type stores called Woodwynn (similar to [[Winners]]) in BC and Alberta (some within Woodward's Stores), which were originally known as Woodward's Bargain Stores. Several malls also had separate Woodward's Book Stores. The closure of Woodward's locations in many malls sparked redevelopment and expansion of a number of the centres, such as Chinook Centre in [[Calgary]]. In a number of malls, the presence of separate operations such as the book store and Woodwynn required these stores to also be replaced. When the [[West Edmonton Mall]] location closed, The Bay - which already had a full store at the opposite end of the mall - simply converted the former Woodward's into a second Bay (one of the few cases where a single mall has had two duplicate anchor tenants); after a few years of this, however, the Woodward's-Bay was closed and converted into a multi-screen movie theatre, an [[HMV Group|HMV Canada]] (now [[Sunrise Records]]) location, and additional retail space.\n\nOn December 8, 2009, the Woodward's Food Floor reopened for the first time since the chain's sale to Safeway. The new Woodward's Food Floor, which is located in Vancouver at the former Woodward's complex (along with a new location of [[London Drugs]]), is now a division of Nester's Market.<ref>[https://vancouversun.com/Woodward+comes+back+life/2305030/story.html Woodward's comes back to life] at the Vancouver Sun  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208021138/http://www.vancouversun.com/Woodward+comes+back+life/2305030/story.html |date=December 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Woodward's Building]]\n*[[List of department stores#Canada|List of Canadian department stores]]\n*[[Spencer's (department store)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Woodward's}}\n*[http://www.hbcheritage.ca/history/acquisitions/woodwards-stores-ltd Hudson's Bay Company website]\n*[http://www.nestersmarket.com/woodwards/ Woodward's Food Floor website]\n*[https://flickr.com/photos/beinder/491826814/ Woodward's catalogue model circa 1980]\n*[http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/woodwards-steel-tower-vancouver-damage-survey-and-demolitions-july-7-and-15-2006;rad Footage of survey of Woodward's building in Vancouver and demolition of the tower, 2006, City of Vancouver Archives]\n\n\n{{Hudson's_Bay_Trading_Company,_L.P.}}\n\n[[Category:Department stores of Canada]]\n[[Category:Defunct retail companies of Canada]]\n[[Category:Hudson's Bay Company]]\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 1892]]\n[[Category:1892 establishments in British Columbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Department store chain in western Canada}}\n{{distinguish|Woodward & Lothrop}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name       = Woodward's Stores Ltd.\n| logo       = Woodwards Logo.svg\n| fate       = Filed for bankruptcy, stores sold to [[Hudson's Bay Company]]\n| type       = [[Department store]] chain\n| foundation = 1892\n| defunct    = 1993\n| location   =  [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]\n| industry   = [[Retail]]\n| products   = (Full-line department stores & supermarkets) Clothing, grocery, pharmacy, footwear, bedding, hardware, furniture, appliances, electronics, music, cosmetics, jewellery, china, imported specialties, housewares, sporting goods, stationary, toys, home textiles, restaurants, garden centre, auto centres (at most locations); services at stores also included: travel agency, book stores, optical, hair salon, shoe repair.\n}}\n'''Woodward's Stores Ltd.''' was a [[department store]] chain that operated in [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]], Canada, for one hundred years, before its sale to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].\n\n==History==\n[[Charles A.

Most immigration courts have set up programs where ''pro bono'' (free, volunteer) attorneys are available on the day of the master calendar hearing. For [[criminal proceedings]], the law provides a [[public defender]] for every [[defendant]] who has no means to hire a private attorney. But since removal proceedings are not criminal proceedings, the law does not provide a public defender or compensate the respondent for the costs of an attorney. The ''pro bono'' attorney helps the alien in the following ways:\n\n* The ''pro bono'' attorney speaks on behalf of the respondent in court.\n* The ''pro bono'' attorney helps the respondent determine how to respond to each of the charges in the NTA.\n* The ''pro bono'' attorney helps the respondent determine whether to claim eligibility for relief from removal (such as asylum or [[cancellation of removal]])\n\nIf the respondent's situation is complicated, the ''pro bono'' attorney may request a [[continuance]] on the respondent's behalf, so that the respondent can secure an attorney. The ''pro bono'' attorney does not typically continue to represent the respondent for the merits hearing. Rather, the respondent is expected to find (and pay for) an attorney by that time.\n\n=== How appeals work ===\n{{Further|Board of Immigration Appeals}}\nDecisions of immigration judges may be appealed by either party with the BIA. Absent [[exceptional circumstances#United States|exceptional circumstances]], the BIA does not accept new evidence regarding the original case, but instead, simply aims to determine whether the immigration judge made an incorrect judgment based on the law or the facts available to it at that time. It is therefore critical that all the arguments and facts be presented to the immigration judges in immigration courts. BIA appeals are generally handled through paper, with physical hearings very rare.<ref name=immigration-equality-bia>{{cite web|url = http://www.immigrationequality.org/get-legal-help/our-legal-resources/immigration-equality-asylum-manual/28-board-of-immigration-appeals/|title = 28.

Instead, the courts created their own standard of review, called the \"abuse of discretion\" standard. Under this court-created standard, a BIA decision will be remanded for further proceedings if it is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to the law. But this allows criminal aliens to remain in the United States while the BIA and the courts play [[ping pong#English|ping-pong]] with their cases. In the meantime, the courts are blatantly refusing to review any late-filed petition, even if the petitioner is a [[national of the United States]] like U.S. President [[Donald Trump]].

Most immigration courts have set up programs where ''pro bono'' (free, volunteer) attorneys are available on the day of the master calendar hearing. For [[criminal proceedings]], the law provides a [[public defender]] for every [[defendant]] who has no means to hire a private attorney. But since removal proceedings are not criminal proceedings, the law does not provide a public defender or compensate the respondent for the costs of an attorney. The ''pro bono'' attorney helps the alien in the following ways:\n\n* The ''pro bono'' attorney speaks on behalf of the respondent in court.\n* The ''pro bono'' attorney helps the respondent determine how to respond to each of the charges in the NTA.\n* The ''pro bono'' attorney helps the respondent determine whether to claim eligibility for relief from removal (such as asylum or [[cancellation of removal]])\n\nIf the respondent's situation is complicated, the ''pro bono'' attorney may request a [[continuance]] on the respondent's behalf, so that the respondent can secure an attorney. The ''pro bono'' attorney does not typically continue to represent the respondent for the merits hearing. Rather, the respondent is expected to find (and pay for) an attorney by that time.\n\n=== How appeals work ===\n{{Further|Board of Immigration Appeals}}\nDecisions of immigration judges may be appealed by either party with the BIA. Absent [[exceptional circumstances#United States|exceptional circumstances]], the BIA does not accept new evidence regarding the original case, but instead, simply aims to determine whether the immigration judge made an incorrect judgment based on the law or the facts available to it at that time. It is therefore critical that all the arguments and facts be presented to the immigration judges in immigration courts. BIA appeals are generally handled through paper, with physical hearings very rare.<ref name=immigration-equality-bia>{{cite web|url = http://www.immigrationequality.org/get-legal-help/our-legal-resources/immigration-equality-asylum-manual/28-board-of-immigration-appeals/|title = 28.

Aliens may do this to avoid lengthy periods of detention or legal limbo, and to reunite with their families.\n* Administrative removal for an [[aggravated felony|aggravated felon]]: Any \"illegal alien\" who has been convicted of any [[aggravated felony]] may be removed immediately after the completion of his or her term of [[imprisonment]].<ref name=\"section 1365(b)\"/>\n\nRemoval proceedings also should not be confused with [[Operation Streamline]], that involves the use of federal ''criminal'' charges being pressed against aliens for unlawful entry. Non-LPR aliens who are found guilty through Operation Streamline courts generally have to spend a few months in prison, after which they are handed over to ICE agents.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP.

Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]].

Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]].

By this period, the Labour Party were also the dominant party in Scotland, in terms of electoral support and representation. Targeting Labour through emphasising left-of-centre policies and values was therefore electorally logical for the SNP, as well as tying in with the ideological preferences of many new party members.<ref name=\"Mitchell1996208\"/> In 1961, the SNP conference expressed the party's opposition to the siting of the [[United States|US]] [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine base at the [[Holy Loch]].

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right. The 1980s saw the SNP further define itself as a party of the political left, such as campaigning against the introduction of the [[community charge|poll tax]] in Scotland in 1989; one year before the tax was imposed on the rest of the UK.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nIdeological tensions inside the SNP are further complicated by arguments between the so-called [[SNP gradualist]]s and [[SNP fundamentalist]]s. In essence, gradualists seek to advance Scotland to independence through further devolution, in a \"step-by-step\" strategy. They tend to be in the moderate left grouping, though much of the [[79 Group]] was gradualist in approach.

Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.\n\nThe party suffered its first split during this period with John MacCormick leaving the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|Home Rule]] at that year's conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly.\n\nHowever, wartime conditions also enabled the SNP's first parliamentary success at the [[1945 Motherwell by-election|Motherwell by-election]] in 1945, but [[Robert McIntyre]] MP lost the seat at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|general election]] three months later. The 1950s were characterised by similarly low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.\n\nThe 1960s, however, offered more electoral successes, with candidates polling credibly at [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961|Glasgow Bridgeton]] in 1961, [[1962 West Lothian by-election|West Lothian]] in 1962 and [[1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election|Glasgow Pollok]] in 1967. Indeed, this foreshadowed [[Winnie Ewing]]'s surprise victory in [[1967 Hamilton by-election|a by-election]] at the previously safe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] seat of [[Hamilton (UK Parliament constituency)|Hamilton]]. This brought the SNP to national prominence, leading to the establishment of the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]].\n\n=== Becoming a Major Force (1970s) ===\n[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|In [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] the SNP won 11 constituencies, a record that would stand until [[Nicola Sturgeon]] assumed the party's leadership.|350x350px]]\nDespite this breakthrough, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]] was to prove a disappointment for the party as despite an increase in vote share, Ewing failed to retain her seat in Hamilton. The party did receive some consolation with the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] the party's only MP. This was to be the case until the [[1973 Glasgow Govan by-election|1973 by-election]] at [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] where a hitherto safe Labour seat was claimed by [[Margo MacDonald]].\n\n1974 was to prove something of an [[annus mirabilis]] for the party as it deployed its highly effective ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4241-dilemmas-of-over-development-scottish-nationalism-and-the-future-of-the-union|title=Dilemmas of Over-Development: Scottish Nationalism and the Future of the Union|website=Versobooks.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> The SNP gained 6 seats at the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February general election]] before hitting a high point in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October re-run]], polling almost a third of all votes in Scotland and returning 11 MPs to Westminster. Furthermore, during that year's [[1974 Scottish local elections|local elections]] the party claimed overall control of [[Cumbernauld and Kilsyth]]. \n\nThis success was to continue for much of the decade, and at the [[1977 Scottish local elections|1977 district elections]] the SNP saw victories at councils including [[East Kilbride (district)|East Kilbride]] and [[Falkirk Council|Falkirk]] and held the balance of power in [[1977 Glasgow City District Council election|Glasgow]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Faux|first=Ronald|url=|title=Labour lose control of Glasgow|date=4 May 1977|work=The Times, p. 1|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> However, this level of support was not to last and by 1978 Labour revival was evident at three by-elections ([[1978 Glasgow Garscadden by-election|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[1978 Hamilton by-election|Hamilton]] and [[1978 Berwick and East Lothian by-election|Berwick and East Lothian]]) as well as the [[1978 Scottish regional elections|regional elections]].\n\nThis was to culminate when the party experienced a large drop in its support at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]], precipitated by the party [[1979 vote of no confidence in the Callaghan ministry|bringing down]] the incumbent Labour minority government following the controversial failure of that year's [[1979 Scottish devolution referendum|devolution referendum]]. Reduced to just 2 MPs, the successes of October 1974 were not to be surpassed until the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]].\n\n=== Factional Divisions and Infighting (1980s) ===\n[[File:Scottish National Party 79 Group Logo.svg|left|thumb|112x112px|The [[79 Group]] sought to define the party on the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. ]]\nFollowing this defeat, a period of internal strike occurred within the party, culminating with the formation of two internal groups: the proto-fascist [[Siol nan Gaidheal|Siol nan Gaidhea]]<nowiki/>l<ref>{{Cite book|last=Devine, T. M. (Thomas Martin)|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1004568536|title=The Scottish nation : a modern history|isbn=978-0-7181-9673-8|location=London|oclc=1004568536}}</ref> and left-wing [[79 Group]]. Traditionalists within the party, centred around [[Winnie Ewing]], by this time an [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], responded by establishing the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] which sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation, despite the fact that this would have undone the work of figures such as [[William Wolfe]], who developed a clearly [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policy platform throughout the 1970s.\n\nThese events ensured the success of a leadership motion at the party's annual conference of 1982, in [[Ayr]], despite the 79 Group being bolstered by the merger of [[Jim Sillars|Jim Sillars']] [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party (SLP)]] although this influx of ex-SLP members further shifted the characteristics of the party leftwards. Despite this, traditionalist figure [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] remained party leader through the electoral dissapointments of [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]] and [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]], where he lost his own [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] seat won 13 years prior. \n\nThrough this period, Sillars grew influence in the party, developing a clear socio-economic platform including ''Independence in Europe,'' reversing the SNP's previous opposition to membership of the [[European Union|then-EEC]] which had been unsuccessful in a [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]]. This position was enhanced further by Sillars reclaiming [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] in a [[1988 Glasgow Govan by-election|by-election]] in 1988. \n\nDespite this moderation, the party did not join [[Scottish Labour|Labour]], the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Scottish Greens|Greens]] as well as civil society in the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] which developed a blueprint for a devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] due to the unwillingness of the convention to discuss independence as a constitutional option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0165/ex-mp-scotland-in-trouble-if-lax-on-constitution|title=Ex-MP: Scotland \u2018in trouble\u2019 if lax on constitution - The Targe|website=thetarge.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> \n\n=== First Salmond Era (1990s) ===\n[[File:Tayside Regional Council 1994.svg|thumb|181x181px|In [[1994 Tayside Regional Council election|1994]] the SNP gained control of [[Tayside]], the only time the party controlled a regional council, albeit without a majority.]]\n[[Alex Salmond]] had been elected MP for [[Banff and Buchan (UK Parliament constituency)|Banff and Buchan]] in 1987, after the re-admittance of 79 Group members, and was able to seize the party leadership after Wilson's resignation in [[1990 Scottish National Party leadership election|1990]] after a contest with [[Margaret Ewing]]. This was a surprise victory as Ewing had the backing of much of the party establishment, including Sillars and then-Party Secretary [[John Swinney]]. The defection of Labour MP [[Dick Douglas]] further evidenced the party's clear left-wing positioning, particularly regarding opposition to the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27388579|title=Former MP Dick Douglas dies aged 82|date=2014-05-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB}}</ref> Despite this, Salmond's leadership was unable to avert a fourth successive general election disappointment in [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]] with the party reduced back from 5 to 3 MPs.\n\nThe mid-90s offered some successes for the party, with [[North East Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|North East Scotland]] being gained at the [[1994 European Parliament election|1994 European elections]] and the party securing a [[1995 Perth and Kinross by-election|by-election]] at [[Perth and Kinross (UK Parliament constituency)|Perth and Kinross]] in 1995 after a near miss at [[1994 Monklands East by-election|Monklands East]] the previous year.\n[[File:Scottish devolution referendum, 1997 Question 1 results.svg|left|thumb|The party was part of the successful [[History of Scottish devolution|devolution]] campaign in [[1997 Scottish devolution referendum|1997]].]]\n1997 offered the party's most successful [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 23 years, although in the face of the Labour landslide the party was unable to match either 1974 election.

There is also an [[SNP Trade Union Group]]. There is an independently owned monthly newspaper, ''[[The Scots Independent]]'', which is highly supportive of the party.\n\nThe SNP's leadership is vested in its National Executive Committee (NEC), which is made up of the party's elected office bearers and six elected members (voted for at conference).

Members of the 79 Group - including future party leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] - were expelled from the party. This produced a response in the shape of the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]] from those who wanted the SNP to remain a \"broad church\", apart from arguments of left vs. right.

It is also a philosophy that emphasises the election of an SNP government should bring about trust in the Scottish people in the ability of [[Scotland]] to govern herself, thus bringing increased support for independence.\n\nFundamentalism stands in opposition to the so-called gradualist point of view, which believes that the SNP should emphasise independence more widely in order to achieve it.
