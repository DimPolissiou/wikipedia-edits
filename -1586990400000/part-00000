The investigations were done in August and September 2018. Speaking with facility mental health clinicians and program directors, they reported that separated children exhibited \"fear, feelings of abandonment, and post-traumatic stress\" with some children exhibiting acute symptoms of grief such as crying inconsolably.

Had Whitaker lost, his fight against Ch\u00e1vez would have been a unification bout for Whitaker's IBF light welterweight title and Ch\u00e1vez's WBC light welterweight title, but Whitaker's victory ensure the fight would instead be for his newly won WBC welterweight title instead.<ref>[https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/06/Pernell-Whitaker-using-his-speed-and-capitalizing-on-his/3717731394000/ Pernell Whitaker, using his speed and capitalizing on his...], UPI article, 1993-03-06, Retrieved on 2020-04-13</ref> At the insistence of Ch\u00e1vez, the fight was held at a catch-weight of 145 pounds, two pounds under the official welterweight limit of 147 pounds.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/sports/boxing-chavez-and-whitaker-fight-versus-flight.html Chavez and Whitaker: Fight Versus Flight], NY Times article, 1993-09-10, Retrieved on 2020-04-12</ref>  \n\nThe fight was highly anticipated as Ch\u00e1vez was the number one fighter on [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'' magazine's]] pound-for-pound list and Whitaker was number two.

Whitaker used his slick boxing skills to control the fight as Ch\u00e1vez had trouble landing punches consistently. Whitaker would dominate with his jab landing 130 to Ch\u00e1vez's, and had the edge in overall punches with 311 punches landed compared to 220 for Ch\u00e1vez. However, when the fight went to the judge's scorecards only one judge, Jack Woodruff, had scored the fight in Whitaker's favor at 115\u2013113.

Named for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], the state was made out of the western part of the [[Washington Territory]], which was ceded by the [[British Empire]] in 1846, in accordance with the [[Oregon Treaty]] in the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The state, which is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Oregon]] to the south, [[Idaho]] to the east, and the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] is the [[state capital]]; the state's largest city is [[Seattle]]. Washington is often referred to as '''Washington State''' to distinguish it from the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nWashington is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|18th largest state]], with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km<sup>2</sup>), and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th most populous]] state, with more than 7.6 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], the center of transportation, business, and industry along [[Puget Sound]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep [[fjord]]s, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep [[temperate rainforest]]s in the west; [[mountain range]]s in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Western United States]], after [[California]]. [[Mount Rainier]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the state's highest elevation, at almost {{convert|14411|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and is the most [[topographically prominent]] mountain in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]]\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. Washington is the nation's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Washington ranks second only to California in wine production.\n\nManufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has more than a thousand dams, including the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.\n\nWashington is one of the [[List of U.S. states by income|wealthiest]] and most socially progressive states in the country.{{dubious|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}} The state consistently ranks among the best for [[life expectancy]] and low [[unemployment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|title=America's best states to live in, ranked|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001023/https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Along with [[Colorado]], Washington was one of the [[Cannabis in Washington (state)|first to legalize medicinal and recreational]] [[cannabis]], was among the first thirty-six states to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal [[abortion]]s [[Abortion in the United States#History|on request]] before the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v.

A [[Mediterranean Climate]] predominates in western Washington, and a much drier [[semi-arid climate]] prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] and [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term \"[[Pineapple Express]]\" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kruckeberg | first = Arthur R. | title = The Natural History of Puget Sound Country | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | pages = 42\u201343 | isbn = 978-0-295-97477-4}}</ref>\n\nDespite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883\u20131884, 1915\u20131916, 1949\u20131950, and 1955\u20131956, among others.

The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations. [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world.

Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]\u2014especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]]. Thus, instead of rain forests, much of eastern Washington is covered with [[grassland]] and [[shrub-steppe]].\n\n====Temperatures====\n\nThe average annual temperature ranges from {{convert|51|F}} on the Pacific coast to {{convert|40|F}} in the northeast. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was {{convert|-48|F}} in [[Winthrop, Washington|Winthrop]] and [[Mazama, Washington|Mazama]]. The highest recorded temperature in the state was {{convert|118|F}} at [[Ice Harbor Dam]]. Both records were set east of the Cascades.

He claimed the coastal lands up to [[Prince William Sound]] for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn 1778, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer Captain [[James Cook]] sighted [[Cape Flattery]], at the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by [[Spain|Spanish explorers]] [[Manuel Quimper]] in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792.\n\n===Settlement===\n\n{{Main|Oregon pioneer history}}\n\nThe British-Spanish [[Nootka Convention]] of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] (for whom [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor County]] is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the [[Columbia Rediviva|''Columbia'']]. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in [[sea otter]] pelts. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nExplorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the [[North West Company]] to build a trading post at the site.\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] in 1841]]\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the [[Continental Divide]] to the Pacific Ocean as part of the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into [[Oregon Country]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the [[Columbia District]].\n\nFur trapper [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], on orders from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near [[Fort Vancouver]]. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the [[Kootenai River]] and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the [[Oregon Treaty]] on June 15, 1846.\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including [[Marcus Whitman]], established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]], in territory of both the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] Indian tribes. Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the [[Oregon Trail]], the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients\u2014lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases\u2014died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the [[Whitman massacre]] in 1847. This event triggered the [[Cayuse War]] between settlers and Indians.\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]], a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the [[Puget Sound]] area, was founded in 1833. Black pioneer [[George Washington Bush]] and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from [[Missouri]] and [[Tennessee]], respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]], in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's [[Oregon black exclusion laws|Black Exclusion Law]], which prohibited African Americans from entering the territory while simultaneously prohibiting [[slavery]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Articles on George Washington Bush | publisher = City of Tumwater, WA | url = http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm | accessdate = June 15, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714212032/http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm\n| archivedate = July 14, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author = McClintock, Thomas C. |title = James Saules, Peter Burnett, and the Oregon Black Exclusion Law of June 1844 |journal = The Pacific Northwest Quarterly |volume = 86 |number = 3 |date = July 1, 1995 |page = 122 }}</ref> After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Oregon boundary dispute|Provisional Government of Oregon|Oregon Treaty|Oregon Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Washington Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Seattle - looking east on Yesler Way, 1887.jpg|thumb|Seattle in 1887]]\n\nThe growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory.

In eastern Washington, the [[Yakima River]] Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using [[Dryland farming|dry farming]] techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the [[Douglas fir]]. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.\n\n===Industrial era===\n\n[[File:B-17Es at Boeing Plant, Seattle, Washington, 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]] bombers under construction, circa{{nbsp}}1942]]\n\nFor a long period, [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated. [[Seattle]] was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the [[Boeing]] company became an established icon in the area.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the largest concrete structure in the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's [[heavy bomber]]s, ports in Seattle, [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at [[Golden Gardens Park]]. In eastern Washington, the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Works]] [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] plant was opened in 1943, and played a major role in the construction of the nation's [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].\n\n===Mount St. Helens eruption, 1980===\n\n{{Main|1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens}}\n\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of [[Mount St. Helens]] [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted violently]], destroying a large part of the top of the volcano.

The North Cascades Highway, [[Washington State Route 20|State Route 20]], closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of [[Washington Pass]]. The [[Cayuse Pass|Cayuse]] and [[Chinook Pass|Chinook]] Passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.\n\nWashington is crossed by a number of freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascade route]] between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's [[King Street Station]], the busiest station in Washington, and 15th busiest in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|title=Amtrak|website=www.amtrak.com|access-date=January 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015155/https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> serves as the terminus for the two long distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the [[Empire Builder]] to Chicago and the [[Coast Starlight]] to Los Angeles.

A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, [[British Columbia]], and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.\n\nThree recent studies by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], two chlorinated pesticides, [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]], [[dieldrin]] and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the [[Washington State Department of Health]] advises the public not to eat [[mountain whitefish]] from the [[Wenatchee River]] from [[Leavenworth, Washington|Leavenworth]] downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also showed high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2007/2007-06-25-01.asp|title=Toxics Persist in Washington Rivers, Lakes and Fish|website=Ens-newswire.com|date=June 25, 2007|accessdate=July 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005919/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2007/2007-06-25-01.asp|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2006, Governor [[Christine Gregoire]] signed into law the recently approved House Bill 2322.

Named for [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States|U.S. president]], the state was made out of the western part of the [[Washington Territory]], which was ceded by the [[British Empire]] in 1846, in accordance with the [[Oregon Treaty]] in the settlement of the [[Oregon boundary dispute]]. The state, which is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Oregon]] to the south, [[Idaho]] to the east, and the [[Provinces of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] to the north, was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] is the [[state capital]]; the state's largest city is [[Seattle]]. Washington is often referred to as '''Washington State''' to distinguish it from the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]].\n\nWashington is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|18th largest state]], with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,827 km<sup>2</sup>), and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|13th most populous]] state, with more than 7.6 million people. Approximately 60 percent of Washington's residents live in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], the center of transportation, business, and industry along [[Puget Sound]], an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep [[fjord]]s, and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep [[temperate rainforest]]s in the west; [[mountain range]]s in the west, central, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, central, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and in the [[Western United States]], after [[California]]. [[Mount Rainier]], an active [[stratovolcano]], is the state's highest elevation, at almost {{convert|14411|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and is the most [[topographically prominent]] mountain in the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]]\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer; its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. Washington is the nation's largest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy. Washington ranks second only to California in wine production.\n\nManufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft and missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, lumber, food processing, metals and metal products, chemicals, and machinery. Washington has more than a thousand dams, including the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], built for a variety of purposes including irrigation, power, flood control, and water storage.\n\nWashington is one of the [[List of U.S. states by income|wealthiest]] and most socially progressive states in the country.{{dubious|date=March 2020}}{{Fact|date=March 2020}} The state consistently ranks among the best for [[life expectancy]] and low [[unemployment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|title=America's best states to live in, ranked|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001023/https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/travel/experience/america/fifty-states/2018/11/06/whats-best-american-state-live-all-50-states-ranked/1901557002/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Along with [[Colorado]], Washington was one of the [[Cannabis in Washington (state)|first to legalize medicinal and recreational]] [[cannabis]], was among the first thirty-six states to legalize [[same-sex marriage]], doing so in 2012, and was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal [[abortion]]s [[Abortion in the United States#History|on request]] before the 1973 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v.

Similarly, Washington voters approved a [[Washington Death with Dignity Act|2008 referendum]] on legalization of [[assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], and is currently one of only five states, along with [[Oregon]], [[California]], [[Colorado]] and [[Vermont]], as well as [[Washington, D.C.|the District of Columbia]] to have legalized the practice.

A [[Mediterranean Climate]] predominates in western Washington, and a much drier [[semi-arid climate]] prevails east of the Cascade Range. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent [[High-pressure area|high pressure]] and [[Low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high pressure [[anticyclone]] system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means [[prevailing winds]] from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably [[dry season]].\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure [[cyclone]] system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring relatively warm and moist air masses and a predictably [[wet season]]. The term \"[[Pineapple Express]]\" is used colloquially to describe [[atmospheric river]] events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from tropical and near-tropical Pacific regions into the Pacific Northwest.<ref>{{cite book | last = Kruckeberg | first = Arthur R. | title = The Natural History of Puget Sound Country | publisher = University of Washington Press | year = 1991 | pages = 42\u201343 | isbn = 978-0-295-97477-4}}</ref>\n\nDespite western Washington's having a marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916, and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883\u20131884, 1915\u20131916, 1949\u20131950, and 1955\u20131956, among others.

During the El Ni\u00f1o phase, the jet stream enters the U.S. farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack. The La Ni\u00f1a phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average.\n\nIn 2006, the Climate Impacts Group at the [[University of Washington]] published ''The Impacts of Climate change in Washington's Economy'', a preliminary assessment on the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |title=Climate Change\u2014Economic Impacts |publisher=Ecy.wa.gov |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730040420/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/climatechange/economic_impacts.htm |archivedate=July 30, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n====Rain shadow effects====\n\n{{main|Rain shadow}}\n\n[[File:Wa rain map.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Washington experiences extensive variation in rainfall.]]\n\nRainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west. The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as {{convert|160|in}} of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a [[temperate rainforest]]. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than {{convert|200|in|disp=or|sp=us}} water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only {{convert|6|in}}. Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing [[orographic lift]] of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations. [[Mount Baker]], near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world. In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season\u2014{{convert|1140|in|ft m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases99/aug99/noaa99056.html | title = Mt.

Semi-arid conditions occur in much of eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central [[Columbia Plateau]]\u2014especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the [[Okanagan Highland]].

He claimed the coastal lands up to [[Prince William Sound]] for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire.\n\nIn 1778, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] explorer Captain [[James Cook]] sighted [[Cape Flattery]], at the entrance to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], but Cook did not realize the strait existed. It was not discovered until [[Charles William Barkley]], captain of the ''[[Imperial Eagle (ship)|Imperial Eagle]]'', sighted it in 1787. The straits were further explored by [[Spain|Spanish explorers]] [[Manuel Quimper]] in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791, and British explorer [[George Vancouver]] in 1792.\n\n===Settlement===\n\n{{Main|Oregon pioneer history}}\n\nThe British-Spanish [[Nootka Convention]] of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States. American captain [[Robert Gray (sea captain)|Robert Gray]] (for whom [[Grays Harbor County, Washington|Grays Harbor County]] is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the [[Columbia Rediviva|''Columbia'']]. Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in [[sea otter]] pelts. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] entered the state on October 10, 1805.\n\nExplorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811, and erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the [[North West Company]] to build a trading post at the site.\n[[File:Fort Nez Perces Trading 1841.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Fur trading at [[Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s]] in 1841]]\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the [[Continental Divide]] to the Pacific Ocean as part of the [[Treaty of 1818|Anglo-American Convention of 1818]], which established the 49th Parallel as the international boundary west from [[Lake of the Woods]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues, west to the Pacific, was deferred until a later time. Spain, in 1819, ceded their rights north of the 42nd Parallel to the United States, although these rights did not include possession.\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint-occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into [[Oregon Country]], [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the [[Columbia District]].\n\nFur trapper [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], on orders from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]], Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near [[Fort Vancouver]]. The party crossed the Rockies into the [[Columbia Valley]], near present-day [[Radium Hot Springs]], British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the [[Kootenai River]] and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the [[Oregon Treaty]] on June 15, 1846.\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including [[Marcus Whitman]], established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present day [[Walla Walla County, Washington|Walla Walla County]], in territory of both the [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] and the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] Indian tribes. Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the [[Oregon Trail]], the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Marcus provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients\u2014lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases\u2014died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and murdered Whitman and twelve other white settlers in the [[Whitman massacre]] in 1847. This event triggered the [[Cayuse War]] between settlers and Indians.\n\n[[Fort Nisqually]], a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the [[Puget Sound]] area, was founded in 1833. Black pioneer [[George Washington Bush]] and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from [[Missouri]] and [[Tennessee]], respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now [[Tumwater, Washington|Tumwater]], in 1846. They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's [[Oregon black exclusion laws|Black Exclusion Law]], which prohibited African Americans from entering the territory while simultaneously prohibiting [[slavery]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Articles on George Washington Bush | publisher = City of Tumwater, WA | url = http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm | accessdate = June 15, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070714212032/http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/research%20bushTOC.htm\n| archivedate = July 14, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author = McClintock, Thomas C. |title = James Saules, Peter Burnett, and the Oregon Black Exclusion Law of June 1844 |journal = The Pacific Northwest Quarterly |volume = 86 |number = 3 |date = July 1, 1995 |page = 122 }}</ref> After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area.\n\n===Statehood===\n\n{{Main|Oregon boundary dispute|Provisional Government of Oregon|Oregon Treaty|Oregon Territory|Organic act#List of organic acts|Washington Territory|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n[[File:Seattle - looking east on Yesler Way, 1887.jpg|thumb|Seattle in 1887]]\n\nThe growing populace of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory.

In eastern Washington, the [[Yakima River]] Valley became known for its apple orchards, while the growth of wheat using [[Dryland farming|dry farming]] techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the [[Douglas fir]]. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.\n\n===Industrial era===\n\n[[File:B-17Es at Boeing Plant, Seattle, Washington, 1943.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]] bombers under construction, circa{{nbsp}}1942]]\n\nFor a long period, [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated. [[Seattle]] was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], and the [[Boeing]] company became an established icon in the area.\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], a series of [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dams]] were constructed along the Columbia river as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]], the largest concrete structure in the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many of the nation's [[heavy bomber]]s, ports in Seattle, [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]], and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, a number of whom were quartered at [[Golden Gardens Park]]. In eastern Washington, the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Works]] [[Nuclear power|atomic energy]] plant was opened in 1943, and played a major role in the construction of the nation's [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bombs]].\n\n===Mount St. Helens eruption, 1980===\n\n{{Main|1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens}}\n\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and eruptions, the northeast face of [[Mount St. Helens]] [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens|erupted violently]], destroying a large part of the top of the volcano.

The North Cascades Highway, [[Washington State Route 20|State Route 20]], closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of [[Washington Pass]]. The [[Cayuse Pass|Cayuse]] and [[Chinook Pass|Chinook]] Passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.\n\nWashington is crossed by a number of freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascade route]] between Eugene, Oregon and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's [[King Street Station]], the busiest station in Washington, and 15th busiest in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|title=Amtrak|website=www.amtrak.com|access-date=January 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214015155/https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/statefactsheets/WASHINGTON17.pdf|archive-date=December 14, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> serves as the terminus for the two long distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the [[Empire Builder]] to Chicago and the [[Coast Starlight]] to Los Angeles.

A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, [[British Columbia]], and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.\n\nThree recent studies by the [[Washington State Department of Ecology]] showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], two chlorinated pesticides, [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]], [[dieldrin]] and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the [[Washington State Department of Health]] advises the public not to eat [[mountain whitefish]] from the [[Wenatchee River]] from [[Leavenworth, Washington|Leavenworth]] downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also showed high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2007/2007-06-25-01.asp|title=Toxics Persist in Washington Rivers, Lakes and Fish|website=Ens-newswire.com|date=June 25, 2007|accessdate=July 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005919/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jun2007/2007-06-25-01.asp|archive-date=June 4, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2006, Governor [[Christine Gregoire]] signed into law the recently approved House Bill 2322.

Larry became an Eagle Scout, mixing his activities with his work at his father\u2019s auto dealership. \n\nIn the fall of 1942, he enrolled at the University of Kansas and became a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity which later would induct him into its Hall of Fame. Larry and Bob Dole had been schoolmates since the first grade and continued that relationship into college. 1943 saw Larry\u2019s induction into the army, subsequent officer\u2019s commission through OCS and overseas service until he was relieved from active duty in 1946.  \n\nLarry married Martha (Marti) Lou Norton on September 4, 1946, then returned to KU where he graduated in 1948. On February 12, 1948, the birth of Stephen Drew Ochs blessed this couple. Out of college, Larry went to work for Prudential Insurance Company in Lawrence, then Wichita, Kansas, where on March 21, 1951, David Norton Ochs joined the family. Both sons were highly allergic to wheat spores which prompted a move to Colorado Springs and a more hospitable climate in 1955.\n\n== '''Middle Life''' ==\nIn Colorado Springs, Larry joined with brothers Harlan, Kenneth and Donald Ochs in a business partnership and opened the PDQ Car Wash in Colorado Springs, followed by launching Acorn Petroleum in 1959. More than 60 years later, the third generation of the Ochs family is still operating the company. Headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO, Acorn Petroleum is a leading distributor of oil, fuel, chemicals, lubricants and filters in the Colorado Front Range urban corridor.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn 1967, Larry was elected to the Colorado Springs City Council. \n\nIn 1970, Larry was named Vice Mayor under Mayor Eugene McCleary. \n\nIn December 1970, Vice Mayor Larry Ochs traveled to Paris with a League of Wives delegation and attempted to meet with North Vietnamese representatives.

He led the city in the airport expansion, building of a new propane storage facility to ease the natural gas shortage, further procurement of water rights and development of water storage, transmission and treatment facilities \u2013 crucial to the expansion and growth of the city\u2019s population and businesses. \n\nIn 1977, a devastating tragedy struck with the untimely death of Marti. Larry remarried in 1978 to Jean Mitchell, a widow from Dallas. Larry was acquainted with Jean and her late husband, Gene Ronald Mitchell (who also died in 1977) through mutual friends. As he finished his term as mayor, Larry and Jean began to travel extensively, visiting numerous countries including Russia, China, India, Israel, England, France, Turkey, South America, Africa and Canada, and many parts of the United States.  \n\n== '''Later Life''' ==\nFrom 1979 to 2003, Larry and Jean lived a quiet life in Colorado Springs. Out of politics, Larry continued to manage Acorn Petroleum with his brothers, participated in the Pikes Peak Range Riders, and was an active member of the First United Methodist Church in Colorado Springs. Larry was a loving husband, father, stepfather and grandfather. \n\nIn 1996, Jean was diagnosed with colon cancer, and underwent a treatment program that included chemotherapy, radiation, and extensive surgery. Larry was devoted to her care, spending months away from home at the Mayo Clinic, and attending to Jean\u2019s care at home. \n[[File:Larry and Jean Ochs 2.jpg|thumb|Larry and Jean Ochs]] \n\n== '''Illness and Death''' ==\nIn 2001, Larry was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a disease of the lungs that is typically incurable and fatal.
