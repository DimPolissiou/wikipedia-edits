Peter M. Nardi of Pitzer College says: \n<blockquote>The connection between sexual orientation and gender roles has been confused by many people. Too often, assumptions about homosexuality or heterosexuality have led to assumptions about masculinity or femininity&nbsp;... Understanding the differences between sexual identity and gender roles is enhanced when focusing on the issues of friendship and sex among gay men. For many people, being gay has been interpreted in terms of not being masculine or, more specifically, being seen as feminine.{{sfn|Nardi|1992|p=173}}</blockquote>\n\nAccording to human rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]]:\n<blockquote>Queers subvert the gender system. Gay men love males and are not adequately [[macho]] and aggressive. Lesbians love women and are insufficiently passive and dependent on men. That's why we're persecuted. Our nonconformity threatens the system which sustains the social hegemony of male heterosexuality and [[misogyny]].<ref name=Tatchell1>{{cite web|last1=Tatchell|first1=Peter|title=The \"gender fuck\" politics of the London Gay Liberation Front 1970\u201373.|url=http://www.petertatchell.net/masculinity/subverting_the_gender.htm|website=petertatchell.net|publisher=Unpublished|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis has been described as \"gender fuck politics\".<ref name=Tatchell1/>\n\n[[Havelock Ellis]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] thought homosexuality resulted from reversed gender roles.
