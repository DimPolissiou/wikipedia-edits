The friends (''Veere''; \"bros\" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]) are living their own lives in different places when they reunite for Kalindi's wedding.\n\nKalindi has been living with her boyfriend, Rishabh ([[Sumeet Vyas]]) for two years in [[Australia]]. When he proposes to her, she is shocked. Coming from a broken home, Kalindi is averse to the idea of marriage. Her parents used to fight a lot and her father Krishna remarried soon after her mother Ritu died. Nevertheless, Kalindi agrees for Rishabh's happiness. Avni is a blossoming divorce lawyer in [[Delhi]] and her mother is on ever lookout for suitable groom for her. Sakshi is living with her parents after moving out of her NRI husband's London home due to frequent fights. She is taunted by upscale aunties for overstaying at her parents' place. She gets upset at the taunts she has to hear from neighbours for going to clubs. Meera lives in America, having married an American, John,  with whom she has a son named Kabir after her father. She is estranged from her father, fondly called 'bade papa' because of her marriage to John, and though she misses him, she refuses to get in touch until he accepts John.\n\nWhen Kalindi travels to Delhi to get married, she is overwhelmed by Rishabh's over affectionate family and their customary involvement in the wedding. They were making it a huge event (big fat Indian wedding) to \"maintain face\" in the society. While in Delhi, Kalindi lives with her gay Kuki uncle and his partner rather than her father, and reunites with her ''veere''. Avni on insistence of her mother meets a few prospective grooms. Kalindi's father and step mother offers to help in her wedding but she is reluctant. She is disturbed by ceremonial demands of Rishabh's family and her own aversion to marriage, resulting in anxiety. During her engagement, Rishabh comments about her not having a proper family, which infuriates her and she leaves the gathering. Avni gets drunk to forget the fact that her prospective groom rejected her and ends up sleeping with Bhandari, Rishabh's cousin. Meera gets drunk and Sakshi leaves party midway because of taunts of 'aunties'.\n\nThe next morning, they find Kalindi in her old home which is a bone of contention between the brothers. Rishabh apologizes to Kalindi and they patch up. However, she explains that she cannot fulfill his family's expectations of her and they mutually break up the engagement. Her friends however, are not supportive of this decision, and try to reason with her, explaining that Rishabh is a good man and she shouldn't run away from marriage due to issues over his family. Kalindi stubbornly points out each of her friend's flaws instead, resulting in everyone getting into an argument and leaving.\n\nSometime later, Sakshi, believing they have become too overwhelmed with life's troubles, buys her ''veere'' a vacation to [[Thailand]]. They reconnect and come clean about their respective issues: Kalindi about her commitment issues stemming from her dysfunctional family; Avni about wanting to marry the right guy and sleeping with Bhandari; Sakshi about why her husband wants to divorce her. Sakshi and her husband were always fighting after marriage. One day, he walked on her [[masturbating]]; appalled, he decides to divorce her. Sakshi is embarrassed to tell her parents the truth about the divorce. Meera explains that she and John haven't had sex in a year after the birth of her son. Everyone decides to go back and face their problems. Sakshi tells her parents the truth and to her surprise, they are very supportive. John comes to India. Meera and he gets intimate. Avni tells her mom about her reluctance to settle for arranged marriage. Kalindi finds that Rishabh's father has been arrested for bank fraud as loan is not paid. Avni arranges for his bail.\n\nKalindi's friends pressurize Kuki uncle to resolve his four-year feud with his brother for Kalindi's happiness; they talk and resolve, this improves relations between father and daughter. The brothers transfer the family house to Kalindi as their gift. She proposes to Rishabh and they decide to marry but in a simple and stylish way.\n\nOn wedding day held in her renovated home, Kalindi wears her mother's old wedding gown and the ceremony is a small intimate affair with fewer guests. John calls Meera's father Kabir Singh and tells them about his grandson. He comes to the wedding and plays with his grandson Kabir. Sakshi gives news of her divorce settlement to 'aunties'. Avni decides to give Bhandari a chance, as he is smitten with her.\n\nThe film ends with everyone dancing at Kalindi and Rishabh's wedding reception.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kareena Kapoor Khan]] as Kalindi Malhotra /Kalindi Puri\n** Smriti Setya as Young Kalindi Malhotra \n* [[Sonam Kapoor Ahuja]] as Avni Sharma\n** Muskaan Khubchandani as Young Avni\n* [[Swara Bhaskar]] as Sakshi Aunty\n** Muskaan Malhotra as Young Sakshi\n* Shikha Talsania as Meera Kaur Stinson\n** Kashish Kanwar as Young Meera\n* Kavita Ghai as Ritu Puri, Kalindi's mother\n* [[Neena Gupta]] as Avni's mother\n* [[Sumeet Vyas]] as Rishabh Malhotra, Kalindi's Husband\n* Vishwas Kini as a Bhandari/stalker\n* [[Vivek Mushran]] as Kalindi's Uncle \n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Rishabh's mother\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Rishabh's father \n* [[Alka Kaushal]] as a Santosh aunty/ Bhandari's mom\n* [[Ekavali Khanna]] as Paromita \n* Sukesh Arora as Cookies friend \n* [[Anjum Rajabali]] as Some tharki baba\n* Ishwak Singh as a dummy\n* [[Suraj Singh]] as Vineet\n* [[Edward Sonnenblick]] as a John Stinson, Meera's husband\n* [[Kamlesh Gill]] as Jhaaiji\n* Bubbles Sabharwal as Sakshi's mother\n* Babla Kochar as Bade Papas ex bf\n* Muskaan Khubchandani as Young Avani\n* Kalpana Jha as Shanti\n* Jitpreet Singh Gill as Sakshi aunty\u2019s boyfriend aka Bade Papa{{div col end}}\n<br />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn December 2015, [[Sonam Kapoor]] indicated that she would be working on a project with her sister [[Rhea Kapoor]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/sonam-kapoor-not-doing-aashiqui-3-her-next-is-with-sister-rhea/ |title= Sonam Kapoor not doing 'Aashiqui 3', her next is with sister Rhea|accessdate=18 December 2015 |author=PTI |date=18 September 2012 }}</ref> The project was officially announced in June 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-sonam-kapoor-and-kareena-kapoor-khan-come-together-for-veere-di-wedding-2223659 |title= Veere Di Wedding: Sonam Kapoor gears up for an all-girls ride with Kareena Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar|accessdate=14 June 2016 |author=DNA}}</ref>\n\nThe project was delayed due to Kareena Kapoor's pregnancy.

The friends (''Veere''; \"bros\" in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]) are living their own lives in different places when they reunite for Kalindi's wedding.\n\nKalindi has been living with her boyfriend, Rishabh ([[Sumeet Vyas]]) for two years in [[Australia]]. When he proposes to her, she is shocked. Coming from a broken home, Kalindi is averse to the idea of marriage. Her parents used to fight a lot and her father Krishna remarried soon after her mother Ritu died. Nevertheless, Kalindi agrees for Rishabh's happiness. Avni is a blossoming divorce lawyer in [[Delhi]] and her mother is on ever lookout for suitable groom for her. Sakshi is living with her parents after moving out of her NRI husband's London home due to frequent fights. She is taunted by upscale aunties for overstaying at her parents' place. She gets upset at the taunts she has to hear from neighbours for going to clubs. Meera lives in America, having married an American, John,  with whom she has a son named Kabir after her father. She is estranged from her father, fondly called 'bade papa' because of her marriage to John, and though she misses him, she refuses to get in touch until he accepts John.\n\nWhen Kalindi travels to Delhi to get married, she is overwhelmed by Rishabh's over affectionate family and their customary involvement in the wedding. They were making it a huge event (big fat Indian wedding) to \"maintain face\" in the society. While in Delhi, Kalindi lives with her gay Kuki uncle and his partner rather than her father, and reunites with her ''veere''. Avni on insistence of her mother meets a few prospective grooms. Kalindi's father and step mother offers to help in her wedding but she is reluctant. She is disturbed by ceremonial demands of Rishabh's family and her own aversion to marriage, resulting in anxiety. During her engagement, Rishabh comments about her not having a proper family, which infuriates her and she leaves the gathering. Avni gets drunk to forget the fact that her prospective groom rejected her and ends up sleeping with Bhandari, Rishabh's cousin. Meera gets drunk and Sakshi leaves party midway because of taunts of 'aunties'.\n\nThe next morning, they find Kalindi in her old home which is a bone of contention between the brothers. Rishabh apologizes to Kalindi and they patch up. However, she explains that she cannot fulfill his family's expectations of her and they mutually break up the engagement. Her friends however, are not supportive of this decision, and try to reason with her, explaining that Rishabh is a good man and she shouldn't run away from marriage due to issues over his family. Kalindi stubbornly points out each of her friend's flaws instead, resulting in everyone getting into an argument and leaving.\n\nSometime later, Sakshi, believing they have become too overwhelmed with life's troubles, buys her ''veere'' a vacation to [[Thailand]]. They reconnect and come clean about their respective issues: Kalindi about her commitment issues stemming from her dysfunctional family; Avni about wanting to marry the right guy and sleeping with Bhandari; Sakshi about why her husband wants to divorce her. Sakshi and her husband were always fighting after marriage. One day, he walked on her [[masturbating]]; appalled, he decides to divorce her. Sakshi is embarrassed to tell her parents the truth about the divorce. Meera explains that she and John haven't had sex in a year after the birth of her son. Everyone decides to go back and face their problems. Sakshi tells her parents the truth and to her surprise, they are very supportive. John comes to India. Meera and he gets intimate. Avni tells her mom about her reluctance to settle for arranged marriage. Kalindi finds that Rishabh's father has been arrested for bank fraud as loan is not paid. Avni arranges for his bail.\n\nKalindi's friends pressurize Kuki uncle to resolve his four-year feud with his brother for Kalindi's happiness; they talk and resolve, this improves relations between father and daughter. The brothers transfer the family house to Kalindi as their gift. She proposes to Rishabh and they decide to marry but in a simple and stylish way.\n\nOn wedding day held in her renovated home, Kalindi wears her mother's old wedding gown and the ceremony is a small intimate affair with fewer guests. John calls Meera's father Kabir Singh and tells them about his grandson. He comes to the wedding and plays with his grandson Kabir. Sakshi gives news of her divorce settlement to 'aunties'. Avni decides to give Bhandari a chance, as he is smitten with her.\n\nThe film ends with everyone dancing at Kalindi and Rishabh's wedding reception.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kareena Kapoor Khan]] as Kalindi Puri\n** Smriti Setya as Young Kalindi\n* [[Sonam Kapoor Ahuja]] as Avni Sharma\n** Muskaan Khubchandani as Young Avni\n* [[Swara Bhaskar]] as Sakshi Aunty\n** Muskaan Malhotra as Young Sakshi\n* Shikha Talsania as Meera Kaur Stinson\n** Kashish Kanwar as Young Meera\n* Kavita Ghai as Ritu Puri, Kalindi's mother\n* [[Neena Gupta]] as Avni's mother\n* [[Sumeet Vyas]] as Rishabh Malhotra, Kalindi's fianc\u00e9\n* Vishwas Kini as a Bhandari/stalker\n* [[Vivek Mushran]] as Kalindi's Uncle \n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Rishabh's mother\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Rishabh's father \n* [[Alka Kaushal]] as a Santosh aunty/ Bhandari's mom\n* [[Ekavali Khanna]] as Paromita \n* Sukesh Arora as Cookies friend \n* [[Anjum Rajabali]] as Some tharki baba\n* Ishwak Singh as a dummy\n* [[Suraj Singh]] as Vineet\n* [[Edward Sonnenblick]] as a John Stinson, Meera's husband\n* [[Kamlesh Gill]] as Jhaaiji\n* Bubbles Sabharwal as Sakshi's mother\n* Babla Kochar as Bade Papas ex bf\n* Muskaan Khubchandani as Young Avani\n* Kalpana Jha as Shanti\n* Jitpreet Singh Gill as Sakshi aunty\u2019s boyfriend aka Bade Papa{{div col end}}\n<br />\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn December 2015, [[Sonam Kapoor]] indicated that she would be working on a project with her sister [[Rhea Kapoor]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/sonam-kapoor-not-doing-aashiqui-3-her-next-is-with-sister-rhea/ |title= Sonam Kapoor not doing 'Aashiqui 3', her next is with sister Rhea|accessdate=18 December 2015 |author=PTI |date=18 September 2012 }}</ref> The project was officially announced in June 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-sonam-kapoor-and-kareena-kapoor-khan-come-together-for-veere-di-wedding-2223659 |title= Veere Di Wedding: Sonam Kapoor gears up for an all-girls ride with Kareena Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar|accessdate=14 June 2016 |author=DNA}}</ref>\n\nThe project was delayed due to Kareena Kapoor's pregnancy.

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.
