The Tahquamenon Falls include a single 50-foot (15 m) drop, the ''Upper Falls'', plus the cascades and rapids collectively called the ''Lower Falls''. During the late-spring runoff, the river drains as much as 50,000 gallons (200,000 liters) of water per second, making the upper falls the second most voluminous vertical waterfall east of the [[Mississippi River]], after only [[Niagara Falls]].<ref name=\"MDNR\">{{cite web |author = [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]] |publisher = Michigan Department of Natural Resources |url = http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=428&type=SPRK |title = Tahquamenon Falls State Park Detail |year = 2007 |access-date = October 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Paradise to Newberry===\nEast of Paradise, M-123 runs along the Tahquamenon River inside the state park boundaries.

Continuing along the bay as Whitefish Road, M-123 meets the community of [[Paradise, Michigan|Paradise]], the northernmost point along the highway. It is here that M-123 intersects Whitefish Point Road, which continues north to [[Whitefish Point]], home of the [[Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum]]. In either direction, M-123 runs southbound from Paradise, changing direction. Continuing east of Paradise, M-123 is the only paved road that serves the Tahquamenon Falls State Park and the Whitefish Point region.<ref name=\"MDOT07\"/><ref name=\"google123\"/>\n\n===Tahquamenon Falls State Park===\n{{main|Tahquamenon Falls State Park}}\n\n[[File:2009-0618-TahquamenonFalls.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Tahquamenon Falls are a major tourist attraction along the route of M-123.]]\nThe Tahquamenon Falls State Park is a 46,179 acre (186.9&nbsp;km\u00b2) [[state park]] in the U.S. state of Michigan.  It is the second largest of [[List of Michigan state parks|Michigan's state parks]].  Bordering on [[Lake Superior]], most of the park is located within [[Chippewa County, Michigan|Chippewa County]], with the western section of the park extending into [[Luce County, Michigan|Luce County]]. The park follows the [[Tahquamenon River]] as it passes over [[Tahquamenon Falls]] and drains into [[Whitefish Bay]], Lake Superior.  The Tahquamenon Falls include a single 50-foot (15 m) drop, the ''Upper Falls'', plus the cascades and rapids collectively called the ''Lower Falls''. During the late-spring runoff, the river drains as much as 50,000 gallons (200,000 liters) of water per second, making the upper falls the second most voluminous vertical waterfall east of the [[Mississippi River]], after only [[Niagara Falls]].<ref name=\"MDNR\">{{cite web |author= Staff |publisher= [[Michigan Department of Natural Resources]] |url= http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=428&type=SPRK |title= Tahquamenon Falls State Park Detail |year= 2007 |accessdate= October 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Paradise to Newberry===\nEast of Paradise, M-123 runs along the Tahquamenon River inside the state park boundaries.

It runs south and west across Murphy Creek and the Auger River before intersecting with [[H-37 (Michigan county highway)|H-37]] at Four Mile Corner. The highway crosses a branch of the Tahquamenon River one last time before becoming Newberry Avenue in the city of [[Newberry, Michigan|Newberry]]. The highest [[annual average daily traffic]], a measure of traffic volume,  was recorded by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) for M-123 in 2007 along Newberry Avenue at 7,500&nbsp;vehicles.<ref name=\"aadtMI\">{{cite map |author= Michigan Department of Transportation |location= Lansing |scale= Scale not given |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/adtfront_20092_7.pdf  |format= PDF |cartography= MDOT |title= Statewide AADT Map |date= 2007 |accessdate= October 7, 2008}}</ref> South of downtown, M-123 meets M-28 a second time west of Twin Lake.

By 1936, M-123 was designated running north of M-28 on {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} of hard-surface pavement. At this time, US&nbsp;2 is routed along Worth Road and uses roadway later used by M-123 from Moran to Rogers Park, and [[M-48 (Michigan highway)|M-48]] was routed north of Newberry to Four Mile Corner.<ref name=\"MSHD36-06\"/> The first extension of M-123 southward from Eckerman, through [[Trout Lake, Michigan|Trout Lake]] to Rogers Park north of St. Ignace, came in 1954. Part of this routing in Trout Lake uses [[M-48 (Michigan highway)|M-48]] (now a portion of H-40). An additional extension is shown north to the Tahquamenon River Bridge, lengthening the highway to the north on the April 15, 1954 official state map.<ref name=\"MSHD54-04\">{{cite MDOT map |date=1954-04-15 |sections=B10\u2013C10}}</ref> The section north to the Tahquamenon River Bridge is remarked on the October 1, 1954 state map as a county road, however.<ref name=\"MSHD54-10\">{{cite MDOT map |date=1954-10-01 |sections=B10\u2013C10}}</ref> In 1957, M-123 was permanently extended north to the bridge,<ref name=\"MSHD57-10\">{{cite MDOT map |date=1957-10-01 |section=B10}}</ref> and in 1962 the final extension north to Paradise and south to Newberry was completed.
