Mr. Belding breaks the disappointing news that Rod will not be taking everyone on the trip, but offers to step in and take them instead.

Most of his estate went to his eldest son George, who married the daughter of Lawrence Alcock. A trust fund was set up, to be administered partly  by Thomas Bramston of Skreens, for   his daughters and younger son. His eldest daughter married the third son of [[Sir Herbert Croft, 1st Baronet]].

In April 1713 he became an alderman of Maldon. He voted for the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713, and  was returned unopposed at the [[1713 British general election]].  He was brought into the commission of the peace for Essex in March 1714.\n\nBramston was returned in a contest for Maldon at the [[1715 British general election]]  In October 1715 when his cousin, Anthony Bramston and  others were arrested on suspicion of being disaffected to George I, it was probably Thomas Bramston who donated \u2018a sirloin of beef and a turkey\u2019 to those imprisoned, which may account for his removal from the bench in March 1716. He was bailiff of Maldon  in 1716, and 1720. At the [[1722 British general election]] he was returned for Maldon again in a contest and listed as a Tory.  At the [[1727 British general election]] he was probably replaced by his namesake [[Thomas Bramston (1691\u20131765)|Thomas Bramston of Skreens]].\n\nBramston died on 30 May 1737, leaving two surviving sons and three daughters. Most of his estate went to his eldest son George, who married the daughter of Lawrence Alcock. A trust fund was set up, to be administered partly  by Thomas Bramston of Skreens, for   his daughters and younger son. His eldest daughter married the third son of [[Sir Herbert Croft, 1st Baronet]]. It took two years to obtain probate, because in spite of Bramston\u2019s role in the chancery office, his will was full of confusing obliterations and interspersed text\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|gb}}\n{{s-bef\n | before  = [[John Comyns]]\n | before2 = [[William Fytche (MP)|William Fytche]]\n}}\n{{s-title\n | title =  [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Maldon (UK Parliament constituency)|Maldon]]\n | years =   1712\u2013[[1727 British general election|1727]]\n | with  =  [[John Comyns]]\n | with2 = [[Samuel Tufnell]]\n | with3 = [[John Comyns|Sir John Comyns]]\n}}\n{{s-aft\n | after  = [[Henry Parsons (English politician)|Henry Parsons]]\n | after2 = [[Thomas Bramston (1691\u20131765)|Thomas Bramston II]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bramston, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1658 births]]\n[[Category:1737 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1710\u20131713]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1713\u20131715]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1715\u20131722]]\n[[Category:British MPs 1722\u20131727]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bramston_(1658%E2%80%931737)"}

Around 1757, he obtained a post as Clerk in the [[War Office]]. He married Elizabeth Wilson, daughter of Robert Wilson, of Woodford, Essex and merchant of London, in November 1757. Elizabeth's sister had married [[Anthony Chamier]] who also became a public official at the War Office. In 1759 Bradshaw was promoted to first clerk at the War Office where he served under [[William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington|Lord Barrington]]. When Barrington became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1761, he took Bradshaw to the [[Treasury]] as chief clerk in December 1761. In February 1763 Bradshaw became commissioner of taxes. As an important civil servant, he became connected with several influential politicians, including the [[Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]].  When Grafton was first lord of the Treasury, he appointed Bradshaw [[Secretary to the Treasury]] in August 1767.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/bradshaw-thomas-1733-74 | title= BRADSHAW, Thomas (1733-74), of Hampton Court, Mdx. | publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate = 23 October 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:The Bradshaw Family by Zoffany, 1769. Tate Britain.jpg|thumb|right|The Bradshaw Family by [[Johann Zoffany]], 1769. The original is at [[Tate Britain]] ]]\n\n==Political career==\nGrafton brought Bradshaw into the House of Commons  as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Harwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Harwich]], a Government borough, at a by-election on 30 November 1767.  Bradshaw helped Grafton with the [[1768 British general election|1768 general election]] and was returned himself unopposed as MP for [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]]. From then on he acted mainly as Grafton's confidential man of business in both public and private matters. He acted as Grafton's go-between with Lord North, and when Grafton wanted to divorce [[Anne FitzPatrick|his duchess]] sought evidence of her adultery.<ref name = HOP/>\n\nWhen Grafton resigned in January 1770 he obtained for Bradshaw the reversion for two lives of the office of auditor general of the plantations worth upwards of \u00a32500 a year, and a pension of \u00a31500 a year until the post became vacant. Bradshaw remained at the Treasury, at the request of Grafton and North to induct [[John Robinson (Treasury)|John Robinson]] into his duties. In April 1772 Bradshaw was made a [[Lord of the Admiralty]] but when he stood for re-election at Saltash was defeated. He was then returned on petition on 8 June 1772. He was returned unopposed for Saltash at the  [[1774 British general election|1774 general election]], shortly before his death. He is not known to have participated in parliamentary debates.<ref name = HOP/>\n\n==Later life and legacy==\nBradshaw was noted for his \u201cunbounded extravagance\u201d and a \u201cgay and social disposition\u201d.  He died on 6 November 1774, by one account from a fever and by another by shooting himself because he was burdened with debts. His will provided for his family on the strength of the auditorship-general of the plantations, but he never reached that office because it was only held only in reversion.
