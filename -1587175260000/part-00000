Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.

Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar proclaimed as \"King of Poland\". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.<ref>Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871\u20131900)'' (1981)</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the [[Piast Concept]]. It held there was a Polish utopia during the [[Piast dynasty|Piast Dynasty]] a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the \"Piast Concept\" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democracy Party]], known as the \"Endecja,\" which was led by [[Roman Dmowski]]. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A.

The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s.

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.  The key episode was the [[Russo-Japanese War|decisive defeat of Russia]] by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat which quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey, and Persia.<ref>Rotem Kowner, ed., ''The impact of the Russo-Japanese war'' (Routledge, 2006).</ref> In China [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866\u20131925) launched his new party the [[Kuomintang]] (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. Kuomintang recruits pledged:\n:from this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.<ref>Hans Kohn, ''Nationalism: Its Meaning and History'' (1955) p. 87.</ref>\nThe Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun's nationalism as well as by the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism.<ref>Shakhar Rahav, ''The Rise of Political Intellectuals in Modern China: May Fourth Societies and the Roots of Mass-Party Politics'' (Oxford UP, 2015).</ref> The [[New Culture Movement]] stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to historian Patricia Ebrey:\n:Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], [[warlordism]], autocracy, [[patriarchy]], and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p. 271</ref>\n:\n\n==== Greece ====\n{{Main articles|Greek nationalism}}\nNationalist [[Irredentism|irredentist]] movements Greek advocating for [[Enosis]] (unity of ethnincally Greek states with the [[Greece|Hellenic Republic]] to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of [[Cyprus]], as well as the [[Megali Idea]], the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as [[Crete]], [[Ionia]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Northern Epirus]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Thrace]] among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish war of 1919]]. \n\nThe [[4th of August Regime|4th of August regime]] was a [[Fascism|fascist]] or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and led by Greek general [[Ioannis Metaxas]] from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] respectively. It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

Many scholars believe that the development of nationalism in Europe (and subsequently the modern nation-state) was due to the threat of war. \"External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat\".<sup>[[Nationalism#cite note-herbst-war-and-state-62|[62]]]</sup> With increased external threats, the state's extractive capacities increase.

They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nProminent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272\u201373}}<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4236409|title = Evolution, Mobility, and Ethnic Group Formation|journal = Politics and the Life Sciences|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 59\u201371|last1 = Goetze|first1 = David|year = 1998|doi = 10.1017/S0730938400025363}}</ref>\n\nThis approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 \"[[What is a Nation?]]\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily [[plebiscite]]\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.<ref name=\"blackwell\"/>\n\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with [[liberal nationalism]], although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).  Renan argued that factors such as ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling dynasty and historic military deeds were important but not sufficient.

She states:\n:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country. They did succeed by uniting several [[South Slavs|south Slavic]] people into [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918.<ref>Ivo Banac, ''The National Question in Yugoslavia'' (Cornell University Press, 1984).</ref>\n\n===Anti-colonial nationalism===\n[[File:Crowd demonstrates against Great Britain in Cairo.jpg|thumb|Crowd demonstrates against Britain in [[Cairo]] on 23 October 1951 as tension continued to mount in the dispute between Egypt and Britain over control of the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].]]\nThis form of nationalism came about during the [[decolonization]] of the post war periods. It was a reaction mainly in Africa and Asia against being subdued by foreign powers. It also appeared in the non-Russian territories of the Tsarist empire and later, the USSR, where Ukrainianists and Islamic Marxists condemned Russian Bolshevik rule in their territories as a renewed Russian imperialism.

(see [[Pan-Islamism]])<ref>''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. \"Muslims\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Marxists]] and other [[socialists]] and [[communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2 August 2008|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the topic, [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place. More abstractly, nationalism is \"power-hunger tempered by self-deception\".<ref name=NonN>George Orwell, [http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat Notes on Nationalism], [http://orwell.ru orwell.ru].</ref>\n\nFor Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:\n\n{{quote|There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129\u201349 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.<ref>Motyl 1:298</ref>\n\nThe [[pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]]. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars.

The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army. Crispi, whose private life (he was perhaps a trigamist) and personal finances...were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.| R.J.B.

Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War. After 1945, the Catholics returned to government and tensions eased somewhat, but the former two Sicilies remained poor and ridiculed. The working class now voted for the [[Communist party|Communist Party]], and it looked to Moscow rather than Rome for inspiration, and was kept out of the national government even as it controlled industrial cities across the North.

In the 1790s, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]\ninvaded, annexed, and subsequently [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar proclaimed as \"King of Poland\". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.<ref>Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871\u20131900)'' (1981)</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the [[Piast Concept]]. It held there was a Polish utopia during the [[Piast dynasty|Piast Dynasty]] a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the \"Piast Concept\" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democracy Party]], known as the \"Endecja,\" which was led by [[Roman Dmowski]]. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A.

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.  The key episode was the [[Russo-Japanese War|decisive defeat of Russia]] by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat which quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey, and Persia.<ref>Rotem Kowner, ed., ''The impact of the Russo-Japanese war'' (Routledge, 2006).</ref> In China [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866\u20131925) launched his new party the [[Kuomintang]] (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. Kuomintang recruits pledged:\n:from this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.<ref>Hans Kohn, ''Nationalism: Its Meaning and History'' (1955) p. 87.</ref>\nThe Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun's nationalism as well as by the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism.<ref>Shakhar Rahav, ''The Rise of Political Intellectuals in Modern China: May Fourth Societies and the Roots of Mass-Party Politics'' (Oxford UP, 2015).</ref> The [[New Culture Movement]] stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to historian Patricia Ebrey:\n:Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], [[warlordism]], autocracy, [[patriarchy]], and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p. 271</ref>\n:\n\n==== Greece ====\n{{Main articles|Greek nationalism}}\nNationalist [[Irredentism|irredentist]] movements Greek advocating for [[Enosis]] (unity of ethnincally Greek states with the [[Greece|Hellenic Republic]] to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of [[Cyprus]], as well as the [[Megali Idea]], the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as [[Crete]], [[Ionia]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Northern Epirus]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Thrace]] among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish war of 1919]]. \n\nThe [[4th of August Regime|4th of August regime]] was a [[Fascism|fascist]] or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and led by Greek general [[Ioannis Metaxas]] from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] respectively. It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''.

Many scholars believe that the development of nationalism in Europe (and subsequently the modern nation-state) was due to the threat of war. \"External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat\".<sup>[[Nationalism#cite note-herbst-war-and-state-62|[62]]]</sup> With increased external threats, the state's extractive capacities increase.

They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nProminent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272\u201373}}<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4236409|title = Evolution, Mobility, and Ethnic Group Formation|journal = Politics and the Life Sciences|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 59\u201371|last1 = Goetze|first1 = David|year = 1998|doi = 10.1017/S0730938400025363}}</ref>\n\nThis approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).  Renan argued that factors such as ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling dynasty and historic military deeds were important but not sufficient.

She states:\n:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country. They did succeed by uniting several [[South Slavs|south Slavic]] people into [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918.<ref>Ivo Banac, ''The National Question in Yugoslavia'' (Cornell University Press, 1984).</ref>\n\n===Anti-colonial nationalism===\n[[File:Crowd demonstrates against Great Britain in Cairo.jpg|thumb|Crowd demonstrates against Britain in [[Cairo]] on 23 October 1951 as tension continued to mount in the dispute between Egypt and Britain over control of the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].]]\nThis form of nationalism came about during the [[decolonization]] of the post war periods. It was a reaction mainly in Africa and Asia against being subdued by foreign powers. It also appeared in the non-Russian territories of the Tsarist empire and later, the USSR, where Ukrainianists and Islamic Marxists condemned Russian Bolshevik rule in their territories as a renewed Russian imperialism.

(see [[Pan-Islamism]])<ref>''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. \"Muslims\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Marxists]] and other [[socialists]] and [[communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2 August 2008|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the topic, [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place. More abstractly, nationalism is \"power-hunger tempered by self-deception\".<ref name=NonN>George Orwell, [http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat Notes on Nationalism], [http://orwell.ru orwell.ru].</ref>\n\nFor Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:\n\n{{quote|There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129\u201349 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.<ref>Motyl 1:298</ref>\n\nThe [[pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]]. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. British pacifist [[Bertrand Russell]] criticizes nationalism for diminishing the individual's capacity to judge his or her fatherland's foreign policy.<ref>''Russell Speaks His Mind'', 1960.

She is a rising star of the ensemble cast and works hard to be the best comedian she can be. Sonny often tries to solve the ongoing feud between the ''Mackenzie Falls'' and ''So Random!'' casts, especially when she dates the star of \"Mackenzie Falls,\" Chad Dylan Cooper. She was Chad's girlfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice\". As seen in further episodes, all of her co-stars are very fond of her. She does not appear in ''[[So Random!]]'', due to Lovato's departure.\n* [[Tiffany Thornton]] as Tawni Hart\n*: Tawni is a main cast member of \"So Random!\" who is jealous of Sonny. She originally feared Sonny was moving in on her spotlight and acted meanly towards the newcomer. However, after a while, the two become best friends. Tawni is a [[diva]]; she loves mirrors, make-up and everything about herself. She is self-centered, but also talented and has a soft side. She has a similar personality to Chad. She prefers to wear \"Coco Mocho Coco\" lipstick, as stated in many episodes.\n* [[Sterling Knight]] as Chad Dylan Cooper\n*: Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on ''Mackenzie Falls'', the rival teen TV series of ''So Random!''. He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the ''So Random!'' cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Nico Harris\n*: Nico is a cast member of ''So Random!'' who is best friends with Grady. He is always striking out with the girls and has a crush on ''Mackenzie Falls'' star Penelope, who constantly turns him down when he asks her out. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared. He is said to have been discovered in a one-man band.\n* [[Doug Brochu]] as Grady Mitchell\n*: Grady is a cast member of ''So Random!''. He is best friends with Nico who often calls him \"G\". Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico. He is shown to be dull-witted, gullible and immature. He also comes up with very strange conclusions to certain situations. He loves to eat and hates exercising. He claims to be an expert lip-reader, but very often misreads his targets' mouths and comes up with non-sensical sentences. In the episode \"The New Girl\" he tells Nico that when he's around a girl that he believes likes him, he will turn into a Scotsman named Seamus McGregor. He has a big brother named Grant who is in college and is the leader of his own fraternity.\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Zora Lancaster\n*: Zora is the youngest cast member of ''So Random!''. She is very smart, mysterious, crazy and clever. She is the most cunning of the 'So Random!' cast and is known as \"the weird one\". She often pops out of nowhere, surprising her friends. She is somewhat a detective and puts her skills to use in the \"So Random\" studio. She listens in on her friends' conversations and then shocks them by speaking to them about it later on. She appeared sporadically throughout the second season.\n\n==Production==\nThe original working title for the series was ''Sketchpad!'', and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to ''Welcome to Mollywood''. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to ''Welcome to Holliwood''. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to ''Sonny with a Chance''. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with [[Bridgit Mendler]] for the role, but Lovato was chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|title=Lemonade Mouth Star: Bridgit Mendler|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925105138/http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Sonny with a Chance'' has a [[story within a story|show-within-a-show]], ''So Random!'', complete with fully produced sketches.

The show's name, ''Mackenzie Falls'', comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a [[waterfall]]). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of ''So Random!'' made a parody of ''Mackenzie Falls'' titled ''Mackenzie [[Public toilet|Stalls]]'', which was set in a [[bathroom]].

It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).\n\nA full-length version of this theme was released via the [[Radio Disney]] network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere.

She is a rising star of the ensemble cast and works hard to be the best comedian she can be. Sonny often tries to solve the ongoing feud between the ''Mackenzie Falls'' and ''So Random!'' casts, especially when she dates the star of \"Mackenzie Falls,\" Chad Dylan Cooper. She was Chad's girlfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice\". As seen in further episodes, all of her co-stars are very fond of her. She does not appear in ''[[So Random!]]'', due to Lovato's departure.\n* [[Tiffany Thornton]] as Tawni Hart\n*: Tawni is a main cast member of \"So Random!\" who is jealous of Sonny. She originally feared Sonny was moving in on her spotlight and acted meanly towards the newcomer. However, after a while, the two become best friends. Tawni is a [[diva]]; she loves mirrors, make-up and everything about herself. She is self-centered, but also talented and has a soft side. She has a similar personality to Chad. She prefers to wear \"Coco Mocho Coco\" lipstick, as stated in many episodes.\n* [[Sterling Knight]] as Chad Dylan Cooper\n*: Chad is a teen heartthrob as the star on ''Mackenzie Falls'', the rival teen TV series of ''So Random!''. He is stubborn, egotistical, pampered, and self-centered, but he has a soft side, which he usually only shows to Sonny. He and Sonny had a love-hate relationship until the 2nd season when he was Sonny's boyfriend as of the episode \"Falling for the Falls\" until they split in \"Sonny with a Choice.\" As a result of this romance, he started to warm up to the ''So Random!'' cast and eventually started to \"hang out\" with them. It is shown that he still has feelings for Sonny in the episode after they split. In the first season, he was seen as a stubborn, vain young man, but in later episodes, he has changed to be more loving and kind. Throughout season 1 he displays feelings for Sonny. For example, in the episode \"Sonny with a Chance of Dating\" Chad was jealous when he found out Sonny was going on a date with James. In addition, in the same episode, when Chad and Sonny were fake dating, Chad said to put her head on his shoulder hinting that he likes her. In the episode, \"You've got Fan Mail\", Sonny seems touched that Chad actually cared enough to dress up as Eric for her. Chad tries to cover it up by saying he just wanted to try on the beard that went along with the Eric costume. Again, in episode 16 of the first season, \"Sonny in the Kitchen with Dinner\", Chad becomes jealous when he sees the news on a magazine about Sonny kissing Hayden because of the kiss cam.\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Nico Harris\n*: Nico is a cast member of ''So Random!'' who is best friends with Grady. He is always striking out with the girls and has a crush on ''Mackenzie Falls'' star Penelope, who constantly turns him down when he asks her out. A running gag throughout the series is Nico jumping into Grady's arms when he gets scared. He is said to have been discovered in a one-man band.\n* [[Doug Brochu]] as Grady Mitchell\n*: Grady is a cast member of ''So Random!''. He is best friends with Nico who often calls him \"G\". Grady is always involved in strange plans with Nico. He is shown to be dull-witted, gullible and immature. He also comes up with very strange conclusions to certain situations. He loves to eat and hates exercising. He claims to be an expert lip-reader, but very often misreads his targets' mouths and comes up with non-sensical sentences. In the episode \"The New Girl\" he tells Nico that when he's around a girl that he believes likes him, he will turn into a Scotsman named Seamus McGregor. He has a big brother named Grant who is in college and is the leader of his own fraternity.\n* [[Allisyn Ashley Arm]] as Zora Lancaster\n*: Zora is the youngest cast member of ''So Random!''. She is very smart, mysterious, crazy and clever. She is the most cunning of the 'So Random!' cast and is known as \"the weird one\". She often pops out of nowhere, surprising her friends. She is somewhat a detective and puts her skills to use in the \"So Random\" studio. She listens in on her friends' conversations and then shocks them by speaking to them about it later on. She appeared sporadically throughout the second season.\n\n==Production==\nThe original working title for the series was ''Sketchpad!'', and the original name for the main character was Molly Munroe. The show's title was later changed to ''Welcome to Mollywood''. After the first publicity materials about the show were released, the lead character's name was then changed to Holli and the title changed once again to ''Welcome to Holliwood''. The main character's name was later changed to Sonny Munroe, and the show's title was changed for a final time to ''Sonny with a Chance''. The name is a play on the words \"Sunny with a chance of rain\", as heard in weather forecasts, reflecting the many comical situations in which the cast find themselves in each episode. Originally Lovato auditioned with [[Bridgit Mendler]] for the role, but Lovato was chosen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|title=Lemonade Mouth Star: Bridgit Mendler|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925105138/http://voices.yahoo.com/lemonade-mouth-star-bridgit-mendler-8322669.html?cat=40|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}\n\n''Sonny with a Chance'' has a [[story within a story|show-within-a-show]], ''So Random!'', complete with fully produced sketches.

The show is similar to ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and ''[[Gossip Girl]]'', among others. The show's name, ''Mackenzie Falls'', comes from Chad's character's name and the name of the town (which is located near a [[waterfall]]). In the season two episode \"The Legend of Candy Face\", the cast of ''So Random!'' made a parody of ''Mackenzie Falls'' titled ''Mackenzie [[Public toilet|Stalls]]'', which was set in a [[bathroom]]. Minisodes and promos can be seen on the ''Sonny with a Chance'' website along with one minisode as a bonus feature on the DVD.\n\n==Theme song and opening sequence==\nThe show's theme song \"So Far, So Great\", was written and produced by Jeanne Lurie, Chen Neeman and Aristedis \"Aris\" Archontis, who have each written songs for several artists on Disney-owned [[Hollywood Records]]. It is performed by series actress Demi Lovato. The theme is of pop-rock style (the music cues composed by Chris Alan Lee and Scott Clausen, signaling scene changes and commercial breaks are styled similarly).\n\nA full-length version of this theme was released via the [[Radio Disney]] network on March 31, 2009, less than two months after the show's U.S. premiere. The theme song is also featured as a track on the Disney compilation album, ''[[Disney Channel Playlist]]'', released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 9, 2009. The song is also available as the bonus track on Lovato's second album ''[[Here We Go Again (Demi Lovato album)|Here We Go Again]]'', released by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 21, 2009.\n\nIn the [[Russian language|Russian]] version of the series (\"\u0414\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441\" aka Give Sonny a Chance), the cast members' names are rendered in [[Cyrillic]]\u2014and the intro is performed by a different Russian girl in Russian (not by Demi Lovato).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7TJ50fSJrE |title=Sonny With a Chance Russian opening (season 2) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Otherwise, in translation the intro music is not changed.\n\nIn the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version (\"Sunny Entre Estrelas\"), the intro music is sung in translation.\n\n==Broadcast==\n\n===Season 1===\nThe series originally premiered on February 8, 2009 on [[Disney Channel]], [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family Channel]], and [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)]].

These techniques can be used to assess the success of [[cell culture]] techniques, [[cryopreservation]] techniques, the toxicity of substances, or the effectiveness of substances in mitigating effects of toxic substances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/molecular-probes-the-handbook/assays-for-cell-viability-proliferation-and-function/overview-of-probes-for-cell-viability-cell-proliferation-and-live-cell-function.html|title=Overview of Probes for Cell Viability, Cell Proliferation and Live-Cell Function\u2014Section 15.1 - US|website=www.thermofisher.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n== Common Viability Assay Methods ==\nThough simple visual techniques of observing viability can be useful, it can be difficult to thoroughly measure an organism's/part of an organism's viability merely using the observation of physical properties. However, there are a variety of common protocols utilized for further observation of viability using assays.\n\n;Tetrazolium reduction: One useful way to locate and measure viability is to complete a Tetrazolium Reduction Assay. The tetrazolium aspect of this assay, which utilizes both positive and negative charges in its formula, promotes the distinction of cell viability in a specimen.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last=Niles |first=Andrew L. |last2=Moravec |first2=Richard A. |last3=Worzella |first3=Tracy J. |last4=Evans |first4=Nathan J. |last5=Riss |first5=Terry L. | name-list-format = vanc |  chapter = High-Throughput Screening Assays for the Assessment of Cytotoxicity |date=2013-03-04 |doi = 10.1002/9781118538203.ch5 | veditors = Steinberg P | title = High-Throughput Screening Methods in Toxicity Testing |pages=107\u2013127 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. |isbn=978-1-118-53820-3 }}</ref>\n\n;Resazurin reduction: Resazurin Reduction Assays perform very closely to that of a tetrazolium assay, except they use the power of redox to fuel their ability to represent cell viability.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;Protease viability marker: One can look at protease fuction in specimens if they wish to target viability in cells; this practice in research is known as \"Protease Viability Marker Assay Concept\". The actions of protease cease once a cell dies, so a clear-cut line is drawn in determining cell viability when using this technique.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;ATP:ATP is a common energy molecule that many researchers hold extensive knowledge of, thus carrying over to how one understands viability assays. The ATP Assay Concept is a well-known technique for determining the viability of cells using the assessment of ATP and a method known as \"firefly luciferase\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n;Sodium-potassium ratio: Another kind of assay practices the examination of the ratio of [[potassium]] to [[sodium]] in cells to serve as an index of viability. If the cells do not have high intracellular potassium and low intracellular sodium, then (1) the [[cell membrane]] may not be intact, and/or (2) the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]] may not be operating well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindner B, Seydel U | title = Mass spectrometric analysis of drug-induced changes in Na+ and K+ contents of single bacterial cells | journal = Journal of General Microbiology | volume = 129 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u20135 | date = January 1983 | pmid = 6339677 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-129-1-51 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pichugin Y, Fahy GM, Morin R | title = Cryopreservation of rat hippocampal slices by vitrification | journal = Cryobiology | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 228\u201340 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16403489 | doi = 10.1016/j.cryobiol.2005.11.006 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0011224005001896 }}</ref> \u00a0\n\n;Cytolysis or membrane leakage: This category includes the [[lactate dehydrogenase]] assay. Assays such as these contain a stable enzyme common in all cells that can be readily detected when cell membranes are no longer intact.

With his newly acquired title and influence, the district was renamed after his title (a decision that has caused controversy ever since). The neighboring [[Condado (Santurce)|Condado]] also received its present-name from Ubarri's title, as the district's name literally translates to \"county\" (which in medieval tradition is land granted by a monarch to a count).<ref>Cangrejos - Santurce - Authors; An\u00edbal Sep\u00falveda, Jorge Carbonell, Centro de Investigaciones CARIMAR, Oficina Estatal de Preservaci\u00f3n Hist\u00f3rica.</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Paris (1898)===\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] provided that Cuba would become independent from Spain but the U.S. Congress made sure it would be under U.S. control through the Platt Amendment. It ceded to the United States Puerto Rico, and other adjacent islands then under Spanish sovereignty in the Caribbean, as well as [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in Asia-Pacific region.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\" />\n\nThe United States Army established the now historical [[Camp Las Casas]], in the area of \"Las Casas\" in 1904. The camp was the main training base of the \"Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry\" (on January 15, 1899, the military government changed the name of Puerto Rico to Porto Rico and on May 17, 1932, U.S. Congress changed the name back to \"Puerto Rico\") The Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was a segregated U.S. Army Regiment which was later renamed the \"[[65th Infantry Regiment (United States)|65th Infantry Regiment]]\".  Correction on the previous statement :  The 65th Infantry Regiment was not segregated.  It was a Regular Army Regiment that accepted personnel of every race but blacks, there was a black Regiment in the Island for that purpose, the 375th Regiment.  The base continued in operation until 1946, when it was finally closed and the [[Residencial Las Casas]] now stands.<ref name=\"HMPR\">\"Historia Militar de Puerto Rico\"; by [[H\u00e9ctor Andr\u00e9s Negroni]]; pg. 370; {{ISBN|84-7888-138-7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States]] took control of Puerto Rico from [[Spain]] in the aftermath of the [[Spanish-American War]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]].

It is 7.6&nbsp;km long from west to east, and up to 3.0&nbsp;km wide in the eastern part. The peninsula is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean in the north, with more than five km of beaches from the [[Condado (Santurce)|Condado]] peninsula in the west, to a point 600 m east of \"Punta Las Mar\u00edas\", where it borders on the Isla Verde area, and \"Laguna San Jos\u00e9\" and its northern [[Headlands and bays|embayment]], \"Laguna Los Corozos\" to the east.\n\nTo the south is the [[Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a Channel]], which separates Santurce from the northern barrios of former municipio [[R\u00edo Piedras, Puerto Rico|R\u00edo Piedras]]: [[Hato Rey Norte]], [[Hato Rey Central]], and [[Oriente, San Juan, Puerto Rico|Oriente]].  To the west is [[San Juan Bay]], where three bridges, \"Puente Dos Hermanos\" (Ave. Ashford), \"Puente G. Esteves\" ([[Avenida Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n|Ave. Ponce de Le\u00f3n]]) and \"Puente San Antonio\" (Ave. Fernandes Juncos) connect Santurce with \"La Isleta\" (small island) where [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico|Old San Juan]] is located.\nIt has a total area of {{convert|8.70|sqmi|km2}} composed of {{convert|5.24|sqmi|km2}} of land and {{convert|3.46|sqmi|km2}} of water area.\n\nThe topography is mainly flat with low hills toward the central areas and swampy areas to the south along the Mart\u00edn Pe\u00f1a Channel and to the east near the Laguna San Jos\u00e9 (San Jos\u00e9 Lagoon). The highest point is at [[Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n / Monteflores (Santurce)|Monteflores]] with {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}.\n\n==Location==\nSanturce is located along the north-eastern coast of Puerto Rico. It lies south of the Atlantic Ocean, east of [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico|Old San Juan]] and west of [[Isla Verde, Puerto Rico|Isla Verde]]. The district occupies an area of {{convert|5.24|sqmi|km2}} of land and 3.46 (8.96 km2) of water.

Many years after his arrival he was granted the title of Count of Santurce (which is the Hispanicized equivalent of Santurtzi) by the Spanish Crown. With his newly acquired title and influence, the district was renamed after his title (a decision that has caused controversy ever since). The neighboring [[Condado (Santurce)|Condado]] also received its present-name from Ubarri's title, as the district's name literally translates to \"county\" (which in medieval tradition is land granted by a monarch to a count).<ref>Cangrejos - Santurce - Authors; An\u00edbal Sep\u00falveda, Jorge Carbonell, Centro de Investigaciones CARIMAR, Oficina Estatal de Preservaci\u00f3n Hist\u00f3rica.</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Paris (1898)===\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] provided that Cuba would become independent from Spain but the U.S. Congress made sure it would be under U.S. control through the Platt Amendment. It ceded to the United States Puerto Rico, and other adjacent islands then under Spanish sovereignty in the Caribbean, as well as [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in Asia-Pacific region.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\" />\n\nThe United States Army established the now historical [[Camp Las Casas]], in the area of \"Las Casas\" in 1904. The camp was the main training base of the \"Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry\" (on January 15, 1899, the military government changed the name of Puerto Rico to Porto Rico and on May 17, 1932, U.S. Congress changed the name back to \"Puerto Rico\") The Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry was a segregated U.S. Army Regiment which was later renamed the \"[[65th Infantry Regiment (United States)|65th Infantry Regiment]]\".  Correction on the previous statement :  The 65th Infantry Regiment was not segregated.  It was a Regular Army Regiment that accepted personnel of every race but blacks, there was a black Regiment in the Island for that purpose, the 375th Regiment.

A minor portion are descendants of [[Jewish Cuban]]s who came to establishment after [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959. Like in many former Spanish colonies founded soon after the [[Spanish Inquisition]], there are some Puerto Ricans who are [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jews]]. Recent DNA ancestry has identified a number of Portuguese descendants who arrived in Puerto Rico after the start of the Portuguese Inquisition in 1536. These are descendants of Convers\u00f3 families.

They have been part of the community for over 70 years. Both teams have enjoyed great domestic success, the baseball team is regarded{{By whom|date=June 2013}} as the \u2018[[New York Yankees]] of [[Puerto Rico]]\u2019, largely in part to the accomplishments of its legendary players, such as [[Roberto Clemente]] and [[Willie Mays]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.\n\n==Health==\nSanturce has an extensive healthcare network which includes two of the finest hospitals on the island, Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital and Pavia Hospital.\n\n==Economy==\n{{see also|Economy of Puerto Rico|Real estate in Puerto Rico}}\nSanturce experienced significant economic growth following World War II.
