It was administered by a succession of other Michigan counties prior to the organization of county government in 1857.A majority of the population used to be Chippewa Indians, the area offered shelter from tall white pines, and food from the river and lake. Iosco County was cut from a piece of land seded from the Chippewa Indians to the United States Government.

The large company town included internal rail lines for transportation and a [[Tramway (industrial)|tramway]] extending over [[Lake Huron]] on long piers for loading gypsum onto ships. Started in 1862, the mine supplied gypsum for temporary buildings constructed in [[Chicago]] at the [[World Columbian Exposition]] of 1893.<ref>{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref> At present, two companies continue to mine gypsum in Iosco County.\n\nIn 2009, Alabaster Township formed the non-profit Alabaster Wind Power Development Corp. to conduct the necessary 2-year studies of wind data at this site as a potential location for the development of [[wind turbine]]s. It proposed using 10 large tramway platforms which extend more than 6,000 feet into the lake to gauge winds. The turbines could be built on the tramways.

Swimming is a great way to exercise the joints with minimal damage.<ref name=\"Saladinp274\"/>\n\nA joint disorder is termed [[arthropathy]], and when involving [[inflammation]] of one or more joints the disorder is called [[arthritis]]. Most joint disorders involve arthritis, but joint damage by external [[physical trauma]] is typically not termed arthritis.\n\nArthropathies are called ''polyarticular'' (multiarticular) when involving many joints and ''monoarticular'' when involving only a single joint.\n\nArthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55. There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis, [[osteoarthritis]] (also known as degenerative joint disease), occurs following trauma to the joint, following an [[infection]] of the joint or simply as a result of aging and the deterioration of articular cartilage. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and [[psoriatic arthritis]], which are [[autoimmune disorder|autoimmune diseases]] in which the body is attacking itself. [[Septic arthritis]] is caused by joint infection. [[Gout|Gouty arthritis]] is caused by deposition of [[uric acid]] crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal-shaped crystals of [[calcium pyrophosphate]]. This form of gout is known as [[Chondrocalcinosis|pseudogout]].\n\n[[Temporomandibular joint syndrome]] (TMJ) involves the jaw joints and can cause facial pain, clicking sounds in the jaw, or limitation of jaw movement, to name a few symptoms. It is caused by psychological tension and misalignment of the jaw ([[malocclusion]]), and may be affecting as many as 75 million Americans.<ref name=\"Saladinp274\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\nThe English word ''joint'' is a past participle of the verb ''join'', and can be read as ''joined''.<ref name=\"Klein1971\">Klein, E.

At the end of the ossicular chain, movement of the stapes footplate within the [[oval window]] of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the [[basilar membrane]]. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the [[organ of Corti]]: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the [[scala vestibuli]] and [[scala tympani]]. Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the [[tectorial membrane (cochlea)|tectorial membrane]] and the [[reticular lamina]] of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position.  When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.\n\nBasilar Membrane motion causes a shearing motion between the reticular lamina and the tectorial membrane, thereby activating the mechano-sensory apparatus of the hair bundle, which in turn generates a [[receptor potential]] in the hair cells.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThus the sound pressure wave is transduced to an electrical signal which can be processed as sound in higher parts of the [[auditory system]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== Skeletal Muscle ==\nWhen a deformation is imposed on a muscle, changes in cellular and molecular conformations link the mechanical forces with biochemical signals, and the close integration of mechanical signals with electrical, metabolic, and hormonal signaling may disguise the aspect of the response that is specific to the mechanical forces.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17127292 |pmc=2043154 |year=2007 |last1=Burkholder |first1=TJ |title=Mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle |volume=12 |pages=174\u201391 |journal=Frontiers in Bioscience |doi=10.2741/2057}}</ref>\n\n== Cartilage ==\n[[File:Mechanically Gated Channel.png|thumb|Mechanically gated channel]]\nOne of the main mechanical functions of articular [[cartilage]] is to act as a low-friction, load-bearing surface.

In addition, studies by Chowdhury TT and Agarwal S have shown that mechanical loading which represents physiological loading conditions will block the production of catabolic mediators (iNOS, COX-2, NO, PGE2) induced by inflammatory cytokines (IL-1) and restore anabolic activities. Thus an improved understanding of the interplay of biomechanics and cell signalling will help to develop therapeutic methods for blocking catabolic components of the mechanotransduction pathway.  A better understanding of the optimal levels of in vivo mechanical forces are therefore necessary for maintaining the health and viability of cartilage, preventative techniques may be devised for the prevention of cartilage degradation and disease.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2008.054239 |title=Mechanotherapy: How physical therapists' prescription of exercise promotes tissue repair |year=2009 |last1=Khan |first1=K M |last2=Scott |first2=A |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=247\u201352 |pmid=19244270 |pmc=2662433}}\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.405716 |title=Biophysics of the cochlea: Linear approximation |year=1993 |last1=Mammano |first1=F. |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=3320\u201332 |pmid=8326060 |last2=Nobili |first2=R|bibcode = 1993ASAJ...93.3320M }}\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1906851 |title=DC Resting Potentials Inside the Cochlear Partition |year=1952 |last1=v.

At the end of the ossicular chain, movement of the stapes footplate within the [[oval window]] of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the [[basilar membrane]]. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the [[organ of Corti]]: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the [[scala vestibuli]] and [[scala tympani]]. Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the [[tectorial membrane (cochlea)|tectorial membrane]] and the [[reticular lamina]] of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position.  When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.\n\nBasilar Membrane motion causes a shearing motion between the reticular lamina and the tectorial membrane, thereby activating the mechano-sensory apparatus of the hair bundle, which in turn generates a [[receptor potential]] in the hair cells.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThus the sound pressure wave is transduced to an electrical signal which can be processed as sound in higher parts of the [[auditory system]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n== Skeletal Muscle ==\nWhen a deformation is imposed on a muscle, changes in cellular and molecular conformations link the mechanical forces with biochemical signals, and the close integration of mechanical signals with electrical, metabolic, and hormonal signaling may disguise the aspect of the response that is specific to the mechanical forces.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17127292 |pmc=2043154 |year=2007 |last1=Burkholder |first1=TJ |title=Mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle |volume=12 |pages=174\u201391 |journal=Frontiers in Bioscience |doi=10.2741/2057}}</ref>\n\n== Cartilage ==\n[[File:Mechanically Gated Channel.png|thumb|Mechanically gated channel]]\nOne of the main mechanical functions of articular [[cartilage]] is to act as a low-friction, load-bearing surface.

In addition, studies by Chowdhury TT and Agarwal S have shown that mechanical loading which represents physiological loading conditions will block the production of catabolic mediators (iNOS, COX-2, NO, PGE2) induced by inflammatory cytokines (IL-1) and restore anabolic activities. Thus an improved understanding of the interplay of biomechanics and cell signalling will help to develop therapeutic methods for blocking catabolic components of the mechanotransduction pathway.  A better understanding of the optimal levels of in vivo mechanical forces are therefore necessary for maintaining the health and viability of cartilage, preventative techniques may be devised for the prevention of cartilage degradation and disease.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2008.054239 |title=Mechanotherapy: How physical therapists' prescription of exercise promotes tissue repair |year=2009 |last1=Khan |first1=K M |last2=Scott |first2=A |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=247\u201352 |pmid=19244270 |pmc=2662433}}\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.405716 |title=Biophysics of the cochlea: Linear approximation |year=1993 |last1=Mammano |first1=F. |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=93 |issue=6 |pages=3320\u201332 |pmid=8326060 |last2=Nobili |first2=R|bibcode = 1993ASAJ...93.3320M }}\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.1906851 |title=DC Resting Potentials Inside the Cochlear Partition |year=1952 |last1=v.

Nagi Reddy]] and [[Aluri Chakrapani|Chakrapani]]. The film features [[M. G. Ramachandran]] in [[dual role]]s while [[B. Saroja Devi]], [[Rathna (actress)|Rathna]], [[S. V. Ranga Rao]], [[M. N. Nambiar]] play supporting roles. It is a remake of the 1964 [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film ''[[Ramudu Bheemudu]]''. The film is about the two look-alike twins who were separated at birth: One being a coward and the other a courageous man. The rest of the film revolves around the twins whose paths are crossed when they meet each other. ''Enga Veettu Pillai'' was released on 14 January 1965 and emerged a major box office success, running for over 25 weeks in theatres, thereby becoming a [[silver jubilee film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nRamu ([[MGR]]) is an innocent & cowardly one&nbsp;\u2013 the heir to all riches of Poonjolai zamin. He has been raised that way by Susheela ([[Pandari Bai]]) and his sister's husband Narendran Gajendran ([[M. N. Nambiar]]). Ramu shivers at the very mention of his brother in law's name and a whiplash is Narendran's favourite form of punishment. Narendran wants to get Ramu married to Leela ([[B. Saroja Devi]]) for her wealth and he demands dowry, but she is turned off by his cowardice.\n\nNarendran plans to take all off Ramu's wealth and kick him out of the house. Ramu over hears this and runaway.\n\nIlango ([[MGR]]) is a jobless young man, prone to pick a fight and for this reason, he cause trouble for his mother (Rushyendramani). Ilango chase a thief who steal Leela's purse and Leela takes him home mistaking him as Ramu. Ilango enjoys their attention and does not reveal his true identity to them.\n\nMeanwhile, Santha ([[Rathna (actress)|Rathna]]) a village girl finds Ramu who is now unconscious due to hunger and bring him home to his mother Rushyendramani. Ilango teaches a lesson to Narendran while Ramu learns the ways of the world.\n\nNarendran is angered as Ilango interferes in factory matters and made him powerless in front of the workers. He beats his wife susheela accusing her for encouraging Ilango. A fight ensues between Ilango and Narendran, Narendran leave the house with his sister and daughter, Meena.\n\nDue to this, Susheela fall ill and Narendran rejects Ilango's request to come home. Ilango decides to leave and reveal that he was not Ramu through a letter to Narendran. Narendran kidnaps Govindan who is a friend of Ilango and get to know about his whereabouts. Narendran's goons kidnap Ramu mistaking him for Ilango.\n\nThe rest of the story reveals that Ramu and Ilango are brothers who got separated during their childhood. Ilango was adopted by a childless couple. Ilango comes to rescue Ramu and after a fight Narendran see them together and have a change of heart.\n\nThe film ends happily with Ramu marrying Santha and Ilango marrying Leela with the blessings of Narendran and all family members.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[M.

It was one of Hungary's first commercial TV channels and began broadcasting only three days after its main rival [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]].\n\n==About RTL Klub==\nSince its start, RTL Klub has focused to gain viewers from the urban population. The channel airs programs mostly for a younger (18-49) audience.\n\nRTL Klub and TV2 aired two similar major reality series simultaneously. While TV2 purchased the rights of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', RTL Klub produced its own series called ''Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g'' (Real World). ''Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g'' had three seasons between 2002 and 2004. Since its second season the show has been much more successful than the rival ''Big Brother''.\n\nRTL Klub is the most watched TV channel in Hungary since 2002, thanks to the daily Hungarian soap opera ''Bar\u00e1tok k\u00f6zt'' (Among Friends), which is the most watched TV programme in Hungary with more than 2 million viewers; the tabloid magazine ''F\u00f3kusz'' (Focus) and the game show ''Legyen \u00d6n is milliomos'' (''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''). Millionaire is off the schedule from September 2007 after seven years and has replaced by ''A Sz\u00e9f'' (''[[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take It Or Leave It]]'').\n\nFrom the fall-winter season of 2005-2006, RTL Klub has started to broadcast popular American TV shows like ''Lost''. The first episode of ''Lost'' had almost 2 million viewers, and a 50% share. This was a record. The next year Prison Break started with almost 1.6 million. Nowadays a TV show at prime time (21:00) can reach 1-1.5 million viewers. In season 2006-2007 ''Prison Break'' was the most watched American series in Hungary.\n\nFrom the fall season of 2007, RTL Klub has launched two new formats with great success. Poker Face ran like a tournament for six weeks with an average 38-42% share. The other new show was ''[[America's Got Talent|Csillag sz\u00fcletik]]'', the Hungarian version of the RTL ''Got Talent'' format. ''Poker Face'' ended with the super final at 18 December and the time slot of it will be occupied by the new game show ''A Sz\u00e9f'' (''[[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take It or Leave it]]'').\n\nRTL Klub was the only licensed broadcaster of [[Formula One]] in Hungary from 2002 until 2011. After 10 years RTL decided not to renew the licence for Formula 1. The reason was that they wanted to concentrate mainly for the prime time programs because of the shrinking advertising market.<ref>[http://tv24.blog.hu/2011/10/24/a_forma_1_rol_is_lemond_az_rtl \"A Forma-1-r\u0151l is lemond az RTL\" (RTL gives up Formula 1 rights)] October 24, 2011.</ref>\n\nRTL Klub has been the only licensed broadcaster of [[Domino Day]] in Hungary, for 6 years (2004-2009).\n\nFrom 2010, RTL Klub started with 2 winning formats. First of all the channel after 6 years absence successfully relaunched the [[Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g]] franchise. VV4 ran with a 40% SHR among 18-49 demographic.<ref>Est.hu [http://est.hu/cikk/86765 \"Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g 4: T\u00f6retlen siker\" (VV4: Great success)] January 15, 2011.</ref> Secondly they purchased the rights of television talent show [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]. The show ran with a 50% SHR<ref>Est.hu [http://www.pestiest.hu/cikk/82831/az_x-faktor_megeszi_a_megasztart_reggelire] \"Az X-Faktor megeszi a Megaszt\u00e1rt reggelire\" (The X Factor eats Megaszt\u00e1r for breakfast)] September 7, 2010.</ref> among 18-49 demographic which is really high on the Hungarian television market. The Factor crashed the competitor talent show on TV2 so \"Megaszt\u00e1r\" left the time slot of ''The X Factor'' after a few episodes. Because of the success of both format, RTL Klub renewed both show for the 5th and 2nd season respectively.

The show started in the fall of 1998, one year after the foundation of RTL Klub. The show remarkably resembles BBC soap-drama, [[EastEnders]]. Initially, it didn't have the expected ratings, however, bound by the contract, RTL Klub had to keep the show running. Since 2000, the third season, the show has been rarely beaten in ratings in its own timeslot. Today, the average rating of the show is about 2 million viewers, and it's a solid foundation of viewers the channel occasionally builds on.

The 1st seasons of the 2 shows had similar ratings but BB was slightly ahead. Since the 2nd season VV crashed the rival format so BB moved to the late night time slot and died quietly. The 2nd season of VV was followed with a 3rd one which had great ratings again. (There was no BB3.) After the 3rd season of VV ended RTL Klub had the format rested for 6 years. In 2010 they relaunched the format with some changes. VV4 was followed by VV5 in 2011. VV6 started in Winter 2014 on RTL II and the channel continues it with a 7th season in Autumn. RTL Klub sold the format of VV to Czech Republic and Slovakia where the show was called Vyvolen\u00ed. The Czech VV had 3 seasons while the Slovak had 2.

Sportklub aired various sport activities, such as the French and Italian football league (as partner of [[Digi Sport (Hungary)|Digi Sport]]), tennis, poker, [[NCAA]], athletics, [[futsal]] and box. The channel reran the Formula-1 broadcast of the parent channel to 2011. It aired certain matches of the English and the Spanish league, however its main competitors, the sports channels run by the Hungarian public service television [[Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3|MTV]], Sport1 and Sport2, have the first pick of the matches they would like to air. To ease up the load on Sportklub, the parent company also launched Sportklub+ in September 2007, which aired sports events deemed to attract less viewers than the parent channel, but it closed on 15 October 2009.\n\nSportklub closed down in Hungary on 30 April 2016.\n\nSportklub is also available in countries close to Hungary in which countries IKO also operates, including [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]].\n\n===[[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]]===\nIn September 2011, RTL Klub started a project named RTL2 to launch a new RTL channel in [[Hungary]]. In April, 2012 it was announced, that RTL will launch [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]] in September or in October with ''I Love Gjoni'' (reality show); ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?'' (Hungarian version) and ''Heti Hetes'' (weekly comedy show on Sunday nights).\n\nIn July 2012, something started to promoted on RTL Klub with these sentences: ''The Life is Nice'' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Az \u00e9let sz\u00e9p.''), ''The Sky is Blue'' (''Az \u00e9g k\u00e9k.''), ''The Grass is Green'' (''A f\u0171 z\u00f6ld.''), but it wasn't mentioned that these ads are advertising something. In September 2012, it was revealed that these ads advertised RTL2, the new commercial television channel what will launch on October 1, 2012 and it will replace Reflektor TV. In September, it suddenly became an [[Internet meme]] but bloggers and net users were disappointed when they got know the promotion is about ''\"just\"'' a new TV channel.\n\nAt the launch the prime-time schedule of [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]] included series: ''[[Modern Family]]'', ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'', ''[[Terra Nova (TV series)|Terra Nova]]'', ''[[Journeyman (TV series)|Journeyman]]'', ''[[The Forgotten (TV series)|The Forgotten]]'', ''[[Chase (2010 TV series)|Chase]]'', shows moved from RTL Klub: ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire]]'' and ''Heti Hetes'' and a new magazine ''Forr\u00f3 nyomon''.\n\n===RTL+===\nIt launched as Po\u00e9n! on 2 April 2008, then it was renamed as Prizma on 20 December 2010. Prizma\u2019s focus was on entertainment and its purpose was to provide something attractive for each generation. Most of its programming consisted of beloved familiars, but there were some new audience favourites, too. It airs as [[:hu:RTL+|RTL+]] since 1 May 2014.\n\n===Sorozat+===\nSorozat+ is the channel for fans of series - for those who live in anticipation of the next episode. Sorozat+ offers something for each member of the family, from Latin-American telenovelas to top US series. It launched on 2 April 2008.\n\n===Muzsika TV===\nMuzsika TV is a music channel that offers a mix of traditional and modern pieces, featuring the greatest stars of folk and pop music as well as operettas and musicals.

It was one of Hungary's first commercial TV channels and began broadcasting only three days after its main rival [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]].\n\n==About RTL Klub==\nSince its start, RTL Klub has focused to gain viewers from the urban population. The channel airs programs mostly for a younger (18-49) audience.\n\nRTL Klub and TV2 aired two similar major reality series simultaneously. While TV2 purchased the rights of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', RTL Klub produced its own series called ''Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g'' (Real World). ''Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g'' had three seasons between 2002 and 2004. Since its second season the show has been much more successful than the rival ''Big Brother''.\n\nRTL Klub is the most watched TV channel in Hungary since 2002, thanks to the daily Hungarian soap opera ''Bar\u00e1tok k\u00f6zt'' (Among Friends), which is the most watched TV programme in Hungary with more than 2 million viewers; the tabloid magazine ''F\u00f3kusz'' (Focus) and the game show ''Legyen \u00d6n is milliomos'' (''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''). Millionaire is off the schedule from September 2007 after seven years and has replaced by ''A Sz\u00e9f'' (''[[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take It Or Leave It]]'').\n\nFrom the fall-winter season of 2005-2006, RTL Klub has started to broadcast popular American TV shows like ''Lost''. The first episode of ''Lost'' had almost 2 million viewers, and a 50% share. This was a record. The next year Prison Break started with almost 1.6 million. Nowadays a TV show at prime time (21:00) can reach 1-1.5 million viewers. In season 2006-2007 ''Prison Break'' was the most watched American series in Hungary.\n\nFrom the fall season of 2007, RTL Klub has launched two new formats with great success. Poker Face ran like a tournament for six weeks with an average 38-42% share. The other new show was ''[[America's Got Talent|Csillag sz\u00fcletik]]'', the Hungarian version of the RTL ''Got Talent'' format. ''Poker Face'' ended with the super final at 18 December and the time slot of it will be occupied by the new game show ''A Sz\u00e9f'' (''[[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take It or Leave it]]'').\n\nRTL Klub was the only licensed broadcaster of [[Formula One]] in Hungary from 2002 until 2011. After 10 years RTL decided not to renew the licence for Formula 1. The reason was that they wanted to concentrate mainly for the prime time programs because of the shrinking advertising market.<ref>[http://tv24.blog.hu/2011/10/24/a_forma_1_rol_is_lemond_az_rtl \"A Forma-1-r\u0151l is lemond az RTL\" (RTL gives up Formula 1 rights)] October 24, 2011.</ref>\n\nRTL Klub has been the only licensed broadcaster of [[Domino Day]] in Hungary, for 6 years (2004-2009).\n\nFrom 2010, RTL Klub started with 2 winning formats. First of all the channel after 6 years absence successfully relaunched the [[Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g]] franchise. VV4 ran with a 40% SHR among 18-49 demographic.<ref>Est.hu [http://est.hu/cikk/86765 \"Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g 4: T\u00f6retlen siker\" (VV4: Great success)] January 15, 2011.</ref> Secondly they purchased the rights of television talent show [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]. The show ran with a 50% SHR<ref>Est.hu [http://www.pestiest.hu/cikk/82831/az_x-faktor_megeszi_a_megasztart_reggelire] \"Az X-Faktor megeszi a Megaszt\u00e1rt reggelire\" (The X Factor eats Megaszt\u00e1r for breakfast)] September 7, 2010.</ref> among 18-49 demographic which is really high on the Hungarian television market. The Factor crashed the competitor talent show on TV2 so \"Megaszt\u00e1r\" left the time slot of ''The X Factor'' after a few episodes. Because of the success of both format, RTL Klub renewed both show for the 5th and 2nd season respectively. They started in the fall season of 2011.\n\n==Current shows==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0\"\n! | Series name\n! | Hungarian title\n! | Current season/Last aired season\n\n|-\n| ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' || ''A z\u00f6ld \u00edj\u00e1sz'' || 2nd\n|-\n| ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' || ''Dr. Csont'' || 9th\n|-\n| ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' || ''Tot\u00e1l sz\u00edv\u00e1s'' || 3rd\n|-\n| ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'' || ''Castle'' || 5th\n|-\n| ''[[Cobra 11]]'' || ''Cobra 11'' || 18th\n|-\n| ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' || ''Gyilkos elm\u00e9k'' || 8th\n|-\n| ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' || ''CSI: A helysz\u00ednel\u0151k'' || 8th\n|-\n| ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' || ''CSI: Miami helysz\u00ednel\u0151k'' ||  10th\n|-\n| ''[[CSI: NY]]'' || ''CSI: New York-i helysz\u00ednel\u0151k'' || 2nd\n|-\n| ''[[Dallas (2012 TV series)|Dallas]]'' || ''Dallas'' ||  1st\n|-\n| ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' || ''A hatalom h\u00e1l\u00f3j\u00e1ban'' ||  3rd\n|-\n| ''[[Deutschland 83]]'' || ''Volt egyszer k\u00e9t N\u00e9metorsz\u00e1g'' || 1st\n|-\n| ''[[Esperanza m\u00eda]]'' || ''Isten \u00e1ldjon, Esperanza!'' || 1st\n|-\n| ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' || ''A rejt\u00e9ly'' || 3rd\n|-\n| ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' || ''Gossip Girl - A pletykaf\u00e9szek'' || 2nd\n|-\n| ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' || ''Grace klinika'' || 8th\n|-\n| ''[[Muhte\u015fem Y\u00fczy\u0131l]]'' || ''Szulejm\u00e1n'' || 3rd\n|-\n| ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' || ''Tuti gimi'' ||  8th\n|-\n| ''[[Primeval (TV series)|Primeval]]'' || ''\u0150sl\u00e9nyek kalandorai'' ||  3rd\n|-\n| ''[[Revolution (TV series)|Revolution]]'' || ''Revolution'' ||  1st\n|-\n| ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' || ''Kem\u00e9ny motorosok'' ||  3rd\n|-\n| ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' || ''Oda\u00e1t'' ||  6th\n|-\n| ''[[The Closer]]'' || ''A f\u0151n\u00f6k'' ||  6th\n|-\n| ''[[The Following]]'' || ''Gyilkos hajsza'' ||  1st\n|-\n| ''[[The Glades (TV series)|The Glades]]'' || ''Glades - Tengerparti gyilkoss\u00e1gok'' ||  3rd\n|-\n| ''[[The Mentalist]]'' || ''A mentalista'' || 6th\n|-\n| ''[[The Tudors]]'' || ''Tudorok'' || 3rd\n|-\n| ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'' || ''V\u00e1mp\u00edrnapl\u00f3k'' || 2nd\n|-\n| ''[[True Justice]]'' || ''Igazs\u00e1goszt\u00f3k'' || 1st\n|}\n\n==Other formats==\n\n* '''[[Bar\u00e1tok k\u00f6zt]]''' (Among Friends): the most watched domestically produced television soap of Hungary. The show started in the fall of 1998, one year after the foundation of RTL Klub. The show remarkably resembles BBC soap-drama, [[EastEnders]]. Initially, it didn't have the expected ratings, however, bound by the contract, RTL Klub had to keep the show running. Since 2000, the third season, the show has been rarely beaten in ratings in its own timeslot. Today, the average rating of the show is about 2 million viewers, and it's a solid foundation of viewers the channel occasionally builds on. Each episode of the series is 10 minutes long, and every weekday two episodes are aired. In between the two episodes, there is a news session as well as the highest value commercial block in Hungarian television.\n* '''[[X-Faktor]]''': the licensed version of the talent show [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]].

Season 4 started 1 year later with 3 new judges and 2 new hosts.\n* '''[[Val\u00f3 Vil\u00e1g]]''' (Real World): the show is similar to the reality show ''Big Brother'' although there are some major differences between the two formats. VV first started on RTL Klub in 2002. At the same time the rival TV channel (TV2) purchased the rights of the successful Big Brother format. The 1st seasons of the 2 shows had similar ratings but BB was slightly ahead. Since the 2nd season VV crashed the rival format so BB moved to the late night time slot and died quietly. The 2nd season of VV was followed with a 3rd one which had great ratings again. (There was no BB3.) After the 3rd season of VV ended RTL Klub had the format rested for 6 years. In 2010 they relaunched the format with some changes. VV4 was followed by VV5 in 2011. VV6 started in Winter 2014 on RTL II and the channel continues it with a 7th season in Autumn. RTL Klub sold the format of VV to Czech Republic and Slovakia where the show was called Vyvolen\u00ed. The Czech VV had 3 seasons while the Slovak had 2. In both countries VyVolen\u00ed (the chosen one) won the time slot against ''Big Brother''.\n* '''Csillag Sz\u00fcletik''' (A Star Borns): the Hungarian licensed version of ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''.

In it famous Hungarian people dance with professional dancers. This show is also very popular. The 2nd season finale had more viewers than the FIFA Football World Cup Final in Hungary. (Italy vs. France), it should however be noted that Hungary were not in the competition hence weakening interest. It had 3 seasons. 2 in 2006 (spring and fall) and 1 in 2008 (fall). The show returned in 2013 spring on [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]].\n* '''Gy\u0151zike''': a documentary-soap about a Hungarian [[Romani people|gypsy]] family. The head of the family called [[Gy\u0151z\u0151 G\u00e1sp\u00e1r]], husband and father of two girls, who is a pop/rap singer and he had a band but after the show started in 2005 the band broke up. It used to be a very popular show, bearing similarities to [[MTV]]'s ''[[the Osbournes]]''. It had 7 seasons but the return of the show is unlikely.\n* '''P\u00f3kerarc''': The Hungarian adaption of the RTL format [[PokerFace (game show)|PokerFace]]. It debuted at November 2007 and broadcast every day at 19.00. At the end of the first season, before Christmas one player won 50 Million [[Hungarian forint|Ft]]. (200.000 Euro). The host of the game is Istv\u00e1n V\u00e1g\u00f3 (the host of the previous game show [[Who wants to be a Millionaire?]] and Bal\u00e1zs Sebesty\u00e9n (the host of Bal\u00e1zs show and K\u00e9sz \u00c1tver\u00e9s). The 2nd season started in fall 2008.\n* '''A K\u00eds\u00e9rt\u00e9s''' (The Temptation): the licensed version of ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]''. The show had one season on RTL Klub in 2004 and had moderate ratings and so it wasn't renewed for a second season.\n* '''A Retteg\u00e9s Foka''' (Fear Factor): It is a licensed version of the American ''[[Fear Factor]]''. It was cancelled after 2 seasons, reruns however are still aired on Cool TV.\n* '''Survivor \u2013 A sziget''' (Survivor - The Island): the licensed version of the famous hit reality show ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', whose international format rights are held by RTL. RTL Klub aired two seasons. The major difference between the Hungarian Survivor and the original one was the winner was selected by a public vote (via SMS or phone calls).\n* '''Szesz\u00e9lyes''' (Capricious): a show similar to long-running ''Szesz\u00e9lyes \u00c9vszakok'' (Capricious Seasons). After the cancellation of the original show, RTL Klub launched its own version with the host [[Imre Antal]], which ran until Antal's death of [[cancer]] in 2008. The channel didn't renew the license for the show because it had considerably lower ratings than the original.\n* '''Cs\u00ed\u00ed\u00edz!''': the licensed Hungarian version of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]''.\n\n==Sister TV channels==\nRTL Klub has many sister channels. One of the owners of RTL Klub is \"IKO K\u00e1belt\u00e9v\u00e9 Kft.\", which owned [[Cool TV|Cool]], Film+, Sportklub (which ceased on 30 April 2016), Sportklub+ (which is a non-airing channel since 15 October 2009), DoQ (which closed on 31 March 2019), F&H, Sorozat+, Po\u00e9n! (which became Prizma in 20 December 2010 and RTL+ on 1 May 2014), Reflektor (which closed on 31 December 2012) and Film+ 2 (which was replaced by RTL Gold on 3 July 2017), all of which are in some way related to IKO's primary channel, RTL Klub. In July 2011, RTL Group acquired seven TV channels from IKO K\u00e1belt\u00e9v\u00e9 (Cool, Film+, Film+ 2, Prizma TV, Sorozat+, Reflektor TV, Muzsika TV). [[Thematic Cable|Tematic Cable Entertainment]] bought Sportklub, DoQ and F&H in 2013 from the RTL Group. Prizma TV airs since 1 May 2014 as [[:hu:RTL+|RTL+]].\n\n===Cool===\nOriginally [[Cool TV|Cool]] had the target audience of 15-29 urban youths who love music, externals, clothes, trendy lifestyle and extravagance. The channel was launched on 15 September 2003 and it is available in 2.5 million households.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101211839/http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool |archivedate=2012-11-01 }}</ref> The channel is on a [[24/7]] broadcast schedule, targeting audience not only during the day, but during the night as well. Cool airs reruns of series RTL Klub originally purchased or produced as well as series targeting today's youth. These include: ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'' (''Egy r\u00e9m rendes csal\u00e1d''), ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Footballer's Wives]]'' (''Futbalista feles\u00e9gek''), ''[[The L Word]]'' (''L''), ''[[Queer as Folk (US TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' (''A fi\u00fak a klubb\u00f3l''), ''[[The Unit]]'' (''Az egys\u00e9g''), ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' (''Hal\u00e1li hull\u00e1k''), ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' (''Spangli''), ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' (''Skins''), ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' (''Sz\u00fcletett feles\u00e9gek'')\n\nIn 2007, Cool launched a series of topical shows produced by the channel, such as ''Cool Live and Cool Night'', featuring younger hosts lent to Cool by RTL Klub. The earlier is a youth lifestyle show, and the latter is an adult show including interviews with Hungarian porn stars and producers, as well as occasionally shown soft-core video clips. {{As of|2013|9|29}}, these talk shows are cancelled.\n\nIn 2009, Cool purchased the airing rights of the successful Hungarian version of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose line is it anyway?]]'', [[Beugr\u00f3]].\n\nOn 30 August 2010, Cool rebranded, opening for a wider audience. Since then the channel airs mostly crime procedurals like the [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI franchise]], ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', [[Alarm f\u00fcr Cobra 11 \u2013 Die Autobahnpolizei|Cobra 11]], [[The Mentalist]], etc. The move was successful because as of July 2012, Cool TV is the third watched commercial TV channel, and most watched cable channel in Hungary (target audience 18-49, prime time 19.00-23.00), beating main competitor [[Viasat 3]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool/ajanlok/cool-a-3-csatorna |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605115841/http://r-time.hu/csatornaink/cool/ajanlok/cool-a-3-csatorna |archivedate=2013-06-05 }}</ref>\n\nOn 1 December 2014, Cool rebranded to its current ident package, and from 1 January 2015 onwards, the channel is available in HD too.\n\n===Film+===\n[[Film+]] was launched on 15 September 2003, the same time as Cool. The channel airs movies which previously aired on RTL Klub [[24/7]]. According to the 2012 Hungarian television ratings, Film+ is the third-most-watched cable channel in Hungary.<ref>http://sorozatwiki.hu/news.php?readmore=75381</ref> Due to the early success of the channel, the parent company launched Film+ 2, which aired movies in the same fashion as Film+, but it closed on 3 July 2017 to make way for RTL Gold, a channel which airs old episodes of RTL Klub's old game shows and talkshows.\n\nThe channel is available in HD since New Year's Day 2015.\n\n===Film+ 2===\nFilm+ 2 was a non-violent family channel. It launched on 2 April 2008. This movie channel was devoted partly to female audiences, and partly to family films during the evenings and weekends. It offered comedies, romantic films, adventures and dramas. In the RTL cable portfolio, Film+ 2 was the channel that broadcasts most Hungarian films.\n\nIt closed down on 3 July 2017 to make way for RTL Gold.\n\n===Sportklub===\n[[Sport Klub|Sportklub]] was launched on 2 January 2006. RTL Klub purchased the broadcasting rights of the [[FIFA]] World Cup 2006 but it didn't have enough airing time for all of the matches, and therefore Sport Klub was launched by the parent company to fill in. Sportklub aired various sport activities, such as the French and Italian football league (as partner of [[Digi Sport (Hungary)|Digi Sport]]), tennis, poker, [[NCAA]], athletics, [[futsal]] and box. The channel reran the Formula-1 broadcast of the parent channel to 2011. It aired certain matches of the English and the Spanish league, however its main competitors, the sports channels run by the Hungarian public service television [[Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3|MTV]], Sport1 and Sport2, have the first pick of the matches they would like to air. To ease up the load on Sportklub, the parent company also launched Sportklub+ in September 2007, which aired sports events deemed to attract less viewers than the parent channel, but it closed on 15 October 2009.\n\nSportklub closed down in Hungary on 30 April 2016.\n\nSportklub is also available in countries close to Hungary in which countries IKO also operates, including [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]].\n\n===[[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]]===\nIn September 2011, RTL Klub started a project named RTL2 to launch a new RTL channel in [[Hungary]]. In April, 2012 it was announced, that RTL will launch [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]] in September or in October with ''I Love Gjoni'' (reality show); ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?'' (Hungarian version) and ''Heti Hetes'' (weekly comedy show on Sunday nights).\n\nIn July 2012, something started to promoted on RTL Klub with these sentences: ''The Life is Nice'' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Az \u00e9let sz\u00e9p.''), ''The Sky is Blue'' (''Az \u00e9g k\u00e9k.''), ''The Grass is Green'' (''A f\u0171 z\u00f6ld.''), but it wasn't mentioned that these ads are advertising something. In September 2012, it was revealed that these ads advertised RTL2, the new commercial television channel what will launch on October 1, 2012 and it will replace Reflektor TV. In September, it suddenly became an [[Internet meme]] but bloggers and net users were disappointed when they got know the promotion is about ''\"just\"'' a new TV channel.\n\nAt the launch the prime-time schedule of [[RTL II (Hungary)|RTL II]] included series: ''[[Modern Family]]'', ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]'', ''[[Terra Nova (TV series)|Terra Nova]]'', ''[[Journeyman (TV series)|Journeyman]]'', ''[[The Forgotten (TV series)|The Forgotten]]'', ''[[Chase (2010 TV series)|Chase]]'', shows moved from RTL Klub: ''[[Who Wants to be a Millionaire]]'' and ''Heti Hetes'' and a new magazine ''Forr\u00f3 nyomon''.\n\n===RTL+===\nIt launched as Po\u00e9n! on 2 April 2008, then it was renamed as Prizma on 20 December 2010. Prizma\u2019s focus was on entertainment and its purpose was to provide something attractive for each generation. Most of its programming consisted of beloved familiars, but there were some new audience favourites, too. It airs as [[:hu:RTL+|RTL+]] since 1 May 2014.\n\n===Sorozat+===\nSorozat+ is the channel for fans of series - for those who live in anticipation of the next episode. Sorozat+ offers something for each member of the family, from Latin-American telenovelas to top US series. It launched on 2 April 2008.\n\n===Muzsika TV===\nMuzsika TV is a music channel that offers a mix of traditional and modern pieces, featuring the greatest stars of folk and pop music as well as operettas and musicals. It launched on 6 November 2009.\n\n==References==\n{{Clear}}\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.rtlklub.hu Official Site] (in Hungarian)\n\n{{RTL Group}}\n{{Bertelsmann}}\n{{Television in Hungary}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rtl Klub}}\n[[Category:Hungarian television networks]]\n[[Category:RTL Group]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1997]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Media in Budapest]]\n[[Category:Television in Hungary]]\n", "name_user": "Zelrin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Not to be confused witnClub RTL(Belgium/Luxembourg)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTL_Klub"}
{"title_page": "Multi-objective optimization", "text_new": "{{See also|Multiple-criteria decision analysis|Vector optimization}}\n\n'''Multi-objective optimization''' (also known as '''multi-objective programming''', '''vector optimization''', '''multicriteria optimization''', '''multiattribute optimization''' or '''Pareto optimization''') is an area of [[MCDM|multiple criteria decision making]] that is concerned with [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical optimization problems]] involving more than one [[Loss function|objective function]] to be optimized simultaneously. Multi-objective optimization has been applied in many fields of science, including engineering, economics and logistics where optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of [[trade-off]]s between two or more conflicting objectives. Minimizing cost while maximizing comfort while buying a car, and maximizing performance whilst minimizing fuel consumption and emission of pollutants of a vehicle are examples of multi-objective optimization problems involving two and three objectives, respectively. In practical problems, there can be more than three objectives.\n\nFor a [[nontrivial]] multi-objective optimization problem, no single solution exists that simultaneously optimizes each objective. In that case, the objective functions are said to be conflicting, and there exists a (possibly infinite) number of Pareto optimal solutions. A solution is called [[Maxima of a point set|nondominated]], Pareto optimal, [[Pareto efficient]] or noninferior, if none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values. Without additional [[Subjectivity|subjective]] preference information, all Pareto optimal solutions are considered equally good (as vectors cannot be ordered completely). Researchers study multi-objective optimization problems from different viewpoints and, thus, there exist different solution philosophies and goals when setting and solving them. The goal may be to find a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions, and/or quantify the trade-offs in satisfying the different objectives, and/or finding a single solution that satisfies the subjective preferences of a human decision maker (DM).\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nA multi-objective optimization problem is an [[optimization problem]] that involves multiple objective functions.<ref name=\"Miettinen1999\" /><ref name=\"HwangMasud1979\" /><ref name=hassanzadeh>{{cite journal|last1=Hassanzadeh|first1=Hamidreza|last2=Rouhani|first2=Modjtaba|title=A multi-objective gravitational search algorithm|journal=In Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks (CICSyN)|date=2010|pages=7\u201312}}</ref> In mathematical terms, a multi-objective optimization problem can be formulated as\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\min &\\left(f_1(x), f_2(x),\\ldots, f_k(x) \\right)  \\\\\n\\text{s.t. } &x\\in X,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere the integer <math>k\\geq 2</math> is the number of objectives and the set <math>X</math> is the [[feasible set]] of decision vectors. The feasible set is typically defined by some constraint functions. In addition, the vector-valued objective function is often defined as\n:<math>f:X\\to\\mathbb R^k, \\ f(x)= (f_1(x),\\ldots,f_k(x))^T</math>. If some objective function is to be maximized, it is equivalent to minimize its negative. The image of <math>X</math> is denoted by <math>Y \\in \\mathbb R^k</math>\n\n[[File:Front pareto.svg|thumb|300px|Example of a [[Pareto frontier]] (in red), the set of Pareto optimal solutions (those that are not dominated by any other feasible solutions). The boxed points represent feasible choices, and smaller values are preferred to larger ones. Point ''C'' is not on the Pareto frontier because it is dominated by both point ''A'' and point ''B''. Points ''A'' and ''B'' are not strictly dominated by any other, and hence do lie on the frontier.]]\n\nAn element <math>x^*\\in X</math> is called a [[feasible solution]] or a '''feasible decision'''. A vector <math>z^* := f(x^*)\\in \\mathbb R^k</math> for a feasible solution <math>x^*</math> is called an '''objective vector''' or an '''outcome'''. In multi-objective optimization, there does not typically exist a feasible solution that minimizes all objective functions simultaneously. Therefore, attention is paid to [[Pareto optimality|Pareto optimal]] solutions; that is, solutions that cannot be improved in any of the objectives without degrading at least one of the other objectives. In mathematical terms, a feasible solution <math>x^1\\in X</math> is said to [[Pareto improvement|(Pareto) dominate]] another solution <math>x^2\\in X</math>, if\n#<math>f_i(x^1)\\leq f_i(x^2)</math> for all indices <math>i \\in \\left\\{ {1,2,\\dots,k } \\right\\}</math> and\n#<math>f_j(x^1) < f_j(x^2)</math> for at least one index <math>j \\in \\left\\{ {1,2,\\dots,k } \\right\\}</math>.\nA solution <math>x^*\\in X</math> (and the corresponding outcome <math>f(x^*)</math>) is called Pareto optimal, if there does not exist another solution that dominates it. The set of Pareto optimal outcomes is often called the '''[[Pareto front]]''', Pareto frontier, or Pareto boundary.\n\nThe Pareto front of a multi-objective optimization problem is bounded by a so-called '''nadir objective vector''' <math> z^{nad} </math> and an '''ideal objective vector''' <math> z^{ideal} </math>, if these are finite. The nadir objective vector is defined as\n:<math> z^{nad}_i= \\sup_{x\\in X\\text{ is Pareto optimal}} f_i(x) \\text{ for all } i=1,\\ldots,k </math>\nand the ideal objective vector as\n:<math> z^{ideal}_i=\\inf_{x\\in X}{f_i(x)}\\text{ for all } i=1,\\ldots,k.</math>\nIn other words, the components of a nadir and an ideal objective vector define upper and lower bounds for the objective function values of Pareto optimal solutions, respectively. In practice, the nadir objective vector can only be approximated as, typically, the whole Pareto optimal set is unknown. In addition, a '''utopian objective vector''' <math>z^{utopian}</math> with\n:<math> z^{utopian}_i = z^{ideal}_{i}-\\epsilon \\text{ for all } i=1,\\ldots,k,</math>\nwhere <math>\\epsilon>0</math> is a small constant, is often defined because of numerical reasons.\n\n== Examples of applications ==\n\n===Economics===\n\nIn [[economics]], many problems involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's [[demand]] for various goods is determined by the process of maximization of the [[utility|utilities]] derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of [[indifference curve]]s, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.\n\nAnother example involves the [[production possibilities frontier]], which specifies what combinations of various types of goods can be produced by a society with certain amounts of various resources. The frontier specifies the trade-offs that the society is faced with \u2014 if the society is fully utilizing its resources, more of one good can be produced only at the expense of producing less of another good. A society must then use some process to choose among the possibilities on the frontier.\n\n[[Macroeconomics#Macroeconomic policy|Macroeconomic policy]]-making is a context requiring multi-objective optimization. Typically a [[central bank]] must choose a stance for [[monetary policy]] that balances competing objectives \u2014 low [[inflation]], low [[unemployment]], low [[balance of trade]] deficit, etc. To do this, the central bank uses a [[economic model|model of the economy]] that quantitatively describes the various causal linkages in the economy; it [[simulation|simulates]] the model repeatedly under various possible stances of monetary policy, in order to obtain a menu of possible predicted outcomes for the various variables of interest. Then in principle it can use an aggregate objective function to rate the alternative sets of predicted outcomes, although in practice central banks use a non-quantitative, judgement-based, process for ranking the alternatives and making the policy choice.\n\n===Finance===\n\nIn [[finance]], a common problem is to choose a portfolio when there are two conflicting objectives \u2014 the desire to have the [[expected value]] of portfolio returns be as high as possible, and the desire to have [[financial risk|risk]], often measured by the [[standard deviation]] of portfolio returns, be as low as possible. This problem is often represented by a graph in which the [[efficient frontier]] shows the best combinations of risk and expected return that are available, and in which indifference curves show the investor's preferences for various risk-expected return combinations. The problem of optimizing a function of the expected value (first [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]) and the standard deviation (square root of the second central moment) of portfolio return is called a [[two-moment decision model]].\n\n===Optimal control===\n{{Main article|Optimal control|Dynamic programming|Linear-quadratic regulator}}\n\nIn [[engineering]] and [[economics]], many problems involve multiple objectives which are not describable as the-more-the-better or the-less-the-better; instead, there is an ideal target value for each objective, and the desire is to get as close as possible to the desired value of each objective. For example, energy systems typically have a trade-off between performance and cost<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shirazi|first=Ali|last2=Najafi|first2=Behzad|last3=Aminyavari|first3=Mehdi|last4=Rinaldi|first4=Fabio|last5=Taylor|first5=Robert A.|date=2014-05-01|title=Thermal\u2013economic\u2013environmental analysis and multi-objective optimization of an ice thermal energy storage system for gas turbine cycle inlet air cooling|journal=Energy|volume=69|pages=212\u2013226|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.071}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Najafi|first=Behzad|last2=Shirazi|first2=Ali|last3=Aminyavari|first3=Mehdi|last4=Rinaldi|first4=Fabio|last5=Taylor|first5=Robert A.|date=2014-02-03|title=Exergetic, economic and environmental analyses and multi-objective optimization of an SOFC-gas turbine hybrid cycle coupled with an MSF desalination system|journal=Desalination|volume=334|issue=1|pages=46\u201359|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2013.11.039}}</ref> or one might want to adjust a rocket's fuel usage and orientation so that it arrives both at a specified place and at a specified time; or one might want to conduct [[open market operations]] so that both the [[inflation rate]] and the [[unemployment rate]] are as close as possible to their desired values.\n\nOften such problems are subject to linear equality constraints that prevent all objectives from being simultaneously perfectly met, especially when the number of controllable variables is less than the number of objectives and when the presence of random shocks generates uncertainty. Commonly a multi-objective [[quadratic function#Bivariate (two variable) quadratic function|quadratic objective function]] is used, with the cost associated with an objective rising quadratically with the distance of the objective from its ideal value. Since these problems typically involve adjusting the controlled variables at various points in time and/or evaluating the objectives at various points in time, [[intertemporal optimization]] techniques are employed.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/IECON.2009.5415056 |isbn=978-1-4244-4648-3 |chapter=Chaos rejection and optimal dynamic response for boost converter using SPEA multi-objective optimization approach |title=2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics |pages=3315\u20133322 |year=2009 |last1=Rafiei |first1=S.

Before looking for optimal designs it is important to identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.\n\nFor example, when designing a paper mill, one can seek to decrease the amount of capital invested in a paper mill and enhance the quality of paper simultaneously. If the design of a paper mill is defined by large storage volumes and paper quality is defined by quality parameters, then the problem of optimal design of a paper mill can include objectives such as: i) minimization of expected variation of those quality parameter from their nominal values, ii) minimization of expected time of breaks and iii) minimization of investment cost of storage volumes. Here, maximum volume of towers are design variables. This example of optimal design of a paper mill is a simplification of the model used in.<ref name=RoRiPi11>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ropponen | first1 = A. | last2 = Ritala | first2 = R. | last3 = Pistikopoulos | first3 = E.

Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. These objectives are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus there is a need for tight spatial [[frequency reuse]] which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. [[Multi-user MIMO]] techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive [[precoding]]. The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high data rates, thus the operator would like to find a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total network data throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.\n\nRadio resource management is often solved by scalarization; that is, selection of a network utility function that tries to balance throughput and user fairness. The choice of utility function has a large impact on the computational complexity of the resulting single-objective optimization problem.<ref name=fnt2013 /> For example, the common utility of weighted sum rate gives an [[NP-hard]] problem with a complexity that scales exponentially with the number of users, while the weighted max-min fairness utility results in a quasi-convex optimization problem with only a polynomial scaling with the number of users.<ref name=luo2008>Z.-Q.

This section summarizes some of them and the contexts in which they are used. Many methods convert the original problem with multiple objectives into a single-objective [[optimization problem]]. This is called a scalarized problem. If scalarization is done neatly,{{Clarify|reason=What does \"neatly\" mean?|date=October 2018}} Pareto optimality of the solutions obtained can be guaranteed.\n\nSolving a multi-objective optimization problem is sometimes understood as approximating or computing all or a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions.<ref name=\"Ehrgott2005\">{{cite book|author=Matthias Ehrgott|title=Multicriteria Optimization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrZw9srrHroC|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|isbn=978-3-540-21398-7}}</ref><ref name=\"CoelloLamont2007\">{{cite book|author1=Carlos A.

In a posteriori methods, a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions is first found and then the DM must choose one of them. In interactive methods, the decision maker is allowed to iteratively search for the most preferred solution. In each iteration of the interactive method, the DM is shown Pareto optimal solution(s) and describes how the solution(s) could be improved. The information given by the decision maker is then taken into account while generating new Pareto optimal solution(s) for the DM to study in the next iteration. In this way, the DM learns about the feasibility of his/her wishes and can concentrate on solutions that are interesting to him/her. The DM may stop the search whenever he/she wants to. More information and examples of different methods in the four classes are given in the following sections.\n\n== Scalarizing ==\n\nScalarizing a multi-objective optimization problem is an a priori method, which means formulating a single-objective optimization problem such that optimal solutions to the single-objective optimization problem are Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective optimization problem.<ref name=\"HwangMasud1979\" /> In addition, it is often required that every Pareto optimal solution can be reached with some parameters of the scalarization.<ref name=\"HwangMasud1979\">{{cite book|author1=Ching-Lai Hwang|author2=Abu Syed Md Masud|title=Multiple objective decision making, methods and applications: a state-of-the-art survey|url=https://archive.org/details/multipleobjectiv0000hwan|url-access=registration|accessdate=29 May 2012|year=1979|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-09111-2}}</ref> With different parameters for the scalarization, different Pareto optimal solutions are produced.

Currently, most evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms apply Pareto-based ranking schemes.

The main advantage of evolutionary algorithms, when applied to solve multi-objective optimization problems, is the fact that they typically generate sets of solutions, allowing computation of an approximation of the entire Pareto front. The main disadvantage of evolutionary algorithms is their lower speed and the Pareto optimality of the solutions cannot be guaranteed. It is only known that none of the generated solutions dominates the others.\n\nAnother paradigm for multi-objective optimization based on novelty using evolutionary algorithms was recently improved upon.<ref name=vargas2015>Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas, Junichi Murata, Hirotaka Takano, Alexandre Claudio Botazzo Delbem (2015), \"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00266 General Subpopulation Framework and Taming the Conflict Inside Populations]\", Evolutionary computation 23 (1), 1-36.</ref> This paradigm searches for novel solutions in objective space (i.e., novelty search<ref>Lehman, Joel, and Kenneth O. Stanley. \"Abandoning objectives: Evolution through the search for novelty alone.\" Evolutionary computation 19.2 (2011): 189-223.</ref> on objective space) in addition to the search for non-dominated solutions. Novelty search is like stepping stones guiding the search to previously unexplored places.

In other words, the decision maker is expected to express preferences at each iteration in order to get ''Pareto optimal solutions'' that are of interest to the decision maker and learn what kind of solutions are attainable. \n\nThe following steps are commonly present in interactive methods of optimization :<ref name=Miettinen2008>{{cite book | last1 = Miettinen | first1 = K. | last2 = Ruiz | first2 = F. | last3 = Wierzbicki | first3 = A.

Instead of mathematical convergence that is often used as a stopping criterion in [[mathematical optimization]] methods, a psychological convergence is often emphasized in interactive methods. Generally speaking, a method is terminated when the decision maker is confident that he/she has found the ''most preferred solution available''.\n\n=== Types of preference information ===\nThere are different interactive methods involving different types of preference information.

A hybrid algorithm in the context of multi-objective optimization is a combination of algorithms/approaches from these two fields (see e.g.<ref name=Miettinen2008 />). Hybrid algorithms of EMO and MCDM are mainly used to overcome shortcomings by utilizing strengths. Several types of hybrid algorithms have been proposed in the literature, e.g. incorporating MCDM approaches into EMO algorithms as a local search operator and to lead a DM to the most preferred solution(s) etc. A local search operator is mainly used to enhance the rate of convergence of EMO algorithms.\n\nThe roots for hybrid multi-objective optimization can be traced to the first Dagstuhl seminar organized in November 2004 (see, [http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=04461 here]). Here some of the best minds{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} in EMO (Professor Kalyanmoy Deb, Professor J\u00fcrgen Branke etc.) and MCDM (Professor Kaisa Miettinen, Professor Ralph E.

Subsequently many more Dagstuhl seminars have been arranged to foster collaboration. Recently, hybrid multi-objective optimization has become an important theme in several international conferences in the area of EMO and MCDM (see e.g.<ref name=Sindhya2011>{{cite book | last1 = Sindhya | first1 = K. | last2 = Ruiz | first2 = A.

The a posteriori preference techniques provide an important class of multi-objective optimization techniques.<ref name=\"Miettinen1999\" /> Usually the a posteriori preference techniques include four steps: (1) computer approximates the Pareto front, i.e. the Pareto optimal set in the objective space; (2) the decision maker studies the Pareto front approximation; (3) the decision maker identifies the preferred point at the Pareto front; (4) computer provides the Pareto optimal decision, which output coincides with the objective point identified by the decision maker. From the point of view of the decision maker, the second step of the a posteriori preference techniques is the most complicated one. There are two main approaches to informing the decision maker. First, a number of points of the Pareto front can be provided in the form of a list (interesting discussion and references are given in<ref name=\"BensonSayin1997\">{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Harold P.|last2=Sayin|first2=Serpil|title=Towards finding global representations of the efficient set in multiple objective mathematical programming|journal=Naval Research Logistics|volume=44|issue=1|year=1997|pages=47\u201367|issn=0894-069X|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6750(199702)44:1<47::AID-NAV3>3.0.CO;2-M|hdl=11693/25666|url=http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/11693/25666/1/Towards%20finding%20global%20representations%20of%20the%20efficient%20set%20in%20multiple%20objective%20mathematical%20programming.pdf}}</ref>) or using Heatmaps.<ref name=\"Pryke,Mostaghim,Nazemi\">{{cite book|last=Pryke|first=Andy|author2=Sanaz Mostaghim |author3=Alireza Nazemi |title=Heatmap Visualisation of Population Based Multi Objective Algorithms|journal=Evolutionary Multi-Criterion Optimization|volume=4403|year=2007|pages=361\u2013375|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-70928-2_29|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-70927-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Visualization in bi-objective problems: tradeoff curve ===\n\nIn the case of bi-objective problems, informing the decision maker concerning the Pareto front is usually carried out by its visualization: the Pareto front, often named the tradeoff curve in this case, can be drawn at the objective plane. The tradeoff curve gives full information on objective values and on objective tradeoffs, which inform how improving one objective is related to deteriorating the second one while moving along the tradeoff curve. The decision maker takes this information into account while specifying the preferred Pareto optimal objective point. The idea to approximate and visualize the Pareto front was introduced for linear bi-objective decision problems by S.Gass and T.Saaty.<ref name=\"GassSaaty1955\">{{cite journal|last1=Gass|first1=Saul|last2=Saaty|first2=Thomas|title=The computational algorithm for the parametric objective function|journal=Naval Research Logistics Quarterly|volume=2|issue=1\u20132|year=1955|pages=39\u201345|issn=0028-1441|doi=10.1002/nav.3800020106}}</ref> This idea was developed and applied in environmental problems by J.L.

One of them, which is applicable in the case of a relatively small number of objective points that represent the Pareto front, is based on using the visualization techniques developed in statistics (various diagrams, etc. \u2013 see the corresponding subsection below). The second idea proposes the display of bi-objective cross-sections (slices) of the Pareto front. It was introduced by W.S. Meisel in 1973<ref>{{citation |title=Tradeoff decision in multiple criteria decision making |editor1=J. L. Cochrane |editor2=M. Zeleny |journal=Multiple Criteria Decision Making |pages=461\u2013476 |year=1973 |last1=Meisel |first1=W. L.}}</ref> who argued that such slices inform the decision maker on objective tradeoffs. The figures that display a series of bi-objective slices of the Pareto front for three-objective problems are known as the decision maps. They give a clear picture of tradeoffs between three criteria. Disadvantages of such an approach are related to two following facts. First, the computational procedures for constructing the bi-objective slices of the Pareto front are not stable since the Pareto front is usually not stable. Secondly, it is applicable in the case of only three objectives. In the 1980s, the idea W.S. Meisel of implemented in a different form \u2013 in the form of the [[Interactive Decision Maps]] (IDM) technique.<ref name=\"LotovBushenkov2004\">{{cite book |author1=A. V. Lotov |author2=V. A.

Multi-objective optimization has been applied in many fields of science, including engineering, economics and logistics where optimal decisions need to be taken in the presence of [[trade-off]]s between two or more conflicting objectives. Minimizing cost while maximizing comfort while buying a car, and maximizing performance whilst minimizing fuel consumption and emission of pollutants of a vehicle are examples of multi-objective optimization problems involving two and three objectives, respectively. In practical problems, there can be more than three objectives.\n\nFor a [[nontrivial]] multi-objective optimization problem, no single solution exists that simultaneously optimizes each objective. In that case, the objective functions are said to be conflicting, and there exists a (possibly infinite) number of Pareto optimal solutions. A solution is called [[Maxima of a point set|nondominated]], Pareto optimal, [[Pareto efficient]] or noninferior, if none of the objective functions can be improved in value without degrading some of the other objective values. Without additional [[Subjectivity|subjective]] preference information, all Pareto optimal solutions are considered equally good (as vectors cannot be ordered completely). Researchers study multi-objective optimization problems from different viewpoints and, thus, there exist different solution philosophies and goals when setting and solving them. The goal may be to find a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions, and/or quantify the trade-offs in satisfying the different objectives, and/or finding a single solution that satisfies the subjective preferences of a human decision maker (DM).\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nA multi-objective optimization problem is an [[optimization problem]] that involves multiple objective functions.<ref name=\"Miettinen1999\" /><ref name=\"HwangMasud1979\" /><ref name=hassanzadeh>{{cite journal|last1=Hassanzadeh|first1=Hamidreza|last2=Rouhani|first2=Modjtaba|title=A multi-objective gravitational search algorithm|journal=In Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks (CICSyN)|date=2010|pages=7\u201312}}</ref> In mathematical terms, a multi-objective optimization problem can be formulated as\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\min &\\left(f_1(x), f_2(x),\\ldots, f_k(x) \\right)  \\\\\n\\text{s.t. } &x\\in X,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere the integer <math>k\\geq 2</math> is the number of objectives and the set <math>X</math> is the [[feasible set]] of decision vectors. The feasible set is typically defined by some constraint functions. In addition, the vector-valued objective function is often defined as\n:<math>f:X\\to\\mathbb R^k, \\ f(x)= (f_1(x),\\ldots,f_k(x))^T</math>. If some objective function is to be maximized, it is equivalent to minimize its negative. The image of <math>X</math> is denoted by <math>Y \\in \\mathbb R^k</math>\n\n[[File:Front pareto.svg|thumb|300px|Example of a [[Pareto frontier]] (in red), the set of Pareto optimal solutions (those that are not dominated by any other feasible solutions). The boxed points represent feasible choices, and smaller values are preferred to larger ones. Point ''C'' is not on the Pareto frontier because it is dominated by both point ''A'' and point ''B''. Points ''A'' and ''B'' are not strictly dominated by any other, and hence do lie on the frontier.]]\n\nAn element <math>x^*\\in X</math> is called a [[feasible solution]] or a '''feasible decision'''. A vector <math>z^* := f(x^*)\\in \\mathbb R^k</math> for a feasible solution <math>x^*</math> is called an '''objective vector''' or an '''outcome'''. In multi-objective optimization, there does not typically exist a feasible solution that minimizes all objective functions simultaneously. Therefore, attention is paid to [[Pareto optimality|Pareto optimal]] solutions; that is, solutions that cannot be improved in any of the objectives without degrading at least one of the other objectives. In mathematical terms, a feasible solution <math>x^1\\in X</math> is said to [[Pareto improvement|(Pareto) dominate]] another solution <math>x^2\\in X</math>, if\n#<math>f_i(x^1)\\leq f_i(x^2)</math> for all indices <math>i \\in \\left\\{ {1,2,\\dots,k } \\right\\}</math> and\n#<math>f_j(x^1) < f_j(x^2)</math> for at least one index <math>j \\in \\left\\{ {1,2,\\dots,k } \\right\\}</math>.\nA solution <math>x^*\\in X</math> (and the corresponding outcome <math>f(x^*)</math>) is called Pareto optimal, if there does not exist another solution that dominates it. The set of Pareto optimal outcomes is often called the '''[[Pareto front]]''', Pareto frontier, or Pareto boundary.\n\nThe Pareto front of a multi-objective optimization problem is bounded by a so-called '''nadir objective vector''' <math> z^{nad} </math> and an '''ideal objective vector''' <math> z^{ideal} </math>, if these are finite. The nadir objective vector is defined as\n:<math> z^{nad}_i= \\sup_{x\\in X\\text{ is Pareto optimal}} f_i(x) \\text{ for all } i=1,\\ldots,k </math>\nand the ideal objective vector as\n:<math> z^{ideal}_i=\\inf_{x\\in X}{f_i(x)}\\text{ for all } i=1,\\ldots,k.</math>\nIn other words, the components of a nadir and an ideal objective vector define upper and lower bounds for the objective function values of Pareto optimal solutions, respectively. In practice, the nadir objective vector can only be approximated as, typically, the whole Pareto optimal set is unknown. In addition, a '''utopian objective vector''' <math>z^{utopian}</math> with\n:<math> z^{utopian}_i = z^{ideal}_{i}-\\epsilon \\text{ for all } i=1,\\ldots,k,</math>\nwhere <math>\\epsilon>0</math> is a small constant, is often defined because of numerical reasons.\n\n== Examples of applications ==\n\n===Economics===\n\nIn [[economics]], many problems involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's [[demand]] for various goods is determined by the process of maximization of the [[utility|utilities]] derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one good to be purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of [[indifference curve]]s, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.\n\nAnother example involves the [[production possibilities frontier]], which specifies what combinations of various types of goods can be produced by a society with certain amounts of various resources. The frontier specifies the trade-offs that the society is faced with \u2014 if the society is fully utilizing its resources, more of one good can be produced only at the expense of producing less of another good. A society must then use some process to choose among the possibilities on the frontier.\n\n[[Macroeconomics#Macroeconomic policy|Macroeconomic policy]]-making is a context requiring multi-objective optimization. Typically a [[central bank]] must choose a stance for [[monetary policy]] that balances competing objectives \u2014 low [[inflation]], low [[unemployment]], low [[balance of trade]] deficit, etc. To do this, the central bank uses a [[economic model|model of the economy]] that quantitatively describes the various causal linkages in the economy; it [[simulation|simulates]] the model repeatedly under various possible stances of monetary policy, in order to obtain a menu of possible predicted outcomes for the various variables of interest. Then in principle it can use an aggregate objective function to rate the alternative sets of predicted outcomes, although in practice central banks use a non-quantitative, judgement-based, process for ranking the alternatives and making the policy choice.\n\n===Finance===\n\nIn [[finance]], a common problem is to choose a portfolio when there are two conflicting objectives \u2014 the desire to have the [[expected value]] of portfolio returns be as high as possible, and the desire to have [[financial risk|risk]], often measured by the [[standard deviation]] of portfolio returns, be as low as possible. This problem is often represented by a graph in which the [[efficient frontier]] shows the best combinations of risk and expected return that are available, and in which indifference curves show the investor's preferences for various risk-expected return combinations. The problem of optimizing a function of the expected value (first [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]) and the standard deviation (square root of the second central moment) of portfolio return is called a [[two-moment decision model]].\n\n===Optimal control===\n{{Main article|Optimal control|Dynamic programming|Linear-quadratic regulator}}\n\nIn [[engineering]] and [[economics]], many problems involve multiple objectives which are not describable as the-more-the-better or the-less-the-better; instead, there is an ideal target value for each objective, and the desire is to get as close as possible to the desired value of each objective. For example, energy systems typically have a trade-off between performance and cost<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shirazi|first=Ali|last2=Najafi|first2=Behzad|last3=Aminyavari|first3=Mehdi|last4=Rinaldi|first4=Fabio|last5=Taylor|first5=Robert A.|date=2014-05-01|title=Thermal\u2013economic\u2013environmental analysis and multi-objective optimization of an ice thermal energy storage system for gas turbine cycle inlet air cooling|journal=Energy|volume=69|pages=212\u2013226|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.071}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Najafi|first=Behzad|last2=Shirazi|first2=Ali|last3=Aminyavari|first3=Mehdi|last4=Rinaldi|first4=Fabio|last5=Taylor|first5=Robert A.|date=2014-02-03|title=Exergetic, economic and environmental analyses and multi-objective optimization of an SOFC-gas turbine hybrid cycle coupled with an MSF desalination system|journal=Desalination|volume=334|issue=1|pages=46\u201359|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2013.11.039}}</ref> or one might want to adjust a rocket's fuel usage and orientation so that it arrives both at a specified place and at a specified time; or one might want to conduct [[open market operations]] so that both the [[inflation rate]] and the [[unemployment rate]] are as close as possible to their desired values.\n\nOften such problems are subject to linear equality constraints that prevent all objectives from being simultaneously perfectly met, especially when the number of controllable variables is less than the number of objectives and when the presence of random shocks generates uncertainty. Commonly a multi-objective [[quadratic function#Bivariate (two variable) quadratic function|quadratic objective function]] is used, with the cost associated with an objective rising quadratically with the distance of the objective from its ideal value. Since these problems typically involve adjusting the controlled variables at various points in time and/or evaluating the objectives at various points in time, [[intertemporal optimization]] techniques are employed.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/IECON.2009.5415056 |isbn=978-1-4244-4648-3 |chapter=Chaos rejection and optimal dynamic response for boost converter using SPEA multi-objective optimization approach |title=2009 35th Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics |pages=3315\u20133322 |year=2009 |last1=Rafiei |first1=S.

Before looking for optimal designs it is important to identify characteristics which contribute the most to the overall value of the design. A good design typically involves multiple criteria/objectives such as capital cost/investment, operating cost, profit, quality and/or recovery of the product, efficiency, process safety, operation time etc. Therefore, in practical applications, the performance of process and product design is often measured with respect to multiple objectives. These objectives typically are conflicting, i.e. achieving the optimal value for one objective requires some compromise on one or more of other objectives.\n\nFor example, when designing a paper mill, one can seek to decrease the amount of capital invested in a paper mill and enhance the quality of paper simultaneously. If the design of a paper mill is defined by large storage volumes and paper quality is defined by quality parameters, then the problem of optimal design of a paper mill can include objectives such as: i) minimization of expected variation of those quality parameter from their nominal values, ii) minimization of expected time of breaks and iii) minimization of investment cost of storage volumes. Here, maximum volume of towers are design variables. This example of optimal design of a paper mill is a simplification of the model used in.<ref name=RoRiPi11>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ropponen | first1 = A. | last2 = Ritala | first2 = R. | last3 = Pistikopoulos | first3 = E.

Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. These objectives are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus there is a need for tight spatial [[frequency reuse]] which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. [[Multi-user MIMO]] techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive [[precoding]]. The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high data rates, thus the operator would like to find a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total network data throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.\n\nRadio resource management is often solved by scalarization; that is, selection of a network utility function that tries to balance throughput and user fairness. The choice of utility function has a large impact on the computational complexity of the resulting single-objective optimization problem.<ref name=fnt2013 /> For example, the common utility of weighted sum rate gives an [[NP-hard]] problem with a complexity that scales exponentially with the number of users, while the weighted max-min fairness utility results in a quasi-convex optimization problem with only a polynomial scaling with the number of users.<ref name=luo2008>Z.-Q.

This is called a scalarized problem. If scalarization is done neatly,{{Clarify|reason=What does \"neatly\" mean?|date=October 2018}} Pareto optimality of the solutions obtained can be guaranteed.\n\nSolving a multi-objective optimization problem is sometimes understood as approximating or computing all or a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions.<ref name=\"Ehrgott2005\">{{cite book|author=Matthias Ehrgott|title=Multicriteria Optimization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrZw9srrHroC|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|isbn=978-3-540-21398-7}}</ref><ref name=\"CoelloLamont2007\">{{cite book|author1=Carlos A.

In a posteriori methods, a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions is first found and then the DM must choose one of them. In interactive methods, the decision maker is allowed to iteratively search for the most preferred solution. In each iteration of the interactive method, the DM is shown Pareto optimal solution(s) and describes how the solution(s) could be improved. The information given by the decision maker is then taken into account while generating new Pareto optimal solution(s) for the DM to study in the next iteration. In this way, the DM learns about the feasibility of his/her wishes and can concentrate on solutions that are interesting to him/her. The DM may stop the search whenever he/she wants to. More information and examples of different methods in the four classes are given in the following sections.\n\n== Scalarizing ==\n\nScalarizing a multi-objective optimization problem is an a priori method, which means formulating a single-objective optimization problem such that optimal solutions to the single-objective optimization problem are Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective optimization problem.<ref name=\"HwangMasud1979\" /> In addition, it is often required that every Pareto optimal solution can be reached with some parameters of the scalarization.<ref name=\"HwangMasud1979\">{{cite book|author1=Ching-Lai Hwang|author2=Abu Syed Md Masud|title=Multiple objective decision making, methods and applications: a state-of-the-art survey|url=https://archive.org/details/multipleobjectiv0000hwan|url-access=registration|accessdate=29 May 2012|year=1979|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=978-0-387-09111-2}}</ref> With different parameters for the scalarization, different Pareto optimal solutions are produced.

Currently, most evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms apply Pareto-based ranking schemes.

The main advantage of evolutionary algorithms, when applied to solve multi-objective optimization problems, is the fact that they typically generate sets of solutions, allowing computation of an approximation of the entire Pareto front. The main disadvantage of evolutionary algorithms is their lower speed and the Pareto optimality of the solutions cannot be guaranteed. It is only known that none of the generated solutions dominates the others.\n\nAnother paradigm for multi-objective optimization based on novelty using evolutionary algorithms was recently improved upon.<ref name=vargas2015>Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas, Junichi Murata, Hirotaka Takano, Alexandre Claudio Botazzo Delbem (2015), \"[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00266 General Subpopulation Framework and Taming the Conflict Inside Populations]\", Evolutionary computation 23 (1), 1-36.</ref> This paradigm searches for novel solutions in objective space (i.e., novelty search<ref>Lehman, Joel, and Kenneth O. Stanley. \"Abandoning objectives: Evolution through the search for novelty alone.\" Evolutionary computation 19.2 (2011): 189-223.</ref> on objective space) in addition to the search for non-dominated solutions. Novelty search is like stepping stones guiding the search to previously unexplored places.

In other words, the decision maker is expected to express preferences at each iteration in order to get ''Pareto optimal solutions'' that are of interest to the decision maker and learn what kind of solutions are attainable. \n\nThe following steps are commonly present in interactive methods of optimization :<ref name=Miettinen2008>{{cite book | last1 = Miettinen | first1 = K. | last2 = Ruiz | first2 = F. | last3 = Wierzbicki | first3 = A.

Instead of mathematical convergence that is often used as a stopping criterion in [[mathematical optimization]] methods, a psychological convergence is often emphasized in interactive methods. Generally speaking, a method is terminated when the decision maker is confident that he/she has found the ''most preferred solution available''.\n\n=== Types of preference information ===\nThere are different interactive methods involving different types of preference information.

In classification based interactive methods, the decision maker is assumed to give preferences in the form of classifying objectives at the current Pareto optimal solution into different classes indicating how the values of the objectives should be changed to get a more preferred solution.

A hybrid algorithm in the context of multi-objective optimization is a combination of algorithms/approaches from these two fields (see e.g.<ref name=Miettinen2008 />). Hybrid algorithms of EMO and MCDM are mainly used to overcome shortcomings by utilizing strengths. Several types of hybrid algorithms have been proposed in the literature, e.g. incorporating MCDM approaches into EMO algorithms as a local search operator and to lead a DM to the most preferred solution(s) etc. A local search operator is mainly used to enhance the rate of convergence of EMO algorithms.\n\nThe roots for hybrid multi-objective optimization can be traced to the first Dagstuhl seminar organized in November 2004 (see, [http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=04461 here]). Here some of the best minds{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} in EMO (Professor Kalyanmoy Deb, Professor J\u00fcrgen Branke etc.) and MCDM (Professor Kaisa Miettinen, Professor Ralph E. Steuer etc.) realized the potential in combining ideas and approaches of MCDM and EMO fields to prepare hybrids of them. Subsequently many more Dagstuhl seminars have been arranged to foster collaboration. Recently, hybrid multi-objective optimization has become an important theme in several international conferences in the area of EMO and MCDM (see e.g.<ref name=Sindhya2011>{{cite book | last1 = Sindhya | first1 = K. | last2 = Ruiz | first2 = A.

The a posteriori preference techniques provide an important class of multi-objective optimization techniques.<ref name=\"Miettinen1999\" /> Usually the a posteriori preference techniques include four steps: (1) computer approximates the Pareto front, i.e. the Pareto optimal set in the objective space; (2) the decision maker studies the Pareto front approximation; (3) the decision maker identifies the preferred point at the Pareto front; (4) computer provides the Pareto optimal decision, which output coincides with the objective point identified by the decision maker. From the point of view of the decision maker, the second step of the a posteriori preference techniques is the most complicated one. There are two main approaches to informing the decision maker. First, a number of points of the Pareto front can be provided in the form of a list (interesting discussion and references are given in<ref name=\"BensonSayin1997\">{{cite journal|last1=Benson|first1=Harold P.|last2=Sayin|first2=Serpil|title=Towards finding global representations of the efficient set in multiple objective mathematical programming|journal=Naval Research Logistics|volume=44|issue=1|year=1997|pages=47\u201367|issn=0894-069X|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6750(199702)44:1<47::AID-NAV3>3.0.CO;2-M|hdl=11693/25666|url=http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/11693/25666/1/Towards%20finding%20global%20representations%20of%20the%20efficient%20set%20in%20multiple%20objective%20mathematical%20programming.pdf}}</ref>) or using Heatmaps.<ref name=\"Pryke,Mostaghim,Nazemi\">{{cite book|last=Pryke|first=Andy|author2=Sanaz Mostaghim |author3=Alireza Nazemi |title=Heatmap Visualisation of Population Based Multi Objective Algorithms|journal=Evolutionary Multi-Criterion Optimization|volume=4403|year=2007|pages=361\u2013375|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-70928-2_29|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-70927-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Visualization in bi-objective problems: tradeoff curve ===\n\nIn the case of bi-objective problems, informing the decision maker concerning the Pareto front is usually carried out by its visualization: the Pareto front, often named the tradeoff curve in this case, can be drawn at the objective plane. The tradeoff curve gives full information on objective values and on objective tradeoffs, which inform how improving one objective is related to deteriorating the second one while moving along the tradeoff curve. The decision maker takes this information into account while specifying the preferred Pareto optimal objective point. The idea to approximate and visualize the Pareto front was introduced for linear bi-objective decision problems by S.Gass and T.Saaty.<ref name=\"GassSaaty1955\">{{cite journal|last1=Gass|first1=Saul|last2=Saaty|first2=Thomas|title=The computational algorithm for the parametric objective function|journal=Naval Research Logistics Quarterly|volume=2|issue=1\u20132|year=1955|pages=39\u201345|issn=0028-1441|doi=10.1002/nav.3800020106}}</ref> This idea was developed and applied in environmental problems by J.L.

One of them, which is applicable in the case of a relatively small number of objective points that represent the Pareto front, is based on using the visualization techniques developed in statistics (various diagrams, etc. \u2013 see the corresponding subsection below). The second idea proposes the display of bi-objective cross-sections (slices) of the Pareto front. It was introduced by W.S. Meisel in 1973<ref>{{citation |title=Tradeoff decision in multiple criteria decision making |editor1=J. L. Cochrane |editor2=M. Zeleny |journal=Multiple Criteria Decision Making |pages=461\u2013476 |year=1973 |last1=Meisel |first1=W. L.}}</ref> who argued that such slices inform the decision maker on objective tradeoffs. The figures that display a series of bi-objective slices of the Pareto front for three-objective problems are known as the decision maps. They give a clear picture of tradeoffs between three criteria. Disadvantages of such an approach are related to two following facts. First, the computational procedures for constructing the bi-objective slices of the Pareto front are not stable since the Pareto front is usually not stable. Secondly, it is applicable in the case of only three objectives. In the 1980s, the idea W.S. Meisel of implemented in a different form \u2013 in the form of the [[Interactive Decision Maps]] (IDM) technique.<ref name=\"LotovBushenkov2004\">{{cite book |author1=A. V. Lotov |author2=V. A.
