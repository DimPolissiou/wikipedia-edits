A person doing such is called a '''beggar''' or '''panhandler'''. Beggars may be found in [[Public space|public places]] such as transport routes, urban parks, and  markets. Besides money, they may also ask for food, drink, cigarettes or other small items.\n\n[[Internet begging]] is the modern practice of asking people to give money to others via the Internet, rather than in person.  Internet begging is usually targeted at people who are acquainted with the beggar, but it may be advertised to strangers.  Internet begging encompasses requests for help meeting [[basic needs]] such as medical care and shelter, as well as requests for people to pay for [[vacation]]s, [[school trips]], and other things that the beggar wants but cannot comfortably afford.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nA beggar is different from a religious '''[[mendicant]]''' as some mendicants do not ask for money. Their survival is reciprocated by providing society with various forms of [[Church service|religious service]], [[moral education]], and preservation of [[culture]]. \n\n==History==\nBeggars have existed in human society since before the dawn of recorded history. Street begging has happened in most societies around the world, though its prevalence and exact form vary.\n\n[[File:Beggar in Uppsala, Sweden.jpg|thumbnail|right|A beggar in [[Uppsala]], Sweden.

The ''penes'' was somebody with a job, only not enough to make a living, while the ''ptochos'' depended on others entirely. The [[working poor]] were accorded a higher social status.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cavallo|first=Guglielmo|authorlink=Guglielmo Cavallo|title=The Byzantines|page=15|year=1997|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-09792-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJDRx6FAi0EC|ref=harv}}</ref> The [[New Testament]] contains several references to [[Jesus]]' status as the savior of the ''ptochos'', usually translated as \"the poor\", considered the most wretched portion of society. In the [[Rich man and Lazarus]] parable, Lazarus is called 'ptochos' and presented as living in extreme poverty.\n\n===Britain===\n''A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds'', was first published in 1566 by [[Thomas Harman]]. From early modern England, another example is [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]] in his [[coney-catching]] pamphlets, the titles of which included \"The Defence of Conny-catching,\" in which he argued there were worse crimes to be found among \"reputable\" people. ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' is a ballad opera in three acts written in 1728 by John Gay.  ''The Life and Adventures of [[Bampfylde Moore Carew]]'' was first published in 1745. There are similar writers for many European countries in the early modern period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nAccording to [[Jackson J. Spielvogel]], \"Poverty was a highly visible problem in the eighteenth century, both in cities and in the countryside... Beggars in Bologna were estimated at 25 percent of the population; in Mainz, figures indicate that 30 percent of the people were beggars or prostitutes... In France and Britain by the end of the century, an estimated 10 percent of the people depended on charity or begging for their food.\"<ref>Jackson J.

At various times, begging was restricted to the [[disability|disabled]]. This system developed into the [[workhouse]], a state-operated institution where those unable to obtain other employment were forced to work in often grim conditions in exchange for a small amount of food. The [[welfare state]] of the 20th century greatly reduced the number of beggars by directly providing for the basic necessities of the poor from state funds.\n\n===In India ===\n[[File:India - Kolkata street beggar - 3246.jpg|thumb|180px|A street beggar in [[India]] gets into a car]]\nBegging is an age old social phenomenon in India.

To avoid freezing to death, some beggars paid porters one copper coin to sleep in their warehouse for the night.

Beggar chiefs provided security in the form of food for beggars and in return received a portion of beggars daily earnings as tribute. Beggar chiefs would often lend out their surplus income back to beggars and charge interest, furthering their subjects dependence on them to the point of near slavery. Although beggar chiefs could acquire significant wealth they were still looked upon as low class citizens. The title of beggar chief was often passed through family line and could stick with an individual through occupational changes.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Religious begging==\n{{Main|Mendicant}}\n[[File:Mendicant in India.png|thumb|A mendicant outside \u2018''Kalkaji Mandir\u2019''  in Delhi, India]]\nMany religions have prescribed begging as the only acceptable means of support for certain classes of adherents, including [[Hinduism]], [[Sufism]], [[Buddhism]], and typically to provide a way for certain adherents to focus exclusively on spiritual development without the possibility of becoming caught up in worldly affairs.\n\nReligious ideals of \u2018''Bhiksha''\u2019 in Hinduism, \u2018''Charity''\u2019 in Christianity besides others promote [[alms-giving]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gopalakrishnan|first=A.|date=2002|title=Poverty As Crime|url=|journal=Frontline Magazine |volume=19 |page=23 |doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> This obligation of making gifts to God by alms-giving explains the occurrence of generous donations outside religious sites like temples and mosques to mendicants begging in the name of God.\n\n[[Tzedakah]] plays a central role in Judaism. According to the Torah, Jews are obligated to contribute 10% of their income as tithes, which also can include giving to the poor.\n\nIn [[Buddhism]], [[monk]]s and [[nun]]s traditionally live by begging for [[alms]], as done by the historical [[Gautama Buddha]] himself. This is, among other reasons, so that [[Laity]] can gain religious merit by giving food, medicines, and other essential items to the monks. The monks seldom need to plead for food; in villages and towns throughout modern [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], and other Buddhist countries, householders can often be found at dawn every morning streaming down the road to the local temple to give food to the monks. In East Asia, monks and nuns were expected to farm or work for returns to feed themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.udn.com/jackwing/3188887 |title=\u8fb2\u79aavs\u5546\u79aa |language=zh |publisher=Blog.udn.com |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://2007.tibetmagazine.net/20054-p83.htm |title=\u50e7\u4fd7 |publisher=2007.tibetmagazine.net |accessdate=2011-12-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318101902/http://2007.tibetmagazine.net/20054-p83.htm |archivedate=2012-03-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hkbuddhist.org/magazine/552/552_10.html |title=\u9435\u978b\u8e0f\u7834\u5fc3\u7121\u7919 \u6fc1\u6c57\u6210\u6ce5\u610f\u5fd7\u5805\u2014\u2014\u8a18\u5c71\u6771\u535a\u5c71\u6b63\u89ba\u5bfa\u4ec1\u9054\u6cd5\u5e2b |publisher=Hkbuddhist.org |accessdate=2011-12-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928101720/http://www.hkbuddhist.org/magazine/552/552_10.html |archive-date=2011-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMing China was founded by former beggar [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang.]] Orphaned in childhood due to famine, [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang,]] turned to the Huangjue temple for help.

It originated in the [[United States]] as a morning program block on the [[Disney Channel]]. Its programming was targeted at children ages 2\u20136, featuring a mix of live-action and [[list of animated television series|animated series]].\n\nThe Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel was rebranded as the [[Disney Junior]] block on Disney Channel on February 14, 2011. The 22 cable channels and blocks using the Playhouse Disney brand around the world were relaunched under the Disney Junior brand over the next two years, concluding with the rebranding of the Russian channel in November 2012.\n\n==History==\nPrior to Playhouse Disney's launch, Disney Channel had aired a lineup of preschool-targeted programs (which were mixed alongside animated series aimed at older children) during the morning hours since its debut in April 1983. On April 6, 1997, Disney Channel underwent a relaunch that signified the beginning of its full conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel, and its morning program block now utilized a similar graphics package for its promotions as that used for the channel's afternoon children's programs. After Disney Channel's preschool block premiered three new original series in 1998 (''[[PB&J Otter]]'', ''[[Rolie Polie Olie]]'', and ''[[Out of the Box (TV series)|Out of the Box]]''), the block rebranded as Playhouse Disney on February 1, 1999.\n\nOne of the Playhouse Disney block's most popular series was ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'', an educational live-action series from [[Jim Henson Productions]] that debuted in October 1997, focusing on the adventures of Bear (voice by [[Noel MacNeal]]); the series was named by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as one of the \"top 10 new shows for kids\" that year.<ref name=ks>{{cite news|last=Kidscreen Staff|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=April 12, 2014|newspaper=KidScreen.com|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> For the first three years of its run, the Playhouse Disney block originally aired each weekday from 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 2:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and weekends from 6:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. Following each program, which usually ran 23 minutes (most of which, with the exception of movies, aired without promotional interruption), the remainder of the time period was filled by either short segments and [[music video]]s (the latter of which were originally aired under the banner \"Feet Beat\") or an episode of an acquired short series.\n\nOn April 16, 2001, Playhouse Disney introduced a new on-air graphics package produced by motion graphics company Beehive;<ref>[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2002/June-1-2002/Opens-and-Logos.aspx Opens and Logos], ''Post Magazine'', June 1, 2002.</ref> actress [[Allyce Beasley]] began serving as the U.S. block's promo announcer at this time, a capacity she would hold until March 30, 2007.

On June 25, 2001, Disney-ABC Cable Networks Group (now Disney-ABC Television Group) announced plans to launch Playhouse Disney Channel, a companion [[digital cable]] and satellite channel that would have served the same target audience as the Disney Channel block;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624034312/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76166895.html Play nice now; Walt Disney Co. plans to introduce Playhouse Disney Channel], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'' (via HighBeam Research), June 25, 2001.</ref><ref name=wsj>{{cite news|last1=Beatty|first1=Sally|title=Disney Plans to Launch New Cable Network, Aiming Programming at Preschool Audience|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB993071891973180362|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 21, 2001}}</ref> plans for the network were later scrapped, although Disney-ABC International Television would launch dedicated Playhouse Disney Channels in international markets (including [[Canada]] and [[Latin America]]) between 2002 and 2007. The Walt Disney Company acquired the broadcast rights to ''[[The Wiggles]]'' as part of their purchase of the [[Fox Family Channel]] in 2001; ''The Wiggles'' moved to Playhouse Disney in June 2002 and became one of the block's most watched shows during its run.\n\nLike Disney Channel, Playhouse Disney was a commercial-free service, but it did show short \"promotional spots\" (structured as short-form segments for Disney products targeted at the block's demographics) along with \u2013 beginning in 2002 \u2013 [[underwriting|underwriter sponsorships]] (with companies such as [[McDonald's]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oei|first1=Lily|title=Nick's Noggin nabs sponsors|url=https://variety.com/2004/tv/news/nick-s-noggin-nabs-sponsors-1117897987/|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Variety|date=January 7, 2004}}</ref>) within breaks between programs<ref>{{cite web | title = Playhouse Disney schedule | url = http://tv.disney.go.com/playhouse/grown-ups/tvschedule.html | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}</ref> (preschool-targeted programs that aired between 3:00 and 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time outside of the Playhouse Disney banner, included the promotional shorts for Disney entertainment products that were seen during Disney Channel's afternoon and nighttime schedule). On October 7, 2002, Playhouse Disney changed its logo to reflect Disney Channel's on-air rebranding. As part of the block's effort to phase out its older interstitial material, it introduced a mascot in September named Clay (voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]), an anthropomorphic clay figure who often used the catchphrases \"It's true!\" and \"Are you with me?\".\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Clay was replaced by two anthropomorphic monkey puppets as the block's hosts, Ooh and Aah (who served as the main characters for one of the short series featured on the Playhouse Disney lineup, ''[[Ooh, Aah & You]]''). Beginning in 2007, Disney Channel began truncating the weekday block to four hours (from 5:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) during the summer months, in order to air episodes of Disney Channel original series during the late morning and early afternoon hours; however, the weekend schedule continued to air as a seven-hour block. By this point, the Playhouse Disney block had expanded to air from 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays, and 4:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on weekends, each running a different schedule.\n\n===Disney Junior===\n{{see also|Disney Junior}}\nOn May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of Disney Junior, a relaunching of Playhouse Disney that would serve as the brand for the Disney Channel block and a new standalone digital cable and satellite channel in the United States, as well as the new brand for the 22 existing Playhouse Disney-branded cable channels and program blocks worldwide.<ref name=\"PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/media/27disney.html?src=busln PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2010.</ref><ref name=\"EW\">[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior SOAPnet Will Go Dark to Make Way for Disney Junior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527032646/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', May 26, 2010.</ref> The Playhouse Disney block ended its 14-year run on February 13, 2011, with the last program to air being an episode of the short series ''Handy Manny's School for Tools'' at 1:55&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Disney Junior block debuted on February 14, 2011,<ref>{{cite web |first=Christy|last=Grosz |url=https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/disney-junior-acing-frosh-year-1118043061/ |title=Disney Junior acing frosh year |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 26, 2011 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> with ''[[Little Einsteins]]'' as its first program.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart|last=Levine |url=https://variety.com/2010/scene/markets-festivals/doc-mcstuffins-set-for-disney-1118021002/ |title=\"Doc McStuffins\" Set for Disney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 24, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/disney-junior-to-debut-in-february-2011-on-disney-channel/ |title=Disney Junior to Debut In February 2011 on Disney Channel |publisher=Disney Junior |via=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=November 5, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sofia M.|last=Fernandez |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-junior-shifts-focus-educational-35845 |title=Disney Junior Shifts Focus Away From Educational Programming |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 4, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=None of these sources even mention ''Little Einsteins''.|date=September 2019}} Several former Playhouse Disney series were carried over to the relaunched block including ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', ''[[Imagination Movers (TV series)|Imagination Movers]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', and ''[[Little Einsteins]]''.

television|satellite]] [[television channel]] that was owned by the [[Disney Channels Worldwide]] unit of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s [[Disney\u2013ABC Television Group]]. It originated in the [[United States]] as a morning program block on the [[Disney Channel]]. Its programming was targeted at children ages 2\u20136, featuring a mix of live-action and [[list of animated television series|animated series]].\n\nThe Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel was rebranded as the [[Disney Junior]] block on Disney Channel on February 14, 2011. The 22 cable channels and blocks using the Playhouse Disney brand around the world were relaunched under the Disney Junior brand over the next two years, concluding with the rebranding of the Russian channel in November 2012.\n\n==History==\nPrior to Playhouse Disney's launch, Disney Channel had aired a lineup of preschool-targeted programs (which were mixed alongside animated series aimed at older children) during the morning hours since its debut in April 1983. On April 6, 1997, Disney Channel underwent a relaunch that signified the beginning of its full conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel, and its morning program block now utilized a similar graphics package for its promotions as that used for the channel's afternoon children's programs. After Disney Channel's preschool block premiered three new original series in 1998 (''[[PB&J Otter]]'', ''[[Rolie Polie Olie]]'', and ''[[Out of the Box (TV series)|Out of the Box]]''), the block rebranded as Playhouse Disney on February 1, 1999.\n\nOne of the Playhouse Disney block's most popular series was ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'', an educational live-action series from [[Jim Henson Productions]] that debuted in October 1997, focusing on the adventures of Bear (voice by [[Noel MacNeal]]); the series was named by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as one of the \"top 10 new shows for kids\" that year.<ref name=ks>{{cite news|last=Kidscreen Staff|title=A Salute to Disney Channel: Disney Channel time line|url=http://kidscreen.com/1998/04/01/21442-19980401/|accessdate=April 12, 2014|newspaper=KidScreen.com|date=April 1, 1998}}</ref> For the first three years of its run, the Playhouse Disney block originally aired each weekday from 8:30&nbsp;a.m. to 2:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], and weekends from 6:00 to 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time. Following each program, which usually ran 23 minutes (most of which, with the exception of movies, aired without promotional interruption), the remainder of the time period was filled by either short segments and [[music video]]s (the latter of which were originally aired under the banner \"Feet Beat\") or an episode of an acquired short series.\n\nOn April 16, 2001, Playhouse Disney introduced a new on-air graphics package produced by motion graphics company Beehive;<ref>[http://www.postmagazine.com/Publications/Post-Magazine/2002/June-1-2002/Opens-and-Logos.aspx Opens and Logos], ''Post Magazine'', June 1, 2002.</ref> actress [[Allyce Beasley]] began serving as the U.S. block's promo announcer at this time, a capacity she would hold until March 30, 2007. [[Radio Disney]] [[cross-promotion|cross-promoted]] the block by rebranding its \"Mickey and Minnie's Tune Time\" block as \"Playhouse Disney\", and in 2002, the TV block's \"Feet Beat\" interstitials were renamed \"[[B. B. Good|B.B.]]'s Music Time\" to promote the Radio Disney block. On June 25, 2001, Disney-ABC Cable Networks Group (now Disney-ABC Television Group) announced plans to launch Playhouse Disney Channel, a companion [[digital cable]] and satellite channel that would have served the same target audience as the Disney Channel block;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624034312/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76166895.html Play nice now; Walt Disney Co. plans to introduce Playhouse Disney Channel], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'' (via HighBeam Research), June 25, 2001.</ref><ref name=wsj>{{cite news|last1=Beatty|first1=Sally|title=Disney Plans to Launch New Cable Network, Aiming Programming at Preschool Audience|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB993071891973180362|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=June 21, 2001}}</ref> plans for the network were later scrapped, although Disney-ABC International Television would launch dedicated Playhouse Disney Channels in international markets (including [[Canada]] and [[Latin America]]) between 2002 and 2007. The Walt Disney Company acquired the broadcast rights to ''[[The Wiggles]]'' as part of their purchase of the [[Fox Family Channel]] in 2001; ''The Wiggles'' moved to Playhouse Disney in June 2002 and became one of the block's most watched shows during its run.\n\nLike Disney Channel, Playhouse Disney was a commercial-free service, but it did show short \"promotional spots\" (structured as short-form segments for Disney products targeted at the block's demographics) along with \u2013 beginning in 2002 \u2013 [[underwriting|underwriter sponsorships]] (with companies such as [[McDonald's]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Oei|first1=Lily|title=Nick's Noggin nabs sponsors|url=https://variety.com/2004/tv/news/nick-s-noggin-nabs-sponsors-1117897987/|accessdate=July 21, 2014|work=Variety|date=January 7, 2004}}</ref>) within breaks between programs<ref>{{cite web | title = Playhouse Disney schedule | url = http://tv.disney.go.com/playhouse/grown-ups/tvschedule.html | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}</ref> (preschool-targeted programs that aired between 3:00 and 7:00&nbsp;a.m. Central Time outside of the Playhouse Disney banner, included the promotional shorts for Disney entertainment products that were seen during Disney Channel's afternoon and nighttime schedule). On October 7, 2002, Playhouse Disney changed its logo to reflect Disney Channel's on-air rebranding. As part of the block's effort to phase out its older interstitial material, it introduced a mascot in September named Clay (voiced by [[Debi Derryberry]]), an anthropomorphic clay figure who often used the catchphrases \"It's true!\" and \"Are you with me?\".\n\nOn March 31, 2007, Clay was replaced by two anthropomorphic monkey puppets as the block's hosts, Ooh and Aah (who served as the main characters for one of the short series featured on the Playhouse Disney lineup, ''[[Ooh, Aah & You]]''). Beginning in 2007, Disney Channel began truncating the weekday block to four hours (from 5:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) during the summer months, in order to air episodes of Disney Channel original series during the late morning and early afternoon hours; however, the weekend schedule continued to air as a seven-hour block. By this point, the Playhouse Disney block had expanded to air from 4:00&nbsp;a.m. to 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays, and 4:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time on weekends, each running a different schedule.\n\n===Disney Junior===\n{{see also|Disney Junior}}\nOn May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of Disney Junior, a relaunching of Playhouse Disney that would serve as the brand for the Disney Channel block and a new standalone digital cable and satellite channel in the United States, as well as the new brand for the 22 existing Playhouse Disney-branded cable channels and program blocks worldwide.<ref name=\"PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/media/27disney.html?src=busln PreSchool Programs Replace SOAPnet], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 27, 2010.</ref><ref name=\"EW\">[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior SOAPnet Will Go Dark to Make Way for Disney Junior] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527032646/http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/05/26/soapnet-will-go-dark-to-make-way-for-disney-junior/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', May 26, 2010.</ref> The Playhouse Disney block ended its 14-year run on February 13, 2011, with the last program to air being an episode of the short series ''Handy Manny's School for Tools'' at 1:55&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe Disney Junior block debuted on February 14, 2011,<ref>{{cite web |first=Christy|last=Grosz |url=https://variety.com/2011/digital/news/disney-junior-acing-frosh-year-1118043061/ |title=Disney Junior acing frosh year |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=September 26, 2011 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> with ''[[Little Einsteins]]'' as its first program.<ref>{{cite web |first=Stuart|last=Levine |url=https://variety.com/2010/scene/markets-festivals/doc-mcstuffins-set-for-disney-1118021002/ |title=\"Doc McStuffins\" Set for Disney |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 24, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/network-press-releases/disney-junior-to-debut-in-february-2011-on-disney-channel/ |title=Disney Junior to Debut In February 2011 on Disney Channel |publisher=Disney Junior |via=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=November 5, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Sofia M.|last=Fernandez |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-junior-shifts-focus-educational-35845 |title=Disney Junior Shifts Focus Away From Educational Programming |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=November 4, 2010 |access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|reason=None of these sources even mention ''Little Einsteins''.|date=September 2019}} Several former Playhouse Disney series were carried over to the relaunched block including ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', ''[[Special Agent Oso]]'', ''[[Imagination Movers (TV series)|Imagination Movers]]'', ''[[Handy Manny]]'', and ''[[Little Einsteins]]''.

Under [[Mir Naseer Khan I]] in 1758, who accepted the Afghan paramountcy, the boundaries of Kalat stretched up to [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] in the east and [[Bandar Abbas]] in the west. However, in November 1839, the British invaded Kalat and killed the Khan and his followers. Afterwards, the British influence in the region gradually grew. In 1869, the British Political Agent Robert Sandeman ended up mediating a dispute between the Khan of Kalat and the Sardars of Balochistan, and established the British primacy in the region. The tribal areas of Marri, Bugti, Khetran and Chaghi were brought under the direct administration of a British Agent, eventually to become the [[Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan]]. [[Las Bela (princely state)|Lasbela]] and [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]] were declared Special Areas with a different political system. The remaining areas of [[Sarawan]], [[Jhalawan]], [[Kacchi (Kalat)|Kacchi]] and [[Makran]] were retained as the Khanate of Kalat, supervised by a Political Agent of Kalat.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nIn the 20th century, the educated Baloch middle class harboured hopes of an independent Balochistan free of the British. They formed a nationalist movement [[Anjuman-e-Ittehad-e-Balochistan]] in 1931. One of their first campaigns was to fight for the accession of [[Azam Jan of Kalat|Azam Jan]] as the Khan of Kalat and a constitutional government to be established under him. They were successful in establishing Azam Jan as the Khan but the new Khan sided with the Sardars and turned his back on the Anjuman. His successor [[Mir Ahmad Yar Khan]] was more sympathetic to Anjuman but he was averse to upsetting his relations with the British. The Anujman, transformed into the [[Kalat State National Party]] (KSNP), continued to fight for independence from the British. It was declared illegal by the Khanate in 1939 and its active leaders and activists were exiled. This paved the way for the formation of new political parties, Balochistan Muslim League allied to the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in June 1939 and Anjuman-i-Watan allied to the [[Indian National Congress]] in the same year.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|pp=55\u201358}}\n\nDuring British rule Balochistan was under the rule of a Chief Commissioner and did not have the same status as other provinces of British India . The Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the period 1927-1947 strived to introduce reforms in Balochistan to bring it on par with other provinces of British India.\n\nDuring the Pakistan Movement, public opinion in Balochistan, at least in Quetta and other small towns, was overwhelmingly in favour of Pakistan. The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province\u2019s inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nThe Khan of Kalat lent great support to the Pakistan Movement but also desired to declare independence. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it clear that the princely states with the lapse of British paramountcy would have to join either India or Pakistan, keeping in mind their geographic and demographic compulsions.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nOn 19 July, Mountbatten called a Round Table Conference meeting between representatives of the State of Kalat and Government of Pakistan. Mountbatten discussed with them the status of the Kalat State. The representatives of Kalat argued that Kalat, as per the treaty of 1876,  was an independent and sovereign state and not an Indian state. Mountbatten accepted this position only for the purpose of negotiation. Although state of Kalat has always been a princely state. Thus, Mountbatten confined the topic of discussion to the leased areas of Quetta, Nushki, Nasirabad and Bolan. He explained that Pakistan rejected Kalat\u2019s claims that these areas should be returned to Kalat.\n\nPakistan's position was that it would inherit all treaty obligations incurred by India to the foreign states. Kalat argued that the leases clearly stated that the other party besides Kalat was the British Government alone. Kalat argued that it was a personal agreement and there was no provision that the leases to the British would be inherited by others. Therefore, since the agreement was between Kalat and the British Government, Pakistan could not be the latter's successor party.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nPakistan did not agree that the agreement was personal as personal agreements by nature implied that only a particular person was involved. Mountbatten also said that according to international law, treaties such as the one being discussed were inherited by successors and not invalidated by a transfer of power. Mountbatten also suggested that in case there was no agreement the matter could be put before an Arbitral Tribunal.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nKalat wished to have further discussions on the matter. Kalat also argued that in case of a vote in the leased areas between joining Kalat and joining Pakistan then the vote would go in favour of the former. Pakistan did not agree that the vote would have such a result.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nKalat also expressed its deepest desire to remain on friendly terms with Pakistan and stated that it understood that Jinnah, who was anxious for a correct decision, wanted more time to study the issues between Kalat and Pakistan. Mountbatten, however, suggested that Jinnah not be brought into the discussions.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nMountbatten insisted that Kalat and Pakistan sign a standstill agreement, which both countries did. The Standstill Agreement also stipulated that both parties would discuss as soon as possible about their relationship concerning Defence and External Affairs.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}} According to the Article I, 'The Government of Pakistan agrees that Kalat is an independent State, being quite different in status from other States of India'. However, the Article IV stated:\n{{quote|a [[standstill agreement (India)|standstill agreement]] will be made between Pakistan and Kalat by which Pakistan shall stand committed to all the responsibilities agreements signed by Kalat and the British Government from 1839 to 1947 and by this, Pakistan shall be the legal, constitutional and political successor of the British.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|p=59}}}}\n\nThrough this agreement, the [[British Paramountcy]] was effectively transferred to Pakistan.\n\nHowever, without making any agreement with Pakistan and in violation of the Standstill Agreement the Khan of Kalat declared independence, to Jinnah's shock. Later on, the ruler of Kalat unconditionally signed an Instrument of Accession with Pakistan on 27 March 1948, contrary to the wishes of his state's legislature.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\n===First conflict===\nBalochistan contained a [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)|Chief Commissioner's province]] and four [[princely state]]s under the British Raj.

Baloch complain that construction of the port relies on Chinese engineers and labourers, and few Balochs have been employed. There has been little improvement in living standards for Balochs in the area. A parallel town for workers at Gwadar is being built close to the old one to segregate Balochs from the growing influx of outsiders. Government officials illegally sold much of the land around Gwadar, making massive profits at the expense of local Balochs. The Pakistani government responded to the Baloch's increased resentment and resistance to their economic marginalisation in Gwadar with a hardline approach, stationing soldiers in the area to secure it from insurgent attacks.{{sfn|Kupecz|2012|p=103}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/49/6/1071|title=Renewed Ethnonationalist Insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan: The Militarized State and Continuing Economic Deprivation|author=Adeel|page=1079|agency=Asian Survey|volume=49|issue=6|date=December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Monsoon: The Indian Ocean & the battle for supremacy in the 21st century|author=Robert D Kaplan|isbn=978-1-863-95502-7|publisher=Griffin Press|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-ZZZJbQcfwC&pg=PA106}}</ref>\n\nThe construction project resulted in the employment of a large number of non-Balochs, especially Punjabis, even though there is an excess in the number of unemployed Baloch engineers and technicians.<ref name=\"td\">{{cite magazine|author=Umair Jamal|title=Pakistan's Balochs Fear Minority Status in Their Own Province|url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/02/pakistans-balochs-fear-minority-status-in-their-own-province/|magazine=The Diplomat|date=11 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Multiculturalism and immigration===\nDue to the historical shortage of skilled labour in Balochistan, skilled workers are often imported from other regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balochistan.gov.pk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=837:productive-sectors&catid=470:quetta-division&Itemid=17|title=Productive Sectors|agency=Government of Balochistan}}</ref> Their arrival means new industries can develop, boosting the local economy; however, nationalists argue that this creates resentment amongst the local inhabitants. Like Karachi, which after migration from Balochistan, Central Asia, Iran, East Asia and especially a large number of people arriving from other areas of Pakistan in search of daily living settled there, it has been a national financial hub in Pakistan,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findpk.com/cities/html/karachi.html|title=Karachi|publisher=Findpk.com}}</ref> thus the local inhabitants (Sindhis) became a minority in the largest city of their province. Nationalists argue against multiculturalism and non-Baloch immigration. Karachi city has been playing a key role as a financial hub for Pakistan and its economy has exploded to become on the major cities in Asia as a [[Port of Karachi|seaport]]. However, the city continues be a home for [[Ethnic violence|ethnic]] and [[sectarian violence]]. Balouch nationalist argue that migration leads to such events, and they are opposed to similar situation in Baluchistan. Mir Suleiman Dawood claims that the people in Balochistan remain deeply resentful of Pakistan's policies in the region and he, apart from other, rather militant, Baloch nationalist organisations have openly called for India's assistance in Balochistan's separation from Pakistan. On 12 August 2009, Khan of Kalat Mir Suleiman Dawood declared himself ruler of Balochistan and formally made announcement of a Council for Independent Balochistan. The Council's claimed domain includes \"Baloch of Iran\", apart from Pakistani Balochistan, but does not include Afghan Baloch regions, and the Council contains \"all separatist leaders including Nawabzada Bramdagh Bugti.\"<ref name=bs>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8444354.stm|work=BBC News|title=Balochistan reaches boiling point|date=7 January 2010|author=Aleem Maqbool}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Soviet invasion, around 4 million refugees from Afghanistan arrived and settled in the region which has resulted in substantial demographic imbalance.<ref name=\"td\"/> Perceived marginalisation as a result of increased Pashtun migration from Afghanistan during the Afghan War drives the insurgency.{{sfn|Kupecz|2012|p=100}}\n\n===Education issues===\nA major factor in the Balouchistan conflict is education, which nationalists feel has been neglected. The government of Pakistan recognises that importing skilled labour from other regions has caused tensions in the region, and has thus sought to encourage scholarships for Balochi students so they can participate in development programmes. The quota for Baloch students in Punjab university was doubled in 2010 under the Cheema Long Scheme, on the order of CM Shabaz Sharif. The provincial governments of Sindh, Punjab and KP said they would take steps to encourage Balochistan students to enroll and benefit from 100% scholarships.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/545+Balochistan+students+to+get+admissions+in+Sindh,+Punjab...-a0196327344|title=545 Balochistan students to get admissions in Sindh, Punjab professional colleges|newspaper=Balochistan Times via The Free Library|date=20 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/269366-cm-doubles-baloch-students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-quota|title=CM doubles Baloch students' quota|work=The News International|date=11 November 2010}}</ref> However, nationalists argue that not enough education development is taking place, and that the government has neglected its duty.\n\n===Military response===\nMany Balochis have not tended to look favourably on Pakistan and the army's intervention in politics as they see the military as dominated by [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and the interests of the Punjabis (who make up 45% of Pakistan's population) and lacking Baloch representation.{{sfn|Kupecz|2012|p=96\u20137}}\n\nIn the insurgencies themselves, the military's \"harsh response\" has led to \"a spiral of violence\".{{sfn|Kupecz|2012|p=104}} (See Human Rights Issues below.)

Under [[Mir Naseer Khan I]] in 1758, who accepted the Afghan paramountcy, the boundaries of Kalat stretched up to [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] in the east and [[Bandar Abbas]] in the west. However, in November 1839, the British invaded Kalat and killed the Khan and his followers. Afterwards, the British influence in the region gradually grew. In 1869, the British Political Agent Robert Sandeman ended up mediating a dispute between the Khan of Kalat and the Sardars of Balochistan, and established the British primacy in the region. The tribal areas of Marri, Bugti, Khetran and Chaghi were brought under the direct administration of a British Agent, eventually to become the [[Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan]]. [[Las Bela (princely state)|Lasbela]] and [[Kharan (princely state)|Kharan]] were declared Special Areas with a different political system. The remaining areas of [[Sarawan]], [[Jhalawan]], [[Kacchi (Kalat)|Kacchi]] and [[Makran]] were retained as the Khanate of Kalat, supervised by a Political Agent of Kalat.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nIn the 20th century, the educated Baloch middle class harboured hopes of an independent Balochistan free of the British. They formed a nationalist movement [[Anjuman-e-Ittehad-e-Balochistan]] in 1931. One of their first campaigns was to fight for the accession of [[Azam Jan of Kalat|Azam Jan]] as the Khan of Kalat and a constitutional government to be established under him. They were successful in establishing Azam Jan as the Khan but the new Khan sided with the Sardars and turned his back on the Anjuman. His successor [[Mir Ahmad Yar Khan]] was more sympathetic to Anjuman but he was averse to upsetting his relations with the British. The Anujman, transformed into the [[Kalat State National Party]] (KSNP), continued to fight for independence from the British. It was declared illegal by the Khanate in 1939 and its active leaders and activists were exiled. This paved the way for the formation of new political parties, Balochistan Muslim League allied to the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] in June 1939 and Anjuman-i-Watan allied to the [[Indian National Congress]] in the same year.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|pp=55\u201358}}\n\nDuring British rule Balochistan was under the rule of a Chief Commissioner and did not have the same status as other provinces of British India . The Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah in the period 1927-1947 strived to introduce reforms in Balochistan to bring it on par with other provinces of British India.\n\nDuring the Pakistan Movement, public opinion in Balochistan, at least in Quetta and other small towns, was overwhelmingly in favour of Pakistan. The pro-India Congress, which drew support from Hindus and some Muslims, sensing that geographic and demographic compulsions would not allow the province\u2019s inclusion into the newly Independent India, began to encourage separatist elements in Balochistan, and other Muslim majority provinces such as NWFP.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nThe Khan of Kalat lent great support to the Pakistan Movement but also desired to declare independence. Lord Mountbatten, however, made it clear that the princely states with the lapse of British paramountcy would have to join either India or Pakistan, keeping in mind their geographic and demographic compulsions.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nOn 19 July, Mountbatten called a Round Table Conference meeting between representatives of the State of Kalat and Government of Pakistan. Mountbatten discussed with them the status of the Kalat State. The representatives of Kalat argued that Kalat, as per the treaty of 1876,  was an independent and sovereign state and not an Indian state. Mountbatten accepted this position only for the purpose of negotiation. Although state of Kalat has always been a princely state. Thus, Mountbatten confined the topic of discussion to the leased areas of Quetta, Nushki, Nasirabad and Bolan. He explained that Pakistan rejected Kalat\u2019s claims that these areas should be returned to Kalat.\n\nPakistan's position was that it would inherit all treaty obligations incurred by India to the foreign states. Kalat argued that the leases clearly stated that the other party besides Kalat was the British Government alone. Kalat argued that it was a personal agreement and there was no provision that the leases to the British would be inherited by others. Therefore, since the agreement was between Kalat and the British Government, Pakistan could not be the latter's successor party.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nPakistan did not agree that the agreement was personal as personal agreements by nature implied that only a particular person was involved. Mountbatten also said that according to international law, treaties such as the one being discussed were inherited by successors and not invalidated by a transfer of power. Mountbatten also suggested that in case there was no agreement the matter could be put before an Arbitral Tribunal.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nKalat wished to have further discussions on the matter. Kalat also argued that in case of a vote in the leased areas between joining Kalat and joining Pakistan then the vote would go in favour of the former. Pakistan did not agree that the vote would have such a result.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nKalat also expressed its deepest desire to remain on friendly terms with Pakistan and stated that it understood that Jinnah, who was anxious for a correct decision, wanted more time to study the issues between Kalat and Pakistan. Mountbatten, however, suggested that Jinnah not be brought into the discussions.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\nMountbatten insisted that Kalat and Pakistan sign a standstill agreement, which both countries did. The Standstill Agreement also stipulated that both parties would discuss as soon as possible about their relationship concerning Defence and External Affairs.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}} According to the Article I, 'The Government of Pakistan agrees that Kalat is an independent State, being quite different in status from other States of India'. However, the Article IV stated:\n{{quote|a [[standstill agreement (India)|standstill agreement]] will be made between Pakistan and Kalat by which Pakistan shall stand committed to all the responsibilities agreements signed by Kalat and the British Government from 1839 to 1947 and by this, Pakistan shall be the legal, constitutional and political successor of the British.{{sfn|Siddiqi|2012|p=59}}}}\n\nThrough this agreement, the [[British Paramountcy]] was effectively transferred to Pakistan.\n\nHowever, without making any agreement with Pakistan and in violation of the Standstill Agreement the Khan of Kalat declared independence, to Jinnah's shock. Later on, the ruler of Kalat unconditionally signed an Instrument of Accession with Pakistan on 27 March 1948, contrary to the wishes of his state's legislature.{{sfn|Chawla|2012|p=81\u2013106}}\n\n===First conflict===\nBalochistan contained a [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)|Chief Commissioner's province]] and four [[princely state]]s under the British Raj.

Tension continued to grow amid consistent political disorder and instability at the federal level. The federal government tasked the Pakistan Army with building several new bases in key areas of Balochistan. Sher Muhammad Bijrani Marri led like-minded militants into guerrilla warfare from 1963 to 1969 by creating their own insurgent bases, spread out over {{convert|45000|mi|km}} of land, from the [[Mengal]] tribal area in the south to the [[Marri-Bugti Country|Marri]] and [[Bugti]] tribal areas in the north. Their goal was to force Pakistan to share revenue generated from the [[Sui gas fields]] with the tribal leaders. The insurgents bombed railway tracks and ambushed convoys.

Despite its important natural resources (gas, gold, copper, oil and uranium), the province has the lowest per capita income in Iran.

In October 2013, the group ''Jaish al-Adl'' (JAA, Army of Justice), killed 14 Iranian border guards in an ambush in the town of Rustak, near the town of Saravan. Shortly thereafter, the Iranian authorities executed 16 Balochs, on charges ranging from terrorism to drug trafficking.<ref name=ba/> Another group, ''Harakat Ansar Iran'' (Partisan Movement of Iran, HAI) killed two [[Basij]] officers and wounded numerous civilians in a October 2012 suicide bombing against the mosque of Imam Hussein, in the port city of [[Chabahar]] ([[Sistan and Baluchestan Province]]).<ref name=ba/>\n\nAccording to analyst Daniele Grassi, \"Salafism plays an increasingly central role\" for the \"post-Jundallah\" militants of JAA and HAI. \"The rhetoric of groups such as HAI and JAA uses strongly anti-[[Shia]] tones.

Created by [[Jim Henson|Jim]] and [[Jane Henson]] in 1955, they are the namesakes of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned [[media franchise]] that encompasses television, music, film, and other media associated with the characters.\n\nThe Muppets originated in the short-form television series ''[[Sam and Friends]]'', which aired from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969, and attained [[Celebrity|celebrity status]] and international recognition through ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (1976\u20131981), which received four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical [[film]]s, including ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979); ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' (1981); and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' (1984). The Walt Disney Company began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell [[The Jim Henson Company]]. The Muppets continued their media presence in the 1990s with ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]'' (1989) and ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' (1996\u201398), both of which were similar in format to ''The Muppet Show'', and three films: ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992), ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' (1996), and ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (1999).\n\nDisney acquired the Muppets in February 2004, allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years.<ref name=\"Disney2004Press\">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy The \"Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html |work=Press release |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=16 January 2013 |quote=In the months before his death in 1990, my father Jim Henson pursued extensive discussions with The Walt Disney Company based on his strong belief that Disney would be a perfect home for the Muppets. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207182316/http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004 }}</ref><ref name=\"agreement\">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy the  \"Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\"|url=http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|work=Press release|publisher=[[The Jim Henson Company]]|accessdate=16 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616224354/http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disney-buys-muppets-as-bid-prospect-fades-69711.html|title=Disney buys Muppets as bid prospect fades|work=The Independent|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=December 31, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203185919/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disney-buys-muppets-as-bid-prospect-fades-69711.html|archivedate=December 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Under Disney, subsequent projects included two films: ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' (2011) and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' (2014);

Rowlf became the first Muppet character to appear regularly on network television when he began appearing with [[Jimmy Dean]] on ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]''. In 1966, [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Lloyd Morrisett]] began developing a children's [[educational television]] program and approached Henson to design a cast of Muppet characters during this stage. Produced by the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the program debuted as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969.\n\nHenson and his creative team became closely involved with ''Sesame Street'' during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. ''Sesame Street'' garnered a positive response, and the Muppets' involvement in the series was said to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an \"effective and pleasurable viewing\" method of presentation for its educational curriculum.<ref>Morrow, p. 93</ref><ref>Davis, p. 163</ref>\n\n===1970s: ''The Muppet Show'' and foray into film===\nIn the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in ''[[The Land of Gorch]]'' segments during the first season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. As his involvement with ''Sesame Street'' continued, Henson began developing a network television series focusing on the Muppets;<ref>Finch, p. 5</ref> as opposed to ''Sesame Street'', however, this series would be aimed at a more adult audience and focus largely on [[sketch comedy]]. Two [[Pilot (television episode)|television pilots]], ''[[The Muppets Valentine Show]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence]]'', aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1974 and 1975, respectively.\n\nAfter ABC passed on the pilots and other networks in the United States expressed little interest in the project, British producer [[Lew Grade, Baron Grade|Lew Grade]] approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for [[Associated Television]]. Debuting in 1976, ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' introduced new characters such as [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]], and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] alongside existing characters such as Kermit and Rowlf. Aired in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]] in the United States, ''The Muppet Show'' became increasingly popular due to its sketch-[[Variety show|variety]] format, unique form of humor, and prolific roster of [[Guest appearance|guest stars]]. It was nominated for twenty-one [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s during its run, winning four, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series|Outstanding Variety Series]] in 1978. The success of ''The Muppet Show'' allowed [[The Jim Henson Company|Henson Associates]] to diversify into theatrical [[film]]s, the first of which, ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', was released in 1979.\n\n=== 1980s\u20131990s: Subsequent projects ===\nFollowing ''The Muppet Movie'' were ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'', released in 1981 and 1984, respectively. Collectively, the three films received four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations. In 1983, Henson debuted ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'', which aired on [[HBO]] in the United States until 1987.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave |title=Joseph Gordon-Levitt Starring in \u2018Fraggle Rock\u2019 Movie (Exclusive)|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/joseph-gordon-levitt-fraggle-rock-1201456256/|accessdate=May 14, 2016|work=Variety |date=March 19, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510041553/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/joseph-gordon-levitt-fraggle-rock-1201456256/|archivedate=May 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Henson entered negotiations with [[Michael Eisner]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]], in which the latter would acquire Jim Henson Productions and, in turn, the Muppets.

In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim came into contact with [[Frank Oz]] that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested [[Jerry Juhl]], who worked with Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in [[Oakland, California]]. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. By the time ''The Muppet Show'' began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz; [[Dave Goelz]]; [[Jerry Nelson]]; [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]; and later, [[Steve Whitmire]], while Juhl became head writer for the series. From ''The Muppet Show'' onward, [[Kevin Clash]]; [[Kathryn Mullen]]; [[Louise Gold]]; [[Karen Prell]]; [[Fran Brill]], [[Caroll Spinney]]; and [[Brian Henson]] performed several minor characters and assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across ''The Muppet Show,'' ''Sesame Street'', ''Fraggle Rock'', and other Henson-related projects.\n\nHenson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Whitmire, Goelz, and [[Bill Barretta]], who joined the main cast of performers in the mid-1990s, assumed Henson's characters, with Whitmire also assuming the role of Beaker. The remainder of Hunt's characters were left without a stable performer until [[David Rudman]] was cast in those roles in the late 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000; [[Eric Jacobson]] assumed his characters beginning in 2002.<ref name=VarMojo/> At Nelson's behest, [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]] gradually began performing his characters in 2008.\n\nWhitmire was [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and most of Whitmire's other characters assumed by the remainder of the cast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kermit-frog-muppeteer-says-he-was-fired-by-disney-1020466|title=Kermit the Frog Muppeteer Says Disney Fired Him|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=July 13, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713213313/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kermit-frog-muppeteer-says-he-was-fired-by-disney-1020466|archive-date=July 13, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Muppets are currently performed by a cast of six principal puppeteers: Jacobson, Goelz, Barretta, Rudman, Vogel and [[Peter Linz]].<ref name=\"VarMojo\" />\n\n==Design and performance==\n[[File:Rowlf the Dog in Jim Henson's Fantastic World Touring exhibit (in Little Rock, Arkansas).jpg|225px|thumb|A [[Rowlf the Dog]] puppet on display at an exhibit in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. Common design elements appear on this puppet, including glove-like \u201clive hands\u201d.]]\n\nThe majority of the Muppets are designed as [[hand puppets]], with several characters utilizing [[hand puppet#Rod puppets|rods]]. Common design elements of the Muppets include wide mouths and large protruding eyes. Most of the Muppets are molded or carved out of various types of foam and covered with any felt-like material. The characters may represent humans; [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] characters; realistic animals; robots; extraterrestrial or mythical creatures; or other forms of abstract characters.\n\nThe Muppets are distinguished from [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] dummies, which are usually animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. They are also generally made of softer material. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, officially known as a \"Muppet performer\", who is usually hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, a stage was used to mask the performers, as would be the case in a live performance. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; in most cases, invisible strings are used to manipulate these puppets, with vocals added at a later point.<ref>Christopher Finch ''Jim Henson: The Works'' 1993, {{ISBN|0-679-41203-4}}.</ref>\n\nSince 2006, Disney has contracted [[Puppet Heap]] to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Wocka, Wocka, Wocka!

One consequence of this design is that most of the Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.\n\nFor more complex Muppets, several performers may operate a single character, with the performer controlling the mouth usually voicing the character. As technology has advanced, the Jim Henson team and other performers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, [[remote manipulators]], and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to exhibit complex movements wholly independently of the performer.\n\nIn his book ''[[Street Gang]]'', author Michael Davis wrote that the characters tend to develop \"organically\", alluding to the performers taking up to a year to develop their characters and voices. They are also \"test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davis |first=Michael |title=Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street |publisher=Viking Press |year=2008 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/streetgangcomple00davi/page/166 166] |isbn=978-0-670-01996-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/streetgangcomple00davi/page/166 }}</ref> When interacting with them, children believed that Muppets were living beings, even when the performers were present.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morrow |first=Robert W. |title=Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |page=[https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/84 84] |isbn=0-8018-8230-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/84 }}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n=== Filmography and television ===\n{{main|List of The Muppets productions}}\n\n===Discography===\n{{main|The Muppets discography}}\nOn September 17, 2002, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released ''[[The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More]]'', a compilation album of music from ''The Muppet Show'' and subsequent film releases.

Created by [[Jim Henson|Jim]] and [[Jane Henson]] in 1955, they are the namesakes of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned [[media franchise]] that encompasses television, music, film, and other media associated with the characters.\n\nThe Muppets originated in the short-form television series ''[[Sam and Friends]]'', which aired from 1955 to 1961. Following appearances on late night talk shows and in advertising during the 1960s, the Muppets began appearing on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969, and attained [[Celebrity|celebrity status]] and international recognition through ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (1976\u20131981), which received four [[Primetime Emmy Award]] wins and twenty-one nominations during its five-year run.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Muppets diversified into theatrical [[film]]s, including ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979); ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' (1981); and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' (1984). The Walt Disney Company began involvement with the Muppets in the late 1980s, during which Henson entered negotiations to sell [[The Jim Henson Company]]. The Muppets continued their media presence in the 1990s with ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]'' (1989) and ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'' (1996\u201398), both of which were similar in format to ''The Muppet Show'', and three films: ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' (1992), ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'' (1996), and ''[[Muppets from Space]]'' (1999).\n\nDisney acquired the Muppets in February 2004, allowing the characters to gain broader public exposure than in previous years.<ref name=\"Disney2004Press\">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy The \"Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\" |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html |work=Press release |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=16 January 2013 |quote=In the months before his death in 1990, my father Jim Henson pursued extensive discussions with The Walt Disney Company based on his strong belief that Disney would be a perfect home for the Muppets. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207182316/http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004 }}</ref><ref name=\"agreement\">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy the  \"Muppets\" and \"Bear in the Big Blue House\"|url=http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|work=Press release|publisher=[[The Jim Henson Company]]|accessdate=16 January 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616224354/http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disney-buys-muppets-as-bid-prospect-fades-69711.html|title=Disney buys Muppets as bid prospect fades|work=The Independent|date=February 18, 2004|accessdate=December 31, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203185919/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/disney-buys-muppets-as-bid-prospect-fades-69711.html|archivedate=December 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Under Disney, subsequent projects included two films: ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' (2011) and ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]'' (2014);

Rowlf became the first Muppet character to appear regularly on network television when he began appearing with [[Jimmy Dean]] on ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]''. In 1966, [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and [[Lloyd Morrisett]] began developing a children's [[educational television]] program and approached Henson to design a cast of Muppet characters during this stage. Produced by the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the program debuted as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969.\n\nHenson and his creative team became closely involved with ''Sesame Street'' during the years that followed; Henson waived his performance fee in exchange for retaining ownership rights to the Muppet characters created for the program. ''Sesame Street'' garnered a positive response, and the Muppets' involvement in the series was said to be a vital component of its increasing popularity, providing an \"effective and pleasurable viewing\" method of presentation for its educational curriculum.<ref>Morrow, p. 93</ref><ref>Davis, p. 163</ref>\n\n===1970s: ''The Muppet Show'' and foray into film===\nIn the early 1970s, the Muppets continued their presence in television, primarily appearing in ''[[The Land of Gorch]]'' segments during the first season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. As his involvement with ''Sesame Street'' continued, Henson began developing a network television series focusing on the Muppets;<ref>Finch, p. 5</ref> as opposed to ''Sesame Street'', however, this series would be aimed at a more adult audience and focus largely on [[sketch comedy]]. Two [[Pilot (television episode)|television pilots]], ''[[The Muppets Valentine Show]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence]]'', aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1974 and 1975, respectively.\n\nAfter ABC passed on the pilots and other networks in the United States expressed little interest in the project, British producer [[Lew Grade, Baron Grade|Lew Grade]] approached Henson and agreed to co-produce the series for [[Associated Television]]. Debuting in 1976, ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' introduced new characters such as [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[Gonzo (Muppet)|Gonzo]], and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] alongside existing characters such as Kermit and Rowlf. Aired in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]] in the United States, ''The Muppet Show'' became increasingly popular due to its sketch-[[Variety show|variety]] format, unique form of humor, and prolific roster of [[Guest appearance|guest stars]]. It was nominated for twenty-one [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s during its run, winning four, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series|Outstanding Variety Series]] in 1978. The success of ''The Muppet Show'' allowed [[The Jim Henson Company|Henson Associates]] to diversify into theatrical [[film]]s, the first of which, ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', was released in 1979.\n\n=== 1980s\u20131990s: Subsequent projects ===\nFollowing ''The Muppet Movie'' were ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'', released in 1981 and 1984, respectively.

In 1961, Jane retired to focus on raising their children. Seeking additional performers, Jim came into contact with [[Frank Oz]] that year. Although interested, Oz initially declined due to his youth and commitment to high school, and instead suggested [[Jerry Juhl]], who worked with Oz at the Vagabond Puppet Theater in [[Oakland, California]]. Upon graduating, Oz subsequently joined in August 1963. By the time ''The Muppet Show'' began, the primary cast of performers grew to consist of Henson; Oz; [[Dave Goelz]]; [[Jerry Nelson]]; [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]; and later, [[Steve Whitmire]], while Juhl became head writer for the series. From ''The Muppet Show'' onward, [[Kevin Clash]]; [[Kathryn Mullen]]; [[Louise Gold]]; [[Karen Prell]]; [[Fran Brill]], [[Caroll Spinney]]; and [[Brian Henson]] performed several minor characters and assisted the main performers with puppeteering. Many of these puppeteers performed characters across ''The Muppet Show,'' ''Sesame Street'', ''Fraggle Rock'', and other Henson-related projects.\n\nHenson, Hunt, and Nelson continued performing until their deaths in 1990, 1992, and 2012, respectively. Whitmire, Goelz, and [[Bill Barretta]], who joined the main cast of performers in the mid-1990s, assumed Henson's characters, with Whitmire also assuming the role of Beaker. The remainder of Hunt's characters were left without a stable performer until [[David Rudman]] was cast in those roles in the late 2000s. Oz continued performing until his retirement from puppeteering in 2000; [[Eric Jacobson]] assumed his characters beginning in 2002.<ref name=VarMojo/> At Nelson's behest, [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]] gradually began performing his characters in 2008.\n\nWhitmire was [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] from the cast in 2016, with Vogel cast as Kermit the Frog in 2017, and most of Whitmire's other characters assumed by the remainder of the cast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kermit-frog-muppeteer-says-he-was-fired-by-disney-1020466|title=Kermit the Frog Muppeteer Says Disney Fired Him|last=Parker|first=Ryan|date=July 13, 2017|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713213313/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/kermit-frog-muppeteer-says-he-was-fired-by-disney-1020466|archive-date=July 13, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Muppets are currently performed by a cast of six principal puppeteers: Jacobson, Goelz, Barretta, Rudman, Vogel and [[Peter Linz]].<ref name=\"VarMojo\" />\n\n==Design and performance==\n[[File:Rowlf the Dog in Jim Henson's Fantastic World Touring exhibit (in Little Rock, Arkansas).jpg|225px|thumb|A [[Rowlf the Dog]] puppet on display at an exhibit in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]]. Common design elements appear on this puppet, including glove-like \u201clive hands\u201d.]]\n\nThe majority of the Muppets are designed as [[hand puppets]], with several characters utilizing [[hand puppet#Rod puppets|rods]]. Common design elements of the Muppets include wide mouths and large protruding eyes. Most of the Muppets are molded or carved out of various types of foam and covered with any felt-like material. The characters may represent humans; [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] characters; realistic animals; robots; extraterrestrial or mythical creatures; or other forms of abstract characters.\n\nThe Muppets are distinguished from [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] dummies, which are usually animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also animated. They are also generally made of softer material. They are presented as being independent of the puppeteer, officially known as a \"Muppet performer\", who is usually hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame to this advantage was an innovation of the Muppets. Prior to this, a stage was used to mask the performers, as would be the case in a live performance. Sometimes, they are seen full-bodied; in most cases, invisible strings are used to manipulate these puppets, with vocals added at a later point.<ref>Christopher Finch ''Jim Henson: The Works'' 1993, {{ISBN|0-679-41203-4}}.</ref>\n\nSince 2006, Disney has contracted [[Puppet Heap]] to produce and maintain newer models of the Muppets.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Wocka, Wocka, Wocka!

One consequence of this design is that most of the Muppets are left-handed, with the performer using their right hand to operate the head while operating the arm with their left hand.\n\nFor more complex Muppets, several performers may operate a single character, with the performer controlling the mouth usually voicing the character. As technology has advanced, the Jim Henson team and other performers have developed several means to operate the Muppets for film and television; these include the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, [[remote manipulators]], and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of different technologies has allowed for scenes in which the Muppets appear to exhibit complex movements wholly independently of the performer.\n\nIn his book ''[[Street Gang]]'', author Michael Davis wrote that the characters tend to develop \"organically\", alluding to the performers taking up to a year to develop their characters and voices. They are also \"test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davis |first=Michael |title=Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street |publisher=Viking Press |year=2008 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/streetgangcomple00davi/page/166 166] |isbn=978-0-670-01996-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/streetgangcomple00davi/page/166 }}</ref> When interacting with them, children believed that Muppets were living beings, even when the performers were present.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morrow |first=Robert W. |title=Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |page=[https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/84 84] |isbn=0-8018-8230-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/84 }}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n=== Filmography and television ===\n{{main|List of The Muppets productions}}\n\n===Discography===\n{{main|The Muppets discography}}\nOn September 17, 2002, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released ''[[The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More]]'', a compilation album of music from ''The Muppet Show'' and subsequent film releases.
