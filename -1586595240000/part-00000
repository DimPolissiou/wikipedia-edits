The majority of 126s were produced in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]], [[Poland]], as the '''[[Polski Fiat]] 126p''', where production continued until 2000. In many markets Fiat stopped sales of the 126 in 1993 in favour of their new front-engined [[Fiat Cinquecento|Cinquecento]]. At a length of 3.05 metres, total production reach almost 4.7 million units.

In [[Austria]], it was briefly assembled by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch|Steyr Puch]] as a successor to the successful [[Puch 500]], with assembly lasting until 1975 &mdash; and production of 2069 examples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steyrpuch.at/puch126.htm|title=STEYR-PUCH-FREUNDE OBERK\u00c4RNTEN|website=www.steyrpuch.at|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> In [[Greece]], there was an attempt to produce a small car named [[DIM (automobiles)|DIM]] whose technical layout was largely based on the 126, but only ten were produced before the project was abandoned.{{cn}}\n\nThe 126 never achieved the popularity of the 500 in Western Europe, as the rear-engined layout lost favor to [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]], nonetheless becoming one of the last and longest-living rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe, survived only by the [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] whose production lasted until 1978 (2003, globally).  The 126 was the last rear-engine small car to be manufactured in Europe until the advent of the [[Smart Fortwo]].\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS. Two models were offered: a lesser equipped one called the \"POP 650\" and a more luxurious model called the \"POP 2000\".\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n== Polski Fiat 126p ==\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polski Fiat 126p (Poland)]]\n\nIn [[Poland]], the car was produced under licence by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ma\u0142olitra\u017cowych]] (FSM) (En: Small-Engined Car Factory) in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]] and [[Tychy]] under the brand [[Polski Fiat]] 126p (literally in English: ''Polish Fiat 126p'') between 1973 and 2000.\n\nDue to a relatively low price it was very popular in Poland and was arguably the most popular Polish car in the 1980s. Its very small size gave it the nickname '''''maluch''''' (\"the small one\", \"small child\", pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8malux|}}). The nickname became so popular that in 1997 it was accepted by the manufacturer as the official name of the car.\n[[File:FSM Niki 650 (14821160718).jpg|thumb|A 126 in Australia, sold locally as the FSM Niki.]]\nAt first it was almost identical with the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy but orange in other markets. To distinguish it from the original Italian car, the letter \"p\" was added to its name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the 126p was continuously modified. First it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat, then hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985 a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator in around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift, and some parts from the [[Fiat Cinquecento]]; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.\n\nIn 1987 the 126 BIS went into production, featuring a water-cooled 704&nbsp;cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some of parts from [[Fiat cinquecento]].\n\nThe factory battery in 126p had only a 35 Amp-hour capacity, which, combined with undersized generator, resulted in the car never having a fully charged battery unless driven for an extended time. Some owners upgraded to a 45 Amp-hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Liter engine) to improve the cold start reliability.\n\n[[File:GeneralLeeFiat.JPG|thumb|right|A modified Fiat 126]]\n\nThe 126p was exported to many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and for several years it was one of the most popular cars in [[Poland]] and in [[Hungary]] as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992, under the name '''FSM Niki'''. During that period it was Australia's cheapest car.<ref>{{cite web|title=FSM Niki 650, too little, too late|url=http://www.transeum.com/worlds-worst-cars/fsm-niki-650-too-little-too-late.html|publisher=Transeum|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also successful in [[Cuba]] where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10.000 still exist today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polish-fiat-126p-sees-unlikely-cuban-revival/a-19464887|title=Polish Fiat 126p sees unlikely Cuban revival {{!}} DW {{!}} 11 August 2016|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, there were several experimental prototypes developed in Poland. A cargo version called \"Bombel\" (literally \"bubble\", but also a colloquial term for \"small child\") because of its fibreglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front wheel drive, front engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.\n\nThere was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body. It is also a popular platform for electric engine and motorcycle engine swaps.\n\n=== History of PF 126p ===\n[[File:Fiat 126 BIS during \u201eXXX lat motoryzacji PRL\u201d exhibition at Bonarka City Center in Krak\u00f3w.JPG|thumb|From 1987 the 126 became available as a hatchback, in spite of having the engine in the rear.]]\n* 1972 \u2013 the FSM car factory was built in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]].\n* 6 June 1973 \u2013 the first Polski Fiat 126p constructed from Italian parts.

During the absolute rule of the [[PZPR]], a private car was considered a luxury item, due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971 there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Marcin | last = Zaremba | url = http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/good-bye-gierek,395534.html| title = Good bye, Gierek! | journal = [[Polityka]] | volume = 45 | year = 2004 | issue = 2477 | page = 79 | language = Polish }}</ref> In a top-down [[planned economy]], decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the [[FSO Syrena|Syrena]], but it was outdated and its production was limited. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was difficult to buy a Western car because the [[Polish z\u0142oty]], like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds and there was no free market in the country.\n\nThus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to provide mobility for ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new [[PZPR]] leader, [[Edward Gierek]], who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]]. Despite the fact that it was a very small [[city car]], it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a [[family car]]. During holidays, it was common to see families of four driving PF-126s abroad with huge suitcases on a [[roof rack]]; sightings of PF-126s towing a small [[:pl:Niewiad\u00f3w N126|Niewiad\u00f3w N126]] caravan especially designed for the PF 126 were also occasionally reported.<ref name=zakrz/> PF 126p production, however, was not sufficient and the PF 126p was on sale with a waiting list. Usually families had to wait a couple of years to buy a car.<ref name=zakrz>Zakrzewski, Adam (2010). pp.72-83</ref> A coupon for a car could also be given by the authorities based on merit.\n\n== Nicknames ==\n\nIn Poland it is called ''Maluch'', which literally means \"small one\" or toddler,<ref>{{cite book|last=Turnock|first=David|title=The East European economy in context: communism and transition|year=1997|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-08626-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qej-6dP5e74C&pg=PA307&dq=126p+Maluch|accessdate=6 November 2010|page=307}}</ref> as well as ''ma\u0142y Fiat'' (\"small Fiat\"), in contrast to [[Fiat 125p]], called ''du\u017cy Fiat'' (\"big Fiat\").<ref>{{cite book|last=Swan|first=Oscar E.|title=Intermediate Polish|year=1986|publisher=Slavica Publishers|isbn=978-0-89357-165-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mD8IAAAAIAAJ&q=ma\u0142y+Fiat&dq=ma\u0142y+Fiat|accessdate=6 November 2010|page=71}}</ref> In some regions, it is also called ''Kaszlak'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Czeszewski|first=Maciej|title=S\u0142ownik polszczyzny potocznej|year=2006|publisher=Wydawn.

By this time 1,352,912 of the cars had been produced in Italy.\n\nThe car was also produced under licence by [[Zastava Automobiles|Zastava]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Austria]], it was briefly assembled by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch|Steyr Puch]] as a successor to the successful [[Puch 500]], but assembly only lasted until 1975 with only 2069 having been built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steyrpuch.at/puch126.htm|title=STEYR-PUCH-FREUNDE OBERK\u00c4RNTEN|website=www.steyrpuch.at|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> In [[Greece]], there was an attempt to produce a small car named [[DIM (automobiles)|DIM]] whose technical layout was largely based on the 126, but only ten were produced before the project was abandoned.\n\nThe 126 never achieved the frenzied popularity of the 500 in Western Europe, partly due to the fact that rear-engined small cars were considered outdated by the time it arrived as the Mini had paved the way for [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]] small cars. Despite this, it still proved popular in Eastern Europe and remained in production for a long time, thus becoming one of the last and longest-living rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe. In fact, it was only survived by the [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] whose production lasted until 2003, although production in Europe ceased in 1978, making the 126 the last rear-engine small car to be manufactured in Europe.{{Dubious|Rear-engined small cars still being made in Europe |reason=Various Smart models are rear-engined, small and manufactured in Europe even at the time of this tagging|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS. Two models were offered: a lesser equipped one called the \"POP 650\" and a more luxurious model called the \"POP 2000\".\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n== Polski Fiat 126p ==\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polski Fiat 126p (Poland)]]\n\nIn [[Poland]], the car was produced under licence by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ma\u0142olitra\u017cowych]] (FSM) (En: Small-Engined Car Factory) in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]] and [[Tychy]] under the brand [[Polski Fiat]] 126p (literally in English: ''Polish Fiat 126p'') between 1973 and 2000.\n\nDue to a relatively low price it was very popular in Poland and was arguably the most popular Polish car in the 1980s. Its very small size gave it the nickname '''''maluch''''' (\"the small one\", \"small child\", pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8malux|}}). The nickname became so popular that in 1997 it was accepted by the manufacturer as the official name of the car.\n[[File:FSM Niki 650 (14821160718).jpg|thumb|A 126 in Australia, sold locally as the FSM Niki.]]\nAt first it was almost identical with the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy but orange in other markets. To distinguish it from the original Italian car, the letter \"p\" was added to its name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the 126p was continuously modified. First it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat, then hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985 a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator in around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift, and some parts from the [[Fiat Cinquecento]]; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.\n\nIn 1987 the 126 BIS went into production, featuring a water-cooled 704&nbsp;cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some of parts from [[Fiat cinquecento]].\n\nThe factory battery in 126p had only a 35 Amp-hour capacity, which, combined with undersized generator, resulted in the car never having a fully charged battery unless driven for an extended time. Some owners upgraded to a 45 Amp-hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Liter engine) to improve the cold start reliability.\n\n[[File:GeneralLeeFiat.JPG|thumb|right|A modified Fiat 126]]\n\nThe 126p was exported to many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and for several years it was one of the most popular cars in [[Poland]] and in [[Hungary]] as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992, under the name '''FSM Niki'''. During that period it was Australia's cheapest car.<ref>{{cite web|title=FSM Niki 650, too little, too late|url=http://www.transeum.com/worlds-worst-cars/fsm-niki-650-too-little-too-late.html|publisher=Transeum|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also successful in [[Cuba]] where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10.000 still exist today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polish-fiat-126p-sees-unlikely-cuban-revival/a-19464887|title=Polish Fiat 126p sees unlikely Cuban revival {{!}} DW {{!}} 11 August 2016|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, there were several experimental prototypes developed in Poland. A cargo version called \"Bombel\" (literally \"bubble\", but also a colloquial term for \"small child\") because of its fibreglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front wheel drive, front engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.\n\nThere was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body. It is also a popular platform for electric engine and motorcycle engine swaps.\n\n=== History of PF 126p ===\n[[File:Fiat 126 BIS during \u201eXXX lat motoryzacji PRL\u201d exhibition at Bonarka City Center in Krak\u00f3w.JPG|thumb|From 1987 the 126 became available as a hatchback, in spite of having the engine in the rear.]]\n* 1972 \u2013 the FSM car factory was built in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]].\n* 6 June 1973 \u2013 the first Polski Fiat 126p constructed from Italian parts.

During the absolute rule of the [[PZPR]], a private car was considered a luxury item, due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971 there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Marcin | last = Zaremba | url = http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/good-bye-gierek,395534.html| title = Good bye, Gierek! | journal = [[Polityka]] | volume = 45 | year = 2004 | issue = 2477 | page = 79 | language = Polish }}</ref> In a top-down [[planned economy]], decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the [[FSO Syrena|Syrena]], but it was outdated and its production was limited. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was difficult to buy a Western car because the [[Polish z\u0142oty]], like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds and there was no free market in the country.\n\nThus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to provide mobility for ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new [[PZPR]] leader, [[Edward Gierek]], who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]]. Despite the fact that it was a very small [[city car]], it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a [[family car]].

One of three closely related species of [[tropicbird]] (Phaethontidae), it was described by [[Pieter Boddaert]] in 1783. Superficially resembling a [[tern]] in appearance, it has almost all-white plumage with a black mask and a red bill. The sexes have similar plumage. As referenced in the common name, adults have red {{birdgloss|tail streamers}} that are about twice their body length. Four subspecies are recognised, but there is evidence of [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] variation in body size\u2014with smaller birds in the north and larger in the south\u2014and hence no grounds for subspecies.\n\nThe red-tailed tropicbird eats fish\u2014mainly [[flying fish]] and squid\u2014after catching them by plunge-diving into the ocean. [[Nesting instinct|Nesting]] takes place in loose [[bird colony|colonies]] on oceanic islands; the nest itself is a [[Bird nest#Scrape|scrape]] found on a cliff face, in a crevice, or on a sandy beach. A single egg is laid, then is incubated by both sexes for about six weeks. The parents make long food-foraging trips of about 150 hours during incubation, but once the chick has hatched, the parents specialize their foraging: one forages for the chick for a few hours at a time, while the other makes much longer trips to feed themselves.\n\nThis bird is considered to be a [[least-concern species]] according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), though it is adversely affected by human contact. Rats and feral cats prey on eggs and young at nesting sites. The bird's tail streamers were once prized by some [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] and [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] peoples.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe British naturalist [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] encountered the red-tailed tropicbird on the Pacific Ocean in March 1769 on [[First voyage of James Cook|James Cook's first voyage]], noting that it was a different species to the familiar [[red-billed tropicbird]].

One of three closely related species of [[tropicbird]] (Phaethontidae), it was described by [[Pieter Boddaert]] in 1883. Superficially resembling a [[tern]] in appearance, it has almost all-white plumage with a black mask and a red bill. The sexes have similar plumage. As referenced in the common name, adults have red {{birdgloss|tail streamers}} that are about twice their body length. Four subspecies are recognised, but there is evidence of [[Cline (biology)|clinal]] variation in body size\u2014with smaller birds in the north and larger in the south\u2014and hence no grounds for subspecies.\n\nThe red-tailed tropicbird eats fish\u2014mainly [[flying fish]] and squid\u2014after catching them by plunge-diving into the ocean. [[Nesting instinct|Nesting]] takes place in loose [[bird colony|colonies]] on oceanic islands; the nest itself is a [[Bird nest#Scrape|scrape]] found on a cliff face, in a crevice, or on a sandy beach. A single egg is laid, then is incubated by both sexes for about six weeks. The parents make long food-foraging trips of about 150 hours during incubation, but once the chick has hatched, the parents specialize their foraging: one forages for the chick for a few hours at a time, while the other makes much longer trips to feed themselves.\n\nThis bird is considered to be a [[least-concern species]] according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), though it is adversely affected by human contact. Rats and feral cats prey on eggs and young at nesting sites. The bird's tail streamers were once prized by some [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] and [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] peoples.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe British naturalist [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] encountered the red-tailed tropicbird on the Pacific Ocean in March 1769 on [[First voyage of James Cook|James Cook's first voyage]], noting that it was a different species to the familiar [[red-billed tropicbird]].

Its informal name in Puerto Rico arises from the [[feast day]] of [[Saint Roch]], or San Roque in Spanish, which coincided with the hurricane's landfall on that island.{{#tag:ref|The Puerto Rican tradition of referring to intense hurricanes by the names of Catholic saints being commemorated on the corresponding [[feast day]]s was among the earliest informal [[tropical cyclone naming]] systems, and lasted for centuries prior to the introduction of standardized naming conventions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone Naming History and Retired Names|agency=[[National Hurricane Center]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=April 9, 2020|url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames_history.shtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Yanez, Anthony|date=September 7, 2017|title=From Adrian to Zelda: A History of Hurricane Names|newspaper=[[KNBC|NBC4 Southern California]]|url=https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/how-hurricanes-get-their-names-storms-weather/23317/|accessdate=April 9, 2020}}</ref> This was the third storm bearing the local name \"San Roque\".<ref name=\"meta\"/> See also: [[Calendar of saints#Connection to tropical cyclones|Calendar of saints \u00a7 Connection to tropical cyclones]].|group=\"nb\"}} In Nova Scotia, the storm was called the \"Second Great August Gale\". For a short time on August 22, it was one of four simultaneously active hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and at 00:00 [[UTC]] on August 17, it struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the island from southeast to northwest, spending seven hours over the island. This was the first tropical cyclone event in Puerto Rico in which [[History of Atlantic hurricane warnings|warning flags]] were used for communicating the level of danger to the public. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. A large number of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. Around the capital city of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], many trees and fences were blown down, and two hospitals were unroofed. In addition to the deleterious winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. Four people were killed in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward and accelerate. Although its center remained far away from the [[United States]], heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on August 20 and 21. Eastern [[New England]] experienced conditions equivalent to a particularly intense [[nor'easter]], with winds as high as {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded on [[Block Island]]. Across [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], grain crops were flattened and and orchards were stripped of their fruit. The esteemed racing yacht [[Volunteer (yacht)|''Volunteer'']] was badly damaged after crashing upon the rocky shoreline. After passing about {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Nantucket]], the now-rapidly moving system weakened and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]], and at 00:00 UTC on August 22, made landfall in Nova Scotia at [[St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia|St. Margarets Bay]]. Damage to utility wires in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] cut power and communications services, and a child was electrocuted to death by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout [[Atlantic Canada]], as well as the [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]] of [[Quebec]], becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"wreck\"/> The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the [[steamer]] ''Dorcas'' and its barge, ''Etta Stewart'', which were caught in the gale while underway east of Halifax. The two ships drifted toward shore late at night on August 21, and struck a rocky [[shoal]] near the entrance to [[Three Fathom Harbour, Nova Scotia|Three Fathom Harbour]]. ''Dorcas'' capsized and was driven ashore, while ''Etta Stewart'' broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed. Two more people died when their boat sank on [[Trinity Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Trinity Bay]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], for a storm total of 31 fatalities. \n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|1893 Atlantic hurricane 3 track.png}}\nBecause of scarce meteorological observations, little is known about Hurricane San Roque's early history.

For a short time on August 22, it was one of four simultaneously active hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean. The system was first observed on August 13 at low latitudes east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. It grew to be a powerful, slow-moving hurricane in the [[Caribbean Sea]], and at 00:00 [[UTC]] on August 17, it struck Puerto Rico at the equivalence of Category 3 on the modern-day [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the island from southeast to northwest, spending seven hours over the island. This was the first tropical cyclone event in Puerto Rico in which [[History of Atlantic hurricane warnings|warning flags]] were used for communicating the level of danger to the public. A prolonged period of strong winds caused widespread destruction on the island, most notably along the northern coast. A large number of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, with flimsy shacks belonging to poor workers faring the worst; many families were left homeless. Telegraph communications were severed across the island. Around the capital city of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], many trees and fences were blown down, and two hospitals were unroofed. In addition to the deleterious winds, several days of heavy rainfall in interior sectors triggered extensive river flooding. The combined effects of rain and wind destroyed fields of crops, most notably coffee and sugar cane. Four people were killed in Puerto Rico.\n\nOn August 19, the hurricane began to turn northeastward and accelerate. Although its center remained far away from the [[United States]], heavy rainfall and gale-force winds overspread the country's [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] on August 20 and 21. Eastern [[New England]] experienced conditions equivalent to a particularly intense [[nor'easter]], with winds as high as {{convert|72|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded on [[Block Island]]. Across [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]], grain crops were flattened and and orchards were stripped of their fruit. The esteemed racing yacht [[Volunteer (yacht)|''Volunteer'']] was badly damaged after crashing upon the rocky shoreline. After passing about {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Nantucket]], the now-rapidly moving system weakened and transitioned into an [[extratropical cyclone]], and at 00:00 UTC on August 22, made landfall in Nova Scotia at [[St. Margarets Bay]]. Damage to utility wires in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] cut power and communications services, and a child was electrocuted to death by a downed power line. The storm wrought havoc on ships and boats throughout [[Atlantic Canada]], as well as the [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]] of [[Quebec]], becoming \"one of the most notorious marine storms in the history of Nova Scotia\".<ref name=\"wreck\"/> The greatest maritime tragedy was the wreck of the [[steamer]] ''Dorcas'' and its barge, ''Etta Stewart'', which were caught in the gale while underway east of Halifax. The two ships drifted toward shore late at night on August 21, and struck a rocky [[shoal]] near the entrance to [[Three Fathom Harbour, Nova Scotia|Three Fathom Harbour]]. ''Dorcas'' capsized and was driven ashore, while ''Etta Stewart'' broke up in the pounding surf. All crew members and passengers on the two vessels, totaling 24 people, were killed.

The average elevation of the city is about 200 meters above sea level. The city is 400 to 500 meters above sea level in some areas.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nRunning through Motomiya, the [[Abukuma River]] divides the city in two. On the former Motomiya Town side, bordered by the [[\u014cu Mountains]] (including [[Mount Adatara]]) in the west, and the Abukuma River in the east, flat plains run north to south extending into the K\u014driyama Basin. The mountains to the north in \u014ctama Village and K\u014driyama serve as the sources for several rivers and streams including the Hyakunichi River (\u767e\u65e5\u5ddd), Adatara River (\u5b89\u9054\u592a\u826f\u5ddd), Seto River (\u702c\u6238\u5ddd), and Gohyaku River (\u4e94\u767e\u5ddd). The Hyakunichi River and Adatara River share the same source but diverge downstream. The former Shirasawa Village is surrounded by gentle rolling hills.\n\n==Climate==\nMotomiya has a [[Humid subtropical climate|humid continental climate]] (K\u00f6ppen ''Cfa'') characterized by mild summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Motomiya is 12.1&nbsp;\u00b0C. The average annual rainfall is 1212&nbsp;mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.1&nbsp;\u00b0C, and lowest in January, at around 0.3&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>[https://en.climate-data.org/location/5391/ Motomiya climate data]</ref>\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\n*Fukushima Prefecture\n**[[K\u014driyama]]\n**[[Nihonmatsu, Fukushima|Nihonmatsu]]\n**[[\u014ctama, Fukushima|\u014ctama]]\n**[[Miharu, Fukushima|Miharu]]\n\n===Population===\nAccording to 2005 census data, Motomiya lost population for the first time in 25 years, falling to 31,367 residents.

The oldest known record refers to the area of Motomiya as \"Honmoku\" (\u672c\u7267). Later in the [[Nara period]], the characters for Honmoku were rewritten as (\u672c\u76ee), also pronounceable as Motome. Motome was then rewritten as (\u6728\u76ee). Then in the 11th century, it became the current Motomiya (\u672c\u5bae). The origins of the name Motomiya, literally meaning \"Central Shrine,\" refer to the Adatara Jinja (\u5b89\u9054\u592a\u826f\u795e\u793e), a [[Shinto shrine]] in the city's northern district.\n\nAs a starting point for roads to [[Aizu]], [[Miharu, Fukushima|Miharu]], S\u014dma, and many other destinations, Motomiya became well known as an [[shukuba|inn town]]. In addition, with the growth of lesser roads to Aizu, Adachi no Umaya (\u5b89\u9054\u99c5), a government-maintained rest stop and messenger station, was established in Motomiya. Currently, the stone marker indicating the start of the Aizu road is preserved at the Motomiya City Historical Folk Museum. [[Date Masamune]] (\u4f0a\u9054\u653f\u5b97) used Motomiya as a base during the Battle of Hitotoribashi (\u4eba\u53d6\u6a4b\u306e\u6226\u3044). Afterwards during the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Motomiya was part of the holding of [[Nihonmatsu Domain]]. During the [[Boshin War]] a number of battles were fought within the city limits.\n\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area was organized as part of [[Adachi District, Fukushima|Adachi District]] in the [[Nakad\u014dri]] region of [[Iwaki Province (1868)|Iwaki Province]]. The town of Motomiya was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. During the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] and [[Taish\u014d period]], the Motomiya Electric Corporation was established and constructed a power plant in present Otama Village's Tamanoi district which provided electricity to the area. From this point many famous industries were born in the area. During the [[Showa era]], [[Gunze]], a Japanese textiles company, opened a factory and began operations in Motomiya. During [[World War II]], Allied bombers attacked Motomiya, because the Gunze factories manufactured cloth used to cover the wings of [ [[Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters.\n\nAfter the war, Japan entered a time of rapid economic growth, and industrial parks were zoned and constructed in Motomiya, Arai, Nukazawa, and Shiraiwa districts. Soon after, Asahi Beer was enticed to construct a brewery in the city limits.\n\nIn the 1980s, mid-size housing developments such as the Northern K\u014driyama New Town and Hikari ga Oka developments were begun as an influx of workers to [[Koriyama, Fukushima|K\u014driyama]] and [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] created a demand for [[Commuter town|bedroom communities]]. The city of Motomiya was established on January 1, 2007, by the merger of the former town of Motomiya absorbing the village of [[Shirasawa, Fukushima|Shirasawa]] (both from [[Adachi District, Fukushima|Adachi District]]).\n\n===Municipal timeline===\n* 1871 - Motomiya Village (\u672c\u5bae\u6751), Aota Village (\u9752\u7530\u6751), Arai Village (\u8352\u4e95\u6751), Niita Village(\u4ec1\u4e95\u7530\u6751), Inashirota Village (\u82d7\u4ee3\u7530\u6751), Haneseishi Village(\u7fbd\u702c\u77f3\u6751), Sagehi Village (\u4e0b\u6a0b\u6751), Sekishita Village (\u95a2\u4e0b\u6751), Takagi Village (\u9ad8\u6728\u6751), Wada Village (\u548c\u7530\u6751), Nukazawa Village (\u7ce0\u6ca2\u6751), Shiraiwa Village (\u767d\u5ca9\u6751), Nagaya Village (\u9577\u5c4b\u6751), Inazawa Village (\u7a32\u6ca2\u6751), Matsuzawa Village (\u677e\u6ca2\u6751) were formed.\n* April 1, 1889 - Motomiya Town, Aota Village, Arai Village, Niita Village, Iwane Village (\u5ca9\u6839\u6751, formed from Inashirota, Haneseishi, Sagehi Villages and later Sekishita Village), Wagisawa Village (\u548c\u6728\u6ca2\u6751, formed from Wada, Takagi and Nukazawa Village), and Shiraiwa Village (\u767d\u5ca9\u6751, formed from Shiraiwa, Nagaya, Inazawa, and Matsuzawa Villages) were formed.\n* April 1, 1954 - Motomiya annexed Aota, Arai, Niita Villages \n* April 30, 1955 - Wagisawa Village was dissolved with Takagi District being added to Motomiya Town, and Wada and Nukazawa Districts being added to Shiraiwa Village.\n* March 31, 1956 - Motomiya absorbed Iwane Village.\n* January 1, 2007 - Motomiya absorbed the village of [[Shirasawa, Fukushima|Shirasawa]] (also from [[Adachi District, Fukushima|Adachi District]]) to create the city of Motomiya.\n\n=== City districts ===\n* Motomiya, \u672c\u5bae\nThis is the original Motomiya area, and includes the city hall and government offices Portions of the former agricultural northern area have been converted to industrial and residential use.\n* Aota, \u9752\u7530\nThis district is a typical farming area. While the eastern half is undergoing rapid development thanks to its proximity to National Route 4, the western half remains largely agricultural.\n* Arai, \u8352\u4e95\nThis district has well-developed retail and industrial areas. Many large shopping centers and factories are located in this area.\n* Niita, \u4ec1\u4e95\u7530\nThis is a geographically narrow district. Because of its shape, homes and businesses line the roads giving it an appearance reminiscent of the Showa era.\n* Iwane, \u5ca9\u6839\nThe northern part of this district is mountainous, while the southern part is farmland. The origin of the district's name comes from the large instances of peculiarly shaped rocks. Even now, specimens can still be seen. A rise in the district's population can be attributed to the Mizuki ga Oka housing development.\n* Sekishita, \u95a2\u4e0b\nThis district is a farming area following the Abukuma River with large belts of worked arable land.\n* Takagi, \u9ad8\u6728\nThis is the downtown district. Like Niita District, homes and shops line the road as in the Showa era. Constructed above in the hills, Kita Koriyama New Town has contributed to a population increase in this district.\n* Shiraiwa, \u767d\u5ca9\nThis was the nucleus of the former Shirasawa Village, and still contains the Shirasawa gymnasium, Yume Library, Village Sports Grounds, Community Center, Culture Center and many other civic buildings. Nestled in the hills, farmers have taken to growing rice and crops in small fields between the slopes.\n* Nukazawa, \u7ce0\u6ca2\nA quiet farming area on the western part of former Shirasawa Village, the opening of Hikari ga Oka housing development makes this district one of the most populous in the former Shirasawa Village.\n* Wada, \u548c\u7530\nThis district is a farming area on the northern part of former Shirasawa Village.

However, predating rail links, roads leading to towns all over Fukushima including Aizu City, Soma City, and Miharu City converged here, making Motomiya a hub for transportation. Even though it had only gravel roads, the transportation industry quickly grew, and with it, the bus and taxi services as well. Since these times, much of the traffic has been diverted to nearby Koriyama and Nihonmatsu. But even now, roads to Aizu from National Route 4 (Prefectural Route 8, Motomiya-Atami line), and roads to the Tosaki(\u6238\u5d0e) traffic circle such as Prefectural Route 118 from Obama (\u5c0f\u6d5c) (Nihonmatsu) and Route 146 from Ishimushiro(\u77f3\u7b75) (K\u014driyama) converge in Motomiya, still making it an important hub for transportation and large numbers of freight trucks still pass through. The [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] passes through Motomiya, but there is no station.\n\n===Railway===\n*[[File:JR logo (east).svg|22px]][[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]] -  [[T\u014dhoku Main Line]]\n** {{STN|Motomiya}} \u2013 {{STN|Gohyakugawa}}\n\n===Buses===\n*Fukushima Public Transportation\n*Motomiya City Bus\n\n===Highway===\n*[[File:E4 Expressway (Japan).jpg|20px|link=|alt=]] [[Tohoku Expressway]], Motomiya Interchange\n* {{jct|country=JPN|Route|4}}\n\n====Prefectural routes====\n*Fukushima Prefectural Route 8 (Motomiya to Atami)\n*Fukushima Prefectural Route 28 (Motomiya to Miharu)\n*Fukushima Prefectural Route 30 (Motomiya to Tsuchiyu)\n*Fukushima Prefectural Route 73 (Nihonmatsu to Kaneya)\n*Fukushima Prefectural Route 40 (Iino to Miharu to Ishikawa)\n\n==Notable people from Motomiya==\n*[[Tomohisa Nemoto]], professional baseball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Motomiya, Fukushima}}\n* [http://www.city.motomiya.lg.jp/ Official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{Fukushima}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Fukushima Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Motomiya, Fukushima]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2015}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                    = {{raise|0.2em|Motomiya}}\n| native_name             = {{lower|0.1em|{{nobold|{{lang|ja|\u672c\u5bae\u5e02}}}}}}\n| official_name           = \n| native_name_lang        = ja\n| settlement_type         = [[Cities of Japan|City]]\n<!-- images, nickname, motto -->\n| image_skyline           = Motomiya town-office.jpg\n| imagesize               = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = Motomiya City Hall\n| image_flag              = Flag of Motomiya, Fukushima.svg\n| flag_alt                = \n| image_seal              = Symbol of Motomiya Fukushima.svg\n| seal_alt                = \n| image_shield            = \n| shield_alt              = \n| image_blank_emblem      = \n| nickname                = \n| motto                   = \n<!-- maps and coordinates -->\n| image_map               = Motomiya in Fukushima Prefecture Ja.svg\n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = Location of Motomiya in Fukushima Prefecture\n| pushpin_map             = Japan\n| pushpin_label_position  = <!-- position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = &nbsp; \n| coordinates             = {{coord|37|30|47.5|N|140|23|37.8|E|region:JP|display=inline,title}}\n| coor_pinpoint           = <!-- to specify exact location of coordinates (was coor_type) -->\n| coordinates_footnotes   = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n<!-- location -->\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = Japan\n| subdivision_type1       = [[List of regions of Japan|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[T\u014dhoku region|T\u014dhoku]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[Prefectures of Japan|Prefecture]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]]\n| subdivision_type3       = \n| subdivision_name3       = \n<!-- established -->\n| established_title       = <!-- Settled -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n<!-- seat, smaller parts -->\n| seat_type               = <!-- defaults to: Seat -->\n| seat                    = \n<!-- government type, leaders -->\n| government_footnotes    = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| leader_party            = \n| leader_title            = Mayor\n| leader_name             = Gigyo Takamatsu\n| leader_title1           = \n| leader_name1            = <!-- etc., up to leader_title4 / leader_name4 -->\n<!-- display settings  -->\n| total_type              = <!-- to set a non-standard label for total area and population rows -->\n| unit_pref               = <!-- enter: Imperial, to display imperial before metric -->\n<!-- area -->\n| area_magnitude          = <!-- use only to set a special wikilink -->\n| area_footnotes          = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| area_total_km2          = 88.02\n| area_land_km2           = \n| area_water_km2          = \n| area_water_percent      = \n| area_note               = \n<!-- elevation -->\n| elevation_footnotes     = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| elevation_m             = \n<!-- population -->\n| population_footnotes    = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| population_total        = 30629\n| population_as_of        = April 1, 2018\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_est          = \n| pop_est_as_of           = \n| population_demonym      = <!-- demonym, ie.

The average elevation of the city is about 200 meters above sea level. The city is 400 to 500 meters above sea level in some areas.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nRunning through Motomiya, the [[Abukuma River]] divides the city in two. On the former Motomiya Town side, bordered by the [[\u014cu Mountains]] (including [[Mount Adatara]]) in the west, and the Abukuma River in the east, flat plains run north to south extending into the K\u014driyama Basin. The mountains to the north in \u014ctama Village and K\u014driyama serve as the sources for several rivers and streams including the Hyakunichi River (\u767e\u65e5\u5ddd), Adatara River (\u5b89\u9054\u592a\u826f\u5ddd), Seto River (\u702c\u6238\u5ddd), and Gohyaku River (\u4e94\u767e\u5ddd). The Hyakunichi River and Adatara River share the same source but diverge downstream. The former Shirasawa Village is surrounded by gentle rolling hills.\n\nMotomiya has a [[Humid subtropical climate|humid continental climate]] (K\u00f6ppen ''Cfa'') characterized by mild summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Motomiya is 12.1&nbsp;\u00b0C. The average annual rainfall is 1212&nbsp;mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.1&nbsp;\u00b0C, and lowest in January, at around 0.3&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>[https://en.climate-data.org/location/5391/ Motomiya climate data]</ref>\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\n*Fukushima Prefecture\n**[[K\u014driyama]]\n**[[Nihonmatsu, Fukushima|Nihonmatsu]]\n**[[\u014ctama, Fukushima|\u014ctama]]\n**[[Miharu, Fukushima|Miharu]]\n\n===Population===\nAccording to 2005 census data, Motomiya lost population for the first time in 25 years, falling to 31,367 residents.

The oldest known record refers to the area of Motomiya as \"Honmoku\" (\u672c\u7267). Later in the [[Nara period]], the characters for Honmoku were rewritten as (\u672c\u76ee), also pronounceable as Motome. Motome was then rewritten as (\u6728\u76ee). Then in the 11th century, it became the current Motomiya (\u672c\u5bae). The origins of the name Motomiya, literally meaning \"Central Shrine,\" refer to the Adatara Jinja (\u5b89\u9054\u592a\u826f\u795e\u793e), a [[Shinto shrine]] in the city's northern district.\n\nAs a starting point for roads to [[Aizu]], [[Miharu, Fukushima|Miharu]], S\u014dma, and many other destinations, Motomiya became well known as an [[shukuba|inn town]]. In addition, with the growth of lesser roads to Aizu, Adachi no Umaya (\u5b89\u9054\u99c5), a government-maintained rest stop and messenger station, was established in Motomiya. Currently, the stone marker indicating the start of the Aizu road is preserved at the Motomiya City Historical Folk Museum. [[Date Masamune]] (\u4f0a\u9054\u653f\u5b97) used Motomiya as a base during the Battle of Hitotoribashi (\u4eba\u53d6\u6a4b\u306e\u6226\u3044). Afterwards during the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]], Motomiya was part of the holding of [[Nihonmatsu Domain]]. During the [[Boshin War]] a number of battles were fought within the city limits.\n\nAfter the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area was organized as part of [[Adachi District, Fukushima|Adachi District]] in the [[Nakad\u014dri]] region of [[Iwaki Province (1868)|Iwaki Province]]. The town of Motomiya was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. During the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] and [[Taish\u014d period]], the Motomiya Electric Corporation was established and constructed a power plant in present Otama Village's Tamanoi district which provided electricity to the area. From this point many famous industries were born in the area. During the [[Showa era]], [[Gunze]], a Japanese textiles company, opened a factory and began operations in Motomiya. During [[World War II]], Allied bombers attacked Motomiya, because the Gunze factories manufactured cloth used to cover the wings of [ [[Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters.\n\nAfter the war, Japan entered a time of rapid economic growth, and industrial parks were zoned and constructed in Motomiya, Arai, Nukazawa, and Shiraiwa districts. Soon after, Asahi Beer was enticed to construct a brewery in the city limits.\n\nIn the 1980s, mid-size housing developments such as the Northern K\u014driyama New Town and Hikari ga Oka developments were begun as an influx of workers to [[Koriyama, Fukushima|K\u014driyama]] and [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] created a demand for [[Commuter town|bedroom communities]].\n\nOn January 1, 2007 Motomiya Town and neighbouring Shirasawa Village (also from Adachi District) merged, forming the city of Motomiy.\n\n===Municipal timeline===\n* 1871 - Motomiya Village (\u672c\u5bae\u6751), Aota Village (\u9752\u7530\u6751), Arai Village (\u8352\u4e95\u6751), Niita Village(\u4ec1\u4e95\u7530\u6751), Inashirota Village (\u82d7\u4ee3\u7530\u6751), Haneseishi Village(\u7fbd\u702c\u77f3\u6751), Sagehi Village (\u4e0b\u6a0b\u6751), Sekishita Village (\u95a2\u4e0b\u6751), Takagi Village (\u9ad8\u6728\u6751), Wada Village (\u548c\u7530\u6751), Nukazawa Village (\u7ce0\u6ca2\u6751), Shiraiwa Village (\u767d\u5ca9\u6751), Nagaya Village (\u9577\u5c4b\u6751), Inazawa Village (\u7a32\u6ca2\u6751), Matsuzawa Village (\u677e\u6ca2\u6751) were formed.\n* April 1, 1889 - Motomiya Town, Aota Village, Arai Village, Niita Village, Iwane Village (\u5ca9\u6839\u6751, formed from Inashirota, Haneseishi, Sagehi Villages and later Sekishita Village), Wagisawa Village (\u548c\u6728\u6ca2\u6751, formed from Wada, Takagi and Nukazawa Village), and Shiraiwa Village (\u767d\u5ca9\u6751, formed from Shiraiwa, Nagaya, Inazawa, and Matsuzawa Villages) were formed.\n* April 1, 1954 - Motomiya annexed Aota, Arai, Niita Villages \n* April 30, 1955 - Wagisawa Village was dissolved with Takagi District being added to Motomiya Town, and Wada and Nukazawa Districts being added to Shiraiwa Village.\n* March 31, 1956 - Motomiya absorbed Iwane Village.\n* January 1, 2007 - Motomiya absorbed the village of [[Shirasawa, Fukushima|Shirasawa]] (also from [[Adachi District, Fukushima|Adachi District]]) to create the city of Motomiya.\n\n=== City districts ===\n* Motomiya, \u672c\u5bae\nThis is the original Motomiya area, and includes the city hall and government offices Portions of the former agricultural northern area have been converted to industrial and residential use.\n* Aota, \u9752\u7530\nThis district is a typical farming area. While the eastern half is undergoing rapid development thanks to its proximity to National Route 4, the western half remains largely agricultural.\n* Arai, \u8352\u4e95\nThis district has well-developed retail and industrial areas. Many large shopping centers and factories are located in this area.\n* Niita, \u4ec1\u4e95\u7530\nThis is a geographically narrow district. Because of its shape, homes and businesses line the roads giving it an appearance reminiscent of the Showa era.\n* Iwane, \u5ca9\u6839\nThe northern part of this district is mountainous, while the southern part is farmland. The origin of the district's name comes from the large instances of peculiarly shaped rocks. Even now, specimens can still be seen. A rise in the district's population can be attributed to the Mizuki ga Oka housing development.\n* Sekishita, \u95a2\u4e0b\nThis district is a farming area following the Abukuma River with large belts of worked arable land.\n* Takagi, \u9ad8\u6728\nThis is the downtown district. Like Niita District, homes and shops line the road as in the Showa era. Constructed above in the hills, Kita Koriyama New Town has contributed to a population increase in this district.\n* Shiraiwa, \u767d\u5ca9\nThis was the nucleus of the former Shirasawa Village, and still contains the Shirasawa gymnasium, Yume Library, Village Sports Grounds, Community Center, Culture Center and many other civic buildings. Nestled in the hills, farmers have taken to growing rice and crops in small fields between the slopes.\n* Nukazawa, \u7ce0\u6ca2\nA quiet farming area on the western part of former Shirasawa Village, the opening of Hikari ga Oka housing development makes this district one of the most populous in the former Shirasawa Village.\n* Wada, \u548c\u7530\nThis district is a farming area on the northern part of former Shirasawa Village. It is home to the Wanda Spring.\n* Inazawa, \u7a32\u6ca2\nHaving won prizes for demonstrating \"what a farming village should be,\" this district is the very paradigm of a Japanese farming community.\n* Nagaya, \u9577\u5c4b\nThis district is another mountainous farming district with farming practices similar to Shiraiwa.\n* Matsuzawa, \u677e\u6ca2\n\n==Government==\nMotomiya has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 20 members.\n\n===Motomiya City civic centers===\n* Motomiya City Hall, \u672c\u5bae\u5e02\u5f79\u6240\uff08Formerly Motomiya Town Offices, \u672c\u5bae\u753a\u5f79\u5834\uff09\n* Shirasawa Consolidated District Offices, \u767d\u6ca2\u7dcf\u5408\u652f\u6240\uff08Formerly Shirasawa Village Offices, \u767d\u6ca2\u6751\u5f79\u5834\uff09\n** Iwane District Offices, \u5ca9\u6839\u652f\u6240\n** Shiraiwa District Offices, \u767d\u5ca9\u652f\u6240\n*Discussions regarding the relocation of the Shirasawa Consolidated District Offices from Nukazawa district to Shiraiwa district have been completed, and the move will be begun soon.\n\n===Police department===\n* Motomiya Police Station (currently slated to be abolished due to budget cuts with duties being divided between Nihonmatsu and Northern K\u014driyama Police Stations)\n** Iwane Police Home/Offices, \u5ca9\u6839\u99d0\u5728\u6240\n** Shiraiwa Police Home/Offices, \u767d\u5ca9\u99d0\u5728\u6240\n** Shirasawa Police Home/Offices, \u767d\u6ca2\u99d0\u5728\u6240\n\n===Post office branches===\n* Motomiya Branch\n* Motomiya Northern Branch\n* Iwane Branch\n* Arai Japan Post Insurance Branch\n* Shirasawa Branch\n\n===Fire department===\n*Adachi Administrative District Combined Southern Fire Station\n\n==Industry==\n===Agriculture===\nIn 2002, rice paddies produced superior quality rice (Koshi hikari type) worth 1.6 billion yen.\n\nThe former Wagisawa Village was a pure farming village. Even at present, agriculture is very active. The former Motomiya Town still is heavily invested in the cultivation of rice, fruits and produce and poultry. In the former Shirasawa Village, sericulture is still active. Of these, the sericulture industry's equipment has been designated as National (treasures???)

However, predating rail links, roads leading to towns all over Fukushima including Aizu City, Soma City, and Miharu City converged here, making Motomiya a hub for transportation. Even though it had only gravel roads, the transportation industry quickly grew, and with it, the bus and taxi services as well. Since these times, much of the traffic has been diverted to nearby Koriyama and Nihonmatsu. But even now, roads to Aizu from National Route 4 (Prefectural Route 8, Motomiya-Atami line), and roads to the Tosaki(\u6238\u5d0e) traffic circle such as Prefectural Route 118 from Obama (\u5c0f\u6d5c) (Nihonmatsu) and Route 146 from Ishimushiro(\u77f3\u7b75) (K\u014driyama) converge in Motomiya, still making it an important hub for transportation and large numbers of freight trucks still pass through.

He was thus brought up by his father, by this stage playing for [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] at the end of his career. At one point the thought of the [[priesthood]] was a possibility for Tommy. However, that was not to be and he joined [[Amateur football|amateur]] side [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] as a young man and played for them throughout World War II.

Together with Cowie and Boyd in Dundee's half-back line, Gallacher and Dundee missed out on the [[Scottish League Championship|League Championship]] on the last day of the [[1948\u201349 in Scottish football|1948/49 season]] to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\nA few years later though, the same Dundee team won the [[Scottish League Cup]] in [[1951\u201352 Scottish League Cup|1951]] and in [[1952\u201353 Scottish League Cup|1952]].

It is a sequel to 2011's ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' and was released in October 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]; then later in November for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Battlefield 4'' was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign mode, and for its numerous [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|title=Battlefield 4 sells 7+ million, only 2% are still playing|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331205158/http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game's [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.\n\nWeapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can \"spot\" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting.\n\n===Campaign===\nThe single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, [[#Setting and characters|Recker]], the player can use two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\nThe campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible [[dog tag]]s which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\n===Multiplayer===\n[[File:Battlefield 4 - MP - Commander Mode.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The new Commander Mode interface in ''Battlefield 4'', showing an overhead view of the map \"Siege of Shanghai\"]]\n''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s multiplayer contains three playable factions\u2014the United States, China, and Russia\u2014fighting against each other, in up to 64-player matches on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (24-Player on Xbox 360 and PS3). A newly reintroduced \"Commander Mode\", last seen in ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'', gives one player on each team a [[real-time strategy]]-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates. Also, the Commander can observe the battle through the eyes of the players on the battlefield, deploying vehicle and weapon drops to \"keep the war machinery going\", and order in missile strikes on hostile targets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |title= Battlefield 4 promo material reveals return of Commander Mode, three playable factions |date= April 15, 2013 |accessdate= May 7, 2013 |first= Wesley |last= Yin-Poole |publisher= Euro Gamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195650/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |archive-date= March 3, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |title=Battlefield 4: Official Commander Mode Trailer |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611235513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A spectator mode is included, enabling players to spectate others in first or third person, as well as use a free camera to pan around the map from any angle.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, at E3, DICE featured the map \"Siege of Shanghai\", pitting the [[People's Liberation Army]] against the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]].

The support kit has access to the new remote mortar and the [[XM25 CDTE|XM25]] allowing for indirect suppressive fire. The Recon kit is now more mobile and is able to equip carbines, [[designated marksman rifle]]s (DMRs), and C4.

With the addition of the Chinese faction, new vehicles include the [[Type 99 tank|Type 99 MBT]], the [[ZFB-05]] armored car, and the [[CAIC Z-10|Z-10W attack helicopter]]. Jets have also been rebalanced and put into two classes, \"attack\" and \"stealth\". The attack jets focus is mainly air-to-ground capabilities, while stealth jets focus mainly on air-to-air combat. Another vehicle added in ''Battlefield 4'' is the addition of the [[CB90|RCB]] and DV-15 Interceptor attack boats, which function as heavily armed aquatic assault craft.\n\nCustomization options have also been increased in ''Battlefield 4'', with all new camos available for every gun. A new \"adaptive\" camo has been introduced that can adapt the camo to the map being played without the player having to change camos every map. Camos can now be applied to jets, helicopters, tanks, transport vehicles and guns. Previously this option was introduced to parachutes but has been removed, emblems are now printed onto parachutes.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Setting and characters===\n''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s single-player Campaign takes place during the fictional \"War of 2020\", six years after the events of its [[Battlefield 3#Plot|predecessor]].

After being trapped underwater while being pursued by Russian special forces, Dunn, critically wounded and trapped, sacrifices himself by ordering the squad to break the windscreen and escape. Reuniting with their commanding officer Captain Garrison, Tombstone learns that Admiral Chang,  head of the Chinese army, has taken control of China with Russian support, and eliminated Chinese presidential candidate Jin Ji\u00e9, a progressive politician seeking reforms within the Chinese government. The group find themselves sent to Shanghai with orders to rescue two VIPs - a woman named Hannah, and her husband - with assistance from an intelligence agent named Kovic.\n\nAlthough the rescue is a success and Kovic takes the VIPs back to the USS ''Valkyrie'', a [[Wasp-class amphibious assault ship]], Tombstone become trapped in the city, and forced to rescue civilians against Pac's protests. Shortly after returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Garrision assigns Kovic as head of the squad, and sends them to the USS ''Titan'', a [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier]] that had just been attacked, to recover its [[voyage data recorder]] before the wreckage sinks. Upon returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Tombstone find the ship under assault by [[People's Liberation Army Navy Marine Corps|Chinese Marines]]. While the squad rescue Garrison, and the VIPs, Kovic is fatally wounded and passes control of the squad to Recker. Learning that China's air force is grounded due to a storm, Garrison assigns Tombstone to lend assistance to US forces planning to assault the Chinese-controlled [[Singapore]] airfield so that Chinese air superiority is weakened. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone on their mission, much to Irish's chagrin.\n\nDespite the airfield being destroyed by a missile strike, Pac is separated from Tombstone during evacuation and assumed killed in the blast. Hannah then betrays Recker and Irish, allowing both to be captured by Chinese soldiers. Both men find themselves taken to a prison in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] for interrogation under Chang's orders. In his cell, Recker finds himself befriended by a Russian prisoner named [[Battlefield 3|\"Dima\"]] - a survivor of the Paris nuclear blast, now suffering from [[radiation poisoning]]. The pair escape from their cell, start a mass prison riot, and use the chaos to make their escape, with Recker rescuing Irish along the way. As Chinese military arrive to quell the riot, Hannah prevents the group from being recaptured by a group of soldiers. Although Irish mistrusts her, Hannah reveals her action was necessary for her mission, revealing her husband is in reality Jin Ji\u00e9, who survived Chang's assassination attempt.\n\nThe group makes use of a tram to get out of the mountains, only for it to be shot down by an enemy helicopter, killing Dima in the crash. Forced to make their way down on foot, hunting for food to survive, the group eventually find a jeep and drive towards the US-occupied city of Tashgar. During the journey, Hannah reveals how she lost her family to Chang's men after bringing Jin Ji\u00e9 to meet them, causing Irish to make amends with her for his behavior. Upon reaching Tashgar, the squad find US troops being besieged by both Chinese and Russian forces, and offer assistance to the US commander by destroying a nearby dam, flooding the area and eliminating the opposing forces. Learning the ''Valkyrie'' is within the region of the [[Suez Canal]], Tombstone are airlifted to the ship, and arrive to warn the vessel that they are blindly heading towards Chang's navy. Assisting in stopping Chinese forces from boarding the ship, the squad soon find Jin Ji\u00e9 amongst other survivors, including Pac (who had survived Singapore).\n\nKnowing he must show his face, as Chinese forces had been fighting under the assumption he was dead, Jin Ji\u00e9 convinces Recker to let him show his face and calm tensions between the three forces. The assault quickly ends with Chinese forces beginning to spread the news of Jin Ji\u00e9's return. Chang, desiring to prevent this and conceal the truth, proceeds to barrage the ''Valkyrie'' with his personal warship. Recker, Irish and Hannah volunteer to board the warship and use explosives to destroy it. However, when the remote detonation fails, Hannah and Irish each volunteer to manually replacing the charges. If the player chooses not to do anything, Chang obliterates the ''Valkyrie'', thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Ji\u00e9; if they send one of the two, the volunteer goes back to set the explosives, and is killed in the blast along with Chang, while the survivor and Recker are recovered by the ''Valkyrie''. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with no regrets.\n\n==Development==\nElectronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to ''Battlefield 3'' during a keynote at the [[University of Southern California]] where he said \"There is going to be a ''Battlefield 4''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|title=EA president mentions Battlefield 4 during college keynote|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103224032/http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: \"Frank was speaking broadly about the ''Battlefield'' brand&mdash;a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to.\" On the eve of ''Battlefield 3''{{'}}s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make ''Battlefield 4''. \"This feels like day one now,\" executive producer Patrick Bach said. \"It's exciting.

Will there be the same Levolution (falling building) or different Levolution in other maps?\"'''<br />Yes, Levolution occurs on every map. Some things are massive like reducing a skyscraper to rubble or flooding an entire level in real-time. Others are small but hugely impact the game like shooting fire extinguishers to distract enemies or cutting the power of a building to blind opponents.<br />If you haven\u2019t seen the Paracel Storm map we unveiled at Gamescom we encourage you to do so. There you can see how players have the option of taking down a turbine weakened by lightning in order to free the damaged destroyer stuck on it. If you manage to set the destroyer adrift, it will crash onto the island, changing the layout of the map and allowing your team to take control of the anti-air weaponry on the ship.<br />These moments are all triggered by the players \u2013 they aren\u2019t just timed moments that will happen no matter what you do in the match. You and your teammates will have to decide if it would be a better tactical decision to radically change the map, or if it would be wiser and better for your play-style if you stopped the other team from triggering these events.|access-date=September 16,

It is a sequel to 2011's ''[[Battlefield 3]]'' and was released in October 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]]; then later in November for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n\n''Battlefield 4'' was met with positive reception. It was praised for its multiplayer mode, gameplay and graphics, but was also criticized for its short and shallow [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign mode, and for its numerous [[Software bug|bugs]] and [[glitch]]es. It was a commercial success, selling over 7 million copies.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|title=Battlefield 4 sells 7+ million, only 2% are still playing|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331205158/http://www.bfcentral.net/bf4/2014/05/battlefield-4-sells-7-million-2-still-playing/|archive-date=March 31, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game's [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] (HUD) is composed of two compact rectangles. The lower left-hand corner features a mini-map and compass for navigation, and a simplified objective notice above it; the lower right includes a compact ammo counter and health meter. The top right displays kill notifications of all players in-game. On the Windows version of the game, the top left features a chat window when in multiplayer. The mini-map, as well as the main game screen, shows symbols denoting three kinds of entities: blue for allies, green for squadmates, and orange for enemies, this applies to all interactivity on the battlefield. Battlefield 4 options also allow colour-blind players to change the on-screen colour indicators to: tritanomaly, deuteranomaly and protanomaly.\n\nWeapon customisation is expansive and encouraged. Primary, secondary and melee weapons can all be customised with weapon attachments and camouflage 'skins'. Most weapons also have a default setting for different firing modes (e.g. semi-automatic, automatic fire), allowing the player to adapt to the environment they find themselves in. They can \"spot\" targets (marking their positions to the player's team) in the single-player campaign (a first in the Battlefield franchise) as well as in multiplayer. The game's bullet-dropping-system has been significantly enhanced, forcing the player to change the way they play medium to long distance combat. In addition, players have more combat capabilities, such as countering melee attacks from the front while standing or crouching, shooting with their sidearm while swimming, and diving underwater to avoid enemy detection. Standard combat abilities are still current including, reloading whilst sprinting, unlimited sprint, prone and vaulting.\n\n===Campaign===\nThe single-player campaign has several differences from the main multiplayer component. For the most part, the player must traverse mini-sandbox-style levels, in some cases using vehicles, like tanks and boats, to traverse the environment. As the player character, [[#Setting and characters|Recker]], the player can use two campaign-only functions: the Engage command and the tactical binocular. The Engage command directs Recker's squadmates, and occasionally other friendly units, to attack any hostiles in Recker's line of sight. The tactical binocular is similar to a laser-designator, in the sense that it allows the player to identify friendly and enemy units, weapon stashes, explosives, and objectives in the field. By identifying enemies, the player can make them visible without using the visor, making them easier to mark for their teammates. At one point, Recker will briefly lose the tactical visor, forcing them to only use the Engage command to direct his squadmates on a limited number of enemies.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\nThe campaign features assignments that require specific actions and unlock weapons for use in multiplayer upon completion. Collectible weapons return along with the introduction of collectible [[dog tag]]s which can be used in multiplayer. Weapon crates are found throughout all levels, allowing players to obtain ammo and switch weapons. While crates hold default weapons, collectible weapons may be used whenever they are acquired and level-specific weapons may be used once a specific mission assignment has been completed by obtaining enough points in a level.<ref name=trailer_gameplay_rev /><ref name=gi_18things />\n\n===Multiplayer===\n[[File:Battlefield 4 - MP - Commander Mode.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The new Commander Mode interface in ''Battlefield 4'', showing an overhead view of the map \"Siege of Shanghai\"]]\n''Battlefield 4''{{'}}s multiplayer contains three playable factions\u2014the United States, China, and Russia\u2014fighting against each other, in up to 64-player matches on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One (24-Player on Xbox 360 and PS3). A newly reintroduced \"Commander Mode\", last seen in ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'', gives one player on each team a [[real-time strategy]]-like view of the entire map and the ability to give orders to teammates. Also, the Commander can observe the battle through the eyes of the players on the battlefield, deploying vehicle and weapon drops to \"keep the war machinery going\", and order in missile strikes on hostile targets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |title= Battlefield 4 promo material reveals return of Commander Mode, three playable factions |date= April 15, 2013 |accessdate= May 7, 2013 |first= Wesley |last= Yin-Poole |publisher= Euro Gamer |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195650/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-battlefield-4-promo-material-reveals-return-of-commander-mode-three-playable-factions |archive-date= March 3, 2016 |url-status= live |df= mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |title=Battlefield 4: Official Commander Mode Trailer |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=June 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611235513/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw |archive-date=June 11, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> A spectator mode is included, enabling players to spectate others in first or third person, as well as use a free camera to pan around the map from any angle.\n\nOn June 10, 2013, at E3, DICE featured the map \"Siege of Shanghai\", pitting the [[People's Liberation Army]] against the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]]. The gameplay showcased Commander Mode; new weapons and vehicles; and the \"Levolution\" gameplay mechanic. The video displays the last of these at various points, including: a player destroying a support pillar to trap an enemy tank above it; and a large skyscraper (with an in-game objective on the top floor) collapsing in the center of the map, kicking up a massive dust cloud throughout the map and bringing the objective closer to ground level.<ref name=bf4_levolution_trailer>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3W4FbsAqIY|title=Battlefield 4: Official Levolution Features Video|publisher=DICE|work=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=August 22, 2013|quote='''Aleksander Gr\u00f8ndal''': Levolution is the next step in player choice, in how you affect the world, and the world affects you back.

The Assault kit must now wait for the defibrillator to recharge after reviving teammates in quick succession. The Engineer kit uses [[Personal defense weapon|PDWs]], and carbines are available to all kits. The support kit has access to the new remote mortar and the [[XM25 CDTE|XM25]] allowing for indirect suppressive fire. The Recon kit is now more mobile and is able to equip carbines, [[designated marksman rifle]]s (DMRs), and C4. Sniping mechanics also give with the ability to zero in your sights (set an aiming distance), and equip more optics and accessories than previous Battlefield games. The Recon kit is still able to utilize the MAV, T-UGS, and the Radio Beacon.<ref name=\"GameSpot-YouTube\" /><ref name=\"EA-YouTube\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7l-eUmhEW8 |title=Battlefield 4 Multiplayer Demo - Siege of Shanghai E3 2013 |publisher=YouTube |date=June 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 22, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061912/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7l-eUmhEW8 |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.battlefield.com/2013/08/road-to-bf4-field-upgrades/|title=The Road to Battlefield 4: Tweaked to the Core|access-date=September 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053817/http://blogs.battlefield.com/2013/08/road-to-bf4-field-upgrades/|archive-date=September 21, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNew vehicles have also been introduced. With the addition of the Chinese faction, new vehicles include the [[Type 99 tank|Type 99 MBT]], the [[ZFB-05]] armored car, and the [[CAIC Z-10|Z-10W attack helicopter]]. Jets have also been rebalanced and put into two classes, \"attack\" and \"stealth\". The attack jets focus is mainly air-to-ground capabilities, while stealth jets focus mainly on air-to-air combat. Another vehicle added in ''Battlefield 4'' is the addition of the [[CB90|RCB]] and DV-15 Interceptor attack boats, which function as heavily armed aquatic assault craft.\n\nCustomization options have also been increased in ''Battlefield 4'', with all new camos available for every gun. A new \"adaptive\" camo has been introduced that can adapt the camo to the map being played without the player having to change camos every map.

After being trapped underwater while being pursued by Russian special forces, Dunn, critically wounded and trapped, sacrifices himself by ordering the squad to break the windscreen and escape. Reuniting with their commanding officer Captain Garrison, Tombstone learns that Admiral Chang,  head of the Chinese army, has taken control of China with Russian support, and eliminated Chinese presidential candidate Jin Ji\u00e9, a progressive politician seeking reforms within the Chinese government. The group find themselves sent to Shanghai with orders to rescue two VIPs - a woman named Hannah, and her husband - with assistance from an intelligence agent named Kovic.\n\nAlthough the rescue is a success and Kovic takes the VIPs back to the USS ''Valkyrie'', a [[Wasp-class amphibious assault ship]], Tombstone become trapped in the city, and forced to rescue civilians against Pac's protests. Shortly after returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Garrision assigns Kovic as head of the squad, and sends them to the USS ''Titan'', a [[Nimitz-class aircraft carrier]] that had just been attacked, to recover its [[voyage data recorder]] before the wreckage sinks. Upon returning to the ''Valkyrie'', Tombstone find the ship under assault by [[People's Liberation Army Navy Marine Corps|Chinese Marines]]. While the squad rescue Garrison, and the VIPs, Kovic is fatally wounded and passes control of the squad to Recker. Learning that China's air force is grounded due to a storm, Garrison assigns Tombstone to lend assistance to US forces planning to assault the Chinese-controlled [[Singapore]] airfield so that Chinese air superiority is weakened. Hannah volunteers to join Tombstone on their mission, much to Irish's chagrin.\n\nDespite the airfield being destroyed by a missile strike, Pac is separated from Tombstone during evacuation and assumed killed in the blast. Hannah then betrays Recker and Irish, allowing both to be captured by Chinese soldiers. Both men find themselves taken to a prison in the [[Kunlun Mountains]] for interrogation under Chang's orders. In his cell, Recker finds himself befriended by a Russian prisoner named [[Battlefield 3|\"Dima\"]] - a survivor of the Paris nuclear blast, now suffering from [[radiation poisoning]]. The pair escape from their cell, start a mass prison riot, and use the chaos to make their escape, with Recker rescuing Irish along the way. As Chinese military arrive to quell the riot, Hannah prevents the group from being recaptured by a group of soldiers. Although Irish mistrusts her, Hannah reveals her action was necessary for her mission, revealing her husband is in reality Jin Ji\u00e9, who survived Chang's assassination attempt.\n\nThe group make use of a tram to get out of the mountains, only for it to be shot down by an enemy helicopter, killing Dima in the crash. Forced to make their way down on foot, hunting for food to survive, the group eventually find a jeep and drive towards the US-occupied city of Tashgar. During the journey, Hannah reveals that how she lost her family to Chang's men after bringing Jin Ji\u00e9 to meet them, causing Irish to make amends with her for his behaviour. Upon reaching Tashgar, the squad find US troops being besieged by both Chinese and Russian forces, and offer assistance to the US commander by destroying a nearby dam, flooding the area and eliminating the opposing forces. Learning the ''Valkyrie'' is within the region of the [[Suez Canal]], Tombstone are airlifted to the ship, and arrive to warn the vessel that they are blindly heading towards Chang's navy. Assisting in stopping Chinese forces from boarding the ship, the squad soon find Jin Ji\u00e9 amongst other survivors, including Pac (who had survived Singapore).\n\nKnowing he must show his face, as Chinese forces had been fighting under the assumption he was dead, Jin Ji\u00e9 convinces Recker to let him show his face and calm tensions between the three forces. The assault quickly ends with Chinese forces beginning to spread the news of Jin Ji\u00e9's return. Chang, desiring to prevent this and conceal the truth, proceeds to barrage the ''Valkyrie'' with his personal warship. Recker, Irish and Hannah volunteer to board the warship and use explosives to destroy it. However, when the remote detonation fails, Hannah and Irish each volunteer to manually replacing the charges. If the player chooses not to do anything, Chang obliterates the ''Valkyrie'', thus killing Pac, Garrison and Jin Ji\u00e9; if they send one of the two, the volunteer goes back to set the explosives, and is killed in the blast along with Chang, while the survivor and Recker are recovered by the ''Valkyrie''. During the credits, the player hears a new dialogue between Irish and Hannah, discussing their pasts, and how they have to keep moving forward with no regrets.\n\n==Development==\nElectronic Arts president Frank Gibeau confirmed the company's intention to release a sequel to ''Battlefield 3'' during a keynote at the [[University of Southern California]] where he said \"There is going to be a ''Battlefield 4''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|title=EA president mentions Battlefield 4 during college keynote|date=November 10, 2011|accessdate=April 7, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103224032/http://www.vg247.com/2011/11/09/report-ea-president-mentions-battlefield-4-during-college-keynote/|archive-date=November 3, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Afterwards, an EA spokesperson told IGN: \"Frank was speaking broadly about the ''Battlefield'' brand&mdash;a brand that EA is deeply passionate about and a fan community that EA is committed to.\" On the eve of ''Battlefield 3''{{'}}s launch, EA Digital Illusions CE told Eurogamer it was the Swedish studio's hope that it would one day get the opportunity to make ''Battlefield 4''. \"This feels like day one now,\" executive producer Patrick Bach said. \"It's exciting.

Some things are massive like reducing a skyscraper to rubble or flooding an entire level in real-time. Others are small but hugely impact the game like shooting fire extinguishers to distract enemies or cutting the power of a building to blind opponents.<br />If you haven\u2019t seen the Paracel Storm map we unveiled at Gamescom we encourage you to do so. There you can see how players have the option of taking down a turbine weakened by lightning in order to free the damaged destroyer stuck on it. If you manage to set the destroyer adrift, it will crash onto the island, changing the layout of the map and allowing your team to take control of the anti-air weaponry on the ship.<br />These moments are all triggered by the players \u2013 they aren\u2019t just timed moments that will happen no matter what you do in the match. You and your teammates will have to decide if it would be a better tactical decision to radically change the map, or if it would be wiser and better for your play-style if you stopped the other team

The [[Bureau of Indian Standards]] is in charge of the enforcement of the manufacture of the flag according to the guidelines.\n\nViolation of the code may invite severe punishments and penalties. The code was written in 2002 and merged the following acts: provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 (No.12 of 1950) and the [[Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971|Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 (No. 69 of 1971)]].\n\nThe Indian Flag Code was often criticized for being too rigid and prevented ordinary citizens from displaying the flag on homes and other buildings. For many years, only government officials and other government buildings could unfurl the flag. That changed in 2001 when [[Naveen Jindal]] won a court case in the [[Supreme Court of India]] to give Indians the right to unfurl the flag publicly. The Indian cricket batsman [[Sachin Tendulkar]] was accused of sporting the flag on his cricket helmet below the BCCI emblem. He later changed it and placed the flag above BCCI emblem. The flag code was updated in 2005; some new provisions include that the flag cannot be worn under the waist or on undergarments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fapr2002/f030420021.html |title=Flag code of India |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Iraq===\nIn 2004, many copies of the proposed new flag for Iraq were burnt (see [[flag of Iraq]]).

In 2003, Paul Hopkinson, a [[Wellington]] schoolteacher, burned the national flag of New Zealand as part of a protest in Parliament grounds at the New Zealand Government's hosting of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], against the background of [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Australia's support of the United States in the Iraq War]]. Hopkinson was initially convicted under Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 of destroying a New Zealand flag with intent to dishonour it, but appealed against his conviction. On appeal, his conviction was overturned on the grounds that the law had to be read consistently with the right to freedom of expression under the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights]]. This meant that his actions were not unlawful because the word dishonour in the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act had many shades of meaning, and when the least restrictive meaning of that word was adopted Hopkinson's actions did not meet that standard. This somewhat unusual result was due in part to the fact that the Bill of Rights does not overrule other laws (''[[Hopkinson v Police]]'').<ref>{{cite news|title=Flag burner in test case|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/175299/2483318/article.html|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=Fair Go, [[Television New Zealand]]|date=14 March 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pollock|first1=Keryn|title=Paul Hopkinson burning the New Zealand flag, 2004|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/33993/paul-hopkinson-burning-the-new-zealand-flag-2004|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Braddock|first1=John|title=New Zealand High Court overturns conviction for flag burning|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2004/08/newz-a26.html|website=[[World Socialist Website]]|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, activist Valerie Morse had burned the New Zealand flag during an [[ANZAC Day]] dawn service in [[Wellington]].

In the case of a [[national flag]], such action is often intended to make a political point against a country or its policies. Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own [[national flag]] and flags of other countries.\n{{TOC right|limit=3}}\n\n==Background==\nActions that may be treated as flag desecration include burning it,<ref name=Charney>{{cite book|last=Charney|first=Evan|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Voices, and Viewpoints |year=2009|publisher=M.E.

It may be a protest against a country's [[foreign policy]], including one's own, or the nature of the government in power there. It may be a protest against nationalism or a deliberate and symbolic insult to the people of the country represented by the flag. It may also be a protest at the very laws prohibiting the act of desecrating a flag.\n\nBurning or defacing a flag is a crime in some countries. In countries where it is not, the act may still be prosecuted as [[disorderly conduct]], arson, or, if conducted on someone else's property, theft or vandalism.\n\nUsing a flag unconventionally, such as hanging it upside down or reversed, may be regarded as desecration.<ref name=Charney/> Flying a flag at [[half-mast]] is considered desecration in Saudi Arabia.<ref name=Goldstein>{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Robert Justin|title=Burning the Flag: The Great 1989\u20131990 American Flag Desecration Controversy|year=2006|publisher=Kent State University Press|isbn=978-0-87338-598-5|page=293}}</ref> In some countries, however, flying a flag upside-down is conventional protocol to [[distress signal#Inverted flags|indicate an emergency or problem]], or to [[War flag|indicate a state of war]]. Moreover, some flags (such as the [[flag of Austria]]) when hung upside down and/or reversed look the same because they are vertically and/or horizontally [[symmetrical]].\n\nSome countries regard it as desecration to make toilet paper, napkins, doormats, and other such items bearing the image of the flag, so that the flag's image will be destroyed or soiled.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} It is, however, increasingly common in some countries to see clothing with the image of the flag forming a substantial part of the piece.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} A pioneer in using the flag as clothing is Abbie Hoffman\u2014who was even arrested for this action in 1968 in the United States.<ref name=\"abbie\">{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/445/226/16426/|title=Abbie Hoffman, Appellant, v.

Televised images of individuals stepping on the Quebec flag were played in [[Quebec]] and contributed to the deterioration in relations between Quebec and [[English Canada]]. The incident, seen as a metaphor of Canada's perceived rejection of Quebec (and of Quebec's distinctiveness in the demise of the Meech Lake Accord) was invoked by [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]] during the run-up to the [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 referendum]] on [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec independence]] and is still remembered today.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn 1999, members of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] from the United States staged a burning of the Canadian Flag outside of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario]].

The [[Bureau of Indian Standards]] is in charge of the enforcement of the manufacture of the flag according to the guidelines.\n\nViolation of the code may invite severe punishments and penalties. The code was written in 2002 and merged the following acts: provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 (No.12 of 1950) and the [[Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971|Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 (No. 69 of 1971)]].\n\nThe Indian Flag Code was often criticized for being too rigid and prevented ordinary citizens from displaying the flag on homes and other buildings. For many years, only government officials and other government buildings could unfurl the flag. That changed in 2001 when [[Naveen Jindal]] won a court case in the [[Supreme Court of India]] to give Indians the right to unfurl the flag publicly.

In 2003, Paul Hopkinson, a [[Wellington]] schoolteacher, burned the national flag of New Zealand as part of a protest in Parliament grounds at the New Zealand Government's hosting of the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], against the background of [[Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq|Australia's support of the United States in the Iraq War]]. Hopkinson was initially convicted under Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 of destroying a New Zealand flag with intent to dishonour it, but appealed against his conviction. On appeal, his conviction was overturned on the grounds that the law had to be read consistently with the right to freedom of expression under the [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990|Bill of Rights]]. This meant that his actions were not unlawful because the word dishonour in the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act had many shades of meaning, and when the least restrictive meaning of that word was adopted Hopkinson's actions did not meet that standard. This somewhat unusual result was due in part to the fact that the Bill of Rights does not overrule other laws (''[[Hopkinson v Police]]'').<ref>{{cite news|title=Flag burner in test case|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/175299/2483318/article.html|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=Fair Go, [[Television New Zealand]]|date=14 March 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pollock|first1=Keryn|title=Paul Hopkinson burning the New Zealand flag, 2004|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/33993/paul-hopkinson-burning-the-new-zealand-flag-2004|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Braddock|first1=John|title=New Zealand High Court overturns conviction for flag burning|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2004/08/newz-a26.html|website=[[World Socialist Website]]|accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, activist Valerie Morse had burned the New Zealand flag during an [[ANZAC Day]] dawn service in [[Wellington]].

The [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', {{ussc|491|397|1989}}, and reaffirmed in ''[[United States v. Eichman|U.S. v. Eichman]]'', {{ussc|496|310|1990}}, has ruled that due to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipal) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as \"[[symbolic speech]].\" However, [[content-neutral restrictions]] may still be imposed to regulate the time, place, and manner of such expression. If the flag that was burned was someone else's property (as it was in the ''Johnson'' case, since Johnson had stolen the flag from a Texas bank's flagpole), the offender could be charged with petty larceny (a flag usually sells at retail for less than [[USD]]&nbsp;20), or with destruction of private property, or possibly both.\n\nThere have been several proposed [[Flag Desecration Amendment]]s to the [[Constitution of the United States]] that would allow Congress to enact laws to prohibit flag desecration:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/amending-america-proposed-amendments-to-the-united-states-constitution-1787-to-2014|title=Amending America: Proposed Amendments to the United States Constitution, 1787 to 2014 \u2013 Data.gov|website=catalog.data.gov|access-date=29 July 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Douglas Applegate]] ([[Ohio]]) in 1991\n*[[Bob Dornan|Robert Dornan]] ([[California]]) in 1991\n*[[Bill Emerson]] ([[Missouri]]) in 1991, 1993, 1995\n*[[Duke Cunningham|Randy Cunningham]] ([[California]]) in 1999, 2001, 2003,\n*[[Jo Ann Emerson]] ([[Missouri]]) in 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013\n*[[John Paul Hammerschmidt|John P.
