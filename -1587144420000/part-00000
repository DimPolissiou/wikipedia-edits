Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia. Anton derides him over Amaya's secrecy and attacks Kenton, stabbing him, and in the ensuing struggle Kenton breaks Anton's neck.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|12}}\n |ShortSummary    = Senator Laine, who wants to use the Devs technology for the US government, visits Amaya and questions Forest about his work. Katie admonishes the Devs team for using the projection system for their own amusement, with Stewart scorning her hypocracy. Lily shares her suspicions with co-workers that Sergei was murdered, and they advise her to tell Kenton. Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with [[schizophrenia]] in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator. When Kenton goes out after her, Jen copies data from his computer onto a flash drive \u2014 Lily, with Jen's help, had feigned schizophrenia to get the security camera footage from the night of Sergei's death. Lily watches the footage with Jamie, who notices that the flames on the screen are not real, but [[Visual effects|digital effects]].

Lily and Jamie argue over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where Pete, the homeless man who lives there, treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, arrest Lily for causing the crash, and take her away for [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric commitment]], while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing [[Go (game)|Go]] with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting and first admission of love for each other, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon breaks into Stewart's [[Motorhome|RV]] and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project. Lily awakes in the [[Napa County, California|Napa]] motel James brought her to, and after realizing they cannot run, decides to go back to San Francisco instead to confront Forest at his house. They find him there with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system - a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them.

She tells him he can re-join the project if he proves his faith in the many-worlds interpretation by standing at a perilous height overlooking a [[dam]], proposing that he will only be conscious of the worlds in which he does not fall to his death. He adheres to this vision, but falls and dies in the present world. Lily and Jamie resume their relationship, and she tells him she plans on proving the Devs team is delusional by not showing up when the machine predicts she will. However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life. Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US. Instead, Lily heads to Devs.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Episode 8\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|16}}\n |ShortSummary    = Inside the Devs labs, Forest shows Lily a projection of what she is about to do: holding Kenton's gun on Forest, she leads him to the transportation capsule out of Devs and shoots him, causing the capsule to crash, and killing Lily in the fall. Beyond this point, Devs can see nothing. Forest tells Lily that their actions have been predetermined and that the system's real name is [[God|Deus]]. Lily leads Forest into the capsule as projected, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the [[Electromagnetic suspension|electromagnetic field]] that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die and Stewart tells a devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped before walking away. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in a simulation inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, an emotional Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on. Inside Amaya, Lily finds Jamie and hugs him, which he returns.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:15-alex-garland.w330.h330.jpg|[[Alex Garland]] is the creator, writer, and director of the miniseries.|thumb|upright]]\nOn March 13, 2018, it was announced that [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] had given the production a pilot order.

One was getting my head around this principle of determinism, which basically says that everything that happens in the world is based on cause and effect...That has all sorts of implications for us.

Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia.

Katie admonishes the Devs team for using the projection system for their own amusement, with Stewart scorning her hypocracy. Lily shares her suspicions with co-workers that Sergei was murdered, and they advise her to tell Kenton. Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with [[schizophrenia]] in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator. When Kenton goes out after her, Jen copies data from his computer onto a flash drive \u2014 Lily, with Jen's help, had feigned schizophrenia to get the security camera footage from the night of Sergei's death.

Lily and Jamie argue over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where Pete, the homeless man who lives there, treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, arrest Lily for causing the crash, and take her away for [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric commitment]], while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing [[Go (game)|Go]] with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting and first admission of love for each other, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon breaks into Stewart's [[Motorhome|RV]] and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project. Lily awakes in the [[Napa County, California|Napa]] motel James brought her to, and after realizing they cannot run, decides to go back to San Francisco instead to confront Forest at his house. They find him there with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system - a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them.

He adheres to this vision, but falls and dies in the present world. Lily and Jamie resume their relationship, and she tells him she plans on proving the Devs team is delusional by not showing up when the machine predicts she will. However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life. Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US.

Beyond this point, Devs can see nothing. Forest tells Lily that their actions have been predetermined and that the system's real name is [[God|Deus]]. Lily leads Forest into the capsule as projected, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the [[Electromagnetic suspension|electromagnetic field]] that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die and Stewart tells a devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped before walking away. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in a simulation inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, an emotional Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on.

The mariner stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The wedding-guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[File:Frontispiece by William Strang.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] by [[William Strang]] for an [[Edition (book)|edition]] of Coleridge's poem. [[1903]].]]\nThe poem begins with an old grey-bearded sailor, the Mariner, stopping a guest at a wedding ceremony to tell him a story of a sailing voyage he took long ago. The Wedding-Guest is at first reluctant to listen, as the ceremony is about to begin, but the mariner's glittering eye captivates him.\n\nThe mariner's tale begins with his ship departing on its journey. Despite initial good fortune, the ship is driven south by a storm and eventually reaches the icy waters of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. An [[albatross]] appears and leads the ship out of the ice jam where it is stuck, but even as the albatross is fed and praised by the ship's crew, the mariner shoots the bird:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n[...] With my cross-bow\nI shot the {{sc1|Albatross}}.<ref name=\"STC 1869\">{{cite book |last=Coleridge |first=Samuel Taylor |author-link=Samuel Taylor Coleridge |editor-last=Coleridge |editor-first=Ernest Hartley |editor-link=Ernest Hartley Coleridge |title=The Poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge |date=1921 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/poemsofsamueltay1921cole/page/186 |pages=186\u2013209}}</ref></poem>\n|source=lines 81-82}}\n\nThe crew is angry with the mariner, believing the albatross brought the south wind that led them out of the Antarctic. However, the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist disappears:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,\nThat bring the fog and mist.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 101-102}}\n\nThey soon find that they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime, as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship \"from the land of mist and snow\"; the south wind that had initially blown them north now sends the ship into uncharted waters near the equator, where it is [[wikt:becalmed|becalmed]]:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nDay after day, day after day,\nWe stuck, nor breath nor motion;\nAs idle as a painted ship\nUpon a painted ocean.\n\nWater, water, every where,\nAnd all the boards did shrink;\nWater, water, every where,\nNor any drop to drink.\n\nThe very deep did rot: Oh Christ!\nThat ever this should be!\nYea, slimy things did crawl with legs\nUpon the slimy sea.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 115-126}}\n\n[[File:Rime of the Ancient Mariner-Albatross-Dore.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] for an 1876 edition of the poem. \"The Albatross\" depicts 17 sailors on the deck of a wooden ship facing an albatross. Icicles hang from the rigging.]]\nThe sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst. In anger, the crew forces the mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck, perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it, or perhaps as a sign of regret:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAh! well a-day! what evil looks\nHad I from old and young!\nInstead of the cross, the Albatross\nAbout my neck was hung.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 139-142}}\n\nAfter a \"weary time\", the ship encounters a ghostly hulk. On board are [[Death (personification)|Death]] (a skeleton) and the \"Night-mare Life-in-Death\", a deathly pale woman, who are playing dice for the souls of the crew. With a roll of the dice, Death wins the lives of the crew members and Life-in-Death the life of the mariner, a prize she considers more valuable. Her name is a clue to the mariner's fate: he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross. One by one, all of the crew members die, but the mariner lives on, seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the crew's corpses, whose last expressions remain upon their faces:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nFour times fifty living men,\n(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)\nWith heavy thump, a lifeless lump,\nThey dropped down one by one.\n\nThe souls did from their bodies fly,\u2014\nThey fled to bliss or woe!\nAnd every soul, it passed me by,\nLike the whizz of my cross-bow!<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 216-223}}\n\nEventually, this stage of the mariner's curse is lifted after he begins to appreciate the many sea creatures swimming in the water. Despite his cursing them as \"slimy things\" earlier in the poem, he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them (\"A spring of love gush'd from my heart, And I bless'd them unaware\"). As he manages to pray, the albatross falls from his neck and his guilt is partially expiated. It then starts to rain, and the bodies of the crew, possessed by good spirits, rise again and help steer the ship. In a trance, the mariner hears two spirits discussing his voyage and penance, and learns that the ship is being powered supernaturally:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThe air is cut away before,\nAnd closes from behind.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 424-425}}\n\nFinally the mariner wakes from his trance and comes in sight of his homeland, but is initially uncertain as to whether or not he is hallucinating:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nOh! dream of joy! is this indeed\nThe light-house top I see?\nIs this the hill? is this the kirk?\nIs this mine own countree?\n\nWe drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\nAnd I with sobs did pray\u2014\nO let me be awake, my God!\nOr let me sleep alway.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 464-471}}\n\nThe rotten remains of the ship sink in a whirlpool, leaving only the mariner behind. A [[hermit]] on the mainland who has spotted the approaching ship comes to meet it in a boat, rowed by a pilot and his boy. When they pull the mariner from the water, they think he is dead, but when he opens his mouth, the pilot shrieks with fright. The hermit prays, and the mariner picks up the oars to row. The pilot's boy laughs, thinking the mariner is the devil, and cries, \"The Devil knows how to row\". Back on land, the mariner is compelled by \"a woful agony\" to tell the hermit his story.\n\nAs penance for shooting the albatross, the mariner, driven by the agony of his guilt, is now forced to wander the earth, telling his story over and over, and teaching a lesson to those he meets:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nHe prayeth best, who loveth best\nAll things both great and small;\nFor the dear God who loveth us,\nHe made and loveth all.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 614-617}}\n\nAfter finishing his story, the mariner leaves, and the wedding-guest returns home, waking the next morning \"a sadder and a wiser man\".\n\nThe poem received mixed reviews from critics, and Coleridge was once told by the publisher that most of the book's sales were to sailors who thought it was a naval songbook. Coleridge made several modifications to the poem over the years. In the second edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'', published in 1800, he replaced many of the archaic words.\n\n==Inspiration for the poem==\n[[File:Ancient mariner statue.jpg|thumb|Commemorative statue at [[Watchet]], Somerset: the albatross hangs on a rope looped around the ancient mariner's neck.\n<poem>\"Ah! well a-day! what evil looks\nHad I from old and young!\nInstead of the cross, the Albatross\nAbout my neck was hung.\" (ll 139-142)<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>]]\nThe poem may have been inspired by [[James Cook]]'s second voyage of exploration (1772\u20131775) of the South Seas and the Pacific Ocean; Coleridge's tutor, [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]], was the astronomer on [[HMS Resolution (1771)|Cook's flagship]] and had a strong relationship with Cook. On this second voyage Cook crossed three times into the [[Antarctic Circle]] to determine whether the fabled great southern continent [[Terra Australis]] existed.<ref>Andrew C. F.

Penguin, 1997.</ref> The discussion had turned to a book that Wordsworth was reading, ''A Voyage Round The World by Way of the Great South Sea'' (1726) by Captain [[George Shelvocke]]. The book told of a [[privateering]] voyage in 1719 during which a melancholy sailor, [[Simon Hatley]], shot a black [[albatross]]:\n\n{{quote|We all observed, that we had not the sight of one fish of any kind, since we were come to the Southward of the [[Le Maire Strait|streights of le Mair]], nor one sea-bird, except a disconsolate black Albatross, who accompanied us for several days&nbsp;... till Hattley, (my second Captain) observing, in one of his melancholy fits, that this bird was always hovering near us, imagin'd, from his colour, that it might be some ill omen&nbsp;... He, after some fruitless attempts, at length, shot the Albatross, not doubting we should have a fair wind after it.}}\n\nAs they discussed Shelvocke's book, Wordsworth proffered the following developmental critique to Coleridge, which importantly contains a reference to [[tutelary spirit]]s: \"Suppose you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea, and the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime.\"<ref name=\"Keach\"/> By the time the trio finished their walk, the poem had taken shape.\n\nBernard Martin argues in ''The Ancient Mariner and the Authentic Narrative'' that Coleridge was also influenced by the life of Anglican clergyman [[John Newton]], who had a [[near-death experience]] aboard a [[slave ship]].<ref>Martin, Bernard, ''The Ancient Mariner and the Authentic Narrative'' (William Heinemann Ltd.: 1949)</ref>\n\nThe poem may also have been inspired by the legends of the [[Wandering Jew]], who was forced to wander the earth until [[Judgement Day]] for a terrible crime, found in Charles Maturin's ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', M. G. Lewis' ''[[The Monk]]'' (a novel Coleridge reviewed), and the legend of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Ancient Mariner and the Wandering Jew | journal = Studies in Philology | date = October 1969 | first = O.

Poem illustration published 1896.]]\nIn ''Biographia Literaria'', Coleridge wrote:\n\n{{quote|The thought suggested itself (to which of us I do not recollect) that a series of poems might be composed of two sorts. In the one, incidents and agents were to be, in part at least, supernatural, and the excellence aimed at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the dramatic truth of such emotions, as would naturally accompany such situations, supposing them real. And real in this sense they have been to every human being who, from whatever source of delusion, has at any time believed himself under supernatural agency. For the second class, subjects were to be chosen from ordinary life...In this idea originated the plan of the 'Lyrical Ballads'; in which it was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least Romantic; yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing [[suspension of disbelief]] for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. ... With this view I wrote the 'Ancient Mariner'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coleridge |first=Samuel Taylor |title=Biographia Literaria |chapter=Chapter XIV|chapter-url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/237838 |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Table Talk'', Coleridge wrote:\n\n{{quote|Mrs Barbauld once told me that she admired The Ancient Mariner very much, but that there were two faults in it -- it was improbable, and had no moral.   As for the probability, I owned that that might admit some question; but as to the want of a moral, I told her that in my own judgement the poem had too much; and that the only, or chief fault, if I might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure imagination. It ought to have had no more moral than the Arabian Nights' tale of the merchant's sitting down to eat dates by the side of a well, and throwing the shells aside, and lo! a genie starts up, and says he must kill the aforesaid merchant, because one of the date shells had, it seems, put out the eye of the genie's son.<ref>TableTalks, p. 106 {{cite web |url=http://www.english.uga.edu/~nhilton/232/stc/comp4f.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415092012/http://www.english.uga.edu/~nhilton/232/stc/comp4f.htm |archivedate=15 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\n==Wordsworth's comments==\nWordsworth wrote to Joseph Cottle in 1799:\n\n{{quote|From what I can gather it seems that the Ancient Mariner has upon the whole been an injury to the volume, I mean that the old words and the strangeness of it have deterred readers from going on. If the volume should come to a second Edition I would put in its place some little things which would be more likely to suit the common taste.}}\n\nHowever, when ''Lyrical Ballads'' was reprinted, Wordsworth included it despite Coleridge's objections, writing:\n\n{{quote|The Poem of my Friend has indeed great defects; first, that the principal person has no distinct character, either in his profession of Mariner, or as a human being who having been long under the control of supernatural impressions might be supposed himself to partake of something supernatural; secondly, that he does not act, but is continually acted upon; thirdly, that the events having no necessary connection do not produce each other; and lastly, that the imagery is somewhat too laboriously accumulated. Yet the Poem contains many delicate touches of passion, and indeed the passion is every where true to nature, a great number of the stanzas present beautiful images, and are expressed with unusual felicity of language; and the versification, though the metre is itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and artfully varied, exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, and every variety of which it is capable. It therefore appeared to me that these several merits (the first of which, namely that of the passion, is of the highest kind) gave to the Poem a value which is not often possessed by better Poems.}}\n\n== Early criticisms ==\n[[File:Dore coleridge.png|thumb|right|Illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], 1878]]\nUpon its release, the poem was criticized for being obscure and difficult to read. The use of archaic spelling of words was seen as not in keeping with Wordsworth's claims of using common language. Criticism was renewed again in 1815\u201316, when Coleridge added marginal notes to the poem that were also written in an archaic style. These notes or [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]], placed next to the text of the poem, ostensibly interpret the verses much like marginal notes found in the Bible. There were many opinions on why Coleridge inserted the gloss.<ref>Duncan Wu, ''A Companion to Romanticism'', Blackwell Publishing, 1998, p 137. {{ISBN|0-631-21877-7}}</ref> [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], who had deeply admired the original for its attention to \"Human Feeling\", claimed that the gloss distanced the audience from the narrative, weakening the poem's effects. The entire poem was first published in the collection of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]''. Another version of the poem was published in the 1817 collection entitled ''[[Sibylline Leaves]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/mariner/about.html|title=GradeSaver: The Rime of the Ancient Mariner-Study Guide \u2013 About The Rime of the Ancient Mariner<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> (see [[1817 in poetry]]).\n\n==Interpretations==\nOn a surface level the poem explores a violation of nature and the resulting psychological effects on the mariner and on all those who hear him. According to [[Jerome McGann]] the poem is like a salvation story. The poem's structure is multi-layered text based on Coleridge's interest in [[higher criticism]]. \"Like the Iliad or Paradise Lost or any great historical product, the ''Rime'' is a work of transhistorical rather than so-called universal significance. This verbal distinction is important because it calls attention to a real one.

The mariner stops a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The wedding-guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[File:Frontispiece by William Strang.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] by [[William Strang]] for an [[Edition (book)|edition]] of Coleridge's poem. [[1903]].]]\nThe poem begins with an old grey-bearded sailor, the Mariner, stopping a guest at a wedding ceremony to tell him a story of a sailing voyage he took long ago. The Wedding-Guest is at first reluctant to listen, as the ceremony is about to begin, but the mariner's glittering eye captivates him.\n\nThe mariner's tale begins with his ship departing on its journey. Despite initial good fortune, the ship is driven south by a storm and eventually reaches the icy waters of the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]]. An [[albatross]] appears and leads the ship out of the ice jam where it is stuck, but even as the albatross is fed and praised by the ship's crew, the mariner shoots the bird:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n[...] With my cross-bow\nI shot the {{sc1|Albatross}}.<ref name=\"STC 1869\">{{cite book |last=Coleridge |first=Samuel Taylor |author-link=Samuel Taylor Coleridge |editor-last=Coleridge |editor-first=Ernest Hartley |editor-link=Ernest Hartley Coleridge |title=The Poems of Samuel Taylor Coleridge |date=1921 |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/poemsofsamueltay1921cole/page/186 |pages=186\u2013209}}</ref></poem>\n|source=lines 81-82}}\n\nThe crew is angry with the mariner, believing the albatross brought the south wind that led them out of the Antarctic. However, the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist disappears:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,\nThat bring the fog and mist.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 101-102}}\n\nThey soon find that they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime, as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship \"from the land of mist and snow\"; the south wind that had initially blown them north now sends the ship into uncharted waters near the equator, where it is [[wikt:becalmed|becalmed]]:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nDay after day, day after day,\nWe stuck, nor breath nor motion;\nAs idle as a painted ship\nUpon a painted ocean.\n\nWater, water, every where,\nAnd all the boards did shrink;\nWater, water, every where,\nNor any drop to drink.\n\nThe very deep did rot: Oh Christ!\nThat ever this should be!\nYea, slimy things did crawl with legs\nUpon the slimy sea.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 115-126}}\n\n[[File:Rime of the Ancient Mariner-Albatross-Dore.jpg|thumb|right|Engraving by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] for an 1876 edition of the poem. \"The Albatross\" depicts 17 sailors on the deck of a wooden ship facing an albatross. Icicles hang from the rigging.]]\nThe sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst. In anger, the crew forces the mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck, perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it, or perhaps as a sign of regret:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nAh! well a-day! what evil looks\nHad I from old and young!\nInstead of the cross, the Albatross\nAbout my neck was hung.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 139-142}}\n\nAfter a \"weary time\", the ship encounters a ghostly hulk. On board are [[Death (personification)|Death]] (a skeleton) and the \"Night-mare Life-in-Death\", a deathly pale woman, who are playing dice for the souls of the crew. With a roll of the dice, Death wins the lives of the crew members and Life-in-Death the life of the mariner, a prize she considers more valuable. Her name is a clue to the mariner's fate: he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross. One by one, all of the crew members die, but the mariner lives on, seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the crew's corpses, whose last expressions remain upon their faces:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nFour times fifty living men,\n(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)\nWith heavy thump, a lifeless lump,\nThey dropped down one by one.\n\nThe souls did from their bodies fly,\u2014\nThey fled to bliss or woe!\nAnd every soul, it passed me by,\nLike the whizz of my cross-bow!<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 216-223}}\n\nEventually, this stage of the mariner's curse is lifted after he begins to appreciate the many sea creatures swimming in the water. Despite his cursing them as \"slimy things\" earlier in the poem, he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them (\"A spring of love gush'd from my heart, And I bless'd them unaware\"). As he manages to pray, the albatross falls from his neck and his guilt is partially expiated. It then starts to rain, and the bodies of the crew, possessed by good spirits, rise again and help steer the ship. In a trance, the mariner hears two spirits discussing his voyage and penance, and learns that the ship is being powered supernaturally:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThe air is cut away before,\nAnd closes from behind.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 424-425}}\n\nFinally the mariner wakes from his trance and comes in sight of his homeland, but is initially uncertain as to whether or not he is hallucinating:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nOh! dream of joy! is this indeed\nThe light-house top I see?\nIs this the hill? is this the kirk?\nIs this mine own countree?\n\nWe drifted o'er the harbour-bar,\nAnd I with sobs did pray\u2014\nO let me be awake, my God!\nOr let me sleep alway.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 464-471}}\n\nThe rotten remains of the ship sink in a whirlpool, leaving only the mariner behind. A [[hermit]] on the mainland who has spotted the approaching ship comes to meet it in a boat, rowed by a pilot and his boy. When they pull the mariner from the water, they think he is dead, but when he opens his mouth, the pilot shrieks with fright. The hermit prays, and the mariner picks up the oars to row. The pilot's boy laughs, thinking the mariner is the devil, and cries, \"The Devil knows how to row\". Back on land, the mariner is compelled by \"a woful agony\" to tell the hermit his story.\n\nAs penance for shooting the albatross, the mariner, driven by the agony of his guilt, is now forced to wander the earth, telling his story over and over, and teaching a lesson to those he meets:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nHe prayeth best, who loveth best\nAll things both great and small;\nFor the dear God who loveth us,\nHe made and loveth all.<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>\n|source=lines 614-617}}\n\nAfter finishing his story, the mariner leaves, and the wedding-guest returns home, waking the next morning \"a sadder and a wiser man\".\n\nThe poem received mixed reviews from critics, and Coleridge was once told by the publisher that most of the book's sales were to sailors who thought it was a naval songbook. Coleridge made several modifications to the poem over the years. In the second edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'', published in 1800, he replaced many of the archaic words.\n\n==Inspiration for the poem==\n[[File:Ancient mariner statue.jpg|thumb|Commemorative statue at [[Watchet]], Somerset: the albatross hangs on a rope looped around the ancient mariner's neck.\n<poem>\"Ah! well a-day! what evil looks\nHad I from old and young!\nInstead of the cross, the Albatross\nAbout my neck was hung.\" (ll 139-142)<ref name=\"STC 1869\" /></poem>]]\nThe poem may have been inspired by [[James Cook]]'s second voyage of exploration (1772\u20131775) of the South Seas and the Pacific Ocean; Coleridge's tutor, [[William Wales (astronomer)|William Wales]], was the astronomer on [[HMS Resolution (1771)|Cook's flagship]] and had a strong relationship with Cook.

Penguin, 1997.</ref> The discussion had turned to a book that Wordsworth was reading, ''A Voyage Round The World by Way of the Great South Sea'' (1726) by Captain [[George Shelvocke]]. The book told of a [[privateering]] voyage in 1719 during which a melancholy sailor, [[Simon Hatley]], shot a black [[albatross]]:\n\n{{quote|We all observed, that we had not the sight of one fish of any kind, since we were come to the Southward of the [[Le Maire Strait|streights of le Mair]], nor one sea-bird, except a disconsolate black Albatross, who accompanied us for several days&nbsp;... till Hattley, (my second Captain) observing, in one of his melancholy fits, that this bird was always hovering near us, imagin'd, from his colour, that it might be some ill omen&nbsp;... He, after some fruitless attempts, at length, shot the Albatross, not doubting we should have a fair wind after it.}}\n\nAs they discussed Shelvocke's book, Wordsworth proffered the following developmental critique to Coleridge, which importantly contains a reference to [[tutelary spirit]]s: \"Suppose you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea, and the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime.\"<ref name=\"Keach\"/> By the time the trio finished their walk, the poem had taken shape.\n\nBernard Martin argues in ''The Ancient Mariner and the Authentic Narrative'' that Coleridge was also influenced by the life of Anglican clergyman [[John Newton]], who had a [[near-death experience]] aboard a [[slave ship]].<ref>Martin, Bernard, ''The Ancient Mariner and the Authentic Narrative'' (William Heinemann Ltd.: 1949)</ref>\n\nThe poem may also have been inspired by the legends of the [[Wandering Jew]], who was forced to wander the earth until [[Judgement Day]] for a terrible crime, found in Charles Maturin's ''[[Melmoth the Wanderer]]'', M. G. Lewis' ''[[The Monk]]'' (a novel Coleridge reviewed), and the legend of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Ancient Mariner and the Wandering Jew | journal = Studies in Philology | date = October 1969 | first = O.

Poem illustration published 1896.]]\nIn ''Biographia Literaria'', Coleridge wrote:\n\n{{quote|The thought suggested itself (to which of us I do not recollect) that a series of poems might be composed of two sorts. In the one, incidents and agents were to be, in part at least, supernatural, and the excellence aimed at was to consist in the interesting of the affections by the dramatic truth of such emotions, as would naturally accompany such situations, supposing them real. And real in this sense they have been to every human being who, from whatever source of delusion, has at any time believed himself under supernatural agency. For the second class, subjects were to be chosen from ordinary life...In this idea originated the plan of the 'Lyrical Ballads'; in which it was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least Romantic; yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing [[suspension of disbelief]] for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. ... With this view I wrote the 'Ancient Mariner'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coleridge |first=Samuel Taylor |title=Biographia Literaria |chapter=Chapter XIV|chapter-url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/learning/essay/237838 |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Table Talk'', Coleridge wrote:\n\n{{quote|Mrs Barbauld once told me that she admired The Ancient Mariner very much, but that there were two faults in it -- it was improbable, and had no moral.   As for the probability, I owned that that might admit some question; but as to the want of a moral, I told her that in my own judgement the poem had too much; and that the only, or chief fault, if I might say so, was the obtrusion of the moral sentiment so openly on the reader as a principle or cause of action in a work of such pure imagination. It ought to have had no more moral than the Arabian Nights' tale of the merchant's sitting down to eat dates by the side of a well, and throwing the shells aside, and lo! a genie starts up, and says he must kill the aforesaid merchant, because one of the date shells had, it seems, put out the eye of the genie's son.<ref>TableTalks, p. 106 {{cite web |url=http://www.english.uga.edu/~nhilton/232/stc/comp4f.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415092012/http://www.english.uga.edu/~nhilton/232/stc/comp4f.htm |archivedate=15 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\n==Wordsworth's comments==\nWordsworth wrote to Joseph Cottle in 1799:\n\n{{quote|From what I can gather it seems that the Ancient Mariner has upon the whole been an injury to the volume, I mean that the old words and the strangeness of it have deterred readers from going on. If the volume should come to a second Edition I would put in its place some little things which would be more likely to suit the common taste.}}\n\nHowever, when ''Lyrical Ballads'' was reprinted, Wordsworth included it despite Coleridge's objections, writing:\n\n{{quote|The Poem of my Friend has indeed great defects; first, that the principal person has no distinct character, either in his profession of Mariner, or as a human being who having been long under the control of supernatural impressions might be supposed himself to partake of something supernatural; secondly, that he does not act, but is continually acted upon; thirdly, that the events having no necessary connection do not produce each other; and lastly, that the imagery is somewhat too laboriously accumulated. Yet the Poem contains many delicate touches of passion, and indeed the passion is every where true to nature, a great number of the stanzas present beautiful images, and are expressed with unusual felicity of language; and the versification, though the metre is itself unfit for long poems, is harmonious and artfully varied, exhibiting the utmost powers of that metre, and every variety of which it is capable. It therefore appeared to me that these several merits (the first of which, namely that of the passion, is of the highest kind) gave to the Poem a value which is not often possessed by better Poems.}}\n\n== Early criticisms ==\n[[File:Dore coleridge.png|thumb|right|Illustration by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], 1878]]\nUpon its release, the poem was criticized for being obscure and difficult to read. The use of archaic spelling of words was seen as not in keeping with Wordsworth's claims of using common language. Criticism was renewed again in 1815\u201316, when Coleridge added marginal notes to the poem that were also written in an archaic style. These notes or [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]], placed next to the text of the poem, ostensibly interpret the verses much like marginal notes found in the Bible. There were many opinions on why Coleridge inserted the gloss.<ref>Duncan Wu, ''A Companion to Romanticism'', Blackwell Publishing, 1998, p 137. {{ISBN|0-631-21877-7}}</ref> [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], who had deeply admired the original for its attention to \"Human Feeling\", claimed that the gloss distanced the audience from the narrative, weakening the poem's effects. The entire poem was first published in the collection of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]''. Another version of the poem was published in the 1817 collection entitled ''[[Sibylline Leaves]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/titles/mariner/about.html|title=GradeSaver: The Rime of the Ancient Mariner-Study Guide \u2013 About The Rime of the Ancient Mariner<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> (see [[1817 in poetry]]).\n\n==Interpretations==\nOn a surface level the poem explores a violation of nature and the resulting psychological effects on the mariner and on all those who hear him. According to [[Jerome McGann]] the poem is like a salvation story. The poem's structure is multi-layered text based on Coleridge's interest in [[higher criticism]]. \"Like the Iliad or Paradise Lost or any great historical product, the ''Rime'' is a work of transhistorical rather than so-called universal significance. This verbal distinction is important because it calls attention to a real one.
