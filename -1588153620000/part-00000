The [[Filtering problem (stochastic processes)|filtering problem]] consists of estimating the internal states in [[dynamical systems]] when partial observations are made, and random perturbations are present in the sensors as well as in the dynamical system. The objective is to compute the [[posterior probability|posterior distributions]] of the states of some [[Markov process]], given some noisy and partial observations.

However, these methods do not perform well when applied to very high-dimensional systems.\n\nParticle filters update their prediction in an approximate (statistical) manner. The samples from the distribution are represented by a set of particles; each particle has a likelihood weight assigned to it that represents the probability of that particle being sampled from the probability density function. Weight disparity leading to weight collapse is a common issue encountered in these filtering algorithms; however it can be mitigated by including a resampling step before the weights become too uneven. Several adaptive resampling criteria can be used, including the variance of the weights and the relative entropy with respect to the uniform distribution.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last1 = Del Moral|first1 = Pierre|last2 = Doucet|first2 = Arnaud|last3 = Jasra|first3 = Ajay|title = On Adaptive Resampling Procedures for Sequential Monte Carlo Methods|journal = Bernoulli|date = 2012|volume = 18|issue = 1|pages = 252\u2013278|url = http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/33/25/83/PDF/RR-6700.pdf|doi = 10.3150/10-bej335}}</ref> In the resampling step, the particles with negligible weights are replaced by new particles in the proximity of the particles with higher weights.\n\nFrom the statistical and probabilistic point of view, particle filters can be interpreted as [[Mean field particle methods|mean field particle]] interpretations of [[Feynman\u2013Kac formula|Feynman-Kac]] probability measures.<ref name=\"dp042\">{{cite book|last = Del Moral|first = Pierre|title = Feynman-Kac formulae.

The particle filter is designed for a [[hidden Markov Model]], where the system consists of both hidden and observable variables. The observable variables (observation process) are related to the hidden variables (state-process) by some functional form that is known. Similarly the dynamical system describing the evolution of the state variables is also known probabilistically.\n\nA generic particle filter estimates the posterior distribution of the hidden states using the observation measurement process. Consider a state-space shown in the diagram below.\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cccccccccc}\nX_0&\\to &X_1&\\to &X_2&\\to&X_3&\\to &\\cdots&\\text{signal}\\\\\n\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\cdots&\\\\\nY_0&&Y_1&&Y_2&&Y_3&&\\cdots&\\text{observation}\n\\end{array}</math>\n \nThe filtering problem is to estimate '''sequentially''' the values of the hidden states <math>X_k</math>, given the values of the observation process <math>Y_0,\\cdots,Y_k,</math> at any time step ''k''.\n\nAll Bayesian estimates of <math>X_k</math> follow from the [[Posterior probability|posterior density]]  ''p''(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>). The particle filter methodology provides an approximation of these conditional probabilities using the empirical measure associated with a genetic type particle algorithm.  In contrast, the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] or [[importance sampling]] approach would model the full posterior ''p''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>).\n\n===The Signal-Observation Model===\nParticle methods often assume <math>X_k</math> and the observations <math>Y_k</math> can be modeled in this form:\n\n*<math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> is a [[Markov process]] on <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x}</math> (for some <math>d_x\\geqslant 1</math>) that evolves according to the transition probability density <math>p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>. This model is also often written in a synthetic way as \n*:<math>X_k|X_{k-1}=x_k \\sim p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>\n:with an initial probability density <math>p(x_0)</math>.\n*The observations <math>Y_0, Y_1, \\cdots</math>  take values in some state space on <math>\\mathbb{R}^{d_y}</math> (for some <math>d_y\\geqslant 1</math>) and are conditionally independent provided that <math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> are known. In other words, each <math>Y_k</math> only depends on <math>X_k</math>. In addition, we assume conditional distribution for <math>Y_k</math> given <math>X_k=x_k</math> are absolutely continuous, and in a synthetic way we have\n*:<math>Y_k|X_k=y_k \\sim p(y_k|x_k)</math>\nAn example of system with these properties is:\n\n:<math>X_k = g(X_{k-1}) + W_{k-1}</math>\n:<math>Y_k = h(X_k) + V_k</math>\n\nwhere both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are mutually independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s and ''g'' and ''h'' are known functions. These two equations can be viewed as [[state space (controls)|state space]] equations and look similar to the state space equations for the Kalman filter. If the functions ''g'' and ''h'' in the above example are linear, and if both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are [[Gaussian]], the Kalman filter finds the exact Bayesian filtering distribution.  If not, Kalman filter based methods are a first-order approximation ([[Extended Kalman filter|EKF]]) or a second-order approximation (UKF in general, but if probability distribution is Gaussian a third-order approximation is possible).\n\nThe assumption that the initial distribution and the transitions of the Markov chain are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure can be relaxed. To design a particle filter we simply need to assume that we can sample the transitions <math>X_{k-1} \\to X_k</math> of the Markov chain <math>X_k,</math> and to compute the likelihood function <math>x_k\\mapsto p(y_k|x_k)</math> (see for instance the genetic selection mutation description of the particle filter given below). The absolutely continuous assumption on the Markov transitions of <math>X_k</math> are only used to derive in an informal (and rather abusive) way different formulae between posterior distributions using the Bayes' rule for conditional densities.\n\n=== Approximate Bayesian computation models ===\n{{main|Approximate Bayesian computation}}\nIn some problems, the conditional distribution of the observations given the random states of the signal may fail to have a density or may be impossible or too complex to compute.<ref name=\":PFOBC\"/> In this situation, we need to resort to an additional level of approximation. One strategy is to replace the signal <math>X_k</math> by the Markov chain <math>\\mathcal X_k=\\left(X_k,Y_k\\right)</math> and to introduce a virtual observation of the form\n\n:<math>\\mathcal Y_k=Y_k+\\epsilon \\mathcal V_k\\quad\\mbox{for some parameter}\\quad\\epsilon\\in [0,1]</math>\n\nfor some sequence of independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s. The central idea is to observe that\n\n:<math>\\text{Law}\\left(X_k|\\mathcal Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, \\mathcal Y_k=y_k\\right)\\approx_{\\epsilon\\downarrow 0} \\text{Law}\\left(X_k|Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, Y_k=y_k\\right)</math>\n\nThe particle filter associated with the Markov process <math>\\mathcal X_k=\\left(X_k,Y_k\\right)</math> given the partial observations <math>\\mathcal Y_0=y_0,\\cdots, \\mathcal Y_k=y_k,</math> is defined in terms of particles evolving in <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x+d_y}</math> with a likelihood function given with some obvious abusive notation by <math>p(\\mathcal Y_k|\\mathcal X_k)</math>. These probabilistic techniques are closely related to [[Approximate Bayesian Computation]] (ABC).

From the probabilistic point of view they coincide with a [[Mean field particle methods|mean field particle]] interpretation of the nonlinear filtering equation. The updating-prediction transitions of the optimal filter evolution can also be interpreted as the classical genetic type selection-mutation transitions of individuals. The sequential importance resampling technique provides another interpretation of the filtering transitions coupling importance sampling with the bootstrap resampling step. Last, but not least, particle filters can be seen as an acceptance-rejection methodology equipped with a recycling mechanism.<ref name=\"dp13\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== [[Mean field particle methods|Mean field particle simulation]] ===\n{{Technical|section|date=June 2017}}\n\n==== The general probabilistic principle ====\nThe nonlinear filtering evolution can be interpreted as a dynamical system in the set of probability measures of the following form <math>\\eta_{n+1}=\\Phi_{n+1}\\left(\\eta_{n}\\right)</math> where <math>\\Phi_{n+1}</math> stands for some mapping from the set of probability distribution into itself.

However, these methods do not perform well when applied to very high-dimensional systems.\n\nParticle filters update their prediction in an approximate (statistical) manner. The samples from the distribution are represented by a set of particles; each particle has a likelihood weight assigned to it that represents the probability of that particle being sampled from the probability density function. Weight disparity leading to weight collapse is a common issue encountered in these filtering algorithms; however it can be mitigated by including a resampling step before the weights become too uneven.

In [[computational physics]] and [[molecular chemistry]] they are used to solve Feynman-Kac path integration problems, or they compute Boltzmann-Gibbs measures, top eigenvalues and ground states of [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|Schr\u00f6dinger]] operators. In [[Biology]] and [[Genetics]] they also represent the evolution of a population of individuals or genes in some environment.\n\nThe origins of mean field type evolutionary computational techniques can be traced to 1950 and 1954 with the seminal work of [[Alan Turing]] on genetic type mutation-selection learning machines<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Turing|first1 = Alan M.|title = Computing machinery and intelligence|journal = Mind|volume = LIX|issue = 238|pages = 433\u2013460|doi = 10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433 |date = October 1950}}</ref> and the articles by [[Nils Aall Barricelli]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite journal|last = Barricelli|first = Nils Aall|year = 1954|authorlink = Nils Aall Barricelli|title = Esempi numerici di processi di evoluzione|journal = Methodos|pages = 45\u201368}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last = Barricelli|first = Nils Aall|year = 1957|authorlink = Nils Aall Barricelli|title = Symbiogenetic evolution processes realized by artificial methods|journal = Methodos|pages = 143\u2013182}}</ref> The first trace of particle filters in [[Statistics|statistical methodology]] dates back to the mid-1950s; the 'Poor Man's Monte Carlo',<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Poor Man's Monte Carlo |journal = Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

The particle filter is designed for a [[hidden Markov Model]], where the system consists of both hidden and observable variables. The observable variables (observation process) are related to the hidden variables (state-process) by some functional form that is known. Similarly the dynamical system describing the evolution of the state variables is also known probabilistically.\n\nA generic particle filter estimates the posterior distribution of the hidden states using the observation measurement process. Consider a state-space shown in the diagram below.\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cccccccccc}\nX_0&\\to &X_1&\\to &X_2&\\to&X_3&\\to &\\cdots&\\text{signal}\\\\\n\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\downarrow&&\\cdots&\\\\\nY_0&&Y_1&&Y_2&&Y_3&&\\cdots&\\text{observation}\n\\end{array}</math>\n \nThe filtering problem is to estimate '''sequentially''' the values of the hidden states <math>X_k</math>, given the values of the observation process <math>Y_0,\\cdots,Y_k,</math> at any time step ''k''.\n\nAll Bayesian estimates of <math>X_k</math> follow from the [[Posterior probability|posterior density]]  ''p''(''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>). The particle filter methodology provides an approximation of these conditional probabilities using the empirical measure associated with a genetic type particle algorithm.  In contrast, the [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|MCMC]] or [[importance sampling]] approach would model the full posterior ''p''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''x''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''x''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;|&nbsp;''y''<sub>0</sub>,''y''<sub>1</sub>,\u2026,''y''<sub>''k''</sub>).\n\n===The Signal-Observation Model===\nParticle methods often assume <math>X_k</math> and the observations <math>Y_k</math> can be modeled in this form:\n\n*<math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> is a [[Markov process]] on <math>\\mathbb R^{d_x}</math> (for some <math>d_x\\geqslant 1</math>) that evolves according to the transition probability density <math>p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>. This model is also often written in a synthetic way as \n*:<math>X_k|X_{k-1}=x_k \\sim p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math>\n:with an initial probability density <math>p(x_0)</math>.\n*The observations <math>Y_0, Y_1, \\cdots</math>  take values in some state space on <math>\\mathbb{R}^{d_y}</math> (for some <math>d_y\\geqslant 1</math>) and are conditionally independent provided that <math>X_0, X_1, \\cdots</math> are known. In other words, each <math>Y_k</math> only depends on <math>X_k</math>. In addition, we assume conditional distribution for <math>Y_k</math> given <math>X_k=x_k</math> are absolutely continuous, and in a synthetic way we have\n*:<math>Y_k|X_k=y_k \\sim p(y_k|x_k)</math>\nAn example of system with these properties is:\n\n:<math>X_k = g(X_{k-1}) + W_{k-1}</math>\n:<math>Y_k = h(X_k) + V_k</math>\n\nwhere both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are mutually independent sequences with known [[probability density function]]s and ''g'' and ''h'' are known functions. These two equations can be viewed as [[state space (controls)|state space]] equations and look similar to the state space equations for the Kalman filter. If the functions ''g'' and ''h'' in the above example are linear, and if both <math>W_k</math> and <math>V_k</math> are [[Gaussian]], the Kalman filter finds the exact Bayesian filtering distribution.  If not, Kalman filter based methods are a first-order approximation ([[Extended Kalman filter|EKF]]) or a second-order approximation (UKF in general, but if probability distribution is Gaussian a third-order approximation is possible).\n\nThe assumption that the initial distribution and the transitions of the Markov chain are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure can be relaxed. To design a particle filter we simply need to assume that we can sample the transitions <math>X_{k-1} \\to X_k</math> of the Markov chain <math>X_k,</math> and to compute the likelihood function <math>x_k\\mapsto p(y_k|x_k)</math> (see for instance the genetic selection mutation description of the particle filter given below).

The ''[[stratified sampling]]'' proposed by Kitagawa (1993<ref name=\"Kitagawa1993\"/>) is optimal in terms of variance.\n\nA single step of sequential importance resampling is as follows:\n\n:1) For <math>i=1,\\cdots,N</math> draw samples from the ''proposal distribution''\n:: <math>x^{(i)}_k \\sim \\pi(x_k|x^{(i)}_{0:k-1},y_{0:k})</math>\n\n:2) For <math>i=1,\\cdots,N</math> update the importance weights up to a normalizing constant:\n::<math>\\hat{w}^{(i)}_k = w^{(i)}_{k-1} \\frac{p(y_k|x^{(i)}_k) p(x^{(i)}_k|x^{(i)}_{k-1})} {\\pi(x_k^{(i)}|x^{(i)}_{0:k-1},y_{0:k})}.</math>\n: Note that when we use the transition prior probability distribution as the importance function, \n::<math> \\pi(x_k^{(i)}|x^{(i)}_{0:k-1},y_{0:k}) = p(x^{(i)}_k|x^{(i)}_{k-1}),</math>\n:this simplifies to the following :\n::<math> \\hat{w}^{(i)}_k = w^{(i)}_{k-1} p(y_k|x^{(i)}_k), </math>\n\n:3) For <math>i=1,\\cdots,N</math> compute the normalized importance weights:\n:: <math>w^{(i)}_k = \\frac{\\hat{w}^{(i)}_k}{\\sum_{j=1}^N \\hat{w}^{(j)}_k}</math>\n\n:4) Compute an estimate of the effective number of particles as\n:: <math>\\hat{N}_\\mathit{eff} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^N\\left(w^{(i)}_k\\right)^2} </math>\n:This criterion reflects the variance of the weights, other criteria can be found in the article,<ref name=\":0\"/> including their rigorous analysis and central limit theorems.\n\n:5) If the effective number of particles is less than a given threshold <math>\\hat{N}_\\mathit{eff} < N_{thr}</math>, then perform resampling:\n::a) Draw ''N'' particles from the current particle set with probabilities proportional to their weights. Replace the current particle set with this new one.\n::b) For <math>i=1,\\cdots,N</math> set <math>w^{(i)}_k = 1/N.</math>\n\nThe term ''Sampling Importance Resampling'' is also sometimes used when referring to SIR filters.\n\n=== Sequential importance sampling (SIS) ===\n* Is the same as sequential importance resampling, but without the resampling stage.\n\n=== \"direct version\" algorithm ===\n{{confusing section|date=October 2011}}\nThe \"direct version\" algorithm {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} is rather simple (compared to other particle filtering algorithms) and it uses composition and rejection. To generate a single sample ''x'' at ''k'' from <math>p_{x_k|y_{1:k}}(x|y_{1:k})</math>:\n\n:1) Set n=0 (This will count the number of particles generated so far)\n\n:2) [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|Uniformly]] choose an index i from the range <math>\\{1,..., N\\}</math>\n\n:3) Generate a test <math>\\hat{x}</math> from the distribution <math>p(x_k|x_{k-1})</math> with <math> x_{k-1}=x_{k-1|k-1}^{(i)}</math>\n\n:4) Generate the probability of <math>\\hat{y}</math> using <math>\\hat{x}</math> from <math>p(y_k|x_k),~\\mbox{with}~x_k=\\hat{x}</math> where <math>y_k</math> is the measured value\n\n:5) Generate another [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] u from <math>[0, m_k]</math> where <math>m_k = \\sup_{x_k} p(y_k|x_k) </math>\n\n:6) Compare u and <math>p\\left(\\hat{y}\\right)</math>\n\n::6a) If u is larger then repeat from step 2\n\n::6b) If u is smaller then save <math>\\hat{x}</math> as <math>x_{k|k}^{(i)}</math> and increment n\n\n:7) If n == N then quit\n\nThe goal is to generate P \"particles\" at ''k'' using only the particles from <math>k-1</math>. This requires that a Markov equation can be written (and computed) to generate a <math>x_k</math> based only upon <math>x_{k-1}</math>. This algorithm uses composition of the P particles from <math>k-1</math> to generate a particle at ''k'' and repeats (steps 2\u20136) until P particles are generated at ''k''.\n\nThis can be more easily visualized if ''x'' is viewed as a two-dimensional array. One dimension is ''k'' and the other dimensions is the particle number. For example, <math>x(k,i)</math> would be the i<sup>th</sup> particle at <math>k</math> and can also be written <math>x_k^{(i)}</math> (as done above in the algorithm). Step 3 generates a ''potential'' <math>x_k</math> based on a randomly chosen particle (<math>x_{k-1}^{(i)}</math>) at time <math>k-1</math> and rejects or accepts it in step 6. In other words, the <math>x_k</math> values are generated using the previously generated <math>x_{k-1}</math>.\n\n==Other particle filters==\n* [[Exponential Natural Particle Filter]]<ref name=\"xnpf2015\">{{cite arXiv\n | author = Zand, G.\n | author2= Taherkhani, M. |author3=Safabakhsh, R. \n | year = 2015\n | title = Exponential Natural Particle Filter\n | eprint = 1511.06603\n| class= cs.LG }}</ref>\n* [[Auxiliary particle filter]]<ref name=\"apf1999\">{{cite journal\n | author = Pitt, M.K.\n |author2=Shephard, N.\n | year = 1999\n | title = Filtering Via Simulation: Auxiliary Particle Filters\n | journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association\n | volume = 94\n | issue = 446\n | pages = 590\u2013591\n | url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5002321997 \n | accessdate = 2008-05-06\n | doi = 10.2307/2670179\n | jstor = 2670179\n }}</ref>\n* [[Regularized auxiliary particle filter]]<ref name=\"jliu2011\">{{cite journal\n | author = Liu, J.\n |author2=Wang, W. |author3=Ma, F. \n | year = 2011\n | title = A Regularized Auxiliary Particle Filtering Approach for System State Estimation and Battery Life Prediction\n | journal = Smart Materials and Structures\n | volume = 20\n | issue = 7\n | pages = 1\u20139\n | doi = 10.1088/0964-1726/20/7/075021\n| bibcode = 2011SMaS...20g5021L}}</ref>\n* Gaussian particle filter\n* Unscented particle filter\n* Gauss\u2013Hermite particle filter\n* Cost Reference particle filter\n* Hierarchical/Scalable particle filter<ref name=\"Canton2011\">{{cite journal\n | author = Canton-Ferrer, C.\n |author2=Casas, J.R. |author3=Pard\u00e0s, M. \n | year = 2011\n | title = Human Motion Capture Using Scalable Body Models\n | journal = Computer Vision and Image Understanding\n | volume = 115\n | issue = 10\n | pages = 1363\u20131374\n | doi = 10.1016/j.cviu.2011.06.001\n |hdl=2117/13393 }}</ref>\n* Rao\u2013Blackwellized particle filter<ref name=\"rbpf1999\"/>\n* [[Rejection sampling|Rejection-sampling]] based optimal particle filter<ref name=\"optrj2008\">{{cite conference\n| citeseerx           = 10.1.1.190.7092\n| title         = An Optimal Filtering Algorithm for Non-Parametric Observation Models in Robot Localization\n| author        = Blanco, J.L. |author2=Gonzalez, J. |author3=Fernandez-Madrigal, J.A.\n| year          = 2008\n| conference    = IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA'08)\n| pages         = 461\u2013466\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"optrj2010\">{{cite journal\n| title         = Optimal Filtering for Non-Parametric Observation Models: Applications to Localization and SLAM\n| author        = Blanco, J.L. |author2=Gonzalez, J. |author3=Fernandez-Madrigal, J.A.\n| year          = 2010\n| journal       = The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)\n| volume        = 29\n| number        = 14\n| pages         = 1726\u20131742\n| doi           = 10.1177/0278364910364165\n| citeseerx         = 10.1.1.1031.4931\n}}\n</ref>\n* Feynman-Kac and mean field particle methodologies<ref name=\"dm962\"/><ref name=\"dp13\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n* Particle Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, see e.g. [[Pseudo-Marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mean field particle methods]]\n* [[Genetic algorithm]]\n* [[Ensemble Kalman filter]]\n* [[Generalized filtering]]\n* [[Moving horizon estimation]]\n* [[Recursive Bayesian estimation]]\n* [[Monte Carlo localization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Del Moral | first1 = Pierre | year = 1996 | title = Non Linear Filtering: Interacting Particle Solution | url = http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~peterdel-moral/mprfs.pdf | journal = Markov Processes and Related Fields | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 555\u2013580 }}\n* Del Moral, Pierre (2004).

It is spoken in what is now [[British Columbia]], ranging from southeastern [[Vancouver Island]] from the west shore of [[Saanich Inlet]] northward beyond [[Gabriola Island]] and [[Nanaimo]] to [[Nanoose Bay]] and including the [[Lower Mainland]] from the [[Fraser River]] Delta upriver to [[Harrison Lake]] and the lower boundary of the [[Fraser Canyon]].\n\nIn the classification of [[Salishan languages]], Halkomelem  is a member of the Central Salish branch.  There are four other branches of the family: Tsamosan, Interior Salish, Bella Coola, and Tillamook.  Speakers of the Central and Tsamosan languages are often identified in ethnographic literature as \"[[Coast Salish languages|Coast Salish]]\".\n\nThe word ''Halkomelem'' is an [[anglicization]] for the language Hul'qumi'num, which has three distinct [[dialect]] groups:\n\n# an Island group, spoken by separate but closely related First Nations on [[Vancouver Island]] and adjoining islands on the west side of the [[Strait of Georgia]]: the [[Snuneymuxw First Nation|Snuneymuxw]] (Nanaimo), Nanoose, [[Stz'uminus First Nation|Stz'uminus]] (Chemainus), [[Cowichan Tribes|Cowichan]], [[Halalt First Nation|Halalt]], Lake Cowichan, [[Lyackson First Nation|Lyackson]], [[Penelakut]],<ref>[http://www.hulquminum.bc.ca/ Hul'quim'num Treaty Group]</ref> and [[Hwlitsum First Nation|Lamalchi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Be of Good Mind, Essays on the Coast Salish|last=Granville Miller|first=Bruce|publisher=UBC Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7748-13242|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=132}}</ref>\n# a Downriver group, spoken by the [[Musqueam Indian Band|Musqueam]], [[Tsawwassen First Nation|Tsawwassen]], Kwantlen, Tsleil-Waututh, Qayqayt, Kwikwetlem, and Katzie.\n# an Upriver group, the Upper [[Sto:lo]], spoken from the Matsqui First Nation on upstream to [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]], Sumas, Chilliwack, Pilalt, and Tait.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fort Langley Journals, 1827-30|last=MacLachlan|first=Morag|publisher=UBC Press|year=1998|isbn=0-7748-0664-8|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=168}}</ref>\n\nThe language differences (namely, in phonology and lexicon) are greatest between the Island and Upriver dialects, with the Downriver dialect (especially the Tsawwassen First Nation) providing a central link between the other two.  The diversity of the Halkomelem dialects is noted to be the result of complex social and economic forces and linguistic change, as many Island people crossed the Georgia Strait to camp along the Fraser River (in both the Downriver and Upriver areas) for the summer runs of salmon.  Arranged marriages between children in different language areas was also common, helping to establish a regional social network in the Strait of Georgia\u2013[[Puget Sound]] Basin.\n\n==Use and revitalization efforts==\nThe Halkomelem language is near extinction.  In 2000, it was estimated that the number of fluent Halkomelem speakers was less than one dozen.  Most are middle-aged or older, and few are monolingual, as there was a flood of English-speaking settlers in the region in the mid-nineteenth century.  Language programs at the [[St\u00f3:l\u014d Nation]], [[Seabird Island First Nation]], and [[Cowichan First Nation]] have been developed to save the language. A program aimed at adults at [[Musqueam]] is a collaboration between the band and the [[University of British Columbia]] First Nations and endangered languages programme.\n\nIn September 2009, The [[University of California Press]] published linguist Brent Galloway's ''Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem''.<ref>{{cite book\n| publisher = University of California\n| last = Galloway\n| first = Brent D.\n| title = Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem\n| series = UC Publications in Linguistics, 141\n| accessdate = 2015-10-24\n| date = 2009\n| url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/65r158r4\n}}</ref>\n\nA Halkomelem [[iPhone]] app was released in 2011,<ref>{{Cite web\n| last = Hul\n| first = Stephen\n| title = FirstVoices apps bring B.C.

Relevant differences in the [[phonology]] of the Island and Upriver dialects are noted at the foot of the [[phoneme]] charts.\n\n===Vowels===\nh\u0259n\u0313q\u0313\u0259min\u0313\u0259m\u0313 has five vowel phonemes.  Long and short vowels (but not schwa) contrast.  Vowel length is written in the native orthography as {{angle bracket|\u00b7}}.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | &nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Front vowel|Front]]&nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Central vowel|Central]]&nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | &nbsp;[[Back vowel|Back]] (rounded)&nbsp;\n|-\n! &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Short]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;[[Vowel length|Long]]&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Short&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Long&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Short&nbsp;\n! &nbsp;Long&nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[High vowel|High]]'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPAlink|i}}\n| align=center | {{IPAlink|i\u02d0}} {{angle bracket|i\u00b7}}\n| align=center | \n| align=center | \n| align=center | {{IPAlink|u}}\n| align=center | {{IPAlink|u\u02d0}} {{angle bracket|u\u00b7}}\n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Mid vowel|Mid]]'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | {{IPAlink|e}}\n| align=center | {{IPAlink|e\u02d0}} {{angle bracket|e\u00b7}}\n| align=center | {{IPAlink|\u0259}}\n| align=center | \n| align=center | \n| align=center | \n|-\n| &nbsp;'''[[Low vowel|Low]]'''&nbsp;\n| align=center | \n| align=center | \n| align=center | {{IPAlink|a}}\n| align=center | {{IPAlink|a\u02d0}} {{angle bracket|a\u00b7}}\n| align=center | \n| align=center | \n|}\nFour of these vowel phonemes (/i/, /e/, /a/, and /\u0259/) are common, while /u/ occurs mainly in loan words.\n\nAll five vowel phonemes vary considerably phonetically. The phoneme /i/ has three distinct allophones. It is realized as {{IPA|[e]}} following unrounded uvulars. It is realized as {{IPA|[\u026a]}} with a central off-glide preceding both unrounded and rounded uvulars. Elsewhere, it is realized as low {{IPA|[i]}} or high {{IPA|[e]}}. The /e/ is realized as a low to mid-front vowel, usually between {{IPA|[\u025b]}} or high {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}. The /a/ is low and central to back, often close to {{IPA|[\u0251]}}. The /u/ is high, back, and rounded, realized somewhere between low {{IPA|[u]}} or high {{IPA|[o]}}.\n\nWhen stressed, the schwa /\u0259/ appears in most environments as a mid-central, but it is fronted and raised before /x/, approaching {{IPA|[\u026a]}}; before /j/ it is also fronted, approaching {{IPA|[\u025b]}}; before /w/ it is lower and back, approaching {{IPA|[\u0251]}}; and before rounded velars it is mid-back, close to {{IPA|[o]}}.  Unstressed /\u0259/ can be as high as {{IPA|[i]}} before /x/ and /j/, and before labialized velars it is realized as {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[u]}}.  This phoneme can also be assimilated to a stressed /e/ or a stressed /a/ in an adjacent syllable, by vowel harmony.\n\n===Consonants===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2|\n! align=\"center\"|[[Bilabial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alv.]] [[Sibilant consonant|sibilant]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Lateral consonant|Lateral]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Labialisation|Labialized Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Labialisation|Labialized Uvular]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! rowspan=3|[[Plosive]]{{ref|1|1}}\n! <small>[[Voiceless consonant|voiceless]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''p''' {{IPAblink|p}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''t\u03b8''' {{IPAblink|t\u03b8}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''t''' {{IPAblink|t}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''c''' {{IPAblink|ts}}\n| \n| align=\"center\"|'''\u010d''' {{IPAblink|t\u0361\u0283}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''k''' {{IPAblink|k}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''k\u02b7''' {{IPAblink|k\u02b7}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''q''' {{IPAblink|q}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''q\u02b7''' {{IPAblink|q\u02b7}}\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! <small>[[ejective]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''p\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|p\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''t\u02bc\u03b8''' {{IPAblink|t\u03b8\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''t\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|t\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''c\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|ts\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u019b\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|t\u026c\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|'''k\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|k\u02bc}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''k\u02bc\u02b7''' {{IPA|[k\u02b7\u02bc]}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''q\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|q\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''q\u02bc\u02b7''' {{IPA|[q\u02b7\u02bc]}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u0294''' {{IPAblink|\u0294}}\n|-\n!<small> [[Voiced consonant|voiced]]{{ref|3|3}}</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''b''' {{IPAblink|b}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''d''' {{IPAblink|d}}\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''j''' {{IPAblink|d\u0361\u0292}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=1|[[Fricative]]\n! <small>[[Voiceless consonant|voiceless]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''f''' {{IPAblink|f}}{{ref|3|3}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u03b8''' {{IPAblink|\u03b8}}\n| \n| align=\"center\"|'''s''' {{IPAblink|s}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u026c''' {{IPAblink|\u026c}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u0161''' {{IPAblink|\u0283}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''x''' {{IPAblink|x}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''x\u02b7''' {{IPAblink|x\u02b7}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''x\u030c''' {{IPAblink|\u03c7}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''x\u030c\u02b7''' {{IPAblink|\u03c7\u02b7}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''h''' {{IPAblink|h}}\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Sonorant|Resonant]]\n! <small>[[Voiced consonant|voiced]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''m''' {{IPAblink|m}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''n''' {{IPAblink|n}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''l''' {{IPAblink|l}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''y''' {{IPAblink|j}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''w''' {{IPAblink|w}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''r''' {{IPAblink|\u0280}}{{ref|3|3}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Glottalization|glottalized]]{{ref|4|4}}</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''m\u0313''' {{IPA|[m\u02c0]}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''n\u0313''' {{IPA|[n\u02c0]}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''l\u0313''' {{IPA|[l\u02c0]}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''y\u0313''' {{IPA|[j\u02c0]}}\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|'''w\u0313''' {{IPA|[w\u02c0]}}\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\n\n:{{note|1|1}} The stops and affricates are grouped together for simplification purposes.\n:{{note|2|2}} Of recent and/or peripheral phonemic status.\n:{{note|3|3}} Occur only in a few foreign and imitative words.\n:{{note|4|4}} The five glottalized resonants pose a problem in phonemic analysis (although they occur frequently).\n\nThe plain plosives are less [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirate]] before vowels than in English, but they are more aspirate finally.  Although the glottalized plosives are [[ejective]]s, they are not usually strongly released.\n\nSuttles (2004) made several interesting notes on the Musqueam [[obstruent]]s.  The labiodental fricative /f/ occurs in recent loans from English and their derivatives such as in ''k\u00e1fi'' \"coffee\" and in ''\u010d\u00edf'' \"chief.\"  According to Suttles (2004), the stops /t/ and /t\u02bc/ are articulated at a point slightly forward of that of the usual English \"t\" and \"d,\" while the affricates /c/ and /c\u02bc/ are somewhat more retracted than these English phonemes.  The affricate {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292]}} has only been recorded in {{lang|hur|kinj\u00e1j}} \"Englishmen\" and {{lang|hur|kinj\u00e1jq\u0259n}} \"English (language).\" The glottalized lateral affricate /\u019b\u02bc/ {{IPA|[t\u02bc\u026c]}} is produced when the apex of the [[tongue]] at the [[Syllable onset|onset]] is in the position for the lateral release rather than for a /t/, and there is less friction produced than with other affricates.  The phonemes /k/ and /k\u02bc/ occur in \"baby talk\" as substitutes for /q/ and /q\u02bc/.  The uvular fricative /x\u030c/ {{IPA|[\u03c7]}} is produced with a great deal of friction and/or uvular vibration, and it contrasts strongly with the velar fricative /x/.\n\nThere is variation in the extent to which Musqueam speakers glottalize resonants.  Phonetically, there are glottalized resonants and resonants preceded or followed by glottal stops, however, Suttles (2004) found no instances of [[contrastive distribution]] among any of the three.  He puts forth two explanations for these facts: that there are two sequences of phonemes, /R\u0294/ and /\u0294R/, with overlapping {{IPA|[R\u02c0]}} allophones, or that there is a single phoneme {{IPA|/R\u02c0/}} that is realized in three distinct ways.  In preferring the latter explanation, Suttles holds that there may be five glottalized resonant phonemes in the dialect, although Downriver speakers glottalize resonants very lightly, making them difficult to detect.\n\nIn most Upriver dialects, glottalized resonants do not exist, while in Island dialects, they are more sharply articulated ([[tenseness]] is a key feature of Island speech).  As is the case with many other phonological features, Downriver Halkomelem stands as a link between the other dialect areas, and it is possible that its speakers vary depending on Island or Upriver influence.  Other differences between dialects include: Island and Downriver have both /n/ and /l/, while Upriver has merged these as /l/.  Upriver lacks the post-vocalic glottal stops of the other two dialects, and vowel length usually appears in that environment for speakers of that dialect.  Additionally, Upriver dialects have greater [[pitch accent|pitch]] differences, and some words are differentiated by pitch alone.\n\n===Stress and pitch===\nBased on Suttles' (2004) recordings of several speakers of the Downriver (Musqueam) dialect, [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] in Halkomelem consists of an increase in intensity and an accompanying rise in [[pitch accent|pitch]].  The three levels of stress are primary (marked /\u05f3/), secondary (marked /`/), and weak (unmarked).  There is one vowel with primary stress in every full word, however, its occurrence is not completely predictable.\n\nIn un[[inflection|inflected]] words with more than one [[vowel]], the primary stress usually falls on the first vowel (e.g. as in ''c\u00e9l\u0259x'' \"hand\" and ''l\u00e9l\u0259m\u02bc'' \"house\").  There are exceptions to this general pattern (e.g. as in ''x\u0259m\u00e9n'' \"enemy\").  As shown by the preceding example, if the word contains both a full vowel and one or more schwas, the stress is placed on the full vowel.  Again, there are exceptions to this pattern, such as in words with a final [[glottal stop]] that cannot be preceded by [[schwa]] (e.g. as in ''n\u0259\u0301c\u02bca\u0294'' \"one\").\n\nAlthough [[minimal pair]]s contrasting stress are rare, they do exist in the language.  The primary stress of a verb root consisting of a resonant, a schwa, and an [[obstruent]] followed by the [[suffix]] /-t/ \"[[transitivity (grammar)|transitive]]\" can fall on either the root or the suffix, allowing for minimal pairs such as ''m\u0259\u0300k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259t'' \"salvage it\" and ''m\u0259k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259\u0301t'' \"finish it all.\"\n\nThe secondary stress appears most often in words that are composed of a root that has retained its stress and a stressed suffix (e.g. as in ''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259\u03b8\u00e0mx'' \"help me\").  It may be the case, however, that the secondary stress recorded by Suttles (2004) in words like ''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259\u03b8\u00e0mx'' is actually a falling pitch; this seems to be characteristic of the last stressed syllable of a phrase in the language.  Additional analyses of the sentential [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] patterns are needed.\n\n===Phonotactics===\nAll obstruents (except the glottals) typically follow one another in sequences of up to four, although a sequence of five is also possible (e.g. as in ''tx\u02b7stx\u030c\u02b7\u00e1s\u0294al'' \"just standing in shock\").  There are no specific restrictions on the types of obstruent sequences that can occur.  [[Plosive]]s appearing in sequences are rearticulated, and sequences of /ss/ are common in the language.\n\n[[Sonorant|Resonants]] only appear adjacent to vowels.  When these sounds occur in the middle of words, they are found in sequences of resonant-obstruent, resonant-resonant, and obstruent-resonant.  An initial resonant is always followed a vowel, and a final resonant must be preceded by one.\n\nThe [[Glottal consonants|laryngeals]] are more restricted than members of the other natural classes in Halkomelem.  The glottal stop occurs only adjacent to a vowel, and, within words, it does not follow any obstruent except (the prefix) /s/.  It can never occur in final position following a [[schwa]].  /h/ occurs only before vowels, following a resonant or one of the [[fricative]]s at morpheme boundaries, but never following other obstruents.  It can appear between an unstressed and a stressed vowel, but it cannot occur between a stressed and an unstressed vowel.\n\n===Morphophonemics===\nCertain processes affect the realization of underlying sounds in Halkomelem.  Alternations that occur fairly commonly are discussed in this section, rather than in the following section on [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].\n*In rapid speech, there is optional [[Elision|loss]] of some instances of schwa, glottal stop, glottalization of resonants, and /h/.\n**An unstressed schwa following an initial nasal stop may be lost, if there is a vowel preceding; the nasal is sometimes heard as part of that syllable (e.g. as in ''t\u0259n\u0259m\u00e9n'' ~ ''t\u0259n m\u00e9n'' \"my father\").\n**/n\u0259/ with no preceding vowel sometimes appears as syllabic {{IPA|[n]}} (e.g. as in ''x\u02b7n\u0259c\u02bc\u00e1w\u0259\u03b8'' ~ ''x\u02b7nc\u02bc\u00e1w\u0259\u03b8'' \"one kind\").\n**A glottal stop after an unstressed final vowel may be lost, in which case the vowel will be reduced to a schwa (e.g. as in ''m\u00e9qe\u0294'' ~ ''m\u00e9q\u0259'').\n**The glottalization of resonants following unstressed vowels is often inaudible (e.g. as in ''sm\u0259n\u02bc\u00e9\u00b7m'' ~ ''sm\u0259n\u00e9\u00b7m'' \"descendants\").\n**/h/ before a stressed vowel may be lost when preceded by a spirant (e.g. as in ''sh\u00e1\u00b7y\u02bc'' ~ ''s\u00e1\u00b7y\u02bc'' \"finished\").\n*An unstressed schwa may take on the quality of an adjacent full vowel, or one that is separated from it by a glottal stop (e.g. as in ''sp\u00e9\u0294\u0259\u03b8'' ~ ''sp\u00e9\u0294e\u03b8'' \"black bear\").\n*When a root with the shape of /CAR\u02c0/ (C is any consonant, A is a full vowel, R\u02c0 is a glottalized resonant), takes the suffix /-\u0259t/ \"transitive,\" the resulting form is /CA\u0294\u0259Rt/.  It appears that the resonant and schwa have switched positions (a form of [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]), but the glottal stop protects the schwa from [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilating]] to the full vowel (e.g. as in ''w\u00edl\u02bc'' \"appear\" and ''w\u00ed\u0294\u0259lt'' \"make it appear\").\n*Several roots appear alone, without having undergone [[affixation]] (e.g. as in ''\u0294\u00ed'' \"big\" and ''p\u00e1'' \"get blown on\").  When this type of root is followed by a [[suffix]] that begins with a stressed vowel, (e.g. as in /-\u00edn\u0259s/ \"chest\"), an /h/ appears (e.g. as in ''\u03b8\u0259h\u00edn\u0259s'' \"barrel-chested\").  A final /h/ is never realized after a stressed vowel.\n*A number of suffixes beginning with /n/ have forms with initial /l/ when they are added to a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] or [[Word stem|stem]] ending in /l/ (i.e. there is [[Alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] of /n/ and /l/ in certain morphological cases in this language) (e.g. as in /-n\u0259x\u02b7/ ~ /-l\u0259x\u02b7/ \"limited control\" in ''\u026c\u0259\u0301q\u02bc\u0259ll\u0259x\u02b7'' \"know it\" and ''c\u0259\u0301llex\u02b7'' \"catch up with him\").\n*In the [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] and [[resultative]] forms of few verbs with initial /c/ or /x/ followed by /a/, the /c/ is [[Reduplication|reduplicated]] as /k\u02b7/ and the /x/ as /x\u02b7/ (e.g. as in ''c\u00e1m'' \"go/come inland\" and its progressive ''c\u00e1k\u02b7\u0259m'' \"be going/coming inland\").\n*[[Vowel gradation]] often occurs between a full vowel, schwa, and zero, depending on the type of root or stem, type of suffix, and placement of stress.\n*When some suffixes are joined with stems, a change in the quality of the stressed [[Vowel quality|vowel]], from one full vowel to another, in the stem, or (rarely) in the suffix results.  The vowel mutations are the product of the assimilation of one vowel to that of an adjacent [[syllable]] at an earlier stage in the language's [[Historical linguistics|history]].  Three kinds of these mutations exist (although only the first example is common).  In the first two examples, the vowel mutation is similar to the [[Germanic umlaut|umlauting]] effect of a suffix on stems in Germanic languages.\n**Stem /e/ changes to /a/ (e.g. as in ''x\u02b7\u019b\u02bc\u00e1qt\u0259s'' \"long-faced\" [''\u019b\u02bc\u00e9qt'' \"long\"]).\n**Stem /a/ to /e/ (e.g. as in ''p\u00e9\u00b7lt\u02bc\u03b8e\u0294'' \"buzzard (turkey vulture),\" which is composed of ''sp\u00e1\u00b7l'' \"raven\" and the suffix /-it\u03b8e\u0294/ \"clothing, blanket\" [with metathesis]).\n**Suffix /e/ to /a/ (e.g. as in ''sq\u02bc\u0259q\u02bc\u0259x\u00e1n'' \"partner,\" which is composed of ''sq\u02bc\u0259q\u02bc\u00e1\u0294'' \"accompanying\" and the suffix /-x\u0259n/ ~ /-x\u00e9n/ \"foot\").\n\n==Morphology<ref>Suttles, Wayne. (2004), 23\u201330.</ref>==\nLike the majority of [[Salishan languages]], Halkomelem is [[polysynthetic]].  A word in Halkomelem may consist of a root standing alone and unaltered, or of a root altered by one or more processes of internal modification and/or accompanied by one or more affixes.  Since all words (with the exception of a few adverbs) can function as [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] heads, there is no basis for distinguishing verbs, nouns, and adjectives.  There are other bases, however, for distinguishing these classes.  Verbs have [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] forms and do not take [[Possessive case|possessive]] affixes, while nouns do not have progressive forms and do take possessive affixes.  Adjectives have neither progressive forms, nor do they take possessive affixes.  [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] is non-existent in the language, although some scholars believe to have found a few possible examples.\n\nThe majority of verb roots have the shapes CAC, C\u0259C, C\u0259CC, while noun roots typically have the shape CVCVC (V is any vowel).  The most common shapes of adjective roots are C\u0259C and CAC.  There is a prefix that nominalizes verbs and adjectives, and there are several prefixes that make verbs out of nouns.  Additionally, there are several ways to make adjective-like words from nouns.  Processes of internal modification of the root include [[reduplication]] (of initial CV and CVC), shift in stress and vowel grade, and [[glottalization]] of resonants (which also affects suffixes).  Roots of different shapes often undergo different processes to produce forms that are grammatically identical.\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs roots are identified as [[Perfective aspect|perfective]], as opposed to progressive, aspect.\n* Perfective {{lang|hur|s\u0259\u0300q\u02bc}} \"split, tear\"\n* Progressive {{lang|hur|s\u0259s\u0259\u0300q\u02bc}} \"be splitting, be tearing\"\nSeveral verbs also have a [[durative aspect]], which can occur in both forms.\n* Perfective {{lang|hur|q\u02bc\u00edk\u02bc\u02b7\u0259t}} \"bite it\"\n* Progressive {{lang|hur|q\u02bc\u00edq\u02bc\u0259k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259t}} \"be biting it\"\nA number also have an iterative-dispositional aspect.  For a few of these verb roots, this aspect can appear in both a progressive and in a perfective form.\n*{{lang|hur|s\u0259\u0301q\u02bcs\u0259q\u02bc}} \"easy to split\"\nThe majority of verbs have a [[resultative]] form which is adjective-like and does not carry a progressive-perfective distinction.\n*{{lang|hur|ss\u0259s\u00edq\u02bc}} \"split, torn\"\n*{{lang|hur|sk\u02bc\u02b7\u0259k\u02bc\u02b7\u00ed\u026c}} \"spilled, capsized\"\nThe [[Plural verb|plural]] can be optionally marked in all of these forms.  The [[diminutive]] is also marked, optionally, in only the progressive and resultative aspects.\n\n===Nouns===\nIt is possible to internally modify noun roots in Halkomelem for the plural, the diminutive, and the diminutive plural.  Compare:\n*{{lang|hur|c\u00e9l\u0259x}} \"hand\"\n*{{lang|hur|c\u0259lc\u00e9l\u0259x}} \"hands\"\n*{{lang|hur|c\u00e9cl\u0259x}} \"little hand\"\n*{{lang|hur|c\u0259c\u00e9cl\u0259x}} \"little hands\"\nA few nouns may have resultative forms.  They do not have progressive forms, but they may be made into a verb with a verbalizing affix and then express this form.\n\n===Adjectives===\nSimilar to noun roots, adjective roots can be internally modified for plural, diminutive, and diminutive plural.  They can only have progressive forms if made into verbs by means of a verbalizing affix.\n*{{lang|hur|p\u02bc\u0259\u0301q\u02bc}} \"white\"\n*{{lang|hur|p\u02bc\u00e9p\u02bcq\u02bc}} \"white\" (PL)\nComplex adjectives are formed from adjective roots and lexical suffixes.\n*{{lang|hur|m\u00e1\u0294\u0259q\u02b7}} \"large bird\"\n\n===Affixes===\nHalkomelem contains [[prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es, and [[infix]]es.  All infixes of the language have been described in the preceding sections.  Affixes are typically divisible into [[inflectional]] or [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] and [[Function word|grammatical]] or [[Lexical items|lexical]] categories, depending on their involvement in paradigms and meaning, however, a number of Halkomelem affixes mix these categories.  Suttles (2004) identifies the following classes of suffixes and prefixes; a sampling of these affixes follow.\n\n*Non-personal affixes\n**Suffixes of the voice system\n***Transitive: /-t/ /-n\u0259x\u02b7/ /-x/ \"transitive\"\n***Intransitive: /-\u0259m/ \"intransitive,\" /-\u00e9ls/ \"activity\" (compare {{lang|hur|p\u0259\u0301n}} \"get buried,\" {{lang|hur|p\u0259\u0301n\u0259t}} \"bury it,\" {{lang|hur|p\u0259\u0301n\u0259m}} \"plant,\" and {{lang|hur|p\u0259\u0301n\u00e9ls}} \"bury something\")\n***Causative: /-st\u0259x\u02b7/ \"causative\"\n***Permissive: /-s/ \"let,\" as in \"let him go\" or \"let it be\"\n***Applicative: /-n\u0259s/ \"goal\" (e.g. as in {{lang|hur|n\u0259\u0294\u00e9mn\u0259s}} \"go after him\"), /-n\u00e9m/ \"go\"\n***Reflexive: /-\u03b8\u0259t/ \"oneself,\" /-n\u00e1m\u0259t/ \"oneself (limited control)\"\n***Reciprocal: /-t\u0259l\u02bc/ \"each other\"\n***Subordinate passive: /-\u0259t/ \"subordinate passive\"\n**Aspectual and modal affixes\n***Aspectual prefixes: /w\u0259-/ \"established,\" ''w\u0259\u026c-'' \"already\"\n***Modal suffixes: /-\u0259\u0301lm\u0259n/ \"want to, intend to, seem about to\"\n**Derivational affixes\n***Affixes with purely grammatical meaning\n****Nominalizing prefix: /s-/ \"nominalize (verbs and adjectives)\"\n***Verbalizing affixes (combine grammatical and lexical meaning): /c-/ \"get, make, do, go to,\" ''\u026c-'' \"partake of,\" /tx\u02b7-/ \"buy,\" /-\u00e0\u00b7l/ \"travel by\"\n***Lexical prefixes: /m\u0259-/ \"come,\" /t\u0259n-/ \"from\"\n***Lexical suffixes\n****Body parts: /-aq\u02b7/ \"head\"\n****Common artifacts: /-w\u0259t/ \"canoe\"\n****Natural phenomena: /-\u0259tp/ \"plant, tree\"\n*Personal affixes\n\n===Possessive affixes===\nThe following table lists the possessive affixes which appear in attributive possessive structures in Halkomelem.<ref>Galloway, Brent D. (1993). A Grammar of Upriver Halkomelem. London, UK: University of California Press.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Attached to word prior !! Attached to possessed head !!

Together with the appearance of affixes, possession also requires a structural component, in that the possessor of the head is found to the right of the head.  The possessor is always preceded by a determiner, although depending on the noun class, it can also appear with an [[oblique case]] marker. If the possessor is a common noun, it will be introduced by a determiner, but without an oblique case marker. If, however, the possessor is a proper noun, it must appear in the oblique case. Thus, it will be preceded by an oblique case marker, and the possessed noun will appear without a possessive affix. For proper nouns, the determiner and the oblique case marker are fused into a single particle. Marking common nouns with an oblique case marker results in an ungrammatical construction<ref>Gerdts, D.B. 1988. Object and Absolutive in Halkomelem Salish. New York, NY: Garland.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| k\u02b7\u03b8\u0259  sq\u02b7\u0259mey\u0294-s   \u026be     s\u026beni\u0294 || AUX   dog-3POS   DET   woman || 'the woman's dog'\n|-\n| k\u02b7\u03b8\u0259  puk\u02b7-s     \u026be    s\u026beni\u0294 || AUX   book-3POS  DET   woman || 'the woman's book'\n|-\n| k\u02b7\u03b8\u0259     sq\u02b7\u0259mey\u0294  \u0294\u0259-\u028e    John || DET  dog   OBL-DET  John || 'John's dog'\n|}\n\nMost verbs roots are [[semantic]]ally [[grammatical patient|patient]]-oriented (e.g. they have glosses like \"get hit\" or \"get washed\"), while few verbs are semantically [[grammatical agent|agent]]-oriented (e.g. \"look\" or \"see\").  All are grammatically [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]].  These relations are different with the suffixes of the [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] system.  A verb that is made up of an inactive root and an intransitive suffix is grammatically intransitive, but semantically active.  An inactive or active root that takes on a [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] suffix is grammatically transitive and takes an object.  The transitive suffix is the base for an object or passive person suffix.  Two of the most commonly used transitive suffixes distinguish actions performed with limited control or accidentally from those performed with full control or purposely.\n\n[[Aspectual verb|Aspectual]] prefixes, which precede predicate heads, have adverbial meaning and express temporal distinctions.  [[Modal verb|Modal]] suffixes follow the suffixes of the voice system and indicate desire or intention and search or arrangement.\n\nLexical suffixes can be related to verb roots as [[Object (grammar)|objects]], locus, or instruments; to adjective roots as noun [[Head (linguistics)|heads]]; and to noun roots as noun possessors or the noun heads of [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]].\n\nThe [[Grammatical person|personal affixes]] distinguish first, second, and third person in singular and plural.  There are neither [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual forms]] nor [[Clusivity|inclusive/exclusive]] distinctions in this language.  There is also a set of possessive affixes (prefixes for first and second person singular, suffixes for first-person plural and third person, and a combination of prefix and suffix for second-person plural).  This system will be covered, in detail, in the \"Syntax\" section.\n\n===Ordering of affixes===\n[[Derivation (linguistics)|Derivational]] prefixes and suffixes form an inner layer around the word root, while [[inflectional]] affixes form an outer layer around the root.  Among derivational affixes, those with lexical meaning stand closer to the root than those with purely grammatical meaning.  Among inflectional affixes, those of the voice and person systems stand closer to the root than the [[Aspectual verb|aspectual]] prefixes and [[Modal verb|modal]] suffixes.\n*{{lang|hur|x\u02b7q\u02b7\u00e9n\u0259ct\u0259s}}. \"[She] punches holes in the bottom of it.\"\n\n==Syntax<ref>Suttles, Wayne. (2004), 31\u201372.</ref>==\nIn Musqueam, a sentence minimally consists of a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].  Predicate [[head (linguistics)|heads]] can be bare [[root (linguistics)|roots]] (e.g. {{lang|hur|c\u00e1k\u02bc\u02b7}} \"far\"), derived forms (e.g. {{lang|hur|sp\u00e9\u0294e\u03b8}} \"black bar\"), inflected forms (e.g. {{lang|hur|c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259t}} \"help him/her/them\"), and forms including both [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] and [[inflectional]] affixes (e.g. {{lang|hur|k\u02b7\u0259\u0301xn\u0259ct}} \"name-base-transitive,\" as in \"name a price\").  Predicate heads can also be words that are definable morphologically.  This includes verbs (e.g. {{lang|hur|n\u00e9m}} \"go\"), adjectives (e.g. {{lang|hur|\u03b8\u00ed}} \"big\"), nouns (e.g. {{lang|hur|sw\u0259\u0301y\u02bcqe\u0294}} \"man\"), members of the closed sets of personal words (see the following section), and interrogative words (e.g. {{lang|hur|st\u00e9m}} \"what\").\n\nA verbal predicate may be expanded with the addition of one or two [[auxiliary verbs]] before the head and/or one or more adverbs preceding or following the head.\n*''\u0294i''(AUX) ''c\u0259n c\u02bc\u00e9c\u02bc\u0259w-\u0259t''. \"I am helping him.\"\n**Two pairs of verbs function as auxiliaries, setting the predicate within a spatial context.  The choice between the [[locative]] pair, /\u0294i/ \"be here\" and /ni\u0294/ \"be there,\" depends on the location of the speaker relative to whatever the predicate refers to.  The directional auxiliaries, /\u0294\u0259m\u00ed/ \"come\" and /n\u00e9m/ \"go,\" identify motions toward or away from the speaker.\n*''\u019b''\u02bc(ADV) ''c\u0259n n\u0259w\u026c x\u030ct\u00e9''. \"I did it again.\"\nVerb heads are also found with verb [[complement (linguistics)|complements]] and compound verbs.\n*''\u03b8\u0259\u0301t''(\"try\") ''\u026c\u00e1k\u02b7''. \"He tried to fly.\"\n\nLike verbal predicates, adjectival and nominal predicates can be expanded with other elements.  Nominal predicate heads can appear alone, followed by particles and adverbs.\n*''sw\u0259\u0301y\u02bcqe\u0294 c\u0259n''. \"I am a man.\"\n*''sw\u0259\u0301y\u02bcqe\u0294 \u010dx\u02b7 \u019b\u02bce''. \"You're a man too.\"\nSyntactically, adjectival and nominal predicate heads appear with auxiliaries less often than verbs.  Adjectives and nouns can appear together in nominal predicates expanded with adjectives.  A nominal predicate head can be preceded by a modifying adjective or numeral.\n*''\u0294\u0259\u0301y\u02bc''(\"good\") ''\u010dx\u02b7''(\"you\") ''sw\u0259\u0301y\u02bcqe\u0294''(\"man\"). \"You're a good man.\"\nAdjectives usually appear as predicate heads accompanied by [[grammatical particle|particles]] only, but they can be preceded by auxiliaries and adverbs acting as [[intensifier]]s.\n*''k\u02bc\u02b7\u00e1m\u02bck\u02bc\u02b7\u0259m\u02bc c\u0259n''. \"I'm strong.\"\n*''ni''(AUX) ''\u0294uk\u02bc\u02b7\u00e1m\u02bck\u02bc\u02b7\u0259m''\u02bc. \"He [absent] is strong all right.\"\n*''x\u030c\u0259\u0301\u026c''(ADV) ''q\u02bc\u00e1q\u02bc\u0259y\u02bc''. \"He was very sick.\"\n\n===Person markers<ref>Suttles, Wayne. (2004), 320\u2013329.</ref>===\nThe Halkomelem person markers (forms that correspond in meaning to English personal pronouns) include a set of affixes, one set of particles, and two sets of words (personal and [[possessive pronoun|possessive]]).  As mentioned in the \"Morphology\" section, there is no [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] or [[Clusivity|inclusive/exclusive]] distinction in the language, however, some scholars believe that the forms identified here as second-person \"singular\" were once used in addressing a married couple, a pair of brothers, or even a family, while the \"plural\" forms were used for a larger or less integrated group.\n\n====First- and second-person argument particles====\nThe first- and second-[[Grammatical person|person]] particles pattern like a [[nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative\u2013accusative]] case marking system.  In other words, the same particles mark first- and second-person [[grammatical argument|arguments]] in both [[intransitive]] and [[transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] predicates in main clauses (coordinate constructions).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=1 |\n! colspan=1 | Singular\n! colspan=1 | Plural\n|-\n| '''First-Person'''\n| ''c\u0259n''\n| ''ct''\n|-\n| '''Second-Person'''\n| ''\u010dx\u02b7''\n| ''ce\u00b7p''\n|}\nSuttles (2004) classified the first- and second-person argument particles as second-position [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] particles, along with about twenty other particles that can appear within the predicate.  Most of the second-position predicate particles are mobile, appearing after the first word of the predicate (whatever that may be).  If the only word in the predicate is the head, the first- and second-person argument particles will follow it; if the head is preceded by an auxiliary verb, they will follow the auxiliary; if the head is preceded by an [[adverb]], they will follow the adverb.\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w-\u0259t c\u0259n ce\u0294''. \"I'll help him/her/them.\"\n*''\u0294i c\u0259n c\u02bc\u00e9c\u02bc\u0259w-\u0259t''. \"I am helping him/her/them.\"\n*''l\u0259\u0301q\u02bc c\u0259n w\u0259m\u02bci t\u00e9c\u0259l''. \"I generally get here.\"\n\n====Object person markers====\nAn [[object (grammar)|object]] person marker can only be suffixed to a transitive verb (i.e. a verb stem that has a transitive suffix).  The four forms appear to be composed of identifiable elements: /-S/ and /-am/ \"non-third-person singular,\" /-al-/ \"non-third-person plural,\" /-x/ and /-x\u02b7/ \"first person,\" and /-\u0259/ second person.  Third-person objects are unmarked.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=1 |\n! colspan=1 | Singular\n! colspan=1 | Plural\n|-\n| '''First-Person'''\n| ''-Samx ~ -amx''\n| ''-al\u02bcx\u02b7''\n|-\n| '''Second-Person'''\n| ''-Sam\u0259 ~ -am\u0259\n| ''-al\u0259''\n|}\nThe element /-S/ occurs with the transitivizer /-t/, and they coalesce as /\u03b8/.  With the root ''c\u02bc\u00e9w-'' \"help\" and /-t/ \"transitive,\" we find:\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259\u03b8\u00e0mx'' \"help me\"\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259\u03b8\u00e0l\u02bcx\u02b7'' \"help us\"\nThese forms are normally accompanied by person markers.\n\n====Third-person arguments====\nThe third-person arguments follow an [[ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative\u2013absolutive]] system.  With an intransitive predicate head, a third-person argument is like a third-person object in being marked by zero.  Plurality is optionally indicated by the particle ''\u0294\u00e9\u00b7\u026ct\u0259n''.\n*''n\u00e9m\u02bc ce\u0294''. \"He/she/it/they will go.\"\n*''n\u00e9m\u02bc ce\u0294 \u0294\u00e9\u00b7\u026ct\u0259n''. \"They will go.\"\n\nWith a transitive predicate head in a main clause, on the other hand, a third-person agent must be marked by the suffix /-\u0259s/.  It always follows the transitivizer and object person marker, if any.  Unlike the first- and second-person particles, the suffix does not move to follow an auxiliary or adverb.  Again, the plurality of the third-person may be indicated by the particle ''\u0294\u00e9\u00b7\u026ct\u0259n''.\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259t\u0259s ce\u0294''. \"He/she will help him/her.\"\n*''ni c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259t\u0259s''. \"He/she helped him/her.\"\n*''k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259cn\u00e1mx\u0259s ce\u0294 \u0294\u00e9\u00b7\u026ct\u0259n''. \"They will see me.\"\n\n====Constraints====\nIn the [[voice (grammar)|active]] paradigm, a third person cannot be the agent with a second person as the object.  Instead, we find passive forms.\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259t\u00e0l\u0259m ce\u0294''. \"You folks will be helped.\"\nOnly third persons can be agents in the [[passive voice|passive]].  Other relations (e.g. the forms \"*I am seen by you\" or \"*he is seen by me\") can be expressed only in the active (e.g. \"you see me\" and \"I see him\").\n\n====Subordinate clauses====\nA [[subordinate clause]] is produced by prefixing one of the two subordinating particles, /w\u0259-/ \"if, when, that\" and /\u0294\u0259l/ \"whenever, whatever,\"  to the first word in a predicate and replacing its [[independent clause|coordinate]] agent marker with a subordinate agent marker.  Subordinate agent markers are the same in both intransitive and transitive active predicates.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=1 |\n! colspan=1 | Singular\n! colspan=1 | Plural\n|-\n| '''First-Person'''\n| ''-e\u00b7n ~ -\u0259n''\n| ''-\u0259t''\n|-\n| '''Second-Person'''\n| ''-\u0259x\u02b7''\n| ''-e\u00b7p ~ -\u0259p''\n|-\n| '''Third-Person'''\n| ''-\u0259s''\n| colspan=2 | same as singular\n|}\nSubordinate clauses usually follow main clauses, but there are a few exceptions.\n*''k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259cn\u00e1m\u0259 c\u0259n ce\u0294, w\u0259n\u00e9m\u02bc\u00e8\u00b7n''. \"I will see you, if/when/that I go.\"\n\n==Basic Halq\u0313em\u00e9ylem words and phrases==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Halq\u0313em\u00e9ylem <ref>Halq\u0313em\u00e9ylem Language by Helen Carr, [[Kwantlen First Nation]]</ref>\n|-\n||Hello/Greetings || ''kw\u00e9leches''\n|-\n||How are you? || ''lichexw we eyo''\n|-\n||I am fine || ''tsel we eyo''\n|-\n||Thank you || ''kw'as ho:y''\n|-\n||What is your name? || ''tewat te' skwix''\n|-\n||1|| ''lets'e''\n|-\n||2|| ''isa:le''\n|-\n||3|| ''lhi:xw''\n|-\n||4|| ''X_e'o:thels''\n|-\n||5|| ''lheq'a:tses''\n|-\n||6|| ''t'x_em''\n|-\n||7|| ''tho:kws''\n|-\n||8|| ''teqa:tsa''\n|-\n||9|| ''tu:xw''\n|-\n||10|| ''o:pel''\n|}\n\n==Peoples speaking Halkomelem==\n{{main|List of Halkomelem-speaking peoples}}\n\n== Quote ==\n{{quote|\"If people grow up [[Language acquisition|acquiring more than one language]], their ability to acquire additional languages is much greater,\" Kesler explains. \"So when parents are thinking, 'Would I really rather my child learning Halkomelem than [[French language|French]]?', yeah, I think that's not a bad idea at all.\"<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Wood\n| first = Stephanie\n| title = Despite limited resources, indigenous-language programs persevere in B.C.\n| work = Georgia Straight, Vancouver's News & Entertainment Weekly\n| accessdate = 2014-02-27\n| date = 2014-01-22\n| url = https://www.straight.com/news/572066/despite-limited-resources-indigenous-language-programs-persevere-bc\n}}</ref>\n|Linc Kesler, [[University of British Columbia]] associate professor and director of the First Nations Studies Program and First Nations House of Learning}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Brent Galloway]]\n*[[Donna Gerdts]]\n*[[Patricia Alice Shaw|Patricia Shaw]]\n*[[Wayne Suttles]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Carlson, Keith Thor, ed.

It is spoken in what is now [[British Columbia]], ranging from southeastern [[Vancouver Island]] from the west shore of [[Saanich Inlet]] northward beyond [[Gabriola Island]] and [[Nanaimo]] to [[Nanoose Bay]] and including the [[Lower Mainland]] from the [[Fraser River]] Delta upriver to [[Harrison Lake]] and the lower boundary of the [[Fraser Canyon]].\n\nIn the classification of [[Salishan languages]], Halkomelem  is a member of the Central Salish branch.  There are four other branches of the family: Tsamosan, Interior Salish, Bella Coola, and Tillamook.  Speakers of the Central and Tsamosan languages are often identified in ethnographic literature as \"[[Coast Salish languages|Coast Salish]]\".\n\nThe word ''Halkomelem'' is an [[anglicization]] for the language Hul'qumi'num, which has three distinct [[dialect]] groups:\n\n# an Island group, spoken by separate but closely related First Nations on [[Vancouver Island]] and adjoining islands on the west side of the [[Georgia Strait|Strait of Georgia]]: the [[Snuneymuxw First Nation|Snuneymuxw]] (Nanaimo), Nanoose, [[Stz'uminus First Nation|Stz'uminus]] (Chemainus), [[Cowichan Tribes|Cowichan]], [[Halalt First Nation|Halalt]], Lake Cowichan, [[Lyackson First Nation|Lyackson]], [[Penelakut]],<ref>[http://www.hulquminum.bc.ca/ Hul'quim'num Treaty Group]</ref> and [[Hwlitsum First Nation|Lamalchi]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Be of Good Mind, Essays on the Coast Salish|last=Granville Miller|first=Bruce|publisher=UBC Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7748-13242|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=132}}</ref>\n# a Downriver group, spoken by the [[Musqueam Indian Band|Musqueam]], [[Tsawwassen First Nation|Tsawwassen]], Kwantlen, Tsleil-Waututh, Qayqayt, Kwikwetlem, and Katzie.\n# an Upriver group, the Upper [[Sto:lo]], spoken from the Matsqui First Nation on upstream to [[Yale, British Columbia|Yale]], Sumas, Chilliwack, Pilalt, and Tait.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fort Langley Journals, 1827-30|last=MacLachlan|first=Morag|publisher=UBC Press|year=1998|isbn=0-7748-0664-8|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=168}}</ref>\n\nThe language differences (namely, in phonology and lexicon) are greatest between the Island and Upriver dialects, with the Downriver dialect (especially the Tsawwassen First Nation) providing a central link between the other two.  The diversity of the Halkomelem dialects is noted to be the result of complex social and economic forces and linguistic change, as many Island people crossed the Georgia Strait to camp along the Fraser River (in both the Downriver and Upriver areas) for the summer runs of salmon.  Arranged marriages between children in different language areas was also common, helping to establish a regional social network in the Strait of Georgia\u2013[[Puget Sound]] Basin.\n\n==Use and revitalization efforts==\nThe Halkomelem language is near extinction.  In 2000, it was estimated that the number of fluent Halkomelem speakers was less than one dozen.  Most are middle-aged or older, and few are monolingual, as there was a flood of English-speaking settlers in the region in the mid-nineteenth century.  Language programs at the [[St\u00f3:l\u014d Nation]], [[Seabird Island First Nation]], and [[Cowichan First Nation]] have been developed to save the language. A program aimed at adults at [[Musqueam]] is a collaboration between the band and the [[University of British Columbia]] First Nations and endangered languages programme.\n\nIn September 2009, The [[University of California Press]] published linguist Brent Galloway's ''Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem''.<ref>{{cite book\n| publisher = University of California\n| last = Galloway\n| first = Brent D.\n| title = Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem\n| series = UC Publications in Linguistics, 141\n| accessdate = 2015-10-24\n| date = 2009\n| url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/65r158r4\n}}</ref>\n\nA Halkomelem [[iPhone]] app was released in 2011,<ref>{{Cite web\n| last = Hul\n| first = Stephen\n| title = FirstVoices apps bring B.C.

Relevant differences in the [[phonology]] of the Island and Upriver dialects are noted at the foot of the [[phoneme]] charts.\n\n===Vowels===\nh\u0259n\u0313q\u0313\u0259min\u0313\u0259m\u0313 has five vowel phonemes.

The phoneme /i/ has three distinct allophones. It is realized as {{IPA|[e]}} following unrounded uvulars. It is realized as {{IPA|[\u026a]}} with a central off-glide preceding both unrounded and rounded uvulars. Elsewhere, it is realized as low {{IPA|[i]}} or high {{IPA|[e]}}. The /e/ is realized as a low to mid-front vowel, usually between {{IPA|[\u025b]}} or high {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}. The /a/ is low and central to back, often close to {{IPA|[\u0251]}}. The /u/ is high, back, and rounded, realized somewhere between low {{IPA|[u]}} or high {{IPA|[o]}}.\n\nWhen stressed, the schwa /\u0259/ appears in most environments as a mid-central, but it is fronted and raised before /x/, approaching {{IPA|[\u026a]}}; before /j/ it is also fronted, approaching {{IPA|[\u025b]}}; before /w/ it is lower and back, approaching {{IPA|[\u0251]}}; and before rounded velars it is mid-back, close to {{IPA|[o]}}.  Unstressed /\u0259/ can be as high as {{IPA|[i]}} before /x/ and /j/, and before labialized velars it is realized as {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[u]}}.  This phoneme can also be assimilated to a stressed /e/ or a stressed /a/ in an adjacent syllable, by vowel harmony.\n\n===Consonants===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2|\n! align=\"center\"|[[Bilabial consonant|Labial]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alv.]] [[Sibilant consonant|sibilant]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Lateral consonant|Lateral]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Labialisation|Labialized Velar]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Labialisation|Labialized Uvular]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! rowspan=3|[[Plosive]]{{ref|1|1}}\n! <small>[[Voiceless consonant|voiceless]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''p''' {{IPAblink|p}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''t\u03b8''' {{IPAblink|t\u03b8}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''t''' {{IPAblink|t}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''c''' {{IPAblink|ts}}\n| \n| align=\"center\"|'''\u010d''' {{IPAblink|t\u0361\u0283}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''k''' {{IPAblink|k}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''k\u02b7''' {{IPAblink|k\u02b7}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''q''' {{IPAblink|q}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''q\u02b7''' {{IPAblink|q\u02b7}}\n| align=\"center\"|\n|-\n! <small>[[ejective]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''p\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|p\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''t\u02bc\u03b8''' {{IPAblink|t\u03b8\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''t\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|t\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''c\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|ts\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u019b\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|t\u026c\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|'''k\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|k\u02bc}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''k\u02bc\u02b7''' {{IPA|[k\u02b7\u02bc]}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''q\u02bc''' {{IPAblink|q\u02bc}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''q\u02bc\u02b7''' {{IPA|[q\u02b7\u02bc]}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u0294''' {{IPAblink|\u0294}}\n|-\n!<small> [[Voiced consonant|voiced]]{{ref|3|3}}</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''b''' {{IPAblink|b}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''d''' {{IPAblink|d}}\n|\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''j''' {{IPAblink|d\u0361\u0292}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=1|[[Fricative]]\n! <small>[[Voiceless consonant|voiceless]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''f''' {{IPAblink|f}}{{ref|3|3}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u03b8''' {{IPAblink|\u03b8}}\n| \n| align=\"center\"|'''s''' {{IPAblink|s}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u026c''' {{IPAblink|\u026c}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''\u0161''' {{IPAblink|\u0283}}{{ref|2|2}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''x''' {{IPAblink|x}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''x\u02b7''' {{IPAblink|x\u02b7}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''x\u030c''' {{IPAblink|\u03c7}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''x\u030c\u02b7''' {{IPAblink|\u03c7\u02b7}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''h''' {{IPAblink|h}}\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Sonorant|Resonant]]\n! <small>[[Voiced consonant|voiced]]</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''m''' {{IPAblink|m}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''n''' {{IPAblink|n}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''l''' {{IPAblink|l}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''y''' {{IPAblink|j}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''w''' {{IPAblink|w}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''r''' {{IPAblink|\u0280}}{{ref|3|3}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! <small>[[Glottalization|glottalized]]{{ref|4|4}}</small>\n| align=\"center\"|'''m\u0313''' {{IPA|[m\u02c0]}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''n\u0313''' {{IPA|[n\u02c0]}}\n|\n| align=\"center\"|'''l\u0313''' {{IPA|[l\u02c0]}}\n| align=\"center\"|'''y\u0313''' {{IPA|[j\u02c0]}}\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|'''w\u0313''' {{IPA|[w\u02c0]}}\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|\n| align=\"center\"|\n|}\n\n:{{note|1|1}} The stops and affricates are grouped together for simplification purposes.\n:{{note|2|2}} Of recent and/or peripheral phonemic status.\n:{{note|3|3}} Occur only in a few foreign and imitative words.\n:{{note|4|4}} The five glottalized resonants pose a problem in phonemic analysis (although they occur frequently).\n\nThe plain plosives are less [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirate]] before vowels than in English, but they are more aspirate finally.  Although the glottalized plosives are [[ejective]]s, they are not usually strongly released.\n\nSuttles (2004) made several interesting notes on the Musqueam [[obstruent]]s.  The labiodental fricative /f/ occurs in recent loans from English and their derivatives such as in ''k\u00e1fi'' \"coffee\" and in ''\u010d\u00edf'' \"chief.\"  According to Suttles (2004), the stops /t/ and /t\u02bc/ are articulated at a point slightly forward of that of the usual English \"t\" and \"d,\" while the affricates /c/ and /c\u02bc/ are somewhat more retracted than these English phonemes.  The affricate {{IPA|[d\u0361\u0292]}} has only been recorded in {{lang|hur|kinj\u00e1j}} \"Englishmen\" and {{lang|hur|kinj\u00e1jq\u0259n}} \"English (language).\" The glottalized lateral affricate /\u019b\u02bc/ {{IPA|[t\u02bc\u026c]}} is produced when the apex of the [[tongue]] at the [[Syllable onset|onset]] is in the position for the lateral release rather than for a /t/, and there is less friction produced than with other affricates.  The phonemes /k/ and /k\u02bc/ occur in \"baby talk\" as substitutes for /q/ and /q\u02bc/.  The uvular fricative /x\u030c/ {{IPA|[\u03c7]}} is produced with a great deal of friction and/or uvular vibration, and it contrasts strongly with the velar fricative /x/.\n\nThere is variation in the extent to which Musqueam speakers glottalize resonants.  Phonetically, there are glottalized resonants and resonants preceded or followed by glottal stops, however, Suttles (2004) found no instances of [[contrastive distribution]] among any of the three.  He puts forth two explanations for these facts: that there are two sequences of phonemes, /R\u0294/ and /\u0294R/, with overlapping {{IPA|[R\u02c0]}} allophones, or that there is a single phoneme {{IPA|/R\u02c0/}} that is realized in three distinct ways.  In preferring the latter explanation, Suttles holds that there may be five glottalized resonant phonemes in the dialect, although Downriver speakers glottalize resonants very lightly, making them difficult to detect.\n\nIn most Upriver dialects, glottalized resonants do not exist, while in Island dialects, they are more sharply articulated ([[tenseness]] is a key feature of Island speech).  As is the case with many other phonological features, Downriver Halkomelem stands as a link between the other dialect areas, and it is possible that its speakers vary depending on Island or Upriver influence.  Other differences between dialects include: Island and Downriver have both /n/ and /l/, while Upriver has merged these as /l/.  Upriver lacks the post-vocalic glottal stops of the other two dialects, and vowel length usually appears in that environment for speakers of that dialect.  Additionally, Upriver dialects have greater [[pitch accent|pitch]] differences, and some words are differentiated by pitch alone.\n\n===Stress and pitch===\nBased on Suttles' (2004) recordings of several speakers of the Downriver (Musqueam) dialect, [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] in Halkomelem consists of an increase in intensity and an accompanying rise in [[pitch accent|pitch]].  The three levels of stress are primary (marked /\u05f3/), secondary (marked /`/), and weak (unmarked).  There is one vowel with primary stress in every full word, however, its occurrence is not completely predictable.\n\nIn un[[inflection|inflected]] words with more than one [[vowel]], the primary stress usually falls on the first vowel (e.g. as in ''c\u00e9l\u0259x'' \"hand\" and ''l\u00e9l\u0259m\u02bc'' \"house\").  There are exceptions to this general pattern (e.g. as in ''x\u0259m\u00e9n'' \"enemy\").  As shown by the preceding example, if the word contains both a full vowel and one or more schwas, the stress is placed on the full vowel.  Again, there are exceptions to this pattern, such as in words with a final [[glottal stop]] that cannot be preceded by [[schwa]] (e.g. as in ''n\u0259\u0301c\u02bca\u0294'' \"one\").\n\nAlthough [[minimal pair]]s contrasting stress are rare, they do exist in the language.  The primary stress of a verb root consisting of a resonant, a schwa, and an [[obstruent]] followed by the [[suffix]] /-t/ \"[[transitivity (grammar)|transitive]]\" can fall on either the root or the suffix, allowing for minimal pairs such as ''m\u0259\u0300k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259t'' \"salvage it\" and ''m\u0259k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259\u0301t'' \"finish it all.\"\n\nThe secondary stress appears most often in words that are composed of a root that has retained its stress and a stressed suffix (e.g. as in ''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259\u03b8\u00e0mx'' \"help me\").  It may be the case, however, that the secondary stress recorded by Suttles (2004) in words like ''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259\u03b8\u00e0mx'' is actually a falling pitch; this seems to be characteristic of the last stressed syllable of a phrase in the language.  Additional analyses of the sentential [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] patterns are needed.\n\n===Phonotactics===\nAll obstruents (except the glottals) typically follow one another in sequences of up to four, although a sequence of five is also possible (e.g. as in ''tx\u02b7stx\u030c\u02b7\u00e1s\u0294al'' \"just standing in shock\").  There are no specific restrictions on the types of obstruent sequences that can occur.  [[Plosive]]s appearing in sequences are rearticulated, and sequences of /ss/ are common in the language.\n\n[[Sonorant|Resonants]] only appear adjacent to vowels.  When these sounds occur in the middle of words, they are found in sequences of resonant-obstruent, resonant-resonant, and obstruent-resonant.  An initial resonant is always followed a vowel, and a final resonant must be preceded by one.\n\nThe [[Glottal consonants|laryngeals]] are more restricted than members of the other natural classes in Halkomelem.  The glottal stop occurs only adjacent to a vowel, and, within words, it does not follow any obstruent except (the prefix) /s/.  It can never occur in final position following a [[schwa]].  /h/ occurs only before vowels, following a resonant or one of the [[fricative]]s at morpheme boundaries, but never following other obstruents.  It can appear between an unstressed and a stressed vowel, but it cannot occur between a stressed and an unstressed vowel.\n\n===Morphophonemics===\nCertain processes affect the realization of underlying sounds in Halkomelem.  Alternations that occur fairly commonly are discussed in this section, rather than in the following section on [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].\n*In rapid speech, there is optional [[Elision|loss]] of some instances of schwa, glottal stop, glottalization of resonants, and /h/.\n**An unstressed schwa following an initial nasal stop may be lost, if there is a vowel preceding; the nasal is sometimes heard as part of that syllable (e.g. as in ''t\u0259n\u0259m\u00e9n'' ~ ''t\u0259n m\u00e9n'' \"my father\").\n**/n\u0259/ with no preceding vowel sometimes appears as syllabic {{IPA|[n]}} (e.g. as in ''x\u02b7n\u0259c\u02bc\u00e1w\u0259\u03b8'' ~ ''x\u02b7nc\u02bc\u00e1w\u0259\u03b8'' \"one kind\").\n**A glottal stop after an unstressed final vowel may be lost, in which case the vowel will be reduced to a schwa (e.g. as in ''m\u00e9qe\u0294'' ~ ''m\u00e9q\u0259'').\n**The glottalization of resonants following unstressed vowels is often inaudible (e.g. as in ''sm\u0259n\u02bc\u00e9\u00b7m'' ~ ''sm\u0259n\u00e9\u00b7m'' \"descendants\").\n**/h/ before a stressed vowel may be lost when preceded by a spirant (e.g. as in ''sh\u00e1\u00b7y\u02bc'' ~ ''s\u00e1\u00b7y\u02bc'' \"finished\").\n*An unstressed schwa may take on the quality of an adjacent full vowel, or one that is separated from it by a glottal stop (e.g. as in ''sp\u00e9\u0294\u0259\u03b8'' ~ ''sp\u00e9\u0294e\u03b8'' \"black bear\").\n*When a root with the shape of /CAR\u02c0/ (C is any consonant, A is a full vowel, R\u02c0 is a glottalized resonant), takes the suffix /-\u0259t/ \"transitive,\" the resulting form is /CA\u0294\u0259Rt/.  It appears that the resonant and schwa have switched positions (a form of [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]), but the glottal stop protects the schwa from [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilating]] to the full vowel (e.g. as in ''w\u00edl\u02bc'' \"appear\" and ''w\u00ed\u0294\u0259lt'' \"make it appear\").\n*Several roots appear alone, without having undergone [[affixation]] (e.g. as in ''\u0294\u00ed'' \"big\" and ''p\u00e1'' \"get blown on\").  When this type of root is followed by a [[suffix]] that begins with a stressed vowel, (e.g. as in /-\u00edn\u0259s/ \"chest\"), an /h/ appears (e.g. as in ''\u03b8\u0259h\u00edn\u0259s'' \"barrel-chested\").  A final /h/ is never realized after a stressed vowel.\n*A number of suffixes beginning with /n/ have forms with initial /l/ when they are added to a [[Root (linguistics)|root]] or [[Word stem|stem]] ending in /l/ (i.e. there is [[Alternation (linguistics)|alternation]] of /n/ and /l/ in certain morphological cases in this language) (e.g. as in /-n\u0259x\u02b7/ ~ /-l\u0259x\u02b7/ \"limited control\" in ''\u026c\u0259\u0301q\u02bc\u0259ll\u0259x\u02b7'' \"know it\" and ''c\u0259\u0301llex\u02b7'' \"catch up with him\").\n*In the [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] and [[resultative]] forms of few verbs with initial /c/ or /x/ followed by /a/, the /c/ is [[Reduplication|reduplicated]] as /k\u02b7/ and the /x/ as /x\u02b7/ (e.g. as in ''c\u00e1m'' \"go/come inland\" and its progressive ''c\u00e1k\u02b7\u0259m'' \"be going/coming inland\").\n*[[Vowel gradation]] often occurs between a full vowel, schwa, and zero, depending on the type of root or stem, type of suffix, and placement of stress.\n*When some suffixes are joined with stems, a change in the quality of the stressed [[Vowel quality|vowel]], from one full vowel to another, in the stem, or (rarely) in the suffix results.  The vowel mutations are the product of the assimilation of one vowel to that of an adjacent [[syllable]] at an earlier stage in the language's [[Historical linguistics|history]].  Three kinds of these mutations exist (although only the first example is common).  In the first two examples, the vowel mutation is similar to the [[Germanic umlaut|umlauting]] effect of a suffix on stems in Germanic languages.\n**Stem /e/ changes to /a/ (e.g. as in ''x\u02b7\u019b\u02bc\u00e1qt\u0259s'' \"long-faced\" [''\u019b\u02bc\u00e9qt'' \"long\"]).\n**Stem /a/ to /e/ (e.g. as in ''p\u00e9\u00b7lt\u02bc\u03b8e\u0294'' \"buzzard (turkey vulture),\" which is composed of ''sp\u00e1\u00b7l'' \"raven\" and the suffix /-it\u03b8e\u0294/ \"clothing, blanket\" [with metathesis]).\n**Suffix /e/ to /a/ (e.g. as in ''sq\u02bc\u0259q\u02bc\u0259x\u00e1n'' \"partner,\" which is composed of ''sq\u02bc\u0259q\u02bc\u00e1\u0294'' \"accompanying\" and the suffix /-x\u0259n/ ~ /-x\u00e9n/ \"foot\").\n\n==Morphology<ref>Suttles, Wayne. (2004), 23\u201330.</ref>==\nLike the majority of [[Salishan languages]], Halkomelem is [[polysynthetic]].  A word in Halkomelem may consist of a root standing alone and unaltered, or of a root altered by one or more processes of internal modification and/or accompanied by one or more affixes.  Since all words (with the exception of a few adverbs) can function as [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] heads, there is no basis for distinguishing verbs, nouns, and adjectives.  There are other bases, however, for distinguishing these classes.  Verbs have [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] forms and do not take [[Possessive case|possessive]] affixes, while nouns do not have progressive forms and do take possessive affixes.  Adjectives have neither progressive forms, nor do they take possessive affixes.  [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] is non-existent in the language, although some scholars believe to have found a few possible examples.\n\nThe majority of verb roots have the shapes CAC, C\u0259C, C\u0259CC, while noun roots typically have the shape CVCVC (V is any vowel).  The most common shapes of adjective roots are C\u0259C and CAC.  There is a prefix that nominalizes verbs and adjectives, and there are several prefixes that make verbs out of nouns.  Additionally, there are several ways to make adjective-like words from nouns.  Processes of internal modification of the root include [[reduplication]] (of initial CV and CVC), shift in stress and vowel grade, and [[glottalization]] of resonants (which also affects suffixes).  Roots of different shapes often undergo different processes to produce forms that are grammatically identical.\n\n===Verbs===\nVerbs roots are identified as [[Perfective aspect|perfective]], as opposed to progressive, aspect.\n* Perfective {{lang|hur|s\u0259\u0300q\u02bc}} \"split, tear\"\n* Progressive {{lang|hur|s\u0259s\u0259\u0300q\u02bc}} \"be splitting, be tearing\"\nSeveral verbs also have a [[durative aspect]], which can occur in both forms.\n* Perfective {{lang|hur|q\u02bc\u00edk\u02bc\u02b7\u0259t}} \"bite it\"\n* Progressive {{lang|hur|q\u02bc\u00edq\u02bc\u0259k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259t}} \"be biting it\"\nA number also have an iterative-dispositional aspect.  For a few of these verb roots, this aspect can appear in both a progressive and in a perfective form.\n*{{lang|hur|s\u0259\u0301q\u02bcs\u0259q\u02bc}} \"easy to split\"\nThe majority of verbs have a [[resultative]] form which is adjective-like and does not carry a progressive-perfective distinction.\n*{{lang|hur|ss\u0259s\u00edq\u02bc}} \"split, torn\"\n*{{lang|hur|sk\u02bc\u02b7\u0259k\u02bc\u02b7\u00ed\u026c}} \"spilled, capsized\"\nThe [[Plural verb|plural]] can be optionally marked in all of these forms.  The [[diminutive]] is also marked, optionally, in only the progressive and resultative aspects.\n\n===Nouns===\nIt is possible to internally modify noun roots in Halkomelem for the plural, the diminutive, and the diminutive plural.  Compare:\n*{{lang|hur|c\u00e9l\u0259x}} \"hand\"\n*{{lang|hur|c\u0259lc\u00e9l\u0259x}} \"hands\"\n*{{lang|hur|c\u00e9cl\u0259x}} \"little hand\"\n*{{lang|hur|c\u0259c\u00e9cl\u0259x}} \"little hands\"\nA few nouns may have resultative forms.  They do not have progressive forms, but they may be made into a verb with a verbalizing affix and then express this form.\n\n===Adjectives===\nSimilar to noun roots, adjective roots can be internally modified for plural, diminutive, and diminutive plural.  They can only have progressive forms if made into verbs by means of a verbalizing affix.\n*{{lang|hur|p\u02bc\u0259\u0301q\u02bc}} \"white\"\n*{{lang|hur|p\u02bc\u00e9p\u02bcq\u02bc}} \"white\" (PL)\nComplex adjectives are formed from adjective roots and lexical suffixes.\n*{{lang|hur|m\u00e1\u0294\u0259q\u02b7}} \"large bird\"\n\n===Affixes===\nHalkomelem contains [[prefix]]es, [[suffix]]es, and [[infix]]es.  All infixes of the language have been described in the preceding sections.  Affixes are typically divisible into [[inflectional]] or [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] and [[Function word|grammatical]] or [[Lexical items|lexical]] categories, depending on their involvement in paradigms and meaning, however, a number of Halkomelem affixes mix these categories.  Suttles (2004) identifies the following classes of suffixes and prefixes; a sampling of these affixes follow.\n\n*Non-personal affixes\n**Suffixes of the voice system\n***Transitive: /-t/ /-n\u0259x\u02b7/ /-x/ \"transitive\"\n***Intransitive: /-\u0259m/ \"intransitive,\" /-\u00e9ls/ \"activity\" (compare {{lang|hur|p\u0259\u0301n}} \"get buried,\" {{lang|hur|p\u0259\u0301n\u0259t}} \"bury it,\" {{lang|hur|p\u0259\u0301n\u0259m}} \"plant,\" and {{lang|hur|p\u0259\u0301n\u00e9ls}} \"bury something\")\n***Causative: /-st\u0259x\u02b7/ \"causative\"\n***Permissive: /-s/ \"let,\" as in \"let him go\" or \"let it be\"\n***Applicative: /-n\u0259s/ \"goal\" (e.g. as in {{lang|hur|n\u0259\u0294\u00e9mn\u0259s}} \"go after him\"), /-n\u00e9m/ \"go\"\n***Reflexive: /-\u03b8\u0259t/ \"oneself,\" /-n\u00e1m\u0259t/ \"oneself (limited control)\"\n***Reciprocal: /-t\u0259l\u02bc/ \"each other\"\n***Subordinate passive: /-\u0259t/ \"subordinate passive\"\n**Aspectual and modal affixes\n***Aspectual prefixes: /w\u0259-/ \"established,\" ''w\u0259\u026c-'' \"already\"\n***Modal suffixes: /-\u0259\u0301lm\u0259n/ \"want to, intend to, seem about to\"\n**Derivational affixes\n***Affixes with purely grammatical meaning\n****Nominalizing prefix: /s-/ \"nominalize (verbs and adjectives)\"\n***Verbalizing affixes (combine grammatical and lexical meaning): /c-/ \"get, make, do, go to,\" ''\u026c-'' \"partake of,\" /tx\u02b7-/ \"buy,\" /-\u00e0\u00b7l/ \"travel by\"\n***Lexical prefixes: /m\u0259-/ \"come,\" /t\u0259n-/ \"from\"\n***Lexical suffixes\n****Body parts: /-aq\u02b7/ \"head\"\n****Common artifacts: /-w\u0259t/ \"canoe\"\n****Natural phenomena: /-\u0259tp/ \"plant, tree\"\n*Personal affixes\n\n===Possessive affixes===\nThe following table lists the possessive affixes which appear in attributive possessive structures in Halkomelem.<ref>Galloway, Brent D. (1993). A Grammar of Upriver Halkomelem. London, UK: University of California Press.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Attached to word prior !! Attached to possessed head !!

Together with the appearance of affixes, possession also requires a structural component, in that the possessor of the head is found to the right of the head.  The possessor is always preceded by a determiner, although depending on the noun class, it can also appear with an [[oblique case]] marker. If the possessor is a common noun, it will be introduced by a determiner, but without an oblique case marker. If, however, the possessor is a proper noun, it must appear in the oblique case. Thus, it will be preceded by an oblique case marker, and the possessed noun will appear without a possessive affix. For proper nouns, the determiner and the oblique case marker are fused into a single particle. Marking common nouns with an oblique case marker results in an ungrammatical construction<ref>Gerdts, D.B. 1988. Object and Absolutive in Halkomelem Salish. New York, NY: Garland.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| k\u02b7\u03b8\u0259  sq\u02b7\u0259mey\u0294-s   \u026be     s\u026beni\u0294 || AUX   dog-3POS   DET   woman || 'the woman's dog'\n|-\n| k\u02b7\u03b8\u0259  puk\u02b7-s     \u026be    s\u026beni\u0294 || AUX   book-3POS  DET   woman || 'the woman's book'\n|-\n| k\u02b7\u03b8\u0259     sq\u02b7\u0259mey\u0294  \u0294\u0259-\u028e    John || DET  dog   OBL-DET  John || 'John's dog'\n|}\n\nMost verbs roots are [[semantic]]ally [[grammatical patient|patient]]-oriented (e.g. they have glosses like \"get hit\" or \"get washed\"), while few verbs are semantically [[grammatical agent|agent]]-oriented (e.g. \"look\" or \"see\").  All are grammatically [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]].  These relations are different with the suffixes of the [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] system.  A verb that is made up of an inactive root and an intransitive suffix is grammatically intransitive, but semantically active.  An inactive or active root that takes on a [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] suffix is grammatically transitive and takes an object.  The transitive suffix is the base for an object or passive person suffix.  Two of the most commonly used transitive suffixes distinguish actions performed with limited control or accidentally from those performed with full control or purposely.\n\n[[Aspectual verb|Aspectual]] prefixes, which precede predicate heads, have adverbial meaning and express temporal distinctions.  [[Modal verb|Modal]] suffixes follow the suffixes of the voice system and indicate desire or intention and search or arrangement.\n\nLexical suffixes can be related to verb roots as [[Object (grammar)|objects]], locus, or instruments; to adjective roots as noun [[Head (linguistics)|heads]]; and to noun roots as noun possessors or the noun heads of [[Grammatical modifier|modifiers]].\n\nThe [[Grammatical person|personal affixes]] distinguish first, second, and third person in singular and plural.  There are neither [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual forms]] nor [[Clusivity|inclusive/exclusive]] distinctions in this language.  There is also a set of possessive affixes (prefixes for first and second person singular, suffixes for first-person plural and third person, and a combination of prefix and suffix for second-person plural).  This system will be covered, in detail, in the \"Syntax\" section.\n\n===Ordering of affixes===\n[[Derivation (linguistics)|Derivational]] prefixes and suffixes form an inner layer around the word root, while [[inflectional]] affixes form an outer layer around the root.  Among derivational affixes, those with lexical meaning stand closer to the root than those with purely grammatical meaning.  Among inflectional affixes, those of the voice and person systems stand closer to the root than the [[Aspectual verb|aspectual]] prefixes and [[Modal verb|modal]] suffixes.\n*{{lang|hur|x\u02b7q\u02b7\u00e9n\u0259ct\u0259s}}. \"[She] punches holes in the bottom of it.\"\n\n==Syntax<ref>Suttles, Wayne. (2004), 31\u201372.</ref>==\nIn Musqueam, a sentence minimally consists of a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]].  Predicate [[head (linguistics)|heads]] can be bare [[root (linguistics)|roots]] (e.g. {{lang|hur|c\u00e1k\u02bc\u02b7}} \"far\"), derived forms (e.g. {{lang|hur|sp\u00e9\u0294e\u03b8}} \"black bar\"), inflected forms (e.g. {{lang|hur|c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259t}} \"help him/her/them\"), and forms including both [[derivation (linguistics)|derivational]] and [[inflectional]] affixes (e.g. {{lang|hur|k\u02b7\u0259\u0301xn\u0259ct}} \"name-base-transitive,\" as in \"name a price\").  Predicate heads can also be words that are definable morphologically.  This includes verbs (e.g. {{lang|hur|n\u00e9m}} \"go\"), adjectives (e.g. {{lang|hur|\u03b8\u00ed}} \"big\"), nouns (e.g. {{lang|hur|sw\u0259\u0301y\u02bcqe\u0294}} \"man\"), members of the closed sets of personal words (see the following section), and interrogative words (e.g. {{lang|hur|st\u00e9m}} \"what\").\n\nA verbal predicate may be expanded with the addition of one or two [[auxiliary verbs]] before the head and/or one or more adverbs preceding or following the head.\n*''\u0294i''(AUX) ''c\u0259n c\u02bc\u00e9c\u02bc\u0259w-\u0259t''. \"I am helping him.\"\n**Two pairs of verbs function as auxiliaries, setting the predicate within a spatial context.  The choice between the [[locative]] pair, /\u0294i/ \"be here\" and /ni\u0294/ \"be there,\" depends on the location of the speaker relative to whatever the predicate refers to.  The directional auxiliaries, /\u0294\u0259m\u00ed/ \"come\" and /n\u00e9m/ \"go,\" identify motions toward or away from the speaker.\n*''\u019b''\u02bc(ADV) ''c\u0259n n\u0259w\u026c x\u030ct\u00e9''. \"I did it again.\"\nVerb heads are also found with verb [[complement (linguistics)|complements]] and compound verbs.\n*''\u03b8\u0259\u0301t''(\"try\") ''\u026c\u00e1k\u02b7''. \"He tried to fly.\"\n\nLike verbal predicates, adjectival and nominal predicates can be expanded with other elements.  Nominal predicate heads can appear alone, followed by particles and adverbs.\n*''sw\u0259\u0301y\u02bcqe\u0294 c\u0259n''. \"I am a man.\"\n*''sw\u0259\u0301y\u02bcqe\u0294 \u010dx\u02b7 \u019b\u02bce''. \"You're a man too.\"\nSyntactically, adjectival and nominal predicate heads appear with auxiliaries less often than verbs.  Adjectives and nouns can appear together in nominal predicates expanded with adjectives.  A nominal predicate head can be preceded by a modifying adjective or numeral.\n*''\u0294\u0259\u0301y\u02bc''(\"good\") ''\u010dx\u02b7''(\"you\") ''sw\u0259\u0301y\u02bcqe\u0294''(\"man\"). \"You're a good man.\"\nAdjectives usually appear as predicate heads accompanied by [[grammatical particle|particles]] only, but they can be preceded by auxiliaries and adverbs acting as [[intensifier]]s.\n*''k\u02bc\u02b7\u00e1m\u02bck\u02bc\u02b7\u0259m\u02bc c\u0259n''. \"I'm strong.\"\n*''ni''(AUX) ''\u0294uk\u02bc\u02b7\u00e1m\u02bck\u02bc\u02b7\u0259m''\u02bc. \"He [absent] is strong all right.\"\n*''x\u030c\u0259\u0301\u026c''(ADV) ''q\u02bc\u00e1q\u02bc\u0259y\u02bc''. \"He was very sick.\"\n\n===Person markers<ref>Suttles, Wayne. (2004), 320\u2013329.</ref>===\nThe Halkomelem person markers (forms that correspond in meaning to English personal pronouns) include a set of affixes, one set of particles, and two sets of words (personal and [[possessive pronoun|possessive]]).  As mentioned in the \"Morphology\" section, there is no [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] or [[Clusivity|inclusive/exclusive]] distinction in the language, however, some scholars believe that the forms identified here as second-person \"singular\" were once used in addressing a married couple, a pair of brothers, or even a family, while the \"plural\" forms were used for a larger or less integrated group.\n\n====First- and second-person argument particles====\nThe first- and second-[[Grammatical person|person]] particles pattern like a [[nominative\u2013accusative language|nominative\u2013accusative]] case marking system.  In other words, the same particles mark first- and second-person [[grammatical argument|arguments]] in both [[intransitive]] and [[transitivity (grammar)|transitive]] predicates in main clauses (coordinate constructions).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=1 |\n! colspan=1 | Singular\n! colspan=1 | Plural\n|-\n| '''First-Person'''\n| ''c\u0259n''\n| ''ct''\n|-\n| '''Second-Person'''\n| ''\u010dx\u02b7''\n| ''ce\u00b7p''\n|}\nSuttles (2004) classified the first- and second-person argument particles as second-position [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] particles, along with about twenty other particles that can appear within the predicate.  Most of the second-position predicate particles are mobile, appearing after the first word of the predicate (whatever that may be).  If the only word in the predicate is the head, the first- and second-person argument particles will follow it; if the head is preceded by an auxiliary verb, they will follow the auxiliary; if the head is preceded by an [[adverb]], they will follow the adverb.\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w-\u0259t c\u0259n ce\u0294''. \"I'll help him/her/them.\"\n*''\u0294i c\u0259n c\u02bc\u00e9c\u02bc\u0259w-\u0259t''. \"I am helping him/her/them.\"\n*''l\u0259\u0301q\u02bc c\u0259n w\u0259m\u02bci t\u00e9c\u0259l''. \"I generally get here.\"\n\n====Object person markers====\nAn [[object (grammar)|object]] person marker can only be suffixed to a transitive verb (i.e. a verb stem that has a transitive suffix).  The four forms appear to be composed of identifiable elements: /-S/ and /-am/ \"non-third-person singular,\" /-al-/ \"non-third-person plural,\" /-x/ and /-x\u02b7/ \"first person,\" and /-\u0259/ second person.  Third-person objects are unmarked.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=1 |\n! colspan=1 | Singular\n! colspan=1 | Plural\n|-\n| '''First-Person'''\n| ''-Samx ~ -amx''\n| ''-al\u02bcx\u02b7''\n|-\n| '''Second-Person'''\n| ''-Sam\u0259 ~ -am\u0259\n| ''-al\u0259''\n|}\nThe element /-S/ occurs with the transitivizer /-t/, and they coalesce as /\u03b8/.  With the root ''c\u02bc\u00e9w-'' \"help\" and /-t/ \"transitive,\" we find:\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259\u03b8\u00e0mx'' \"help me\"\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259\u03b8\u00e0l\u02bcx\u02b7'' \"help us\"\nThese forms are normally accompanied by person markers.\n\n====Third-person arguments====\nThe third-person arguments follow an [[ergative\u2013absolutive language|ergative\u2013absolutive]] system.  With an intransitive predicate head, a third-person argument is like a third-person object in being marked by zero.  Plurality is optionally indicated by the particle ''\u0294\u00e9\u00b7\u026ct\u0259n''.\n*''n\u00e9m\u02bc ce\u0294''. \"He/she/it/they will go.\"\n*''n\u00e9m\u02bc ce\u0294 \u0294\u00e9\u00b7\u026ct\u0259n''. \"They will go.\"\n\nWith a transitive predicate head in a main clause, on the other hand, a third-person agent must be marked by the suffix /-\u0259s/.  It always follows the transitivizer and object person marker, if any.  Unlike the first- and second-person particles, the suffix does not move to follow an auxiliary or adverb.  Again, the plurality of the third-person may be indicated by the particle ''\u0294\u00e9\u00b7\u026ct\u0259n''.\n*''c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259t\u0259s ce\u0294''. \"He/she will help him/her.\"\n*''ni c\u02bc\u00e9w\u0259t\u0259s''. \"He/she helped him/her.\"\n*''k\u02bc\u02b7\u0259cn\u00e1mx\u0259s ce\u0294 \u0294\u00e9\u00b7\u026ct\u0259n''. \"They will see me.\"\n\n====Constraints====\nIn the [[voice (grammar)|active]] paradigm, a third person cannot be the agent with a second person as the object.

Other relations (e.g. the forms \"*I am seen by you\" or \"*he is seen by me\") can be expressed only in the active (e.g. \"you see me\" and \"I see him\").\n\n====Subordinate clauses====\nA [[subordinate clause]] is produced by prefixing one of the two subordinating particles, /w\u0259-/ \"if, when, that\" and /\u0294\u0259l/ \"whenever, whatever,\"  to the first word in a predicate and replacing its [[independent clause|coordinate]] agent marker with a subordinate agent marker.

Since 1876, it is officially Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana.</ref> It is one of the earliest surviving public libraries and repositories for manuscript in Italy and holds one of the greatest collections of classical texts in the world. It is named after [[St. Mark]], the patron saint of the city. In historical documents, it is officially ''Bibliotheca Aedis Sancti Marci'' but commonly ''Pubblica Libreria di san Marco''.<ref group=\"note\">The official Latin name was indicated by the Venetian Senate on 10 August 1468. See Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 34 and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe library was founded in 1468 when the humanist scholar Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]], titular [[Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople|Latin patriarch of Constantinople]], donated his personal collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts to the [[Republic of Venice]] with the stipulation that a library of public utility be established. The collection was the result of Bessarion's concerted effort to locate and acquire rare manuscripts throughout Greece and Italy as a means of preserving the knowledge of the [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] world after [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. His choice of Venice was primarily due to the city's large community of Greek refugees and its historical ties to Byzantium. The Venetian government was slow, however, to honor its commitment to suitably house the collection with decades of discussion and indecision, owing to a series of military crises and the resulting climate of political uncertainty. The library was ultimately built during the period of recovery as a part of a vast program of urban renewal aimed at glorifying the republic through architecture and affirming its international prestige as a center of wisdom and learning.\n\nThe original library building is prominently located in [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]], Venice's former governmental center, with its long fa\u00e7ade facing the [[Doge's Palace]].

Access was difficult and consultation impracticable. To no avail, both [[Marcantonio Sabellico]] and [[Andrea Navagero]], in their capacity as official historian, and various other prominent humanists urged the government repeatedly to provide a suitable location. But the political and financial situation during the long years of the [[Italian wars]] stymied any serious plan, notwithstanding the Senate's statement of intent to build a library in 1515.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 18.</ref><ref group=\"note\">The deliberation of the Senate appropriated no funding and was without effect.

Championed by the [[Grimani]] family, the program called for the transformation of [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]] from a medieval town center with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical forum. The intent was to evoke the memory of the ancient [[Roman republic]] and, in the aftermath of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, to present Venice as Rome's true successor.<ref>See in general Chambers, ''The Imperial Age of Venice''..., pp. 12\u201331 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 10\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the [[Zecca of Venice|mint]] (begun 1536) and the [[Loggetta del Sansovino|loggia]] of the bell tower (begun 1538), the program involved replacing the dilapidated thirteenth-century buildings that lined the southern side of the square and the area in front of the Doge's Palace. For this, [[Jacopo Sansovino]], a refugee from the Sack of Rome, was commissioned on 14 July 1536.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino\u2026'', pp. 14\u201315</ref> Subsequently, on 6 March 1537, it was decided that the area of the building facing the palace was to be destined for the offices of the procurators and for the library.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino\u2026'', p. 15.

Significantly, the earlier decree of 1515, citing as examples the libraries in [[Ulpian Library|Rome]] and [[Hadrian's Library|Athens]], had expressly stated that a perfect library with fine books would serve as an ornament for the city and as a light for all of Italy.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?\u2026'', p. 35</ref> The construction of the library was also seen as an opportunity to promote the publishing industry by providing ready access for printers who needed to periodically consult the original manuscripts whenever printing critical editions and to make working copies of the manuscripts on which to write notes and make corrections.<ref group=\"note\">The decision to begin the construction of the library coincided with the laws of 1534 and 1537 which sought to redress a decline in the book trade and the increasing importation of books printed elsewhere by providing further copyright protection to printers and imposing standards of printing quality. For the printing history of the period, see Brown, Horatio, ''The Venetian Printing Press: an Historical Study'', 1891, London, John C. Nimmo, pp. 75\u201382.</ref> Many of the manuscripts were later copied to produce the ''[[Editio princeps|editiones principes]]'' (first editions) of the Greek classics in the printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]].<ref>Rapp, ''Bessarion of Nicaea'', p. 126</ref>\n\n====Sansovino\u2019s  superintendence (1537\u2013''c''.1560)====\nConstruction proceeded slowly. The chosen site for the library, although owned by the government, was already occupied by five hostelries and several food stalls, many of which had longstanding contractual rights.  It was consequently necessary to find a mutually agreed upon alternative location, and at least three of the hostelries had to remain in the area of Saint Mark's Square.<ref name=Howard-19>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 19</ref> Also, the hostelries and shops provided a steady flow of rental income to the procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'', the magistrate responsible for the public buildings around Saint Mark's Square. So there was the need to limit the disruption of the revenue by gradually relocating the activities as the building progressed and new space was required to continue.<ref name=Howard-19/> \n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header = Construction of the<br />Biblioteca Marciana\n | image1 = Biblioteca Marciana-construction plan.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n{{legend|#FAD9D0| area of meat market}}\n{{legend|#D9DCE5| area of hostelries}}\n{{legend|#ECE6BB| area of lean-to bread shops}}\n}}\nThe lean-to bread shops and a portion of the Pellegrino hostelry adjoining the bell tower were demolished in early 1537.<ref name=Howard-19/> But rather than reutilizing the existing foundations, Sansovino built the library detached so as to make the bell tower a freestanding structure and transform Saint Mark's Square into a trapezoid. This was meant to give greater visual importance to the Basilica of Saint Mark located on the eastern side and also make it possible to see the Doge's Palace from anywhere in the square.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File:Jost Amman-detail from Procession for the marriage with the sea.jpg|thumb|[[Jost Amman]], ''Procession for the Doge's Marriage with the Sea'' (detail), showing the meat market in the foreground and the unfinished library behind, ''circa'' 1565]]\nWork was suspended following the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1537\u20131540)]] due to lack of funding in the period of recovery but resumed in 1543. The next year, 1544, the rest of the Pellegrino hostelry was torn down, followed by the Rizza.<ref name=Howard-19/> But on 18 December 1545, the heavy masonry vault collapsed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 20 and Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 132</ref> In the subsequent enquiry, Sansovino claimed that workmen had prematurely removed the temporary wooden supports before the concrete had set and that a galley in the basin of Saint Mark, firing cannon as a salute, had shaken the building. Nevertheless, the architect was sentenced to personally repay the cost of the damage which took him 20 years.<ref group=\"note\">In 1565, the procurators discharged the remaining debt in exchange for sculptural work by Sansovino. The deliberation of the procurators, dated 20 March 1565, is in the Archives (PS, Atti, reg. 130, c. 72). See Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino...'', p. 21.</ref> Also, his stipend was suspended until 1547.  As a consequence of the collapse, the design was modified with a lighter wooden structure to support the roof.  \n\nIn the following years, the procurators increased funding by borrowing from trust funds, recovering unpaid rents, selling unprofitable holdings, and drawing upon the interest income from government bonds.<ref name=Howard-21and23>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 21 and 23</ref> Work proceeded rapidly thereafter. The Cavaletto hostelry was relocated in 1550.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 21</ref> This was followed by the demolition of the Luna. By 1552, at least the seven [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]s in correspondence to the reading room, had been completed.<ref group=\"note\">In 1552, the practice began of extracting by lot the use of the balconies by the procurators and their guests to observe the carnival celebrations in the Piazzetta.

By then, fourteen bays had been constructed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 23</ref> However, owing to difficulties in finding a suitable alternative location, only in 1556 was the last of the hostelries, the Lion, relocated, allowing the building to reach the sixteenth bay in correspondence to the lateral entry of the mint.<ref name=Howard-21and23/> Beyond stood the central meat market. This was a significant source of rental income for the procurators, and construction was halted. The work on the interior decorations continued until about 1560.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 158</ref> Although it was decided five years later to relocate the meat market and continue the building,<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 135</ref> no further action was taken, and in 1570 Sansovino died.\n\n====Scamozzi\u2019s  superintendence (1582\u20131588)====\nIn 1582, following the demolition of the meat market (1581), [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] was selected to oversee the construction of the final five bays, continuing Sansovino's design.<ref>Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 135</ref> This brought the building down to the ''molo'', or embankment, in correspondence with the main fa\u00e7ade of the mint. Scamozzi also added the crowning statues and obelisks. Since the original design by Sansovino does not survive, it is not known whether the architect ever intended for the library to reach its actual length of twenty-one bays. Scamozzi's negative comment on the junction of the library with the mint<ref group=\"note\">Scamozzi criticizes the truncating of cornices, bases, and capitals in reference to the junction of the facades of the library and the mint and considers such solutions \"indecencies and follies\" (''\"indecentie e sciocchezze\"''). See Scamozzi, Vicenzo, ''L'idea della architettura universale di Vincenzo Scamozzi architetto veneto'', Parte seconda, 1615, Venetiis, Giorgio Valentini, p. 171.</ref> has led some architectural historians to argue that the result could never have been intentionally designed by Sansovino. But archival research and technical and aesthetic considerations have not been conclusive.<ref group=\"note\">Deborah Howard summarizes the issue in Howard, Deborah, ''The Length of the Library'', \u00abAteneo veneto\u00bb, Anno CXCVII, terza serie, 9/11, 2010, pp. 23\u201329, {{ISSN|0004-6558}}.</ref>\n\nDuring Scamozzi's superintendence, the debate regarding the height of the building was reopened. When Sansovino had first been commissioned on 14 July 1536, the project expressly called for a three-story construction similar to the recently rebuilt [[Procuratie#Procuratie Vecchie|Procuratie Vecchie]] on the northern side of Saint Mark's Square. But by 6 March 1537, when the decision was made to locate the library within the new building, the plan had been abandoned in favor of a single floor above the ground level.<ref group=\"note\">There are no surviving records regarding the debate, and it is not known what factors were determinative. See, Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino...''\u2026, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> Scamozzi, nonetheless, recommended adding a floor to the library. Engineers were called to assess the existing foundation to determine whether it could bear the additional weight. The conclusions were equivocal, and it was ultimately decided in 1588 that the library would remain with only two floors.<ref group=\"note\">Manuela Morresi suggests that in addition to engineering considerations, the decision to retain the height of the library stemmed from the ascendency of the ''giovani'' faction in the aftermath of the constitutional crisis of 1582 and its opposition to the aggressive building program.

These principles required that a [[triglyph]] be centered over the last column and then followed by half a [[metope]], but the space was insufficient.  With no surviving classical examples to guide them, Bramante, Antonio da Sangallo, Raphael, and other great Renaissance architects had struggled with the dilemma, implementing various ideas, none of which satisfied the Vitruvian dictum. Sansovino's solution was to lengthen the end of the frieze by superimposing a final pilaster on a wider [[Pier (architecture)|pier]], thus creating the space necessary for a perfect half metope.<ref>See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 451\u2013452 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref group=\"note\">Lotz suggests that the inspiration may have been the corner pier in Santa Maria presso San Biaggio in Montepulciano which lacks, however, the corner metope.

The enlarged [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s of the arches on the ground floor alternate between lions\u2019 heads and the heads of pagan divinities (Ceres?, Pan, Apollo, Diana, Mercury, Minerva, Venus, Mars, Juno?, Jupiter, Saturn, and Phanes). In low relief, the [[soffit]]s have either mythological scenes, mostly related to the divinity in the keystone, or [[grotesques]]. The spandrels on the upper floor have allegorical female figures with wings, including Knowledge (book) and Intelligence (celestial sphere) but also Fame (trumpet), Glory (palm), Honor (laurel wreath), Immortality (circle without beginning or end), and Reward (crown). These are in mid-relief, thus creating the illusion that they are further from the viewer.<ref>Ivanoff, ''La libreria marciana...'', p. 4</ref> This effect serves to emphasize the verticality so as to counterbalance the long, horizontal succession of arcades.\n\nThe balustrade above is surmounted by statues of pagan divinities and immortalized heroes of Antiquity.

Statues and carvings abound, and no large areas of plain wall are visible. In addition to the abundance of classical decorative elements \u2013 obelisks, keystone heads, spandrel figures, and a richly carved frieze \u2013 there is a correct and erudite use of the Doric and Ionic orders that recalls Roman prototypes with the intent of giving the building a sense of authenticity. The proportions do not always respect Vitruvian canons. Scamozzi, a rigid classicist, was specifically critical of the arches on the ground floor, considered to be dwarfed and ill-proportioned, and the excessive height of the Ionic entablature with respect to the columns.<ref group=\"note\">Scamozzi considered appropriate a ratio between the height of the entablature and the column of 1 to 4 for the Doric order and 1 to 5 of the Ionic order, whereas the ratios in the library are 1 to 3 and 1 to 2 respectively. See Scamozzi, Vincenzo, ''L\u2019Idea dell\u2019Architettura Universale'', 1615, Venetiis, ''expensis auctoris'', Lib. VI, Cap. VII, pp. 20-21.</ref> Nevertheless, the classical references were sufficient to satisfy the Venetians\u2019 desire to emulate the great civilizations of Antiquity and to present their own city as the successor of the Roman republic. At the same time, the design respects many local building traditions, and it harmonizes with the gothic [[Doge's Palace]] through the common use of [[Istrian stone|Istrian limestone]], the two-story arcades, the balustrades, and the elaborate rooflines.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, pp. 26\u201328, Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', pp. 150\u2013152, and Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance Art'', p. 633</ref>\n\n===Interiors===\nThe actual library was always only on the upper floor with the ground floor being let to shops and, later on, cafes as a source of revenue to the procurators.  The gilded interior rooms are decorated with oil paintings by the masters of Venice's [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] period, including [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese]], and [[Andrea Schiavone]]. Some of these paintings show mythological narratives, principally drawn from the writings of classical authors: Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' and ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', Apuleius\u2019 ''[[The Golden Ass]]'', Nonnus\u2019 ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', Martianus Capella's [[Martianus Capella#De nuptiis|''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'']], and the [[Suda]].  In many instances, these stories of the pagan divinities are employed in a metaphorical sense on the basis of the early Christian writings of Arnobius and Eusebius. Other paintings show allegorical figures and include Renaissance hieroglyphics which reflect the renewed interest in the esotericism of the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic writings]] and of the [[Chaldean Oracles]] that impassioned many humanists following the publication in 1505 of [[Horapollo]]\u2019s ''\u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac''  (''Hieroglyphica''), the purported key to unlock the mysteries of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nThe iconographic sources vary and include [[Pierio Valeriano Bolzani|Pierio Valeriano\u2019s]] dictionary of symbols, ''Hieroglyphica'' (1556); popular emblem books such as [[Andrea Alciati|Andrea Alciati\u2019s]] ''Emblematum Liber'' (1531) and [[Achille Bocchi|Achille Bocchi\u2019s]] ''Symbolicarum quaestionum de universo genere'' (1555); Francesco Marcolini\u2019s divination game ''Le ingeniose sorti'' (1540); as well as [[Vincenzo Cartari|Vincenzo Cartari\u2019s]] mythographic manual for painters ''Imagini colla sposizione degli dei degli antichi'' (1556).<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., p. 21</ref> The \"[[Mantegna Tarocchi]]\" were used as iconographic sources for the depictions of the liberal arts and the muses in the staircase.<ref>Broderick, ''Ascent to Wisdom''..., pp. 98\u2013103, 108 (note 210), and 155 and Ivanoff, ''La libreria marciana...'', pp. 30 and 32</ref>\n\nAlthough several images have a specific pedagogical function aimed at forging temperate and stalwart rulers and inculcating qualities of dedication to duty and moral excellence in the noble youth who studied in the library,<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 28\u201352</ref> the overall decorative program reflects the Venetian aristocracy's interest in philosophy as an intellectual pursuit and, in a broader sense, the growing interest in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism|Platonic philosophy]] as one of the central currents in Renaissance thought. It is conceptually organized on the basis of the Neoplatonic ascent of the soul  and affirms that the quest for knowledge is directed towards the attainment of divine wisdom.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 140</ref> The staircase largely represents the life of the embodied soul in the early stages of the ascent: the practice of the cardinal virtues, the studious contemplation of corporeal matters in both their multiplicity and harmony, the transcendence of mere opinions through dialectic, and catharsis. The reading room corresponds to the soul's subsequent journey within the intellectual realm and shows the culmination of the ascent with the awakening of the higher, intellective soul, ecstatic union, and illumination.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 21\u201328 and 52\u201359</ref> The program culminates with the representation of the [[Plato's political philosophy|ideal Platonic State]] founded upon a transcendent understanding of a higher reality. By association, it is implied that the Republic of Venice is the very paradigm of wisdom, order, and harmony.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 84\u201392</ref>\n\n[[File:SCALA 3.jpg|thumb|left|Staircase with the Dome of Poetics and the second flight (stuccoes by [[Alessandro Vittoria]])]]\n\n====Staircase====\nThe staircase consists of four domes (the Dome of Ethics, the Dome of Rhetoric, the Dome of Dialectic, and the Dome of Poetics) and two flights, the vaults of which are each decorated with twenty-one images of alternating quadrilinear [[Stucco|stuccoes]] by [[Alessandro Vittoria]] and octagonal [[Fresco|frescoes]] by [[Battista Franco]] (first flight) and [[Battista del Moro]] (second flight).<ref>Broderick, ''Ascent to Wisdom''..., pp. 19\u201320, Sansovino, ''Venetia citt\u00e0 nobilissima et singolare''.., c. 114r, and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 141</ref> At the entry and on the landings, Sansovino repeated the Serlian element from the fa\u00e7ade, making use of ancient columns recuperated from the sixth-century Byzantine Church of Santa Maria del Canneto in Pola (Pula, Croatia).<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 157</ref>\n\n[[File:Tiziano-la_sapienza.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], ''\"Wisdom\"'' (''c''. 1560).]]\n\n====Vestibule====\nThe vestibule was originally a lecture hall for the public school of Saint Mark which had been founded in 1446 to train future civil servants of the Ducal Chancery.  The initial curriculum, focusing on grammar and rhetoric, was expanded in 1460 with the creation of a second lectureship for poetry, oratory, and history.  Over time, it evolved into a humanistic school principally for the sons of the nobles and citizens.

The Greek section originally occupied desks 17 to 38 and included grammar, poetry, secular history, rhetoric, medicine, civil law, the works of Aristotle and his commentators, the writings of Plato and the Platonists, mathematics and astronomy, hagiography, theology, canon law, and Biblical texts with commentaries. See Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 159\u2013161 and Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Between the windows were imaginary portraits of great men of Antiquity, the \"philosophers\", each originally accompanied by an identifying inscription. Similar portraits were located in the vestibule. Over time, however, these paintings were moved to various locations within the library and eventually, in 1763, to the Doge's Palace in order to create the wall space necessary for more bookshelves. As a result, some were lost along with all of the identifying inscriptions. The ten that survive were returned to the library in the early nineteenth century and integrated with other paintings in 1929.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 152\u2013157</ref> Of the \"philosophers\", only Diogenes by Tintoretto has been credibly identified.<ref>Ridolfi, Carlo, ''Le marauiglie dell'arte, ouero Le vite de gl'illustri pittori veneti, e dello Stato'', II, 1648, Venetia, Gio.

However, these identifications are purely speculative and without significant supporting arguments. Ivanoff identifies Aristotle solely on the basis of the oriental headdress, which is said to be a reference to his Arab translators.  He also sees a possible correlation in the hand gesture between Veronese's \"philosopher\" and the figure of Aristotle in Raphael\u2019s ''School of Athens''. For Plato, he references Marsilio Ficino\u2019s imaginary description of the philosopher as being older and bearded with broad shoulders, a high brow, and an inspired look and then writes that most of these features are present in Veronese\u2019s \u201cphilosopher\u201d.

They are inserted into a gilded and painted wooden framework along with 52 [[Grotesque|grotesques]] by Battista Franco. The roundels by Bernardo Strozzi and Alessandro Varotari are replacements from 1635 of earlier roundels, respectively by Giulio Licinio and Giambattista Zelotti, which were irreparably damaged by water infiltrations. The original roundels were commissioned in 1556.<ref group=\"note\">The contracts stipulated with Giuseppe Salviati, Battista Franco, and Giulio Licinio survive and specify a payment of 20 ducats per painting.

The contract relative to Salviati is published in Pittoni, ''La libreria di san Marco'', pp. 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nAlthough the original seven artists were formally chosen by Sansovino and Titian, their selection for an official and prestigious commission such as the library was indicative of the ascendancy of the Grimani and of those other families within the aristocracy who maintained close ties with the papal court and whose artistic preferences consequently tended towards [[Mannerism]] as it was developing in Tuscany and Rome. The artists were mostly young and innovative. They were primarily foreign-trained and notably non-Venetian for their artistic styles, having been influenced by the new Mannerist trends in Florence, Rome, Mantua, and Parma.  The roundels that they produced for the ceiling of the reading room are consequently characterized by the greater sculptural rigidity and artificial poses of the figures, the emphasis on line drawing, and the overall dramatic compositions.  They nevertheless show the influence of local painting traditions in both the coloring and brushwork.<ref>See Humfrey, ''Painting in Renaissance Venice'', pp. 188\u2013198 and Paolucci, ''La sala della libreria e il ciclo pittorico'', pp. 290\u2013291.</ref>\n\nFor the single roundels, various and conflicting titles have been proposed over time.<ref group=\"note\">For the principal studies and proposed titles, see  Vasari, Giorgio, ''Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori scultori e architettori'', vol.

Created in 1517, the ''riformadori'' had initially been tasked with reopening the [[University of Padua]] after its closure during the years of the [[War of the League of Cambrai|War of Cambrai]].<ref group=\"note\">Originating as a temporaray committee, the riformatori were definitively established in 1528. See Da Mosto, Andrea, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia: indice generale, storico, descrittivo ed analitico'', vol. I, 1937, Roma, Biblioteca d'arte, p. 217</ref> This involved repairing physical damage to the buildings, hiring new professors, and organizing courses. Over time, their role came to encompass virtually all aspects of public education, including, after 1559, the nomination of the librarian, a patrician chosen for life.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 119</ref> But in 1626, the Senate assumed once again the direct responsibility for the nomination of the librarian whose term was limited in 1775 to three years. The reform of 1626 also established the position of custodian  with the requirement that he be fluent in Greek.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 212\u2013214</ref> Under the ''Riformadori'', the collection was inventoried and first catalogued (1545). For the loaning of the valuable codices, the Council of Ten established stricter conditions which included the requirement of a deposit in gold or silver in the amount of 25 ducats.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 111\u2013112</ref> This sum, already substantial, was increased to 50 ducats in 1558.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 173</ref> \n\nAfter the [[fall of the Venetian Republic]] to Napoleon in 1797, 470 precious manuscripts, selected from public, religious, and private libraries throughout Venice, were turned over to the French as prizes of war. Of these, 203 were subtracted from the Marciana collection along with two musical scores.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 352</ref> Six rare ''incunabula'' and 10 important manuscripts were also removed during the first period of Austrian occupation (1798\u20131805).<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 355. As a consequence of the Austrian defeats in 1866 and 1918, most of the volumes were returned as reparations of war.</ref>\n\nIn 1811, during the second period of French occupation (1805\u20131815), the entire collection was moved to the former Hall of the Great Council in the Doge's Palace when the library, as a building, was transformed together with the adjoining Procuratie Nuove into an official residence for the viceroy of the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. It continued to be used in this capacity during the second period of [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Austrian occupation]] (1815\u20131866), and after the annexation of Venice to the Kingdom of Italy, it came into the possession of the Italian Crown which ceded ownership to the State in 1919.\n\nIn 1904, the collection was moved from the Doge's Palace to the former [[Zecca of Venice|mint]], and in 1924, the Marciana came into possession of the historical rooms of the library. These underwent extensive restoration and in 1929 were reopened to the public. The historical rooms are presently incorporated into the [[Correr Museum]].\n\n==Collection==\n{{See also|Manuscripts in the Biblioteca Marciana}}\n\nThe Venetian government viewed the possession of the valuable codices as a source of civic pride and prestige for the Republic. Little was done initially to favor public access to the library or to improve services to readers.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 35</ref> Although inventories were sporadically conducted, no bibliographical material was developed to facilitate consultation until the nomination of the scholar [[Antonio Maria Zanetti]] (the younger) as custodian in 1737, nor was an acquisition policy established for the continued incrementation of the collection.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 43</ref> Only one new manuscript, a donation, entered into the collection in the twenty years following the opening of the library.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 40</ref> Although a law was passed in 1603 requiring that a copy of all books printed within the territory of the Venetian Republic be deposited in the Marciana (the first such law in Italy),<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 207</ref><ref group=\"note\">The requirement was part of the law of 21 May 1603 that regulated the printers' guild.

See Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 41 (note 42).</ref> Similarly, the invitation of the Senate in 1650 to allocate funds for the acquisition of new books was disregarded.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 42</ref> Nevertheless, a series of individual bequests of private collections began in 1589 and greatly expanded the collection over time.\n\n===Bessarion's Library===\n\n{{See also|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header = \n | image1 = Serra Sant'Abbondio - Monastero di Fonte Avellana, profile.JPG\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = As [[commendatory abbot]] of the monastery of Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana (1456\u20131472), Bessarion was able to remove codices for copying from its important library. \n | image2 = Palazzo colonna, giardino verso santi apostoli 06.JPG\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = In his Roman residence, Palazzo Colonna, Bessarion established a ''scriptorium'' where hired copyists duplicated the manuscripts that could not be found for purchase. \n}}\nThe private library of Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]] constitutes the historical nucleus of the Biblioteca Marciana. In addition to liturgical and theological texts for reference, Bessarion's library initially reflected his particular interests in ancient Greek history, Platonic philosophy, and science, especially astronomy. Some of these texts were brought by Bessarion when he arrived in Italy (1438) for the [[Council of Florence|Council of Ferrara-Florence]]; others were shipped at an unknown later date from the Venetian city of Modone ([[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]), near [[Mystras]] where Bessarion had studied under [[Gemistus Pletho]]. Among the early codices in his collection were works by [[Cyril of Alexandria]], [[Euclid]], [[Ptolemy]], and [[Strabo]], some of which were rare, if not unknown, in Western Europe.<ref>Labowsky, ''Besssarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, pp. 6-7</ref> Elevated to the cardinalate in 1440, Bessarion enjoyed greater financial resources, and he added notable codices that included the precious tenth-century manuscripts of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]' works and of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' that once belonged to the library of Boniface VIII.<ref>Labowsky, ''Besssarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, p. 8</ref>\n\n[[File:VA024RN-0025.jpg|thumb|left|\"Venetus A\", BNM ms Gr.

The manuscript, purchased by Cardinal Bessarion from Giovanni Aurispa, contains the oldest complete text of Homer's epic ''Iliad''.]]\nIn 1454, following the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottoman Turks (1453) and the ensuing devastation, Bessarion charged [[Michael Apostolius]] and Theophanes, bishop of Athens, with the task of locating and purchasing specific works throughout Greece, primarily in Adrianople, Athens, Thessaloniki, Aenos, Gallipoli, and Constantinople, with the objective of preserving the knowledge of the Hellenistic world. He also established a ''[[scriptorium]]'' on Crete, under the direction of Apostolius, where hired scribes copied the texts that could not be found for purchase.<ref>Zorzi, ''Biblioteca Marciana'', p. 18</ref> A similar ''scriptorium'' existed in his Roman residence, Palazzo Colonna near Santi Apostoli, where other texts were copied. Many of the originals were borrowed for this purpose from monasteries in southern Italy, most notably San Nicola di Casole (Apulia), and from [[Fonte Avellana|Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana]] (Marche). These included Bessarion's remarkable discoveries of the ''[[Posthomerica]]'' by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] and the ''Abduction of Helen'' by [[Coluthus]] which would have otherwise been lost as a result of the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] and the destruction of the library of San Nicola di Casole in 1480.<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 9\u201312</ref> Copyists were also hired and coordinated through the bookseller [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]].\n\nFrom the scholar and book trader [[Giovanni Aurispa]] and subsequently from his nephew and heir, Nardo Palmieri, Bessarion acquired \"[[Venetus A]]\" and \"Venetus B\", the oldest texts of [[Homer]]\u2019s ''[[Iliad]]'' with centuries of [[scholia]], the [[Anthology of Planudes|Anthologia Planudea]] containing 2400 Greek poems, the autograph copy of the commentary on Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], the orations of [[Demosthenes]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' by [[Cassius Dio]], the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Photius, and the only surviving copy of ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' by [[Athenaeus]].<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., p. 5 and ''passim'' and Zorzi, ''Biblioteca Marciana'', pp. 18\u201319</ref> \n\nSimultaneously, Bessarion assembled a parallel collection of Latin codices with a relative preponderance of works on philosophy (primarily the medieval Platonic and Aristotelian traditions), history, mathematics, and literature. Some of these were purchased during his residence in Bologna (1450\u20131455) or copied from originals in [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]] (Ravenna), including the works by [[Quintilian]], [[Lactantius]], [[Augustine]], and [[Jerome]]. Of particular interest to Bessarion were the Latin historiographers. Among these were [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]]. The Latin codices also included translations of Greek works, commissioned by Bessarion. Other Latin codices were purchased during his legation to Germany (1460\u20131461), predominately works by [[Nicholas of Lyra]].<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, printed books became increasingly available, and Bessarion began to purchase ''incunabula'', primarily from the printing house of [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]] in Rome. These books included works by [[Cicero]], [[Plutarch]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], Quintilian, and [[Thomas Aquinas]] as well as the Latin translation of Bessarion's own work in defense of Plato, ''Adversus calumniatorem Platonis'' (1469).<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, pp. 17\u201318 and 481\u2013482</ref>\n\nThe Marciana Library now possesses 548 Greek codices, 337 Latin codices, and 27 ''incunabula'' that once belonged to Cardinal Bessarion.<ref>https://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/la-biblioteca/il-patrimonio/patrimonio-librario/fondi/lascito-bessarioneo.

See Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?''..., p. 34 and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe library was founded in 1468 when the humanist scholar Cardinal [[Basilios Bessarion]], titular [[Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople|Latin patriarch of Constantinople]], donated his personal collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts to the [[Republic of Venice]] with the stipulation that a library of public utility be established. The collection was the result of Bessarion's concerted effort to locate and acquire rare manuscripts throughout Greece and Italy as a means of preserving the knowledge of the [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] world after [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. His choice of Venice was primarily due to the city's large community of Greek refugees and its historical ties to Byzantium. The Venetian government was slow, however, to honor its commitment to suitably house the collection with decades of discussion and indecision, owing to a series of military crises and the resulting climate of political uncertainty. The library was ultimately built during the period of recovery as a part of a vast program of urban renewal aimed at glorifying the republic through architecture and affirming its international prestige as a center of wisdom and learning.\n\nThe original library building is prominently located in [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]], Venice's former governmental center, with its long fa\u00e7ade facing the [[Doge's Palace]]. Constructed between 1537 and 1588, it is considered to be the masterpiece of [[Jacopo Sansovino]] and a key work in [[Venetian Renaissance architecture]].<ref>Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance art''..., p. 633 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 226</ref> The  Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]] described it as \"perhaps the richest and most ornate building that there has been since ancient times up until now\" (\"''il pi\u00f9 ricco ed ornato edificio che forse sia stato da gli Antichi in qua''\").<ref>Palladio, Andrea, ''I quattro libri dell'architettura di Andrea Palladio'', 1581, Venetia, Bartolomeo Carampello, p. 5</ref> The art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] regarded it as \"the most magnificent secular Italian building\"  (''\"das pr\u00e4chtigste profane Geb\u00e4ude Italiens\"''),<ref>Burckhardt, Jacob, ''Der Cicerone eine Anleitung zum Genuss der Kunstwerke Italiens'', vol 1, ''Architektur'', 1869, Liepzig, Verlag von E.

Since 1904, the library offices, the reading rooms, and most of the collection have been housed in the adjoining [[Zecca of Venice|Zecca]], the former mint of the Venetian Republic.\n\n==Historical background==\n{{See also|History of libraries#Renaissance}}\n\nCathedral and [[History of libraries#European Middle Ages|monastic libraries]] were the principal centers of study and learning throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

There were additional charges of heresy that reflected the pope\u2019s deep aversion to Platonism, secular poetry, rhetoric, and astrology. Zorzi argues that in this climate of suspicion and repression, Bessarion would have been anxious to quickly remove his collection to safety, outside the territory of the Papal States.

This second shipment, arranged in 1474 by [[Federico da Montefeltro]], departed from Urbino where Bessarion had deposited the remainder of his collection for safekeeping.

Access was difficult and consultation impracticable. To no avail, both [[Marcantonio Sabellico]] and [[Andrea Navagero]], in their capacity as official historian, and various other prominent humanists urged the government repeatedly to provide a suitable location. But the political and financial situation during the long years of the [[Italian wars]] stymied any serious plan, notwithstanding the Senate's statement of intent to build a library in 1515.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 18.</ref><ref group=\"note\">The deliberation of the Senate appropriated no funding and was without effect.

Championed by the [[Grimani]] family, the program called for the transformation of [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]] from a medieval town center with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical forum. The intent was to evoke the memory of the ancient [[Roman republic]] and, in the aftermath of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, to present Venice as Rome's true successor.<ref>See in general Chambers, ''The Imperial Age of Venice''..., pp. 12\u201331 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 10\u201316.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the [[Zecca of Venice|mint]] (begun 1536) and the [[Loggetta del Sansovino|loggia]] of the bell tower (begun 1538), the program involved replacing the dilapidated thirteenth-century buildings that lined the southern side of the square and the area in front of the Doge's Palace. For this, [[Jacopo Sansovino]], a refugee from the Sack of Rome, was commissioned on 14 July 1536.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino\u2026'', pp. 14\u201315</ref> Subsequently, on 6 March 1537, it was decided that the area of the building facing the palace was to be destined for the offices of the procurators and for the library.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino\u2026'', p. 15.

Significantly, the earlier decree of 1515, citing as examples the libraries in [[Ulpian Library|Rome]] and [[Hadrian's Library|Athens]], had expressly stated that a perfect library with fine books would serve as an ornament for the city and as a light for all of Italy.<ref>Raines, ''Book Museum or Scholarly Library?\u2026'', p. 35</ref> The construction of the library was also seen as an opportunity to promote the publishing industry by providing ready access for printers who needed to periodically consult the original manuscripts whenever printing critical editions and to make working copies of the manuscripts on which to write notes and make corrections.<ref group=\"note\">The decision to begin the construction of the library coincided with the laws of 1534 and 1537 which sought to redress a decline in the book trade and the increasing importation of books printed elsewhere by providing further copyright protection to printers and imposing standards of printing quality. For the printing history of the period, see Brown, Horatio, ''The Venetian Printing Press: an Historical Study'', 1891, London, John C. Nimmo, pp. 75\u201382.</ref> Many of the manuscripts were later copied to produce the ''[[Editio princeps|editiones principes]]'' (first editions) of the Greek classics in the printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]].<ref>Rapp, ''Bessarion of Nicaea'', p. 126</ref>\n\n====Sansovino\u2019s  superintendence (1537\u2013''c''.1560)====\nConstruction proceeded slowly. The chosen site for the library, although owned by the government, was already occupied by five hostelries and several food stalls, many of which had longstanding contractual rights.  It was consequently necessary to find a mutually agreed upon alternative location, and at least three of the hostelries had to remain in the area of Saint Mark's Square.<ref name=Howard-19>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 19</ref> Also, the hostelries and shops provided a steady flow of rental income to the procurators of Saint Mark ''de supra'', the magistrate responsible for the public buildings around Saint Mark's Square. So there was the need to limit the disruption of the revenue by gradually relocating the activities as the building progressed and new space was required to continue.<ref name=Howard-19/> \n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 220\n | header = Construction of the<br />Biblioteca Marciana\n | image1 = Biblioteca Marciana-construction plan.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n{{legend|#FAD9D0| area of meat market}}\n{{legend|#D9DCE5| area of hostelries}}\n{{legend|#ECE6BB| area of lean-to bread shops}}\n}}\nThe lean-to bread shops and a portion of the Pellegrino hostelry adjoining the bell tower were demolished in early 1537.<ref name=Howard-19/> But rather than reutilizing the existing foundations, Sansovino built the library detached so as to make the bell tower a freestanding structure and transform Saint Mark's Square into a trapezoid. This was meant to give greater visual importance to the Basilica of Saint Mark located on the eastern side and also make it possible to see the Doge's Palace from anywhere in the square.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File:Jost Amman-detail from Procession for the marriage with the sea.jpg|thumb|[[Jost Amman]], ''Procession for the Doge's Marriage with the Sea'' (detail), showing the meat market in the foreground and the unfinished library behind, ''circa'' 1565]]\nWork was suspended following the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1537\u20131540)]] due to lack of funding in the period of recovery but resumed in 1543. The next year, 1544, the rest of the Pellegrino hostelry was torn down, followed by the Rizza.<ref name=Howard-19/> But on 18 December 1545, the heavy masonry vault collapsed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., p. 20 and Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 132</ref> In the subsequent enquiry, Sansovino claimed that workmen had prematurely removed the temporary wooden supports before the concrete had set and that a galley in the basin of Saint Mark, firing cannon as a salute, had shaken the building. Nevertheless, the architect was sentenced to personally repay the cost of the damage which took him 20 years.<ref group=\"note\">In 1565, the procurators discharged the remaining debt in exchange for sculptural work by Sansovino. The deliberation of the procurators, dated 20 March 1565, is in the Archives (PS, Atti, reg. 130, c. 72). See Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino...'', p. 21.</ref> Also, his stipend was suspended until 1547.  As a consequence of the collapse, the design was modified with a lighter wooden structure to support the roof.  \n\nIn the following years, the procurators increased funding by borrowing from trust funds, recovering unpaid rents, selling unprofitable holdings, and drawing upon the interest income from government bonds.<ref name=Howard-21and23>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 21 and 23</ref> Work proceeded rapidly thereafter. The Cavaletto hostelry was relocated in 1550.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 21</ref> This was followed by the demolition of the Luna. By 1552, at least the seven [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]s in correspondence to the reading room, had been completed.<ref group=\"note\">In 1552, the practice began of extracting by lot the use of the balconies by the procurators and their guests to observe the carnival celebrations in the Piazzetta. In that year, seven balconies were awarded.

By then, fourteen bays had been constructed.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, p. 23</ref> However, owing to difficulties in finding a suitable alternative location, only in 1556 was the last of the hostelries, the Lion, relocated, allowing the building to reach the sixteenth bay in correspondence to the lateral entry of the mint.<ref name=Howard-21and23/> Beyond stood the central meat market. This was a significant source of rental income for the procurators, and construction was halted. The work on the interior decorations continued until about 1560.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 158</ref> Although it was decided five years later to relocate the meat market and continue the building,<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 135</ref> no further action was taken, and in 1570 Sansovino died.\n\n====Scamozzi\u2019s  superintendence (1582\u20131588)====\nIn 1582, following the demolition of the meat market (1581), [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] was selected to oversee the construction of the final five bays, continuing Sansovino's design.<ref>Zorzi, La libreria di san Marco..., p. 135</ref> This brought the building down to the ''molo'', or embankment, in correspondence with the main fa\u00e7ade of the mint. Scamozzi also added the crowning statues and obelisks. Since the original design by Sansovino does not survive, it is not known whether the architect ever intended for the library to reach its actual length of twenty-one bays. Scamozzi's negative comment on the junction of the library with the mint<ref group=\"note\">Scamozzi criticizes the truncating of cornices, bases, and capitals in reference to the junction of the facades of the library and the mint and considers such solutions \"indecencies and follies\" (''\"indecentie e sciocchezze\"''). See Scamozzi, Vicenzo, ''L'idea della architettura universale di Vincenzo Scamozzi architetto veneto'', Parte seconda, 1615, Venetiis, Giorgio Valentini, p. 171.</ref> has led some architectural historians to argue that the result could never have been intentionally designed by Sansovino. But archival research and technical and aesthetic considerations have not been conclusive.<ref group=\"note\">Deborah Howard summarizes the issue in Howard, Deborah, ''The Length of the Library'', \u00abAteneo veneto\u00bb, Anno CXCVII, terza serie, 9/11, 2010, pp. 23\u201329, {{ISSN|0004-6558}}.</ref>\n\nDuring Scamozzi's superintendence, the debate regarding the height of the building was reopened. When Sansovino had first been commissioned on 14 July 1536, the project expressly called for a three-story construction similar to the recently rebuilt [[Procuratie#Procuratie Vecchie|Procuratie Vecchie]] on the northern side of Saint Mark's Square. But by 6 March 1537, when the decision was made to locate the library within the new building, the plan had been abandoned in favor of a single floor above the ground level.<ref group=\"note\">There are no surviving records regarding the debate, and it is not known what factors were determinative. See, Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino...''\u2026, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> Scamozzi, nonetheless, recommended adding a floor to the library. Engineers were called to assess the existing foundation to determine whether it could bear the additional weight. The conclusions were equivocal, and it was ultimately decided in 1588 that the library would remain with only two floors.<ref group=\"note\">Manuela Morresi suggests that in addition to engineering considerations, the decision to retain the height of the library stemmed from the ascendency of the ''giovani'' faction in the aftermath of the constitutional crisis of 1582 and its opposition to the aggressive building program.

He would have undoubtedly seen [[Bramante]]'s tripartite window in the Sala Regia of the Vatican during his Roman sojourn<ref name=\"Lotz, p. 10\">Lotz, ''The Roman Legacy in Sansovino's Venetian Buildings'', p. 10</ref> and may also have been aware of the sixteenth-century nymphaeum at Genazzano near Rome, attributed to Bramante, where the Serlian is placed in a series.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 193</ref> At the Marciana, Sansovino adopted the Serlian of the Orsanmichele prototype, which has narrow sidelights, but these are separated from the tall opening by double columns, placed one behind the other.<ref>Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance Art'', p. 633</ref> This solution of the narrow sidelights ensured greater strength to the structural walls, which was necessary to balance the thrust of the [[barrel vault]] originally planned for the upper story.<ref name=\"Lotz, p. 10\"/>\n\nSuperimposed upon the series of Serlians is a row of large [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]].

These principles required that a [[triglyph]] be centered over the last column and then followed by half a [[metope]], but the space was insufficient.  With no surviving classical examples to guide them, Bramante, Antonio da Sangallo, Raphael, and other great Renaissance architects had struggled with the dilemma, implementing various ideas, none of which satisfied the Vitruvian dictum. Sansovino's solution was to lengthen the end of the frieze by superimposing a final pilaster on a wider [[Pier (architecture)|pier]], thus creating the space necessary for a perfect half metope.<ref>See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 451\u2013452 and Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''..., pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref group=\"note\">Lotz suggests that the inspiration may have been the corner pier in Santa Maria presso San Biaggio in Montepulciano which lacks, however, the corner metope.

Statues and carvings abound, and no large areas of plain wall are visible. In addition to the abundance of classical decorative elements \u2013 obelisks, keystone heads, spandrel figures, and a richly carved frieze \u2013 there is a correct and erudite use of the Doric and Ionic orders that recalls Roman prototypes with the intent of giving the building a sense of authenticity. The proportions do not always respect Vitruvian canons. Scamozzi, a rigid classicist, was specifically critical of the arches on the ground floor, considered to be dwarfed and ill-proportioned, and the excessive height of the Ionic entablature with respect to the columns.<ref group=\"note\">Scamozzi considered appropriate a ratio between the height of the entablature and the column of 1 to 4 for the Doric order and 1 to 5 of the Ionic order, whereas the ratios in the library are 1 to 3 and 1 to 2 respectively.

At the same time, the design respects many local building traditions, and it harmonizes with the gothic [[Doge's Palace]] through the common use of [[Istrian stone|Istrian limestone]], the two-story arcades, the balustrades, and the elaborate rooflines.<ref>Howard, ''Jacopo Sansovino''\u2026, pp. 26\u201328, Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', pp. 150\u2013152, and Hartt, ''History of Italian Renaissance Art'', p. 633</ref>\n\n===Interiors===\nThe actual library was always only on the upper floor with the ground floor being let to shops and, later on, cafes as a source of revenue to the procurators.

In many instances, these stories of the pagan divinities are employed in a metaphorical sense on the basis of the early Christian writings of Arnobius and Eusebius. Other paintings show allegorical figures and include Renaissance hieroglyphics which reflect the renewed interest in the esotericism of the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic writings]] and of the [[Chaldean Oracles]] that impassioned many humanists following the publication in 1505 of [[Horapollo]]\u2019s ''\u1f39\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac''  (''Hieroglyphica''), the purported key to unlock the mysteries of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 20\u201321</ref>\n\nThe iconographic sources vary and include [[Pierio Valeriano Bolzani|Pierio Valeriano\u2019s]] dictionary of symbols, ''Hieroglyphica'' (1556); popular emblem books such as [[Andrea Alciati|Andrea Alciati\u2019s]] ''Emblematum Liber'' (1531) and [[Achille Bocchi|Achille Bocchi\u2019s]] ''Symbolicarum quaestionum de universo genere'' (1555); Francesco Marcolini\u2019s divination game ''Le ingeniose sorti'' (1540); as well as [[Vincenzo Cartari|Vincenzo Cartari\u2019s]] mythographic manual for painters ''Imagini colla sposizione degli dei degli antichi'' (1556).<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., p. 21</ref> The \"[[Mantegna Tarocchi]]\" were used as iconographic sources for the depictions of the liberal arts and the muses in the staircase.<ref>Broderick, ''Ascent to Wisdom''..., pp. 98\u2013103, 108 (note 210), and 155 and Ivanoff, ''La libreria marciana...'', pp. 30 and 32</ref>\n\nAlthough several images have a specific pedagogical function aimed at forging temperate and stalwart rulers and inculcating qualities of dedication to duty and moral excellence in the noble youth who studied in the library,<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 28\u201352</ref> the overall decorative program reflects the Venetian aristocracy's interest in philosophy as an intellectual pursuit and, in a broader sense, the growing interest in [[Renaissance Neoplatonism|Platonic philosophy]] as one of the central currents in Renaissance thought. It is conceptually organized on the basis of the Neoplatonic ascent of the soul  and affirms that the quest for knowledge is directed towards the attainment of divine wisdom.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 140</ref> The staircase largely represents the life of the embodied soul in the early stages of the ascent: the practice of the cardinal virtues, the studious contemplation of corporeal matters in both their multiplicity and harmony, the transcendence of mere opinions through dialectic, and catharsis. The reading room corresponds to the soul's subsequent journey within the intellectual realm and shows the culmination of the ascent with the awakening of the higher, intellective soul, ecstatic union, and illumination.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 21\u201328 and 52\u201359</ref> The program culminates with the representation of the [[Plato's political philosophy|ideal Platonic State]] founded upon a transcendent understanding of a higher reality. By association, it is implied that the Republic of Venice is the very paradigm of wisdom, order, and harmony.<ref>Broderick, ''Custodian of Wisdom''..., pp. 84\u201392</ref>\n\n[[File:SCALA 3.jpg|thumb|left|Staircase with the Dome of Poetics and the second flight (stuccoes by [[Alessandro Vittoria]])]]\n\n====Staircase====\nThe staircase consists of four domes (the Dome of Ethics, the Dome of Rhetoric, the Dome of Dialectic, and the Dome of Poetics) and two flights, the vaults of which are each decorated with twenty-one images of alternating quadrilinear [[Stucco|stuccoes]] by [[Alessandro Vittoria]] and octagonal [[Fresco|frescoes]] by [[Battista Franco]] (first flight) and [[Battista del Moro]] (second flight).<ref>Broderick, ''Ascent to Wisdom''..., pp. 19\u201320, Sansovino, ''Venetia citt\u00e0 nobilissima et singolare''.., c. 114r, and Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 141</ref> At the entry and on the landings, Sansovino repeated the Serlian element from the fa\u00e7ade, making use of ancient columns recuperated from the sixth-century Byzantine Church of Santa Maria del Canneto in Pola (Pula, Croatia).<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 157</ref>\n\n[[File:Tiziano-la_sapienza.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], ''\"Wisdom\"'' (''c''. 1560).]]\n\n====Vestibule====\nThe vestibule was originally a lecture hall for the public school of Saint Mark which had been founded in 1446 to train future civil servants of the Ducal Chancery.  The initial curriculum, focusing on grammar and rhetoric, was expanded in 1460 with the creation of a second lectureship for poetry, oratory, and history.  Over time, it evolved into a humanistic school principally for the sons of the nobles and citizens.  Among the Italian humanists who taught at the school were [[George of Trebizond]], [[Giorgio Valla]], [[Marcantonio Sabellico]], [[Raphael Regius]], and [[Marco Musuro]].<ref>Grendler, Paul, ''Schooling in Renaissance Italy: Literacy and Learning 1300\u20131600'', 1989, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, pp. 61\u201363, {{ISBN|9780801842290}} and Ross, James Bruce, ''Venetian Schools and Teachers Fourteenth to Early Sixteenth Century: A Survey and a Study of Giovanni Battista Egnazio'', \u00abRenaissance Quarterly\u00bb, Volume 29, Issue 4, Winter 1976, pp. 533-534, {{ISSN|0034-4338}}</ref>  The vestibule also briefly (1560\u20131561) hosted the meetings of the [[Accademia Veneziana|Accademia veneziana]] before its failure for bankruptcy.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., 162\u2013163</ref> During this period, the room was lined with wooden benches, interrupted by the lectern which was located under the central window of the western wall.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 162</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1591, the vestibule was transformed into the public Statuary Hall by [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] in order to display the collection of ancient sculpture that [[Giovanni Grimani]] had donated to the Venetian Republic in 1587.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 165\u2013166</ref> Of the original decoration, only the ceiling remains with the [[Illusionistic ceiling painting|illusionistic three-dimensional decoration]] by [[Cristoforo Rosa|Cristoforo and Stefano De Rosa]] of Brescia (1559).  [[Titian]]\u2019s octagonal painting in the center (''c''.1560) has been alternatively identified as ''Wisdom'', ''History'', or ''The Soul''.\n\n[[File:Jacopo tintoretto, diogene.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tintoretto]], ''Diogenes'']]\n\n====Reading Room====\nThe adjacent reading room originally had 38 desks in the center, arranged in two rows, to which the valuable codices were [[Chained library|chained]] according to subject matter.<ref group=\"note\">The Latin section, slightly smaller, occupied desks 1 to 16 and included rhetoric, secular history, medicine, canon and civil law, logic, moral philosophy, the works of Aristotle and his commentators, natural sciences, mathematics, astronomy, Peter Lombard\u2019s ''[[The Four Books of Sentences]]'' and relative commentaries, theology, the works of Thomas Aquinas and Augustine, and Biblical texts with commentaries. The Greek section originally occupied desks 17 to 38 and included grammar, poetry, secular history, rhetoric, medicine, civil law, the works of Aristotle and his commentators, the writings of Plato and the Platonists, mathematics and astronomy, hagiography, theology, canon law, and Biblical texts with commentaries. See Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 159\u2013161 and Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Between the windows were imaginary portraits of great men of Antiquity, the \"philosophers\", each originally accompanied by an identifying inscription. Similar portraits were located in the vestibule. Over time, however, these paintings were moved to various locations within the library and eventually, in 1763, to the Doge's Palace in order to create the wall space necessary for more bookshelves. As a result, some were lost along with all of the identifying inscriptions. The ten that survive were returned to the library in the early nineteenth century and integrated with other paintings in 1929.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 152\u2013157</ref> Of the \"philosophers\", only Diogenes by Tintoretto has been credibly identified.<ref>Ridolfi, Carlo, ''Le marauiglie dell'arte, ouero Le vite de gl'illustri pittori veneti, e dello Stato'', II, 1648, Venetia, Gio. Battista Sgava, p. 26.</ref><ref group=\"note\">In 1967, Nicola Ivanoff identified Aristotle and Plato in the \"philosophers\" by Veronese and, tentatively, Ptolemy and Democritus in the \"philosophers\" by Andrea Schiavone (one of which is alternatively attributed to Giuseppe Salviati). However, these identifications are purely speculative and without significant supporting arguments. Ivanoff identifies Aristotle solely on the basis of the oriental headdress, which is said to be a reference to his Arab translators.  He also sees a possible correlation in the hand gesture between Veronese's \"philosopher\" and the figure of Aristotle in Raphael\u2019s ''School of Athens''. For Plato, he references Marsilio Ficino\u2019s imaginary description of the philosopher as being older and bearded with broad shoulders, a high brow, and an inspired look and then writes that most of these features are present in Veronese\u2019s \u201cphilosopher\u201d. See Ivanoff, ''La libreria Marciana''..., pp. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battista franco, diana e atteone.jpg|thumb|[[Battista Franco]], ''Actaeon and Diana'' and grotesques]]\nThe ceiling of the reading room is decorated with 21 roundels, circular oil paintings, by [[Giovanni de Mio]], [[Giuseppe Salviati]], [[Battista Franco]], [[Giulio Licinio]], [[Bernardo Strozzi]], [[Giambattista Zelotti]], [[Alessandro Varotari]], [[Paolo Veronese]], and [[Andrea Schiavone]]. They are inserted into a gilded and painted wooden framework along with 52 [[Grotesque|grotesques]] by Battista Franco. The roundels by Bernardo Strozzi and Alessandro Varotari are replacements from 1635 of earlier roundels, respectively by Giulio Licinio and Giambattista Zelotti, which were irreparably damaged by water infiltrations. The original roundels were commissioned in 1556.<ref group=\"note\">The contracts stipulated with Giuseppe Salviati, Battista Franco, and Giulio Licinio survive and specify a payment of 20 ducats per painting. Although the canvas would be provided by the procurators, the artists themselves were to provide their own pigments with the exception of blue ultramarine which would be paid for separately. The contract relative to Salviati is published in Pittoni, ''La libreria di san Marco'', pp. 111\u2013112.</ref>\n\nAlthough the original seven artists were formally chosen by Sansovino and Titian, their selection for an official and prestigious commission such as the library was indicative of the ascendancy of the Grimani and of those other families within the aristocracy who maintained close ties with the papal court and whose artistic preferences consequently tended towards [[Mannerism]] as it was developing in Tuscany and Rome. The artists were mostly young and innovative. They were primarily foreign-trained and notably non-Venetian for their artistic styles, having been influenced by the new Mannerist trends in Florence, Rome, Mantua, and Parma.  The roundels that they produced for the ceiling of the reading room are consequently characterized by the greater sculptural rigidity and artificial poses of the figures, the emphasis on line drawing, and the overall dramatic compositions.  They nevertheless show the influence of local painting traditions in both the coloring and brushwork.<ref>See Humfrey, ''Painting in Renaissance Venice'', pp. 188\u2013198 and Paolucci, ''La sala della libreria e il ciclo pittorico'', pp. 290\u2013291.</ref>\n\nFor the single roundels, various and conflicting titles have been proposed over time.<ref group=\"note\">For the principal studies and proposed titles, see  Vasari, Giorgio, ''Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori scultori e architettori'', vol.

See Da Mosto, Andrea, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia: indice generale, storico, descrittivo ed analitico'', vol. I, 1937, Roma, Biblioteca d'arte, p. 217</ref> This involved repairing physical damage to the buildings, hiring new professors, and organizing courses. Over time, their role came to encompass virtually all aspects of public education, including, after 1559, the nomination of the librarian, a patrician chosen for life.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 119</ref> But in 1626, the Senate assumed once again the direct responsibility for the nomination of the librarian whose term was limited in 1775 to three years. The reform of 1626 also established the position of custodian  with the requirement that he be fluent in Greek.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 212\u2013214</ref> Under the ''Riformadori'', the collection was inventoried and first catalogued (1545). For the loaning of the valuable codices, the Council of Ten established stricter conditions which included the requirement of a deposit in gold or silver in the amount of 25 ducats.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., pp. 111\u2013112</ref> This sum, already substantial, was increased to 50 ducats in 1558.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 173</ref> \n\nAfter the [[fall of the Venetian Republic]] to Napoleon in 1797, 470 precious manuscripts, selected from public, religious, and private libraries throughout Venice, were turned over to the French as prizes of war. Of these, 203 were subtracted from the Marciana collection along with two musical scores.<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 352</ref> Six rare ''incunabula'' and 10 important manuscripts were also removed during the first period of Austrian occupation (1798\u20131805).<ref>Zorzi, ''La libreria di san Marco''..., p. 355. As a consequence of the Austrian defeats in 1866 and 1918, most of the volumes were returned as reparations of war.</ref>\n\nIn 1811, during the second period of French occupation (1805\u20131815), the entire collection was moved to the former Hall of the Great Council in the Doge's Palace when the library, as a building, was transformed together with the adjoining Procuratie Nuove into an official residence for the viceroy of the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. It continued to be used in this capacity during the second period of [[Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia|Austrian occupation]] (1815\u20131866), and after the annexation of Venice to the Kingdom of Italy, it came into the possession of the Italian Crown which ceded ownership to the State in 1919.\n\nIn 1904, the collection was moved from the Doge's Palace to the former [[Zecca of Venice|mint]], and in 1924, the Marciana came into possession of the historical rooms of the library. These underwent extensive restoration and in 1929 were reopened to the public. The historical rooms are presently incorporated into the [[Correr Museum]].\n\n==Collection==\n{{See also|Manuscripts in the Biblioteca Marciana}}\n\nThe Venetian government viewed the possession of the valuable codices as a source of civic pride and prestige for the Republic.

In addition to liturgical and theological texts for reference, Bessarion's library initially reflected his particular interests in ancient Greek history, Platonic philosophy, and science, especially astronomy. Some of these texts were brought by Bessarion when he arrived in Italy (1438) for the [[Council of Florence|Council of Ferrara-Florence]]; others were shipped at an unknown later date from the Venetian city of Modone ([[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]), near [[Mystras]] where Bessarion had studied under [[Gemistus Pletho]]. Among the early codices in his collection were works by [[Cyril of Alexandria]], [[Euclid]], [[Ptolemy]], and [[Strabo]], some of which were rare, if not unknown, in Western Europe.<ref>Labowsky, ''Besssarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, pp. 6-7</ref> Elevated to the cardinalate in 1440, Bessarion enjoyed greater financial resources, and he added notable codices that included the precious tenth-century manuscripts of [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]]' works and of Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' that once belonged to the library of Boniface VIII.<ref>Labowsky, ''Besssarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, p. 8</ref>\n\n[[File:VA024RN-0025.jpg|thumb|left|\"Venetus A\", BNM ms Gr.

The manuscript, purchased by Cardinal Bessarion from Giovanni Aurispa, contains the oldest complete text of Homer's epic ''Iliad''.]]\nIn 1454, following the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottoman Turks (1453) and the ensuing devastation, Bessarion charged [[Michael Apostolius]] and Theophanes, bishop of Athens, with the task of locating and purchasing specific works throughout Greece, primarily in Adrianople, Athens, Thessaloniki, Aenos, Gallipoli, and Constantinople, with the objective of preserving the knowledge of the Hellenistic world. He also established a ''[[scriptorium]]'' on Crete, under the direction of Apostolius, where hired scribes copied the texts that could not be found for purchase.<ref>Zorzi, ''Biblioteca Marciana'', p. 18</ref> A similar ''scriptorium'' existed in his Roman residence, Palazzo Colonna near Santi Apostoli, where other texts were copied. Many of the originals were borrowed for this purpose from monasteries in southern Italy, most notably San Nicola di Casole (Apulia), and from [[Fonte Avellana|Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana]] (Marche). These included Bessarion's remarkable discoveries of the ''[[Posthomerica]]'' by [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] and the ''Abduction of Helen'' by [[Coluthus]] which would have otherwise been lost as a result of the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] and the destruction of the library of San Nicola di Casole in 1480.<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 9\u201312</ref> Copyists were also hired and coordinated through the bookseller [[Vespasiano da Bisticci]].\n\nFrom the scholar and book trader [[Giovanni Aurispa]] and subsequently from his nephew and heir, Nardo Palmieri, Bessarion acquired \"[[Venetus A]]\" and \"Venetus B\", the oldest texts of [[Homer]]\u2019s ''[[Iliad]]'' with centuries of [[scholia]], the [[Anthology of Planudes|Anthologia Planudea]] containing 2400 Greek poems, the autograph copy of the commentary on Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'' by [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], the orations of [[Demosthenes]], ''[[Cassius Dio#Roman History|Roman History]]'' by [[Cassius Dio]], the ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Photius, and the only surviving copy of ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'' by [[Athenaeus]].<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., p. 5 and ''passim'' and Zorzi, ''Biblioteca Marciana'', pp. 18\u201319</ref> \n\nSimultaneously, Bessarion assembled a parallel collection of Latin codices with a relative preponderance of works on philosophy (primarily the medieval Platonic and Aristotelian traditions), history, mathematics, and literature. Some of these were purchased during his residence in Bologna (1450\u20131455) or copied from originals in [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]] (Ravenna), including the works by [[Quintilian]], [[Lactantius]], [[Augustine]], and [[Jerome]]. Of particular interest to Bessarion were the Latin historiographers. Among these were [[Livy]] and [[Tacitus]]. The Latin codices also included translations of Greek works, commissioned by Bessarion. Other Latin codices were purchased during his legation to Germany (1460\u20131461), predominately works by [[Nicholas of Lyra]].<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion's Library''..., pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, printed books became increasingly available, and Bessarion began to purchase ''incunabula'', primarily from the printing house of [[Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweynheim]] in Rome. These books included works by [[Cicero]], [[Plutarch]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], Quintilian, and [[Thomas Aquinas]] as well as the Latin translation of Bessarion's own work in defense of Plato, ''Adversus calumniatorem Platonis'' (1469).<ref>Labowsky, ''Bessarion\u2019s Library''\u2026, pp. 17\u201318 and 481\u2013482</ref>\n\nThe Marciana Library now possesses 548 Greek codices, 337 Latin codices, and 27 ''incunabula'' that once belonged to Cardinal Bessarion.<ref>https://marciana.venezia.sbn.it/la-biblioteca/il-patrimonio/patrimonio-librario/fondi/lascito-bessarioneo.

It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, and is a [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] [[metalloid]] and [[semiconductor]]. It is a member of [[carbon group|group 14]] in the periodic table: [[carbon]] is above it; and [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. <!--In 1808, it was given the name ''silicium'' (from {{lang-la|silex}}, hard stone or [[flint]]), with an '''-ium''' word-ending to suggest a [[metal]], a name which the element retains in several languages. The present [[English language|English]] name was first suggested in 1817 to conform with the physically similar elements carbon and [[boron]]. Despite these physical similarities to carbon, however, the chemistry of silicon shows great differences from that of carbon, with silicon oxides being more important than [[polysilane]] compounds, the reverse of the situation for carbon.--> Its melting and boiling points of 1414&nbsp;\u00b0C and 3265&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being only surpassed by [[boron]]. Silicon is the eighth most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|common element]] in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. It is most widely distributed in [[dust]]s, [[sand]]s, [[planetoids]], and [[planet]]s as various forms of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) or [[silicate]]s. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], making silicon the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|second most abundant element]] in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after [[oxygen]].\n\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, and often with little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with [[clays]], [[silica sand]], and [[stone]]. Silicates are used in [[Portland cement]] for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[stucco]], and mixed with silica sand and [[gravel]] to make [[concrete]] for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware [[ceramic]]s such as [[porcelain]], and in traditional [[quartz]]-based [[soda-lime glass]] and many other specialty [[glass]]es. Silicon compounds such as [[silicon carbide]] are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called [[silicone]]s.\n\nThe late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the [[Digital Age]] or [[Information Age]]) due to elemental silicon having a large impact on the modern world economy. The relatively small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in [[semiconductor electronics]] (< 10%) is essential to the [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon]] (MOS) [[transistors]] and [[integrated circuit]] chips used in most modern technology (such as [[computers]] and [[cell phones]], for example). The most widely used silicon device is the [[MOSFET]] (metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistor), which has been manufactured in larger numbers than any other device in history. Free silicon is also used in the [[steel]] refining, [[aluminium]]-casting, and fine chemical industries (often to make [[fumed silica]]).\n\nSilicon is an essential element in biology, although only traces are required by animals. However, various [[sea sponges]] and microorganisms, such as [[diatoms]] and [[radiolaria]], secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.<ref name=\"Cutter\">{{cite book|last=Cutter|first=Elizabeth G.|title=Plant Anatomy.

It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies.

In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration [Ne]3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>2</sup>. Of these, four are [[valence electron]]s, occupying the 3s orbital and two of the 3p orbitals. Like the other members of its group, the lighter [[carbon]] and the heavier [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]], it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals: hence, it can complete its [[octet rule|octet]] and obtain the stable [[noble gas]] configuration of [[argon]] by forming [[orbital hybridization|sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals]], forming tetrahedral SiX<sub>4</sub> derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to.<ref name=King0>King, pp. xiii\u2013xviii</ref> The first four [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of silicon are 786.3, 1576.5, 3228.3, and 4354.4&nbsp;kJ/mol respectively; these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element. Following [[periodic trend]]s, its single-bond covalent radius of 117.6&nbsp;pm is intermediate between those of carbon (77.2&nbsp;pm) and germanium (122.3&nbsp;pm). The hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40&nbsp;pm, although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given the lack of a simple Si<sup>4+</sup> cation in reality.<ref name=Greenwood372>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 372</ref>\n\n====Electrical====\nAt standard temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny [[semiconductor]] with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops as temperature rises. This arises because silicon has a small energy gap ([[band gap]]) between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The [[Fermi level]] is about halfway between the [[valence and conduction bands]] and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is effectively an insulator at room temperature. However, [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] silicon with a [[pnictogen]] such as [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], or [[antimony]] introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an [[Extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type semiconductor]]. Similarly, doping silicon with a [[boron group|group 13 element]] such as [[boron]], [[aluminium]], or [[gallium]] results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type semiconductor]].<ref name=Greenwood331/> ((<!-- this could be move to electronic applications --> Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a [[p-n junction]] with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a [[diode]] that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A [[transistor]] is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a [[triode]] amplifier.<ref name=Greenwood331/>))\n\n====Crystal structure====\nSilicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions, specifically in a [[diamond cubic]] lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414&nbsp;\u00b0C, as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing [[coordination number]] with pressure, culminating in a [[hexagonal close-packed]] allotrope at about 40&nbsp;[[gigapascal]]s known as Si\u2013VII (the standard modification being Si\u2013I). Silicon boils at 3265&nbsp;\u00b0C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener [[carbon]] sublimes (3642&nbsp;\u00b0C) and silicon similarly has a lower [[heat of vaporisation]] than carbon, consistent with the fact that the Si\u2013Si bond is weaker than the C\u2013C bond.<ref name=Greenwood331/>\n\nIt is also possible to construct [[silicene]] layers analogous to [[graphene]].<ref name=Aufray2010/><ref name=Lalmi2010/>\n\n===Isotopes===\n{{Main|Isotopes of silicon}}\nNaturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s, <sup>28</sup>Si (92.23%), <sup>29</sup>Si (4.67%), and <sup>30</sup>Si (3.10%).{{NUBASE2016|ref}} Out of these, only <sup>29</sup>Si is of use in [[NMR]] and [[EPR spectroscopy]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/aj39/NMRmap.cgi|accessdate = 2011-10-20| title = Interactive NMR Frequency Map| author =Jerschow, Alexej|publisher = New York University}}</ref> as it is the only one with a nuclear spin (''I'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}).<ref name=Greenwood330>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 330\u2013331</ref> All three are produced in stars through the [[oxygen-burning process]], with <sup>28</sup>Si being made as part of the [[alpha process]] and hence the most abundant.

Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>) that protects the metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900&nbsp;\u00b0C, but formation of the [[vitreous lustre|vitreous]] dioxide rapidly increases between 950&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1160&nbsp;\u00b0C and when 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C is reached, atmospheric [[nitrogen]] also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Silicon reacts with gaseous [[sulfur]] at 600&nbsp;\u00b0C and gaseous [[phosphorus]] at 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the [[halogen]]s; [[fluorine]] attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, [[chlorine]] does so at about 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] at about 500&nbsp;\u00b0C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form [[silicate]]s. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with [[alkyl halide]]s; this reaction may be catalysed by [[copper]] to directly synthesise [[organosilicon]] chlorides as precursors to [[silicone]] polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive, alloying with most metals to form [[silicide]]s, and reducing most metal oxides because the [[heat of formation]] of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of [[refractory]], unreactive materials such as [[zirconium dioxide]] or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.<ref name=Greenwood331>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 331\u2013335</ref>\n\nTetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise so well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon,<ref name=Kaupp>{{cite journal |last=Kaupp |first=Martin |date=1 December 2006 |title=The role of radial nodes of atomic orbitals for chemical bonding and the periodic table |url=http://depa.fquim.unam.mx/amyd/archivero/LecturasobreNodosRadiales_12854.pdf |journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=320\u2013325 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20522 |pmid=17143872 |access-date=14 October 2016|bibcode=1984JCoCh...5..500B }}</ref> and thus octahedral coordination is also significant.<ref name=Greenwood331/> For example, the [[electronegativity]] of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward [[catenation]] (formation of Si\u2013Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon, due to the concomitant weakening of the Si\u2013Si bond compared to the C\u2013C bond:<ref name=King43>King, pp. 43\u201344</ref> the average Si\u2013Si bond energy is approximately 226&nbsp;kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356&nbsp;kJ/mol for the C\u2013C bond.<ref name=Greenwood374>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 374</ref> This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the [[double bond rule]]. On the other hand, the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the possibility of [[hypervalence]], as seen in five and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as {{chem|SiX|5|-}} and {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.<ref name=King43/> Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior, particularly in the behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a [[metalloid]] rather than a nonmetal.<ref name=King43/> However, metallicity does not become clear in group 14 until germanium and dominant until tin, with the growing importance of the lower +2 oxidation state.<ref name=Greenwood328/>\n\nSilicon shows clear differences from carbon. For example, [[organic chemistry]] has very few analogies with silicon chemistry, while [[silicate]] minerals have a structural complexity unseen in [[oxocarbon]]s.<ref name=Greenwood328>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 328\u2013329</ref> Silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon, and this resemblance is enhanced by the [[d-block contraction]], resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict.<ref name=Greenwood372/> Nevertheless, there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon, which result in germanium being significantly more metallic than silicon. Additionally, the lower Ge\u2013O bond strength compared to the Si\u2013O bond strength results in the absence of \"germanone\" polymers that would be analogous to [[silicone]] polymers.<ref name=Greenwood374/>\n\n===Silicides===\n{{main|Silicide|Binary compounds of silicon}}\n[[File:Diagramme binaire Fe Si analyse thermique 30.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Phase diagram of the Fe\u2013Si system]]\nMany metal [[silicide]]s are known, most of which have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]: their bonding ranges from [[metallic bond|metallic]] to [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]]. Some known stoichiometries are M<sub>6</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si, M<sub>4</sub>Si, M<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, MSi, M<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>, MSi<sub>2</sub>, MSi<sub>3</sub>, and MSi<sub>6</sub>. They are structurally more similar to the [[boride]]s than the [[carbide]]s, in keeping with the [[diagonal relationship]] between [[boron]] and silicon, although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The heats of formation of the silicides are usually similar to those of the borides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower temperatures.<ref name=Greenwood335>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 335\u2013337</ref> Silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1\u201310, with the exception of [[beryllium]]: in particular, [[uranium]] and the transition metals of groups 4\u201310 show the widest range of stoichiometries. Except for [[copper]], the metals in groups 11\u201315 do not form silicides. Instead, most form [[eutectic mixture]]s, although the heaviest [[post-transition metal]]s [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[thallium]], [[lead]], and [[bismuth]] are completely immiscible with liquid silicon.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\nUsually, silicides are prepared by direct reaction of the elements. For example, the [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, and most of these compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal silicides {{chem|(M|+|)|4|(Si|4|4-|)}} contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the {{chem|Si|4|4-}} anion, isoelectronic with [[white phosphorus]], P<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=Greenwood335/><ref name=King45>King, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms (e. g. Cu<sub>5</sub>Si); with increasing silicon content, catenation increases, resulting in isolated clusters of two (e. g. U<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>) or four silicon atoms (e. g. [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>4</sub>[Si<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>) at first, followed by chains (e. g. CaSi), layers (e. g. CaSi<sub>2</sub>), or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e. g. \u03b1-ThSi<sub>2</sub>) as the silicon content rises even higher.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\nThe silicides of the group 1 and 2 metals usually are more reactive than the transition metal silicides. The latter usually do not react with aqueous reagents, except for [[hydrofluoric acid]]; however, they do react with much more aggressive reagents such as liquid [[potassium hydroxide]], or gaseous fluorine or [[chlorine]] when red-hot. The pre-transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous acids, usually producing hydrogen or silanes:<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n:Na<sub>2</sub>Si + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>\n:Mg<sub>2</sub>Si + 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub> + SiH<sub>4</sub>\nProducts often vary with the stoichiometry of the silicide reactant. For example, Ca<sub>2</sub>Si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-PbCl<sub>2</sub> structure with single isolated silicon atoms, and reacts with water to produce [[calcium hydroxide]], hydrated silicon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. CaSi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric SiH<sub>2</sub>, while CaSi<sub>2</sub> with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water, but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid: the product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\n===Silanes===\n{{main|Silanes}}\nSpeculation on silicon hydride chemistry started in the 1830s, contemporary with the development of synthetic [[organic chemistry]]. [[Silane]] itself, as well as [[trichlorosilane]], were first synthesised by [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] and [[Heinrich Buff]] in 1857 by reacting aluminium\u2013silicon alloys with [[hydrochloric acid]], and characterised as SiH<sub>4</sub> and SiHCl<sub>3</sub> by [[Charles Friedel]] and [[Albert Ladenburg]] in 1867. [[Disilane]] (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) followed in 1902, when it was first made by [[Henri Moissan]] and [[Samuel Smiles]] by the [[protonolysis]] of [[magnesium silicide]]s. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that [[Alfred Stock]] began to study silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the [[borane|boron hydrides]]. The names ''silanes'' and ''boranes'' are his, based on analogy with the [[alkane]]s.<ref name=Greenwood337/><ref>E. Wiber, [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1977/pdf/4906x0691.pdf Alfred Stock and the Renaissance of Inorganic Chemistry],\" ''Pure Appl. Chem.'', Vol. 49 (1977) pp. 691\u2013700.</ref><ref>J. W. Mellor, \"A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry,\" Vol. VI, Longman, Green and Co. (1947) pp. 223\u2013227.</ref> The Moissan and Smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, so that the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]] in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method of producing substituted silanes.<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n\nThe silanes comprise a [[homologous series]] of silicon hydrides with a general formula of Si<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub>. They are all strong [[reducing agent]]s. Unbranched and branched chains are known up to ''n''=8, and the cycles Si<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub> and Si<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub> are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after the passage of eight months).<ref name=Greenwood337/> They decompose to form polymeric [[polysilicon hydride]] and hydrogen gas.<ref>W. W. Porterfield, Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, 2nd Ed.\", Academic Press (1993), p. 219.</ref><ref>Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, John Wiley & Sons (2001) p. 844.</ref> As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more so than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because of the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitating [[nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]] at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si\u2013H bond compared to the C\u2013H bond, and the ability of silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's [[activation energy]].<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n\nSilane [[pyrolysis]] gives polymeric species and finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially produced by the pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C\u2013H or C\u2013C bond and the formation of radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating [[silylene]]s :SiH<sub>2</sub> or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210&nbsp;kJ/mol) is much less than the Si\u2013Si and Si\u2013H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in [[methanol]], controlled solvolysis results in the products SiH<sub>2</sub>(OMe)<sub>2</sub>, SiH(OMe)<sub>3</sub>, and Si(OMe)<sub>4</sub>. The Si\u2013H bond also adds to [[alkene]]s, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450&nbsp;\u00b0C, silane participates in an [[addition reaction]] with [[acetone]], as well as a [[ring-opening reaction]] with [[ethylene oxide]]. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate [[hydrogen halide]] with an Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid [[silver]] halide in a heated flow reactor:<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n:SiH<sub>4</sub> + 2 AgCl {{overunderset|\u2192|260&nbsp;\u00b0C|&nbsp;}} SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl + HCl + 2 Ag\nAmong the derivatives of silane, [[iodosilane]] (SiH<sub>3</sub>I) and [[potassium silanide]] (KSiH<sub>3</sub>) are very useful synthetic intermediates in the production of more complicated silicon-containing compounds: the latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid containing K<sup>+</sup> cations and {{chem|SiH|3|-}} anions in the [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] structure, and is made by the reduction of silane by [[potassium]] metal.<ref name=King47>King, p. 47</ref> Additionally, the reactive hypervalent species {{chem|SiH|5|-}} is also known.<ref name=Greenwood337/> With suitable organic substituents it is possible to produce stable polysilanes: they have surprisingly high electric conductivities, arising from [[sigma bond|sigma]] delocalisation of the electrons in the chain.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=R.D. |last2=Michl |first2=J. |doi=10.1021/cr00096a006 |title=Polysilane high polymers |journal=[[Chemical Reviews]] |volume=89 |issue=6| pages=1359 |year=1989 |pmid= |pmc =}}</ref>\n\n===Halides===\nSilicon and [[silicon carbide]] readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, reactive, and volatile silicon tetrahalides.<ref name=Greenwood340>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 340\u20132</ref> [[Silicon tetrafluoride]] also may be made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of [[hydrofluoric acid]] on glass.<ref name=King48/> Heating two different tetrahalides together also produces a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr<sub>3</sub> through SiFClBr<sub>2</sub> to SiFCl<sub>2</sub>Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements is illustrated by the change from an infinite ionic structure in [[aluminium fluoride]] to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom.<ref name=Greenwood340/> [[Silicon tetrachloride]] is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon [[ester]]s.<ref name=Greenwood340/> The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks.<ref name=King48>King, p. 48</ref> The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess [[hydrofluoric acid]] produces the octahedral [[Hexafluorosilicic acid|hexafluorosilicate]] anion {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.<ref name=King48/>\n\nAnalogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes Si<sub>''n''</sub>X<sub>2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub> also are known. While catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds rather than the halides, the opposite is true for silicon, so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least Si<sub>14</sub>F<sub>30</sub>, Si<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>14</sub>, and Si<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>10</sub>. A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by [[pi backbonding]] from the filled p<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty d<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of [[carbon monoxide]] in [[metal carbonyl complex]]es and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by [[comproportionation]] of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes ([[trimethylammonium]] being a useful catalyst for this reaction).<ref name=Greenwood340/>\n\n===Silica===\n[[Silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>), also known as silica, is one of the best-studied compounds, second only to [[properties of water|water]]. Twelve different crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being \u03b1-[[quartz]], a major constituent of many rocks such as [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. It also is known to occur in a pure form as [[rock crystal]]; impure forms are known as [[rose quartz]], [[smoky quartz]], [[morion (mineral)|morion]], [[amethyst]], and [[citrine quartz|citrine]]. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[carnelian]], [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], [[heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], and [[flint]]. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]], as well as the much less common [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]]. Biologically generated forms are also known as [[kieselguhr]] and [[diatomaceous earth]]. [[Vitrification|Vitreous]] silicon dioxide is known as [[tektite]]s, and [[obsidian]], and rarely as [[lechatelierite]]. Some synthetic forms are known as [[keatite]] and [[W-silica]]. [[Opal]]s are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.<ref name=Greenwood342>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 342\u2013347</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|Quartz\nFile:Quartz - Agateplate, redbrown-white.jpg|Agate\nFile:Tridymite tabulars - Ochtendung, Eifel, Germany.jpg|Tridymite\nFile:Cristobalite-Fayalite-40048.jpg|Cristobalite\nFile:Coesiteimage.jpg|Coesite\n</gallery>\n\nMost crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra (with Si at the center) connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, \u03b1-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si\u2013O distances (159.7 and 161.7&nbsp;pm) with a Si\u2013O\u2013Si angle of 144\u00b0. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual \u03b1-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537&nbsp;\u00b0C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar \u03b2-quartz, with a change of the Si\u2013O\u2013Si angle to 155\u00b0 but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867&nbsp;\u00b0C results in another reversible phase transition to \u03b2-tridymite, in which some Si\u2013O bonds are broken to allow for the arrangement of the {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120&nbsp;\u00b0C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to \u03b1-tridymite, similarly to the transition from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz. \u03b2-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic \u03b2-cristobalite at about 1470&nbsp;\u00b0C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200\u2013280&nbsp;\u00b0C to \u03b1-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. \u03b2-cristobalite melts at 1713&nbsp;\u00b0C; the freezing of silica from the melt is quite slow and [[vitrification]], or the formation of a [[glass]], is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt \u03b2-quartz (1550&nbsp;\u00b0C) or \u03b2-tridymite (1703&nbsp;\u00b0C). Silica boils at approximately 2800&nbsp;\u00b0C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following [[lightning]] strikes, forming glassy [[lechatelierite]]. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to [[silicon disulfide]] (SiS<sub>2</sub>) and [[silicon diselenide]] (SiSe<sub>2</sub>): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430 H2SiO3.JPG|thumb|Condensed polysilicic acid]]\nSilica is rather inert chemically. It is not attacked by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis, and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates, to give metal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine at room temperature to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but require temperatures over 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and [[metalloid]] oxides to form a wide variety of compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all, but also have many other uses: for example, [[sodium silicate]] is often used in detergents due to its [[buffer (chemistry)|buffering]], [[saponification|saponifying]], and [[emulsification|emulsifying]] properties.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n===Silicic acids===\nAdding water to silica drops its melting point by around 800&nbsp;\u00b0C due to the breaking of the structure by replacing Si\u2013O\u2013Si linkages with terminating Si\u2013OH groups. Increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated [[silica gel]]s and [[colloid]]al silica dispersions. Many hydrates and [[silicic acid]]s exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions, but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross-link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula [SiO<sub>''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>4\u22122''x''</sub>]<sub>''n''</sub>, similar to the behaviour of [[boron]], [[aluminium]], and [[iron]], among other elements. Hence, although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as [[orthosilicic acid]] Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> and [[metasilicic acid]] SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, none of these are likely to exist in the solid state.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n===Silicate minerals===\n{{main|Silicate minerals}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-top:0; margin-left:1em; text-align:center; font-size:10pt; line-height:11pt; width:25%;\"\n|+ style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\" | Typical coordination of metal cations in silicates (ionic radii in [[picometre|pm]])<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n|-\n!

Tetrahedral {SiO<sub>4</sub>} units are common to almost all these compounds, either as discrete structures, or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms. These may be divided into ''neso''-silicates (discrete {SiO<sub>4</sub>} units) sharing no oxygen atoms, ''soro''-silicates (discrete {Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>} units) sharing one, ''cyclo''-silicates (closed ring structures) and ''ino''-silicates (continuous chain or ribbon structures) both sharing two, ''phyllo''-silicates (continuous sheets) sharing three, and ''tecto''-silicates (continuous three-dimensional frameworks) sharing four. The lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close-packed, or close to it, with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size.<ref name=Greenwood347>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 347\u2013359</ref>\n\nThe [[orthosilicate]]s M{{su|p=II|b=2}}SiO{{su|b=4}} (M = Be, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) and ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> are ''neso''-silicates. Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> ([[phenacite]]) is unusual as both Be<sup>II</sup> and Si<sup>IV</sup> occupy tetrahedral four-coordinated sites; the other divalent cations instead occupy six-coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously replace each other as in [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe,Mn)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. [[Zircon]], ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, demands eight-coordination of the Zr<sup>IV</sup> cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius (84&nbsp;pm). Also significant are the [[garnet]]s, [M{{su|p=II|b=3}}M{{su|p=III|b=2}}(SiO{{su|b=4}}){{su|b=3}}], in which the divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe) are eight-coordinated and the trivalent ones are six-coordinated (e.g. Al, Cr, Fe). Regular coordination is not always present: for example, it is not found in Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, which mixes six- and eight-coordinate sites for Ca<sup>II</sup>. ''Soro''-silicates, involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units, are quite rare: metasilicates involving cyclic \"[(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub>]<sup>2''n''\u2212</sup>\" units of corner-abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\nChain metasilicates, {SiO{{su|p=2\u2212|b=3}}}{{su|b=\u221e}}, form by corner-sharing of an indefinite chain of linked {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra. Many differences arise due to the differing repeat distances of conformation across the line of tetrahedra. A repeat distance of two is most common, as in most [[pyroxene]] minerals, but repeat distances of one, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, and twelve are also known. These chains may then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons, as in the [[asbestos]] minerals, involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\n[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|right|A typical zeolite structure]]\nLayer silicates, such as the clay minerals and the [[mica]]s, are very common, and often are formed by horizontal cross-linking of metasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units. An example is [[kaolinite]] [Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]; in many of these minerals cation and anion replacement is common, so that for example tetrahedral Si<sup>IV</sup> may be replaced by Al<sup>III</sup>, octahedral Al<sup>III</sup> by Mg<sup>II</sup>, and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> by F<sup>\u2212</sup>. Three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex; they may be conceived of as starting from the SiO<sub>2</sub> structure, but having replaced up to one-half of the Si<sup>IV</sup> atoms with Al<sup>III</sup>, they require more cations to be included in the structure to balance charge. Examples include [[feldspar]]s (the most abundant minerals on the Earth), [[zeolite]]s, and [[ultramarine]]s. Many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\u2013KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\u2013CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting Al<sup>III</sup> to undergo six-coordination rather than four-coordination, and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity]], which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition, but different lattices, although this is not a universally held view. Zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks ([[truncated cuboctahedron|truncated cuboctahedra]] being most common, but other polyhedra also are known as zeolite cavities), allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure. Ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{chem|SO|4|2-}}, and {{chem|S|2|2-}}, but are otherwise similar to the feldspars.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\n===Other inorganic compounds===\n[[Silicon disulfide]] (SiS<sub>2</sub>) is formed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C; sublimation of the resulting compound in nitrogen results in white, flexible long fibers reminiscent of [[asbestos]] with a structure similar to W-silica. This melts at 1090&nbsp;\u00b0C and sublimes at 1250&nbsp;\u00b0C; at high temperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to cristobalite. However, SiS<sub>2</sub> lacks the variety of structures of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and quickly hydrolyses to silica and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. It is also ammonolysed quickly and completely by liquid [[ammonia]] as follows to form an [[imide]]:<ref name=Greenwood359>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 359\u2013361</ref>\n:SiS<sub>2</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Si(NH)<sub>2</sub> + 2 NH<sub>4</sub>SH\nIt reacts with the sulfides of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron to form metal [[thiosilicate]]s: reaction with [[ethanol]] results in [[tetraethylsilicate]] Si(OEt)<sub>4</sub> and hydrogen sulfide. Ethylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film-like forms of silica. Reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides yields silicon thiohalides such as S(SiCl)<sub>3</sub>, cyclic Cl<sub>2</sub>Si(\u03bc-S)<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>, and crystalline (SiSCl<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Despite the [[double bond rule]], stable organosilanethiones RR'Si=S have been made thanks to the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an [[amine]] group.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\n[[Silicon nitride]], Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, may be formed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a more economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500&nbsp;\u00b0C. It would make a promising [[ceramic]] if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it: chemically, it is near-totally inert, and even above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C it keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion. It is very hard (9 on the [[Mohs hardness scale]]), dissociates only at 1900&nbsp;\u00b0C at 1&nbsp;atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite (Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>). A similar refractory material is Si<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450&nbsp;\u00b0C in an argon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear Si\u2013O\u2013Si linkages to each other.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\nReacting silyl halides with ammonia or alkylammonia derivatives in the gaseous phase or in ethanolic solution produces various volatile silylamides, which are silicon analogues of the [[amine]]s:<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n:3 SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl\n:SiH<sub>3</sub>Br + 2 Me<sub>2</sub>NH \u2192 SiH<sub>3</sub>NMe<sub>2</sub> + Me<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>Br\n:4 SiH<sub>3</sub>I + 5 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> \u2192 (SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NN(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 4 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I\n\nMany such compounds have been prepared, the only known restriction being that the nitrogen is always tertiary, and species containing the SiH\u2013NH group are unstable at room temperature. The stoichiometry around the nitrogen atom in compounds such as N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>is planar, which has been attributed to a p<sub>\u03c0</sub>\u2013d<sub>\u03c0</sub> interaction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty d<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbital on silicon. Similarly, trisilylamines are weaker as ligands than their carbon analogues, the tertiary [[amine]]s, although substitution of some SiH<sub>3</sub> groups by CH<sub>3</sub> groups mitigates this weakness. For example, N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> does not form an [[adduct]] with [[borane|BH<sub>3</sub>]] at all, while MeN(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Me<sub>2</sub>NSiH<sub>3</sub> form adducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming. Some silicon analogues of [[imine]]s, with a Si=N double bond, are known: the first found was Bu<sup>''t''</sup><sub>2</sub>Si=N\u2013SiBu<sup>''t''</sup><sub>3</sub>, which was discovered in 1986.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\n[[File:SiC p1390066.jpg|thumb|right|Silicon carbide]]\n[[Silicon carbide]] (SiC) was first made by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]] in 1891, who named it carborundum to reference its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between [[diamond]] (an allotrope of carbon) and [[corundum]] ([[aluminium oxide]]).

It is resistant to most aqueous acids, [[phosphoric acid]] being an exception. It forms a protective layer of [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface and hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl<sub>4</sub> and carbon at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C and SiCl<sub>4</sub> and [[carbon tetrachloride|CCl<sub>4</sub>]] at 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory material, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped.<ref name=Greenwood334/> In its diamond-like behavior it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n===Organosilicon compounds===\n{{main|Organosilicon}}\n[[Image:HydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png|upright=1.8|thumb|right|A hydrosilylation reaction, in which Si\u2013H is added to an unsaturated substrate]]\nBecause the Si\u2013C bond is close in strength to the C\u2013C bond, organosilicon compounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable. For example, [[tetraphenylsilane]] (SiPh<sub>4</sub>) may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428&nbsp;\u00b0C, and so may its substituted derivatives Ph<sub>3</sub>SiCl and Ph<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>, which boil at 378&nbsp;\u00b0C and 305&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively. Furthermore, since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners, organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry, for example in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds.<ref name=Greenwood361>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 361\u2013366</ref> However, significant differences also arise: since silicon is more electropositive than carbon, bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon, and vice versa. Thus the Si\u2013F bond is significantly stronger than even the [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond|C\u2013F bond]] and is one of the strongest single bonds, while the Si\u2013H bond is much weaker than the C\u2013H bond and is readily broken. Furthermore, the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon, and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues. For example, nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] or [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1]] processes, but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom. This works for silicon, unlike for carbon, because the long Si\u2013C bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack, unlike for example a C\u2013O \u03c3* antibonding orbital. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the mechanism is still often called \"S<sub>N</sub>2 at silicon\" for simplicity.<ref name=Clayden668>Clayden, pp. 668\u201377</ref>\n\nOne of the most useful silicon-containing groups is [[trimethylsilyl]], Me<sub>3</sub>Si\u2013. The Si\u2013C bond connecting it to the rest of the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the [[fluoride]] ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may be compared to acidic [[proton]]s; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, [[selenium]], or [[iodine]]), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in [[haloalkane]]s, but at the oxygen in [[silyl]] chlorides; and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the [[silyl ether]] [[hexamethyldisiloxane]], (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>2</sub>O. Conversely, while the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (\u03b4+) at the carbon, the analogous \"S<sub>N</sub>2\" reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl [[triflate]]s are so electrophilic that they react 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] is in particular a very good [[Lewis acid]] and is used to convert [[carbonyl]] compounds to [[acetal]]s and [[silyl enol ether]]s, reacting them together analogously to the [[aldol reaction]].<ref name=Clayden668/>\n\nSi\u2013C bonds are commonly formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often carried out in small quantities by reacting [[tetrachlorosilane]] (silicon tetrachloride) with [[organolithium]], [[Grignard reagent|Grignard]], or [[organoaluminium]] reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si\u2013H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic [[copper]] as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n===Silicone polymers===\n{{main|Silicone}}\n[[File:PmdsStructure.png|thumb|right|Structure of [[polydimethylsiloxane]], the principal component of silicones]]\nThe word \"silicone\" was first used by Frederic Kipping in 1901. He invented the word to illustrate the similarity of chemical formulae between Ph<sub>2</sub>SiO and [[benzophenone]], Ph<sub>2</sub>CO, although he also stressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of Ph<sub>2</sub>SiO, which is not shared by Ph<sub>2</sub>CO.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\nSilicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates, in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the [[isoelectronic]] O<sup>\u2212</sup> of the silicates.<ref name=Greenwood361/> They are quite stable to extreme temperatures, oxidation, and water, and have useful dielectric, antistick, and antifoam properties. Furthermore, they are resistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering, and are inert physiologically. They are fairly unreactive, but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents, and occasionally, may even be used as mild reagents for selective syntheses. For example, (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>2</sub>O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of [[molybdenum]] and [[tungsten]] oxyhalides, converting a [[tungsten hexachloride]] suspension in [[dichloroethane]] solution quantitatively to WOCl<sub>4</sub> in under an hour at room temperature, and then to yellow WO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:Olivine-gem7-10a.jpg|thumb|upright|Olivine]]\nIn the universe, silicon is the seventh most abundant element, coming after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[neon]]. These abundances are not replicated well on Earth due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the [[Solar System]]. Silicon makes up 27.2% of the Earth's crust by weight, second only to oxygen at 45.5%, with which it always is associated in nature. Further fractionation took place in the formation of the Earth by [[planetary differentiation]]: [[Earth's core]], which makes up 31.5% of the mass of the Earth, has approximate composition Fe<sub>25</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>; the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] makes up 68.1% of the Earth's mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates, an example being [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>; while the lighter siliceous minerals such as [[aluminosilicate]]s rise to the surface and form the crust, making up 0.4% of the Earth's mass.<ref name=Greenwood329>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 329\u2013330</ref>\n\nThe crystallisation of [[igneous rock]]s from magma depends on a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as [[lattice energy]], melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, [[olivine]] appears first, followed by [[pyroxene]], [[amphibole]], [[biotite]] mica, [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[muscovite mica]], [[quartz]], [[zeolite]]s, and finally, hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of [[hydroxide]] and [[fluoride]] anions in addition to oxides. Many metals may substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo [[weathering]], transport, and deposition, [[sedimentary rock]]s like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. [[Metamorphism]] also may occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.<ref name=Greenwood329/>\n\n==Production==\nSilicon of 96\u201399% purity is made by reducing [[quartzite]] or sand with highly pure [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. The reduction is carried out in an [[electric arc furnace]], with an excess of SiO<sub>2</sub> used to stop [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) from accumulating:<ref name=Greenwood330/>\n:SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 C \u2192 Si + 2 CO\n:2 SiC + SiO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 3 Si + 2 CO\n\n[[File:Ferrosilicon.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Ferrosilicon alloy]]\nThis reaction, known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, usually is conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], producing [[ferrosilicon]].<ref name=Greenwood330/> Ferrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world's production of elemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon, providing 4.6 million [[tonne]]s (or 2/3 of world output) of silicon, most of it in the form of ferrosilicon. It is followed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t), and the United States (170,000 t).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/mcs-2011-simet.pdf |publisher=USGS |title=Silicon Commodities Report 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry (see below) with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants.<ref name=Greenwood330/> Another reaction, sometimes used, is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, as follows:<ref name=Ullmann574>Zulehner et al., p. 574</ref>\n:3 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4 Al \u2192 3 Si + 2 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n\nLeaching powdered 96\u201397% pure silicon with water results in ~98.5% pure silicon, which is used in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of [[tetrachlorosilane]] (silicon tetrachloride) or [[trichlorosilane]]. The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of [[silicone]] production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated [[fractional distillation]], followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure [[zinc]] metal as the reducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by [[zone refining]]. Other routes use the thermal decomposition of [[silane]] or [[tetraiodosilane]] ({{chem|SiI|4}}). Another process used is the reduction of [[sodium hexafluorosilicate]], a common waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry, by metallic [[sodium]]: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material: [[transistor]] production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 10<sup>10</sup>, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 10<sup>12</sup> are needed and attained.<ref name=Greenwood330/>\n\n==Applications==\n===Compounds===\nMost silicon is used industrially without being purified, and indeed, often with comparatively little processing from its natural form. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, [[silica]] sand, and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making [[Portland cement]] (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in [[mortar (masonry)|building mortar]] and modern [[stucco]], but more importantly, combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals such as granite), to make the [[concrete]] that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.<ref name=Greenwood356>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 356.</ref>\n\nSilica is used to make [[fire brick]], a type of ceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware [[ceramic]]s, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired [[clay]] minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is [[porcelain]], which is based on the silicate mineral [[kaolinite]]. Traditional [[glass]] (silica-based [[soda-lime glass]]) also functions in many of the same ways, and also is used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based [[glass fiber]]s are used for [[optical fiber]], as well as to produce [[fiberglass]] for structural support and [[glass wool]] for thermal insulation.\n\nSilicones often are used in [[waterproofing]] treatments, [[molding (process)|molding]] compounds, mold-[[release agent]]s, mechanical seals, high temperature [[lubricant|greases]] and waxes, and [[caulking]] compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in [[breast implant]]s, contact lenses, [[explosive]]s and [[pyrotechnics]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/prep.200700021 |title=Special Materials in Pyrotechnics: VI.

Silicon is a component of some [[superalloy]]s.\n\n=== Alloys ===\nElemental silicon is added to molten [[cast iron]] as [[ferrosilicon]] or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of [[cementite]] where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of [[electrical steel]], modifying its [[resistivity]] and [[ferromagnetic]] properties.\n\nThe properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron. \"Metallurgical grade\" silicon is silicon of 95\u201399% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys ([[silumin]] alloys) for aluminium part [[Casting|casts]], mainly for use in the [[automotive industry]]. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a [[eutectic mixture]] which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.<ref name=\"diecasting\">Apelian, D.

In practice, pure silicon is [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge ([[electron hole|positive]] or [[electron|negative]]) of activated carriers.

Silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering [[avalanche breakdown]] (an [[electron avalanche]] is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over [[germanium]] (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.<ref>[http://www.mpoweruk.com/semiconductors.htm Semiconductors Without the Quantum Physics]. Electropaedia</ref>\n\nMonocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production of low-cost, [[large-area electronics]] in applications such as [[liquid crystal display]]s and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film [[solar cells]]. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons per year.<ref name=USGS>Corathers, Lisa A.

The effect can also be achieved in reverse with a donor molecule having its [[highest occupied molecular orbital]] (HOMO) slightly higher than a valance band edge of the quantum dot, allowing electrons to transfer between them, filling the holes and preventing recombination. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs when a complex forms between the quantum dot and a quencher molecule. The complex will continue to absorb light but when the energy is converted to the ground state it does not release a photon, quenching the material. The third method uses different approach by measuring the [[photocurrent]] emitted by the quantum dots instead of monitoring the photoluminescent display. If the concentration of the desired chemical increases then the photocurrent given off by the nanocrystals will change in response.<ref>Yue, Zhao, Fred Lisdat, Wolfgang J. Parak, Stephen G.

It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, and is a [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] [[metalloid]] and [[semiconductor]]. It is a member of [[carbon group|group 14]] in the periodic table: [[carbon]] is above it; and [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius]] was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. <!--In 1808, it was given the name ''silicium'' (from {{lang-la|silex}}, hard stone or [[flint]]), with an '''-ium''' word-ending to suggest a [[metal]], a name which the element retains in several languages. The present [[English language|English]] name was first suggested in 1817 to conform with the physically similar elements carbon and [[boron]]. Despite these physical similarities to carbon, however, the chemistry of silicon shows great differences from that of carbon, with silicon oxides being more important than [[polysilane]] compounds, the reverse of the situation for carbon.--> Its melting and boiling points of 1414&nbsp;\u00b0C and 3265&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively are the second-highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being only surpassed by [[boron]]. Silicon is the eighth most [[Abundance of the chemical elements|common element]] in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs as the pure element in the Earth's crust. It is most widely distributed in [[dust]]s, [[sand]]s, [[planetoids]], and [[planet]]s as various forms of [[silicon dioxide]] (silica) or [[silicate]]s. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], making silicon the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|second most abundant element]] in the Earth's crust (about 28% by mass) after [[oxygen]].\n\nMost silicon is used commercially without being separated, and often with little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with [[clays]], [[silica sand]], and [[stone]]. Silicates are used in [[Portland cement]] for [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and [[stucco]], and mixed with silica sand and [[gravel]] to make [[concrete]] for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware [[ceramic]]s such as [[porcelain]], and in traditional [[quartz]]-based [[soda-lime glass]] and many other specialty [[glass]]es. Silicon compounds such as [[silicon carbide]] are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called [[silicone]]s.\n\nThe late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the [[Digital Age]] or [[Information Age]]) due to elemental silicon having a large impact on the modern world economy. The relatively small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in [[semiconductor electronics]] (< 10%) is essential to the [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon]] (MOS) [[transistors]] and [[integrated circuit]] chips used in most modern technology (such as [[computers]] and [[cell phones]], for example). The most widely used silicon device is the [[MOSFET]] (metal\u2013oxide\u2013silicon field-effect transistor), which has been manufactured in larger numbers than any other device in history. Free silicon is also used in the [[steel]] refining, [[aluminium]]-casting, and fine chemical industries (often to make [[fumed silica]]).\n\nSilicon is an essential element in biology, although only traces are required by animals. However, various [[sea sponges]] and microorganisms, such as [[diatoms]] and [[radiolaria]], secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.<ref name=\"Cutter\">{{cite book|last=Cutter|first=Elizabeth G.|title=Plant Anatomy.

It is extremely probable that barytes, which we have just now arranged with earths, is in this situation; for in many experiments it exhibits properties nearly approaching to those of metallic bodies.

In both cases, pure silicon was produced: the silicon dissolved in the molten aluminium, but crystallized upon cooling. Dissolving the crude aluminum in hydrochloric acid revealed flakes of crystallized silicon.

In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration [Ne]3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>2</sup>. Of these, four are [[valence electron]]s, occupying the 3s orbital and two of the 3p orbitals. Like the other members of its group, the lighter [[carbon]] and the heavier [[germanium]], [[tin]], and [[lead]], it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals: hence, it can complete its [[octet rule|octet]] and obtain the stable [[noble gas]] configuration of [[argon]] by forming [[orbital hybridization|sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals]], forming tetrahedral SiX<sub>4</sub> derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to.<ref name=King0>King, pp. xiii\u2013xviii</ref> The first four [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of silicon are 786.3, 1576.5, 3228.3, and 4354.4&nbsp;kJ/mol respectively; these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element. Following [[periodic trend]]s, its single-bond covalent radius of 117.6&nbsp;pm is intermediate between those of carbon (77.2&nbsp;pm) and germanium (122.3&nbsp;pm). The hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40&nbsp;pm, although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given the lack of a simple Si<sup>4+</sup> cation in reality.<ref name=Greenwood372>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 372</ref>\n\n====Electrical====\nAt standard temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny [[semiconductor]] with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops as temperature rises. This arises because silicon has a small energy gap ([[band gap]]) between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The [[Fermi level]] is about halfway between the [[valence and conduction bands]] and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is effectively an insulator at room temperature. However, [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] silicon with a [[pnictogen]] such as [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], or [[antimony]] introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an [[Extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type semiconductor]]. Similarly, doping silicon with a [[boron group|group 13 element]] such as [[boron]], [[aluminium]], or [[gallium]] results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type semiconductor]].<ref name=Greenwood331/> ((<!-- this could be move to electronic applications --> Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a [[p-n junction]] with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a [[diode]] that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A [[transistor]] is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a [[triode]] amplifier.<ref name=Greenwood331/>))\n\n====Crystal structure====\nSilicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions, specifically in a [[diamond cubic]] lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414&nbsp;\u00b0C, as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing [[coordination number]] with pressure, culminating in a [[hexagonal close-packed]] allotrope at about 40&nbsp;[[gigapascal]]s known as Si\u2013VII (the standard modification being Si\u2013I). Silicon boils at 3265&nbsp;\u00b0C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener [[carbon]] sublimes (3642&nbsp;\u00b0C) and silicon similarly has a lower [[heat of vaporisation]] than carbon, consistent with the fact that the Si\u2013Si bond is weaker than the C\u2013C bond.<ref name=Greenwood331/>\n\nIt is also possible to construct [[silicene]] layers analogous to [[graphene]].<ref name=Aufray2010/><ref name=Lalmi2010/>\n\n===Isotopes===\n{{Main|Isotopes of silicon}}\nNaturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable [[isotope]]s, <sup>28</sup>Si (92.23%), <sup>29</sup>Si (4.67%), and <sup>30</sup>Si (3.10%).{{NUBASE2016|ref}} Out of these, only <sup>29</sup>Si is of use in [[NMR]] and [[EPR spectroscopy]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/aj39/NMRmap.cgi|accessdate = 2011-10-20| title = Interactive NMR Frequency Map| author =Jerschow, Alexej|publisher = New York University}}</ref> as it is the only one with a nuclear spin (''I'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}).<ref name=Greenwood330>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 330\u2013331</ref> All three are produced in stars through the [[oxygen-burning process]], with <sup>28</sup>Si being made as part of the [[alpha process]] and hence the most abundant.

Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>) that protects the metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900&nbsp;\u00b0C, but formation of the [[vitreous lustre|vitreous]] dioxide rapidly increases between 950&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1160&nbsp;\u00b0C and when 1400&nbsp;\u00b0C is reached, atmospheric [[nitrogen]] also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Silicon reacts with gaseous [[sulfur]] at 600&nbsp;\u00b0C and gaseous [[phosphorus]] at 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the [[halogen]]s; [[fluorine]] attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, [[chlorine]] does so at about 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[bromine]] and [[iodine]] at about 500&nbsp;\u00b0C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated [[nitric acid]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form [[silicate]]s. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with [[alkyl halide]]s; this reaction may be catalysed by [[copper]] to directly synthesise [[organosilicon]] chlorides as precursors to [[silicone]] polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive, alloying with most metals to form [[silicide]]s, and reducing most metal oxides because the [[heat of formation]] of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of [[refractory]], unreactive materials such as [[zirconium dioxide]] or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.<ref name=Greenwood331>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 331\u2013335</ref>\n\nTetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise so well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon,<ref name=Kaupp>{{cite journal |last=Kaupp |first=Martin |date=1 December 2006 |title=The role of radial nodes of atomic orbitals for chemical bonding and the periodic table |url=http://depa.fquim.unam.mx/amyd/archivero/LecturasobreNodosRadiales_12854.pdf |journal=Journal of Computational Chemistry |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=320\u2013325 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20522 |pmid=17143872 |access-date=14 October 2016|bibcode=1984JCoCh...5..500B }}</ref> and thus octahedral coordination is also significant.<ref name=Greenwood331/> For example, the [[electronegativity]] of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward [[catenation]] (formation of Si\u2013Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon, due to the concomitant weakening of the Si\u2013Si bond compared to the C\u2013C bond:<ref name=King43>King, pp. 43\u201344</ref> the average Si\u2013Si bond energy is approximately 226&nbsp;kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356&nbsp;kJ/mol for the C\u2013C bond.<ref name=Greenwood374>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 374</ref> This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the [[double bond rule]]. On the other hand, the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the possibility of [[hypervalence]], as seen in five and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as {{chem|SiX|5|-}} and {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.<ref name=King43/> Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior, particularly in the behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a [[metalloid]] rather than a nonmetal.<ref name=King43/> However, metallicity does not become clear in group 14 until germanium and dominant until tin, with the growing importance of the lower +2 oxidation state.<ref name=Greenwood328/>\n\nSilicon shows clear differences from carbon. For example, [[organic chemistry]] has very few analogies with silicon chemistry, while [[silicate]] minerals have a structural complexity unseen in [[oxocarbon]]s.<ref name=Greenwood328>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 328\u2013329</ref> Silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon, and this resemblance is enhanced by the [[d-block contraction]], resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict.<ref name=Greenwood372/> Nevertheless, there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon, which result in germanium being significantly more metallic than silicon. Additionally, the lower Ge\u2013O bond strength compared to the Si\u2013O bond strength results in the absence of \"germanone\" polymers that would be analogous to [[silicone]] polymers.<ref name=Greenwood374/>\n\n===Silicides===\n{{main|Silicide|Binary compounds of silicon}}\n[[File:Diagramme binaire Fe Si analyse thermique 30.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Phase diagram of the Fe\u2013Si system]]\nMany metal [[silicide]]s are known, most of which have formulae that cannot be explained through simple appeals to [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]: their bonding ranges from [[metallic bond|metallic]] to [[ionic bond|ionic]] and [[covalent bond|covalent]]. Some known stoichiometries are M<sub>6</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si, M<sub>4</sub>Si, M<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>Si, M<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, MSi, M<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>, MSi<sub>2</sub>, MSi<sub>3</sub>, and MSi<sub>6</sub>. They are structurally more similar to the [[boride]]s than the [[carbide]]s, in keeping with the [[diagonal relationship]] between [[boron]] and silicon, although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The heats of formation of the silicides are usually similar to those of the borides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower temperatures.<ref name=Greenwood335>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 335\u2013337</ref> Silicides are known for all stable elements in groups 1\u201310, with the exception of [[beryllium]]: in particular, [[uranium]] and the transition metals of groups 4\u201310 show the widest range of stoichiometries. Except for [[copper]], the metals in groups 11\u201315 do not form silicides. Instead, most form [[eutectic mixture]]s, although the heaviest [[post-transition metal]]s [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[thallium]], [[lead]], and [[bismuth]] are completely immiscible with liquid silicon.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\nUsually, silicides are prepared by direct reaction of the elements. For example, the [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s react with silicon or silicon oxide to give silicides. Nevertheless, even with these highly electropositive elements true silicon anions are not obtainable, and most of these compounds are semiconductors. For example, the alkali metal silicides {{chem|(M|+|)|4|(Si|4|4-|)}} contain pyramidal tricoordinate silicon in the {{chem|Si|4|4-}} anion, isoelectronic with [[white phosphorus]], P<sub>4</sub>.<ref name=Greenwood335/><ref name=King45>King, pp. 45\u201347</ref> Metal-rich silicides tend to have isolated silicon atoms (e. g. Cu<sub>5</sub>Si); with increasing silicon content, catenation increases, resulting in isolated clusters of two (e. g. U<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>) or four silicon atoms (e. g. [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>4</sub>[Si<sub>4</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup>) at first, followed by chains (e. g. CaSi), layers (e. g. CaSi<sub>2</sub>), or three-dimensional networks of silicon atoms spanning space (e. g. \u03b1-ThSi<sub>2</sub>) as the silicon content rises even higher.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\nThe silicides of the group 1 and 2 metals usually are more reactive than the transition metal silicides. The latter usually do not react with aqueous reagents, except for [[hydrofluoric acid]]; however, they do react with much more aggressive reagents such as liquid [[potassium hydroxide]], or gaseous fluorine or [[chlorine]] when red-hot. The pre-transition metal silicides instead readily react with water and aqueous acids, usually producing hydrogen or silanes:<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n:Na<sub>2</sub>Si + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>\n:Mg<sub>2</sub>Si + 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 2 MgSO<sub>4</sub> + SiH<sub>4</sub>\nProducts often vary with the stoichiometry of the silicide reactant. For example, Ca<sub>2</sub>Si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-PbCl<sub>2</sub> structure with single isolated silicon atoms, and reacts with water to produce [[calcium hydroxide]], hydrated silicon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. CaSi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric SiH<sub>2</sub>, while CaSi<sub>2</sub> with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water, but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid: the product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O.<ref name=Greenwood335/>\n\n===Silanes===\n{{main|Silanes}}\nSpeculation on silicon hydride chemistry started in the 1830s, contemporary with the development of synthetic [[organic chemistry]]. [[Silane]] itself, as well as [[trichlorosilane]], were first synthesised by [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] and [[Heinrich Buff]] in 1857 by reacting aluminium\u2013silicon alloys with [[hydrochloric acid]], and characterised as SiH<sub>4</sub> and SiHCl<sub>3</sub> by [[Charles Friedel]] and [[Albert Ladenburg]] in 1867. [[Disilane]] (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) followed in 1902, when it was first made by [[Henri Moissan]] and [[Samuel Smiles]] by the [[protonolysis]] of [[magnesium silicide]]s. Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that [[Alfred Stock]] began to study silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the [[borane|boron hydrides]]. The names ''silanes'' and ''boranes'' are his, based on analogy with the [[alkane]]s.<ref name=Greenwood337/><ref>E. Wiber, [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1977/pdf/4906x0691.pdf Alfred Stock and the Renaissance of Inorganic Chemistry],\" ''Pure Appl. Chem.'', Vol. 49 (1977) pp. 691\u2013700.</ref><ref>J. W. Mellor, \"A Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry,\" Vol. VI, Longman, Green and Co. (1947) pp. 223\u2013227.</ref> The Moissan and Smiles method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via protonolysis of metal silicides is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, so that the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as [[lithium aluminium hydride]] in etheric solutions at low temperatures. Direct reaction of HX or RX with silicon, possibly with a catalyst such as copper, is also a viable method of producing substituted silanes.<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n\nThe silanes comprise a [[homologous series]] of silicon hydrides with a general formula of Si<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub>. They are all strong [[reducing agent]]s. Unbranched and branched chains are known up to ''n''=8, and the cycles Si<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub> and Si<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub> are also known. The first two, silane and disilane, are colourless gases; the heavier members of the series are volatile liquids. All silanes are very reactive and catch fire or explode spontaneously in air. They become less thermally stable with room temperature, so that only silane is indefinitely stable at room temperature, although disilane does not decompose very quickly (only 2.5% of a sample decomposes after the passage of eight months).<ref name=Greenwood337/> They decompose to form polymeric [[polysilicon hydride]] and hydrogen gas.<ref>W. W. Porterfield, Inorganic Chemistry: A Unified Approach, 2nd Ed.\", Academic Press (1993), p. 219.</ref><ref>Inorganic Chemistry, Holleman-Wiberg, John Wiley & Sons (2001) p. 844.</ref> As expected from the difference in atomic weight, the silanes are less volatile than the corresponding alkanes and boranes, but more so than the corresponding germanes. They are much more reactive than the corresponding alkanes, because of the larger radius of silicon compared to carbon facilitating [[nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]] at the silicon, the greater polarity of the Si\u2013H bond compared to the C\u2013H bond, and the ability of silicon to expand its octet and hence form adducts and lower the reaction's [[activation energy]].<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n\nSilane [[pyrolysis]] gives polymeric species and finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially produced by the pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C\u2013H or C\u2013C bond and the formation of radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating [[silylene]]s :SiH<sub>2</sub> or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210&nbsp;kJ/mol) is much less than the Si\u2013Si and Si\u2013H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in [[methanol]], controlled solvolysis results in the products SiH<sub>2</sub>(OMe)<sub>2</sub>, SiH(OMe)<sub>3</sub>, and Si(OMe)<sub>4</sub>. The Si\u2013H bond also adds to [[alkene]]s, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450&nbsp;\u00b0C, silane participates in an [[addition reaction]] with [[acetone]], as well as a [[ring-opening reaction]] with [[ethylene oxide]]. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at \u221280&nbsp;\u00b0C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate [[hydrogen halide]] with an Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid [[silver]] halide in a heated flow reactor:<ref name=Greenwood337/>\n:SiH<sub>4</sub> + 2 AgCl {{overunderset|\u2192|260&nbsp;\u00b0C|&nbsp;}} SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl + HCl + 2 Ag\nAmong the derivatives of silane, [[iodosilane]] (SiH<sub>3</sub>I) and [[potassium silanide]] (KSiH<sub>3</sub>) are very useful synthetic intermediates in the production of more complicated silicon-containing compounds: the latter is a colourless crystalline ionic solid containing K<sup>+</sup> cations and {{chem|SiH|3|-}} anions in the [[sodium chloride|NaCl]] structure, and is made by the reduction of silane by [[potassium]] metal.<ref name=King47>King, p. 47</ref> Additionally, the reactive hypervalent species {{chem|SiH|5|-}} is also known.<ref name=Greenwood337/> With suitable organic substituents it is possible to produce stable polysilanes: they have surprisingly high electric conductivities, arising from [[sigma bond|sigma]] delocalisation of the electrons in the chain.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=R.D. |last2=Michl |first2=J. |doi=10.1021/cr00096a006 |title=Polysilane high polymers |journal=[[Chemical Reviews]] |volume=89 |issue=6| pages=1359 |year=1989 |pmid= |pmc =}}</ref>\n\n===Halides===\nSilicon and [[silicon carbide]] readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, reactive, and volatile silicon tetrahalides.<ref name=Greenwood340>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 340\u20132</ref> [[Silicon tetrafluoride]] also may be made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of [[hydrofluoric acid]] on glass.<ref name=King48/> Heating two different tetrahalides together also produces a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr<sub>3</sub> through SiFClBr<sub>2</sub> to SiFCl<sub>2</sub>Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements is illustrated by the change from an infinite ionic structure in [[aluminium fluoride]] to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom.<ref name=Greenwood340/> [[Silicon tetrachloride]] is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon [[ester]]s.<ref name=Greenwood340/> The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks.<ref name=King48>King, p. 48</ref> The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess [[hydrofluoric acid]] produces the octahedral [[Hexafluorosilicic acid|hexafluorosilicate]] anion {{chem|SiF|6|2-}}.<ref name=King48/>\n\nAnalogous to the silanes, halopolysilanes Si<sub>''n''</sub>X<sub>2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2</sub> also are known. While catenation in carbon compounds is maximised in the hydrogen compounds rather than the halides, the opposite is true for silicon, so that the halopolysilanes are known up to at least Si<sub>14</sub>F<sub>30</sub>, Si<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>14</sub>, and Si<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>10</sub>. A suggested explanation for this phenomenon is the compensation for the electron loss of silicon to the more electronegative halogen atoms by [[pi backbonding]] from the filled p<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbitals on the halogen atoms to the empty d<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbitals on silicon: this is similar to the situation of [[carbon monoxide]] in [[metal carbonyl complex]]es and explains their stability. These halopolysilanes may be produced by [[comproportionation]] of silicon tetrahalides with elemental silicon, or by condensation of lighter halopolysilanes ([[trimethylammonium]] being a useful catalyst for this reaction).<ref name=Greenwood340/>\n\n===Silica===\n[[Silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>), also known as silica, is one of the best-studied compounds, second only to [[properties of water|water]]. Twelve different crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being \u03b1-[[quartz]], a major constituent of many rocks such as [[granite]] and [[sandstone]]. It also is known to occur in a pure form as [[rock crystal]]; impure forms are known as [[rose quartz]], [[smoky quartz]], [[morion (mineral)|morion]], [[amethyst]], and [[citrine quartz|citrine]]. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as [[chalcedony]], [[chrysoprase]], [[carnelian]], [[agate]], [[onyx]], [[jasper]], [[heliotrope (mineral)|heliotrope]], and [[flint]]. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as [[tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]], as well as the much less common [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]]. Biologically generated forms are also known as [[kieselguhr]] and [[diatomaceous earth]]. [[Vitrification|Vitreous]] silicon dioxide is known as [[tektite]]s, and [[obsidian]], and rarely as [[lechatelierite]]. Some synthetic forms are known as [[keatite]] and [[W-silica]]. [[Opal]]s are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.<ref name=Greenwood342>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 342\u2013347</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|Quartz\nFile:Quartz - Agateplate, redbrown-white.jpg|Agate\nFile:Tridymite tabulars - Ochtendung, Eifel, Germany.jpg|Tridymite\nFile:Cristobalite-Fayalite-40048.jpg|Cristobalite\nFile:Coesiteimage.jpg|Coesite\n</gallery>\n\nMost crystalline forms of silica are made of infinite arrangements of {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra (with Si at the center) connected at their corners, with each oxygen atom linked to two silicon atoms. In the thermodynamically stable room-temperature form, \u03b1-quartz, these tetrahedra are linked in intertwined helical chains with two different Si\u2013O distances (159.7 and 161.7&nbsp;pm) with a Si\u2013O\u2013Si angle of 144\u00b0. These helices can be either left- or right-handed, so that individual \u03b1-quartz crystals are optically active. At 537&nbsp;\u00b0C, this transforms quickly and reversibly into the similar \u03b2-quartz, with a change of the Si\u2013O\u2013Si angle to 155\u00b0 but a retention of handedness. Further heating to 867&nbsp;\u00b0C results in another reversible phase transition to \u03b2-tridymite, in which some Si\u2013O bonds are broken to allow for the arrangement of the {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra into a more open and less dense hexagonal structure. This transition is slow and hence tridymite occurs as a metastable mineral even below this transition temperature; when cooled to about 120&nbsp;\u00b0C it quickly and reversibly transforms by slight displacements of individual silicon and oxygen atoms to \u03b1-tridymite, similarly to the transition from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz. \u03b2-tridymite slowly transforms to cubic \u03b2-cristobalite at about 1470&nbsp;\u00b0C, which once again exists metastably below this transition temperature and transforms at 200\u2013280&nbsp;\u00b0C to \u03b1-cristobalite via small atomic displacements. \u03b2-cristobalite melts at 1713&nbsp;\u00b0C; the freezing of silica from the melt is quite slow and [[vitrification]], or the formation of a [[glass]], is likely to occur instead. In vitreous silica, the {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra remain corner-connected, but the symmetry and periodicity of the crystalline forms are lost. Because of the slow conversions between these three forms, it is possible upon rapid heating to melt \u03b2-quartz (1550&nbsp;\u00b0C) or \u03b2-tridymite (1703&nbsp;\u00b0C). Silica boils at approximately 2800&nbsp;\u00b0C. Other high-pressure forms of silica are known, such as coesite and stishovite: these are known in nature, formed under the shock pressure of a meteorite impact and then rapidly quenched to preserve the crystal structure. Similar melting and cooling of silica occurs following [[lightning]] strikes, forming glassy [[lechatelierite]]. W-silica is an unstable low-density form involving {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra sharing opposite edges instead of corners, forming parallel chains similarly to [[silicon disulfide]] (SiS<sub>2</sub>) and [[silicon diselenide]] (SiSe<sub>2</sub>): it quickly returns to forming amorphous silica with heat or traces of water.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430 H2SiO3.JPG|thumb|Condensed polysilicic acid]]\nSilica is rather inert chemically. It is not attacked by any acids other than hydrofluoric acid. However, it slowly dissolves in hot concentrated alkalis, and does so rather quickly in fused metal hydroxides or carbonates, to give metal silicates. Among the elements, it is attacked only by fluorine at room temperature to form silicon tetrafluoride: hydrogen and carbon also react, but require temperatures over 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C to do so. Silica nevertheless reacts with many metal and [[metalloid]] oxides to form a wide variety of compounds important in the glass and ceramic industries above all, but also have many other uses: for example, [[sodium silicate]] is often used in detergents due to its [[buffer (chemistry)|buffering]], [[saponification|saponifying]], and [[emulsification|emulsifying]] properties.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n===Silicic acids===\nAdding water to silica drops its melting point by around 800&nbsp;\u00b0C due to the breaking of the structure by replacing Si\u2013O\u2013Si linkages with terminating Si\u2013OH groups. Increasing water concentration results in the formation of hydrated [[silica gel]]s and [[colloid]]al silica dispersions. Many hydrates and [[silicic acid]]s exist in the most dilute of aqueous solutions, but these are rather insoluble and quickly precipitate and condense and cross-link to form various polysilicic acids of variable combinations following the formula [SiO<sub>''x''</sub>(OH)<sub>4\u22122''x''</sub>]<sub>''n''</sub>, similar to the behaviour of [[boron]], [[aluminium]], and [[iron]], among other elements. Hence, although some simple silicic acids have been identified in dilute solutions, such as [[orthosilicic acid]] Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> and [[metasilicic acid]] SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, none of these are likely to exist in the solid state.<ref name=Greenwood342/>\n\n===Silicate minerals===\n{{main|Silicate minerals}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-top:0; margin-left:1em; text-align:center; font-size:10pt; line-height:11pt; width:25%;\"\n|+ style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\" | Typical coordination of metal cations in silicates (ionic radii in [[picometre|pm]])<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n|-\n!

Tetrahedral {SiO<sub>4</sub>} units are common to almost all these compounds, either as discrete structures, or combined into larger units by the sharing of corner oxygen atoms. These may be divided into ''neso''-silicates (discrete {SiO<sub>4</sub>} units) sharing no oxygen atoms, ''soro''-silicates (discrete {Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>} units) sharing one, ''cyclo''-silicates (closed ring structures) and ''ino''-silicates (continuous chain or ribbon structures) both sharing two, ''phyllo''-silicates (continuous sheets) sharing three, and ''tecto''-silicates (continuous three-dimensional frameworks) sharing four. The lattice of oxygen atoms that results is usually close-packed, or close to it, with the charge being balanced by other cations in various different polyhedral sites according to size.<ref name=Greenwood347>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 347\u2013359</ref>\n\nThe [[orthosilicate]]s M{{su|p=II|b=2}}SiO{{su|b=4}} (M = Be, Mg, Mn, Fe, Zn) and ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> are ''neso''-silicates. Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> ([[phenacite]]) is unusual as both Be<sup>II</sup> and Si<sup>IV</sup> occupy tetrahedral four-coordinated sites; the other divalent cations instead occupy six-coordinated octahedral sites and often isomorphously replace each other as in [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe,Mn)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. [[Zircon]], ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, demands eight-coordination of the Zr<sup>IV</sup> cations due to stoichiometry and because of their larger ionic radius (84&nbsp;pm). Also significant are the [[garnet]]s, [M{{su|p=II|b=3}}M{{su|p=III|b=2}}(SiO{{su|b=4}}){{su|b=3}}], in which the divalent cations (e.g. Ca, Mg, Fe) are eight-coordinated and the trivalent ones are six-coordinated (e.g. Al, Cr, Fe). Regular coordination is not always present: for example, it is not found in Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, which mixes six- and eight-coordinate sites for Ca<sup>II</sup>. ''Soro''-silicates, involving discrete double or triple tetrahedral units, are quite rare: metasilicates involving cyclic \"[(SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>''n''</sub>]<sup>2''n''\u2212</sup>\" units of corner-abutting tetrahedra forming a polygonal ring are also known.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\nChain metasilicates, {SiO{{su|p=2\u2212|b=3}}}{{su|b=\u221e}}, form by corner-sharing of an indefinite chain of linked {SiO<sub>4</sub>} tetrahedra. Many differences arise due to the differing repeat distances of conformation across the line of tetrahedra. A repeat distance of two is most common, as in most [[pyroxene]] minerals, but repeat distances of one, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, and twelve are also known. These chains may then link across each other to form double chains and ribbons, as in the [[asbestos]] minerals, involving repeated chains of cyclic tetrahedron rings.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\n[[File:Zeolite-ZSM-5-vdW.png|thumb|right|A typical zeolite structure]]\nLayer silicates, such as the clay minerals and the [[mica]]s, are very common, and often are formed by horizontal cross-linking of metasilicate chains or planar condensation of smaller units. An example is [[kaolinite]] [Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]; in many of these minerals cation and anion replacement is common, so that for example tetrahedral Si<sup>IV</sup> may be replaced by Al<sup>III</sup>, octahedral Al<sup>III</sup> by Mg<sup>II</sup>, and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> by F<sup>\u2212</sup>. Three-dimensional framework aluminosilicates are structurally very complex; they may be conceived of as starting from the SiO<sub>2</sub> structure, but having replaced up to one-half of the Si<sup>IV</sup> atoms with Al<sup>III</sup>, they require more cations to be included in the structure to balance charge. Examples include [[feldspar]]s (the most abundant minerals on the Earth), [[zeolite]]s, and [[ultramarine]]s. Many feldspars can be thought of as forming part of the ternary system NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\u2013KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>\u2013CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. Their lattice is destroyed by high pressure prompting Al<sup>III</sup> to undergo six-coordination rather than four-coordination, and this reaction destroying feldspars may be a reason for the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity]], which would imply that the crust and mantle have the same chemical composition, but different lattices, although this is not a universally held view. Zeolites have many polyhedral cavities in their frameworks ([[truncated cuboctahedron|truncated cuboctahedra]] being most common, but other polyhedra also are known as zeolite cavities), allowing them to include loosely bound molecules such as water in their structure. Ultramarines alternate silicon and aluminium atoms and include a variety of other anions such as Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{chem|SO|4|2-}}, and {{chem|S|2|2-}}, but are otherwise similar to the feldspars.<ref name=Greenwood347/>\n\n===Other inorganic compounds===\n[[Silicon disulfide]] (SiS<sub>2</sub>) is formed by burning silicon in gaseous sulfur at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C; sublimation of the resulting compound in nitrogen results in white, flexible long fibers reminiscent of [[asbestos]] with a structure similar to W-silica. This melts at 1090&nbsp;\u00b0C and sublimes at 1250&nbsp;\u00b0C; at high temperature and pressure this transforms to a crystal structure analogous to cristobalite. However, SiS<sub>2</sub> lacks the variety of structures of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and quickly hydrolyses to silica and [[hydrogen sulfide]]. It is also ammonolysed quickly and completely by liquid [[ammonia]] as follows to form an [[imide]]:<ref name=Greenwood359>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 359\u2013361</ref>\n:SiS<sub>2</sub> + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Si(NH)<sub>2</sub> + 2 NH<sub>4</sub>SH\nIt reacts with the sulfides of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, and iron to form metal [[thiosilicate]]s: reaction with [[ethanol]] results in [[tetraethylsilicate]] Si(OEt)<sub>4</sub> and hydrogen sulfide. Ethylsilicate is useful as its controlled hydrolysis produces adhesive or film-like forms of silica. Reacting hydrogen sulfide with silicon tetrahalides yields silicon thiohalides such as S(SiCl)<sub>3</sub>, cyclic Cl<sub>2</sub>Si(\u03bc-S)<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>, and crystalline (SiSCl<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. Despite the [[double bond rule]], stable organosilanethiones RR'Si=S have been made thanks to the stabilising mechanism of intermolecular coordination via an [[amine]] group.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\n[[Silicon nitride]], Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, may be formed by directly reacting silicon with nitrogen above 1300&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a more economical means of production is by heating silica and coke in a stream of nitrogen and hydrogen gas at 1500&nbsp;\u00b0C. It would make a promising [[ceramic]] if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it: chemically, it is near-totally inert, and even above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C it keeps its strength, shape, and continues to be resistant to wear and corrosion. It is very hard (9 on the [[Mohs hardness scale]]), dissociates only at 1900&nbsp;\u00b0C at 1&nbsp;atm, and is quite dense (density 3.185&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>), because of its compact structure similar to that of phenacite (Be<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>). A similar refractory material is Si<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O, formed by heating silicon and silica at 1450&nbsp;\u00b0C in an argon stream containing 5% nitrogen gas, involving 4-coordinate silicon and 3-coordinate nitrogen alternating in puckered hexagonal tilings interlinked by non-linear Si\u2013O\u2013Si linkages to each other.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\nReacting silyl halides with ammonia or alkylammonia derivatives in the gaseous phase or in ethanolic solution produces various volatile silylamides, which are silicon analogues of the [[amine]]s:<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n:3 SiH<sub>3</sub>Cl + 4 NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl\n:SiH<sub>3</sub>Br + 2 Me<sub>2</sub>NH \u2192 SiH<sub>3</sub>NMe<sub>2</sub> + Me<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>Br\n:4 SiH<sub>3</sub>I + 5 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> \u2192 (SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NN(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 4 N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I\n\nMany such compounds have been prepared, the only known restriction being that the nitrogen is always tertiary, and species containing the SiH\u2013NH group are unstable at room temperature. The stoichiometry around the nitrogen atom in compounds such as N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>is planar, which has been attributed to a p<sub>\u03c0</sub>\u2013d<sub>\u03c0</sub> interaction between a lone pair on nitrogen and an empty d<sub>\u03c0</sub> orbital on silicon. Similarly, trisilylamines are weaker as ligands than their carbon analogues, the tertiary [[amine]]s, although substitution of some SiH<sub>3</sub> groups by CH<sub>3</sub> groups mitigates this weakness. For example, N(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> does not form an [[adduct]] with [[borane|BH<sub>3</sub>]] at all, while MeN(SiH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Me<sub>2</sub>NSiH<sub>3</sub> form adducts at low temperatures that decompose upon warming. Some silicon analogues of [[imine]]s, with a Si=N double bond, are known: the first found was Bu<sup>''t''</sup><sub>2</sub>Si=N\u2013SiBu<sup>''t''</sup><sub>3</sub>, which was discovered in 1986.<ref name=Greenwood359/>\n\n[[File:SiC p1390066.jpg|thumb|right|Silicon carbide]]\n[[Silicon carbide]] (SiC) was first made by [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]] in 1891, who named it carborundum to reference its intermediate hardness and abrasive power between [[diamond]] (an allotrope of carbon) and [[corundum]] ([[aluminium oxide]]).

It is resistant to most aqueous acids, [[phosphoric acid]] being an exception. It forms a protective layer of [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface and hence only oxidises appreciably in air above 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C; removal of this layer by molten hydroxides or carbonates leads to quick oxidation. Silicon carbide is rapidly attacked by chlorine gas, which forms SiCl<sub>4</sub> and carbon at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C and SiCl<sub>4</sub> and [[carbon tetrachloride|CCl<sub>4</sub>]] at 1000&nbsp;\u00b0C. It is mostly used as an abrasive and a refractory material, as it is chemically stable and very strong, and it fractures to form a very sharp cutting edge. It is also useful as an intrinsic semiconductor, as well as an extrinsic semiconductor upon being doped.<ref name=Greenwood334/> In its diamond-like behavior it serves as an illustration of the chemical similarity between carbon and silicon.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n===Organosilicon compounds===\n{{main|Organosilicon}}\n[[Image:HydrosilylationTriphenylsilylhydride.png|upright=1.8|thumb|right|A hydrosilylation reaction, in which Si\u2013H is added to an unsaturated substrate]]\nBecause the Si\u2013C bond is close in strength to the C\u2013C bond, organosilicon compounds tend to be markedly thermally and chemically stable. For example, [[tetraphenylsilane]] (SiPh<sub>4</sub>) may be distilled in air even at its boiling point of 428&nbsp;\u00b0C, and so may its substituted derivatives Ph<sub>3</sub>SiCl and Ph<sub>2</sub>SiCl<sub>2</sub>, which boil at 378&nbsp;\u00b0C and 305&nbsp;\u00b0C respectively. Furthermore, since carbon and silicon are chemical congeners, organosilicon chemistry shows some significant similarities with carbon chemistry, for example in the propensity of such compounds for catenation and forming multiple bonds.<ref name=Greenwood361>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 361\u2013366</ref> However, significant differences also arise: since silicon is more electropositive than carbon, bonds to more electronegative elements are generally stronger with silicon than with carbon, and vice versa. Thus the Si\u2013F bond is significantly stronger than even the [[carbon\u2013fluorine bond|C\u2013F bond]] and is one of the strongest single bonds, while the Si\u2013H bond is much weaker than the C\u2013H bond and is readily broken. Furthermore, the ability of silicon to expand its octet is not shared by carbon, and hence some organosilicon reactions have no organic analogues. For example, nucleophilic attack on silicon does not proceed by the [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]] or [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1]] processes, but instead goes through a negatively charged true pentacoordinate intermediate and appears like a substitution at a hindered tertiary atom. This works for silicon, unlike for carbon, because the long Si\u2013C bonds reduce the steric hindrance and the d-orbital of silicon is geometrically unconstrained for nucleophilic attack, unlike for example a C\u2013O \u03c3* antibonding orbital. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the mechanism is still often called \"S<sub>N</sub>2 at silicon\" for simplicity.<ref name=Clayden668>Clayden, pp. 668\u201377</ref>\n\nOne of the most useful silicon-containing groups is [[trimethylsilyl]], Me<sub>3</sub>Si\u2013. The Si\u2013C bond connecting it to the rest of the molecule is reasonably strong, allowing it to remain while the rest of the molecule undergoes reactions, but is not so strong that it cannot be removed specifically when needed, for example by the [[fluoride]] ion, which is a very weak nucleophile for carbon compounds but a very strong one for organosilicon compounds. It may be compared to acidic [[proton]]s; while trisilylmethyl is removed by hard nucleophiles instead of bases, both removals usually promote elimination. As a general rule, while saturated carbon is best attacked by nucleophiles that are neutral compounds, those based on nonmetals far down on the periodic table (e.g. sulfur, [[selenium]], or [[iodine]]), or even both, silicon is best attacked by charged nucleophiles, particularly those involving such highly electronegative nonmetals as oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine. For example, enolates react at the carbon in [[haloalkane]]s, but at the oxygen in [[silyl]] chlorides; and when trimethylsilyl is removed from an organic molecule using hydroxide as a nucleophile, the product of the reaction is not the silanol as one would expect from using carbon chemistry as an analogy, because the siloxide is strongly nucleophilic and attacks the original molecule to yield the [[silyl ether]] [[hexamethyldisiloxane]], (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>2</sub>O. Conversely, while the S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction is mostly unaffected by the presence of a partial positive charge (\u03b4+) at the carbon, the analogous \"S<sub>N</sub>2\" reaction at silicon is so affected. Thus, for example, the silyl [[triflate]]s are so electrophilic that they react 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> times faster than silyl chlorides with oxygen-containing nucleophiles. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] is in particular a very good [[Lewis acid]] and is used to convert [[carbonyl]] compounds to [[acetal]]s and [[silyl enol ether]]s, reacting them together analogously to the [[aldol reaction]].<ref name=Clayden668/>\n\nSi\u2013C bonds are commonly formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often carried out in small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with [[organolithium]], [[Grignard reagent|Grignard]], or [[organoaluminium]] reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si\u2013H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic [[copper]] as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n===Silicone polymers===\n{{main|Silicone}}\n[[File:PmdsStructure.png|thumb|right|Structure of [[polydimethylsiloxane]], the principal component of silicones]]\nThe word \"silicone\" was first used by Frederic Kipping in 1901. He invented the word to illustrate the similarity of chemical formulae between Ph<sub>2</sub>SiO and [[benzophenone]], Ph<sub>2</sub>CO, although he also stressed the lack of chemical resemblance due to the polymeric structure of Ph<sub>2</sub>SiO, which is not shared by Ph<sub>2</sub>CO.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\nSilicones may be considered analogous to mineral silicates, in which the methyl groups of the silicones correspond to the [[isoelectronic]] O<sup>\u2212</sup> of the silicates.<ref name=Greenwood361/> They are quite stable to extreme temperatures, oxidation, and water, and have useful dielectric, antistick, and antifoam properties. Furthermore, they are resistant over long periods of time to ultraviolet radiation and weathering, and are inert physiologically. They are fairly unreactive, but do react with concentrated solutions bearing the hydroxide ion and fluorinating agents, and occasionally, may even be used as mild reagents for selective syntheses. For example, (Me<sub>3</sub>Si)<sub>2</sub>O is valuable for the preparation of derivatives of [[molybdenum]] and [[tungsten]] oxyhalides, converting a [[tungsten hexachloride]] suspension in [[dichloroethane]] solution quantitatively to WOCl<sub>4</sub> in under an hour at room temperature, and then to yellow WO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C in light petroleum at a yield of 95% overnight.<ref name=Greenwood361/>\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:Olivine-gem7-10a.jpg|thumb|upright|Olivine]]\nIn the universe, silicon is the seventh most abundant element, coming after [[hydrogen]], [[helium]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[neon]]. These abundances are not replicated well on Earth due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the [[Solar System]]. Silicon makes up 27.2% of the Earth's crust by weight, second only to oxygen at 45.5%, with which it always is associated in nature. Further fractionation took place in the formation of the Earth by [[planetary differentiation]]: [[Earth's core]], which makes up 31.5% of the mass of the Earth, has approximate composition Fe<sub>25</sub>Ni<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>S<sub>3</sub>; the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] makes up 68.1% of the Earth's mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates, an example being [[olivine]], (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>; while the lighter siliceous minerals such as [[aluminosilicate]]s rise to the surface and form the crust, making up 0.4% of the Earth's mass.<ref name=Greenwood329>Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 329\u2013330</ref>\n\nThe crystallisation of [[igneous rock]]s from magma depends on a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as [[lattice energy]], melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, [[olivine]] appears first, followed by [[pyroxene]], [[amphibole]], [[biotite]] mica, [[orthoclase feldspar]], [[muscovite mica]], [[quartz]], [[zeolite]]s, and finally, hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of [[hydroxide]] and [[fluoride]] anions in addition to oxides. Many metals may substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo [[weathering]], transport, and deposition, [[sedimentary rock]]s like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. [[Metamorphism]] also may occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.<ref name=Greenwood329/>\n\n==Production==\nSilicon of 96\u201399% purity is made by reducing [[quartzite]] or sand with highly pure [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. The reduction is carried out in an [[electric arc furnace]], with an excess of SiO<sub>2</sub> used to stop [[silicon carbide]] (SiC) from accumulating:<ref name=Greenwood330/>\n:SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2 C \u2192 Si + 2 CO\n:2 SiC + SiO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 3 Si + 2 CO\n\n[[File:Ferrosilicon.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Ferrosilicon alloy]]\nThis reaction, known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, usually is conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfur]], producing [[ferrosilicon]].<ref name=Greenwood330/> Ferrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world's production of elemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon, providing 4.6 million [[tonne]]s (or 2/3 of world output) of silicon, most of it in the form of ferrosilicon. It is followed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t), and the United States (170,000 t).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/silicon/mcs-2011-simet.pdf |publisher=USGS |title=Silicon Commodities Report 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}</ref> Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry (see below) with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants.<ref name=Greenwood330/> Another reaction, sometimes used, is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, as follows:<ref name=Ullmann574>Zulehner et al., p. 574</ref>\n:3 SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4 Al \u2192 3 Si + 2 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n\nLeaching powdered 96\u201397% pure silicon with water results in ~98.5% pure silicon, which is used in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane or trichlorosilane. The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of [[silicone]] production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated [[fractional distillation]], followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure [[zinc]] metal as the reducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by [[zone refining]]. Other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane. Another process used is the reduction of [[sodium hexafluorosilicate]], a common waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry, by metallic [[sodium]]: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside fuel source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost every other material: [[transistor]] production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 10<sup>10</sup>, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 10<sup>12</sup> are needed and attained.<ref name=Greenwood330/>\n\n==Applications==\n===Compounds===\nMost silicon is used industrially without being purified, and indeed, often with comparatively little processing from its natural form. More than 90% of the Earth's crust is composed of [[silicate minerals]], which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, [[silica]] sand, and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making [[Portland cement]] (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in [[mortar (masonry)|building mortar]] and modern [[stucco]], but more importantly, combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals such as granite), to make the [[concrete]] that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.<ref name=Greenwood356>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 356.</ref>\n\nSilica is used to make [[fire brick]], a type of ceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware [[ceramic]]s, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired [[clay]] minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is [[porcelain]], which is based on the silicate mineral [[kaolinite]]. Traditional [[glass]] (silica-based [[soda-lime glass]]) also functions in many of the same ways, and also is used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based [[glass fiber]]s are used for [[optical fiber]], as well as to produce [[fiberglass]] for structural support and [[glass wool]] for thermal insulation.\n\nSilicones often are used in [[waterproofing]] treatments, [[molding (process)|molding]] compounds, mold-[[release agent]]s, mechanical seals, high temperature [[lubricant|greases]] and waxes, and [[caulking]] compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in [[breast implant]]s, contact lenses, [[explosive]]s and [[pyrotechnics]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/prep.200700021 |title=Special Materials in Pyrotechnics: VI.

Silicon is a component of some [[superalloy]]s.\n\n=== Alloys ===\nElemental silicon is added to molten [[cast iron]] as [[ferrosilicon]] or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of [[cementite]] where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of [[electrical steel]], modifying its [[resistivity]] and [[ferromagnetic]] properties.\n\nThe properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron. \"Metallurgical grade\" silicon is silicon of 95\u201399% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys ([[silumin]] alloys) for aluminium part [[Casting|casts]], mainly for use in the [[automotive industry]]. Silicon's importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a [[eutectic mixture]] which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.<ref name=\"diecasting\">Apelian, D.

Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a [[resistivity]]) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge ([[electron hole|positive]] or [[electron|negative]]) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for [[transistor]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[semiconductor detector]]s, and other [[semiconductor device]]s used in the computer industry and other technical applications.<ref name=Ullmann573>Zulehner et al., p. 573</ref> In [[silicon photonics]], silicon may be used as a continuous wave [[Raman laser]] medium to produce coherent light.<ref name=\"dekker_2008\" >{{cite journal |title=Ultrafast nonlinear all-optical processes in silicon-on-insulator waveguides |journal=[[Journal of Physics D]] |year=2008 |volume=40 |issue=14 |page=R249\u2013R271 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/40/14/r01\n|bibcode=2007JPhD...40..249D |last1=Dekker |first1=R |last2=Usechak |first2=N |last3=F\u00f6rst |first3=M |last4=Driessen |first4=A}}</ref>\n\nIn common [[integrated circuit]]s, a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of [[silicon dioxide|silicon oxide]], an insulator that is easily produced on Si surfaces by processes of [[thermal oxidation]] or [[LOCOS|local oxidation (LOCOS)]], which involve exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions that can be predicted by the [[Deal\u2013Grove model]]. Silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering [[avalanche breakdown]] (an [[electron avalanche]] is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over [[germanium]] (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.<ref>[http://www.mpoweruk.com/semiconductors.htm Semiconductors Without the Quantum Physics]. Electropaedia</ref>\n\nMonocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production of low-cost, [[large-area electronics]] in applications such as [[liquid crystal display]]s and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film [[solar cells]]. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons per year.<ref name=USGS>Corathers, Lisa A.

The effect can also be achieved in reverse with a donor molecule having its [[highest occupied molecular orbital]] (HOMO) slightly higher than a valance band edge of the quantum dot, allowing electrons to transfer between them, filling the holes and preventing recombination. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs when a complex forms between the quantum dot and a quencher molecule. The complex will continue to absorb light but when the energy is converted to the ground state it does not release a photon, quenching the material. The third method uses different approach by measuring the [[photocurrent]] emitted by the quantum dots instead of monitoring the photoluminescent display. If the concentration of the desired chemical increases then the photocurrent given off by the nanocrystals will change in response.<ref>Yue, Zhao, Fred Lisdat, Wolfgang J. Parak, Stephen G.

When one sees the types of air defense weapons that the Afghans get, one sees a policy that appears to be condemning the Afghan lives to be spent very cheaply. Most of the ammunition being delivered for the heavy machine guns is type non-armor piercing, unfit for taking on helicopter gunships. The SAM-7 missiles that the CIA's director[ate] of operations is delivering to the Afghan resistance had a track record of 100% failure in the CIA's last secret war in Angola, and that's the missile they've been sending to the Afghans for four years, despite anguished reports of its ineffectiveness from the field. ... Why have we spent 500,000 Afghan lives so cheaply?\"<ref name=Eiva2>{{cite news |title=Afghanistan: The Fifth Year|publisher=ABC News Nightline|date=27 December 1984}}</ref>\n\nDespite the breakthroughs in Congress and the mediain 1984, few believed the Afghans could win. \"Only a few zealots, like the former Green Beret who runs the effective lobbying operation, the Federation for American Afghan Action, believe that the war is militarily winnable.\"<ref name=Eiva3>{{cite news |title=A war for all congressmen|publisher=The Economist|date=19 January 1985 |pages=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan responded to Congress and the media with a new policy, \"Improve the military effectiveness of the Afghan resistance,\" signing it on 27 March 1985, known as [[National Security Decision Directive]] Number 166 declassified 22 April 2010.\n\nWith the new policy, the CIA replaced the non armor-piercing 12.7mm ammunition with the armor-piercing version.  The losses of Soviet [[Mi-24]] and [[Mi-8]] helicopters in Afghanistan increased.\n\nTwo months after coming to power, Secretary-General Mikhail Gorbachev unleashed a knock-out attempt against the resistance. Yet administration kept opposing effective man-portable air-defense missiles, like the Stinger, for the resistance.\n\nAt this point, Eiva concluded that the CIA deputy director, John McMahon, was the key opponent in government to the provision of the Stinger air defense missile to the resistance.\n \nHe helped draft the following letter sent to one hundred thousand members of a conservative grassroots organization, Free the Eagle, which generated ten thousand letters to the White House:\n\"Why does the CIA persist in failing to supply effective weapons to the Afghan Freedom Fighters?\" the letters asked. \"Why does the CIA choose to send weapons that are old, defective, and in some cases useless? Who's behind this massive -- and deadly -- blunder? To be perfectly honest, my friend ... it's because a certain public official -- namely John McMahon -- is failing to carry out American policy.... That's why I am asking you to sign the enclosed letter addressed to White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan and then mail it to him at the White House.... John McMahon must change his ways or he must go!\"<ref name=\"wilsonwar\"/>{{rp|416\u2013417}} The Stingers \"alter[ed] the war in Afghanistan\" as the Washington Post headline declared on 19 July 1987.\n\n\"Encouraged by the missile's effectiveness, Andrew Eiva, whose Federation for American Afghan Action was a leading Stinger lobbyist last year, suggests that a British-made 81mm mortar, with a range of six kilometers, could make the eight main Soviet airfields in Afghanistan 'untenable.'\"<ref name=\"alter war\">Washington Post, 19 July 1987; David Ottaway, \"U.S. Missiles Alter War in Afghanistan\"</ref>\n\nPresident Reagan later ordered long range mortars to also be put into the covert pipeline. But CIA official [[Milton Bearden]] cut the mortars off after their spectacular and successful initial use, as Bearden later openly bragged on a History Channel documentary about the Afghan covert operation.\n\n\"Bearden should not have bragged so much,\" Eiva said later (24 October 2016). \"Several hundred thousand more Afghans may have died because he delayed the end of the war.\"\n\n\"I appreciated the Washington Post and the New York Times giving me credit for the Stinger missiles,\" said Eiva in an interview. \"My role was the public one. But Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Michael Pillsbury]] had a greater role than I did, sacrificing his career to help push the Stinger through behind closed doors.\"\n\nBoth of Eiva's other major achievements involved non-violent resistance.\n\nEncouraging Afghan resistance to avoid executions of Soviet prisoners, with the goal of increasing Soviet desertions or defections from 1981 to 1983. This resulted in a total of 313 prisoners eventually kept alive by the [[mujaheddin]], one of whom became the first vice-president of independent Russia, [[Alexander Rutskoi]].\n\n\"He (Eiva) says he has worked on a program to encourage Soviet soldiers to defect. 'The Russian soldiers have no Canada and Sweden to defect to, so the goal was to develop one, to train the Afghans to do this.'\"\n\n\"Administration officials who know of Mr. Eiva's activities confirmed his accounts of his actions.\"<ref name=\"alter war\"/>\n\n== Career ==\n\nEiva specialized in [[guerrilla warfare]] support and, as a refugee from the Soviet occupation in Lithuania, dedicated himself to overthrowing the Soviet empire. After graduating from [[West Point]] in 1972, Eiva served in the US Army in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, first with the 82nd Airborne Division, then with [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] where he pioneered early [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV delivery systems]].\n\nAs a lobbyist, Eiva works to organize committees of ordinary Americans to influence the Congress.\n\n== Arming the Afghan Mujaheddin against the Soviets ==\n\nDue to his testimony to the Republican Platform Committee's National Security Subcommittee on 13 August 1984 at the Republican Convention in Dallas, Texas Eiva was responsible for having language inserted into the party platform calling for support of the Afghan Mujaheddin in their fight against the Soviets.<ref name=Eiva>{{cite web|last=Eiva|first=Andrew|title=Remarks to the Republican Platform Committee's National Security Subcommittee|url=http://www.jezail.org/03_Eiva-FAAA/Eiva_1.pdf|publisher=Jezail.org|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1983 to 1988, Eiva published the Afghan Update, a newsletter which provided detailed insight into and criticism of CIA and State Department policy. He was executive director of two sister organizations, the Federation for American Afghan Action and the American Afghan Education Fund. Despite his tiny budget, which George Crile mentions in ''Charlie Wilson's War'',<ref name=\"wilsonwar\"/>{{rp|328}} Eiva was able to galvanize Congress to effectively support the Afghan resistance.\n\nHowever, Eiva made powerful enemies among the American political leadership and elites. The CIA absolutely hated him. The Pentagon hated him. The military industrial complex could see no way to profit from his vision. Then there was Congressman Charlie Wilson who pushed his way into steering Afghan policy from his place on the Appropriations Committee. In Charlie Wilson's War, the late George Crile paints a picture that completely overlooks the real policy debate. It wasn't long before Wilson and the CIA snuffed out the crucial issue of supply with bluster, false bravado and carefully orchestrated news accounts. CIA officers now claim to have done things that, in fact, Eiva did before them.<ref name=Dienstag>{{cite web|last=Dienstag|first=David|title=About Andrew Eiva|url=http://www.jezail.org/03_Eiva-FAAA/eiva.html|publisher=Jezail.org|accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Robert Pear in the New York Times reported on [[Zalmay Khalilzad|Zalmay Khalilzad's]] assessment that the Afghan mujaheddin had \"been taking over a lot more territory a lot quicker than anyone anticipated\". Eiva did not want the cause of the freedom fighters to be forgotten. Pear continues, \"Lobbyists for the Afghan guerrillas feared that the State Department's upbeat assessment would be used to justify further cutbacks in shipments of weapons. Andrew L.

He was reared on stories about Lithuanian resistance, American support for a while and, finally, abandonment.\n\nHis maternal grandfather, General Kazimieras Ladyga, drove the Soviet forces out of Lithuania after World War I, and was chief of staff of the armed forces of independent Lithuania from 1925 to 1927.  In 1940, when the Soviets seized Lithuania, General Ladyga was deported to Siberia, where he was tortured and executed.<ref name=\"gelb\"/>\n\nAndrew's maternal grandmother, Stefanija Ladygiene, was the first woman elected to Lithuanian Parliament.  During the Holocaust, Stefanija sheltered and saved a thirteen year old Jewish girl, Irene Veisaite.  In recognition of Stefanija's rescue of Irene, the Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem, engraved her name on its wall as [[Righteous Among the Nations]].\n\n== Awards ==\n\nAndrew Eiva was presented with the [[Order of the Cross of Vytis]] in Vilnius, Lithuania on 16 February 2012 for his services to the cause of restoration of the Independent State of Lithuania. Eiva was integrally involved in defending the Lithuanian Parliament during the [[January Events (Lithuania)|January Events]] of 1991.\n\nEiva was also honored on 16 December 2011 at the Lithuanian Embassy in Washington, D.C., for his service, the cause of Lithuanian independence.

The proposed legislation asked that US policy be changed \"to aid them effectively.\"\n\n\"The State Department has been lobbying against the legislation. One official, Howard B.

When one sees the types of air defense weapons that the Afghans get, one sees a policy that appears to be condemning the Afghan lives to be spent very cheaply. Most of the ammunition being delivered for the heavy machine guns is type non-armor piercing, unfit for taking on helicopter gunships. The SAM-7 missiles that the CIA's director[ate] of operations is delivering to the Afghan resistance had a track record of 100% failure in the CIA's last secret war in Angola, and that's the missile they've been sending to the Afghans for four years, despite anguished reports of its ineffectiveness from the field. ... Why have we spent 500,000 Afghan lives so cheaply?\"<ref name=Eiva2>{{cite news |title=Afghanistan: The Fifth Year|publisher=ABC News Nightline|airdate=27 December 1984}}</ref>\n\nDespite the breakthroughs in Congress and the mediain 1984, few believed the Afghans could win. \"Only a few zealots, like the former Green Beret who runs the effective lobbying operation, the Federation for American Afghan Action, believe that the war is militarily winnable.\"<ref name=Eiva3>{{cite news |title=A war for all congressmen|publisher=The Economist|date=19 January 1985 |pages=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan responded to Congress and the media with a new policy, \"Improve the military effectiveness of the Afghan resistance,\" signing it on 27 March 1985, known as [[National Security Decision Directive]] Number 166 declassified 22 April 2010.\n\nWith the new policy, the CIA replaced the non armor-piercing 12.7mm ammunition with the armor-piercing version.  The losses of Soviet [[Mi-24]] and [[Mi-8]] helicopters in Afghanistan increased.\n\nTwo months after coming to power, Secretary-General Mikhail Gorbachev unleashed a knock-out attempt against the resistance. Yet administration kept opposing effective man-portable air-defense missiles, like the Stinger, for the resistance.\n\nAt this point, Eiva concluded that the CIA deputy director, John McMahon, was the key opponent in government to the provision of the Stinger air defense missile to the resistance.\n \nHe helped draft the following letter sent to one hundred thousand members of a conservative grassroots organization, Free the Eagle, which generated ten thousand letters to the White House:\n\"Why does the CIA persist in failing to supply effective weapons to the Afghan Freedom Fighters?\" the letters asked. \"Why does the CIA choose to send weapons that are old, defective, and in some cases useless? Who's behind this massive -- and deadly -- blunder? To be perfectly honest, my friend ... it's because a certain public official -- namely John McMahon -- is failing to carry out American policy.... That's why I am asking you to sign the enclosed letter addressed to White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan and then mail it to him at the White House.... John McMahon must change his ways or he must go!\"<ref name=\"wilsonwar\"/>{{rp|416\u2013417}} The Stingers \"alter[ed] the war in Afghanistan\" as the Washington Post headline declared on 19 July 1987.\n\n\"Encouraged by the missile's effectiveness, Andrew Eiva, whose Federation for American Afghan Action was a leading Stinger lobbyist last year, suggests that a British-made 81mm mortar, with a range of six kilometers, could make the eight main Soviet airfields in Afghanistan 'untenable.'\"<ref name=\"alter war\">Washington Post, 19 July 1987; David Ottaway, \"U.S. Missiles Alter War in Afghanistan\"</ref>\n\nPresident Reagan later ordered long range mortars to also be put into the covert pipeline. But CIA official [[Milton Bearden]] cut the mortars off after their spectacular and successful initial use, as Bearden later openly bragged on a History Channel documentary about the Afghan covert operation.\n\n\"Bearden should not have bragged so much,\" Eiva said later (24 October 2016). \"Several hundred thousand more Afghans may have died because he delayed the end of the war.\"\n\n\"I appreciated the Washington Post and the New York Times giving me credit for the Stinger missiles,\" said Eiva in an interview. \"My role was the public one. But Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Michael Pillsbury]] had a greater role than I did, sacrificing his career to help push the Stinger through behind closed doors.\"\n\nBoth of Eiva's other major achievements involved non-violent resistance.\n\nEncouraging Afghan resistance to avoid executions of Soviet prisoners, with the goal of increasing Soviet desertions or defections from 1981 to 1983. This resulted in a total of 313 prisoners eventually kept alive by the [[mujaheddin]], one of whom became the first vice-president of independent Russia, [[Alexander Rutskoi]].\n\n\"He (Eiva) says he has worked on a program to encourage Soviet soldiers to defect. 'The Russian soldiers have no Canada and Sweden to defect to, so the goal was to develop one, to train the Afghans to do this.'\"\n\n\"Administration officials who know of Mr. Eiva's activities confirmed his accounts of his actions.\"<ref name=\"alter war\"/>\n\n== Career ==\n\nEiva specialized in [[guerrilla warfare]] support and, as a refugee from the Soviet occupation in Lithuania, dedicated himself to overthrowing the Soviet empire. After graduating from [[West Point]] in 1972, Eiva served in the US Army in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, first with the 82nd Airborne Division, then with [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] where he pioneered early [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV delivery systems]].\n\nAs a lobbyist, Eiva works to organize committees of ordinary Americans to influence the Congress.\n\n== Arming the Afghan Mujaheddin against the Soviets ==\n\nDue to his testimony to the Republican Platform Committee's National Security Subcommittee on 13 August 1984 at the Republican Convention in Dallas, Texas Eiva was responsible for having language inserted into the party platform calling for support of the Afghan Mujaheddin in their fight against the Soviets.<ref name=Eiva>{{cite web|last=Eiva|first=Andrew|title=Remarks to the Republican Platform Committee's National Security Subcommittee|url=http://www.jezail.org/03_Eiva-FAAA/Eiva_1.pdf|publisher=Jezail.org|accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1983 to 1988, Eiva published the Afghan Update, a newsletter which provided detailed insight into and criticism of CIA and State Department policy. He was executive director of two sister organizations, the Federation for American Afghan Action and the American Afghan Education Fund. Despite his tiny budget, which George Crile mentions in ''Charlie Wilson's War'',<ref name=\"wilsonwar\"/>{{rp|328}} Eiva was able to galvanize Congress to effectively support the Afghan resistance.\n\nHowever, Eiva made powerful enemies among the American political leadership and elites. The CIA absolutely hated him. The Pentagon hated him. The military industrial complex could see no way to profit from his vision. Then there was Congressman Charlie Wilson who pushed his way into steering Afghan policy from his place on the Appropriations Committee. In Charlie Wilson's War, the late George Crile paints a picture that completely overlooks the real policy debate. It wasn't long before Wilson and the CIA snuffed out the crucial issue of supply with bluster, false bravado and carefully orchestrated news accounts. CIA officers now claim to have done things that, in fact, Eiva did before them.<ref name=Dienstag>{{cite web|last=Dienstag|first=David|title=About Andrew Eiva|url=http://www.jezail.org/03_Eiva-FAAA/eiva.html|publisher=Jezail.org|accessdate=3 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Robert Pear in the New York Times reported on [[Zalmay Khalilzad|Zalmay Khalilzad's]] assessment that the Afghan mujaheddin had \"been taking over a lot more territory a lot quicker than anyone anticipated\". Eiva did not want the cause of the freedom fighters to be forgotten. Pear continues, \"Lobbyists for the Afghan guerrillas feared that the State Department's upbeat assessment would be used to justify further cutbacks in shipments of weapons. Andrew L.
