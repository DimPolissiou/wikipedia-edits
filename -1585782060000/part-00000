It represented Serbia at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2019.\n\n==At Junior Eurovision==\nDuring the opening ceremony and the running order draw which both took place on 18 November 2019, Serbia was drawn to perform nineteenth (last) on 24 November 2019, following Albania.\n\n===Voting===\nThe results of the 2019 Junior Eurovision Song Contest were determined by national juries and an online audience vote. Every country had a national jury that consisted of three music industry professionals and two kids aged between 10 and 15 who were citizens of the country they represented. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they could not vote impartially and independently. The first phase of the online voting begun on 22 November 2019 when a recap of all the rehearsal performances was shown on ''junioreurovision.tv'' before the viewers could vote. After this, voters also had the option to watch longer one-minute clips from each participant\u2019s rehearsal. This first round of voting stopped on Sunday, 24 November, at 15:59 CET. The second phase of the online voting took place during the live show and begun right after the last performance and was open for 15 minutes. International viewers could vote for a minimum of three countries and a maximum of five. They could also vote for their own country\u2019s song. These votes were then turned into points which were be determined by the percentage of votes received. For example, if a song received 20% of the votes, it received 20% of the available points. The public vote counted for 50% of the final result, while the other 50% came from the professional juries.\n\n===Points awarded to Serbia===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"| Jury\n|-\n!width=20%|12 points\n!width=20%|10 points\n!width=20%|8 points\n!width=20%|7 points\n!width=20%|6 points\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|North Macedonia|Junior|y=2019}}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|France|Junior|y=2019}}\n|-\n!width=20%|5 points\n!width=20%|4 points\n!width=20%|3 points\n!width=20%|2 points\n!width=20%|1 point\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|Albania|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Kazakhstan|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Spain|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Wales|Junior|y=2019}}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|Ireland|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Netherlands|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Russia|Junior|y=2019}}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|Belarus|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Georgia|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Ukraine|Junior|y=2019}}\n|}\n\n* Serbia received 63 points from Online voting.\n\n===Points awarded by Serbia===\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|'''12 points'''||{{Esc|Kazakhstan|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|'''10 points'''||{{Esc|Poland|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|'''8 points'''||{{Esc|France|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''7 points'''||{{Esc|Australia|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''6 points'''||{{Esc|Italy|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''5 points'''||{{Esc|Spain|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''4 points'''||{{Esc|Georgia|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''3 points'''||{{Esc|Ukraine|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''2 points'''||{{Esc|North Macedonia|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''1 point'''||{{Esc|Malta|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|}\n====Split voting results====\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10| Split voting results from Serbia\n|-\n!

Raise your voice) is a song by Serbian singer Darija Vra\u010devi\u0107. It represented Serbia at the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2019.\n\n==At Junior Eurovision==\nDuring the opening ceremony and the running order draw which both took place on 18 November 2019, Serbia was drawn to perform nineteenth (last) on 24 November 2019, following Albania.\n\n===Voting===\nThe results of the 2019 Junior Eurovision Song Contest will be determined by national juries and an online audience vote. Every country will have a national jury that will consist of three music industry professionals and two kids aged between 10 and 15 who are citizens of the country they represent. This jury will be asked to judge each contestant based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The first phase of the online voting will start on 22 November 2019 when a recap of all the rehearsal performances will be shown on ''junioreurovision.tv'' before the viewers can vote. After this, voters will also have the option to watch longer one-minute clips from each participant\u2019s rehearsal. This first round of voting will stop on Sunday, 24 November, at 15:59 CET. The second phase of the online voting will take place during the live show and will start right after the last performance and will be open for 15 minutes. International viewers can vote for a minimum of three countries and a maximum of five. They can also vote for their own country\u2019s song. These votes will then be turned into points which will be determined by the percentage of votes received. For example, if a song receives 20% of the votes, thus it will receive 20% of the available points. The public vote will count for 50% of the final result, while the other 50% will come from the professional juries.\n\n===Points awarded to Serbia===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"5\"| Jury\n|-\n!width=20%|12 points\n!width=20%|10 points\n!width=20%|8 points\n!width=20%|7 points\n!width=20%|6 points\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|North Macedonia|Junior|y=2019}}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|France|Junior|y=2019}}\n|-\n!width=20%|5 points\n!width=20%|4 points\n!width=20%|3 points\n!width=20%|2 points\n!width=20%|1 point\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|Albania|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Kazakhstan|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Spain|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Wales|Junior|y=2019}}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|Ireland|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Netherlands|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Russia|Junior|y=2019}}\n| valign=\"top\" |\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*{{Esc|Belarus|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Georgia|Junior|y=2019}}\n*{{Esc|Ukraine|Junior|y=2019}}\n|}\n\n* Serbia received 63 points from Online voting.\n\n===Points awarded by Serbia===\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|'''12 points'''||{{Esc|Kazakhstan|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|'''10 points'''||{{Esc|Poland|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|'''8 points'''||{{Esc|France|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''7 points'''||{{Esc|Australia|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''6 points'''||{{Esc|Italy|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''5 points'''||{{Esc|Spain|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''4 points'''||{{Esc|Georgia|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''3 points'''||{{Esc|Ukraine|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''2 points'''||{{Esc|North Macedonia|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|width=20%|'''1 point'''||{{Esc|Malta|y=2019|Junior}}\n|-\n|}\n====Split voting results====\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10| Split voting results from Serbia\n|-\n!

All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed. However, an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of this river.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [[commons:File:LaHabanaalSur.jpg|Fundaci\u00f3n de La Habana a orillas del R\u00edo Onicajinal o Mayabeque]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mayabeque.blogia.com/2009/092601-san-cristobal-de-la-habana-en-el-sur-analisis-historico-geografico-de-su-localiz.php |title=San Cristobal de La Habana en el Sur |publisher=Mayabeque.blogia.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established at least two settlements on the north coast, one of them in ''La Chorrera'', today in the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the [[Almendares River]]. The town that became Havana finally originated adjacent to what was then called ''Puerto de Carenas'' (literally, \"[[Careening]] Bay\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\n\n[[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] gave Havana \u2013 the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba \u2013 its name: ''San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana''. The name combines ''San Crist\u00f3bal'', [[patron saint]] of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the ''Conquista'' of other lands.\n\nHavana began as a [[port|trading port]], and suffered regular attacks by [[buccaneer]]s, [[piracy|pirates]], and [[French corsairs]]. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair [[Jacques de Sores]] in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities \u2013 not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive ''contrabando'' ([[black market]]) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]'' of [[Seville]] (the crown-controlled trading house that held a [[monopoly]] on New World trade).\n\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, in order to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\n\nOn December 20, 1592, [[King Philip II of Spain]] granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the [[Spanish Crown]]. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.\n\n====17th century====\n[[File:Panorama of La Habana (Amsterdam, 17th century).jpg|thumb|17th-century depiction of Havana from the [[Beudeker Collection]]]]\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly [[wood]], combining various [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from [[Canary Islands|Canarian]] characteristics.\n\nIn 1649, an epidemic of the often fatal [[Yellow fever]] brought from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in Colombia affected a third of the European population of Havana.<ref>C Cumo.

The [[Battle of Havana (1762)|episode]] began on June 6, 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the [[Royal Navy]] and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana.<ref name=\"Seven Years War\">Pocock, Tom: Battle for Empire: The very first world war 1756\u201363. Chapter Six.</ref> The British immediately opened up trade with their [[North American]] and [[British West Indies|Caribbean colonies]], causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.<ref name=\"Siege\">Thomas, Hugh: Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom 2nd edition. Chapter One</ref>\n\nAfter regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of [[La Caba\u00f1a|San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a]], the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after [[Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal (San Juan)|Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal]] (the biggest) and [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 15, 1796, the remains of [[Christopher Columbus]] were transported to the island from [[Santo Domingo]]. They rested here until 1898, when they were transferred to [[Seville Cathedral|Seville's Cathedral]], after Spain's loss of Cuba.\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:Mapa de La Habana Vieja.JPG|thumb|right|19th-century depiction of Havana]]\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the [[Antilles]].\n\nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a {{convert|51|km|abbr=on}} stretch between Havana and [[Bejucal]], which was used for transporting [[sugar]] from the valley of [[G\u00fcines]] to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the [[Great Theatre of Havana|Tacon Teatre]], one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] to create a [[Golden Circle (proposed country)|'Golden Circle']] with a 1200&nbsp;mile-radius centered on Havana. After the [[Confederate States of America]] were defeated in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.\n\nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the [[metropolis]] could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish colonialism in the Americas.\n\n===Republican period and post-revolution===\nThe 20th century began with Cuba, and therefore Havana, under occupation by the United States.<ref>Cant\u00f3n Navarro, Jos\u00e9. ''History of Cuba'', p. 81.</ref> The US occupation officially ended when [[Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma]], [[List of Presidents of Cuba|first president of Cuba]], took office on 20 May 1902.\n\nDuring the Republican Period, from 1902 to 1959, the city saw a new era of development. Cuba recovered from the devastation of war to become a well-off country, with the third largest middle class in the hemisphere. Apartment buildings to accommodate the new middle class, as well as mansions for the Cuban tycoons, were built at a fast pace.\n\n[[File:HavanaNewCapitalBldg1920.jpg|thumb|left|[[El Capitolio|Capitolio Nacional]] in 1929]]\n[[File:Museo de La Revolucion, Cuba.jpg|[[Kavanagh building]]|thumb|The former presidential palace now houses a museum]]\nNumerous luxury hotels, casinos and nightclubs were constructed during the 1930s to serve Havana's burgeoning tourist industry, which greatly benefited by the U.S. [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on alcohol from 1920 to 1933. In the 1930s, organized crime characters were not unaware of Havana's nightclub and casino life, and they made their inroads in the city. [[Santo Trafficante Jr.]] took the roulette wheel at the Sans Souci Casino, [[Meyer Lansky]] directed the [[Hotel Habana Riviera]], with [[Lucky Luciano]] at the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba|Hotel Nacional]] Casino. At the time, Havana became an exotic capital of appeal and numerous activities ranging from marinas, grand prix car racing, musical shows, and parks. It was also the favorite destination of [[sex tourists]].<ref>{{cite book\n|title=HAVANA BEFORE CASTRO : when Cuba was a tropical playground.\n|first=Peter\n|last=Moruzzi\n|year=2018\n|publisher=Gibbs Smith\n|isbn=1423603672}}</ref>{{rp|127}}\n\nHavana achieved the title of being the [[Latin American]] city with the biggest middle class population per-capita, simultaneously accompanied by gambling and corruption where gangsters and stars were known to mix socially. During this era, Havana was generally producing more revenue than [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]], whose boom as a tourist destination began only after Havana's casinos closed in 1959. In 1958, about 300,000 American tourists visited the city.\n\nAfter the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution of 1959]], the new r\u00e9gime under [[Fidel Castro]] promised to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]], shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966\u201368, the Cuban government had [[nationalized]] all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" (law No. 1076<ref>{{cite web|author= Nigel Hunt |url= http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=236 |title= Cuba Nationalization Laws |publisher= cuba heritage .org |accessdate= 2009-07-08}}</ref>).\n\nA severe economic downturn occurred after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the [[Cuba \u2013 Soviet Union relations|Cuban government]]. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet [[satellite state]]s of [[Eastern Europe]]. However, contrary to events in Europe, Cuba's communist government persevered through the 1990s and persists to this day.\n\nAfter many years of [[prohibition]], the communist government increasingly turned to [[tourism in Cuba|tourism]] for new financial revenue, and has allowed foreign investors to build new hotels and develop the hospitality industry. In Old Havana, effort has also gone into rebuilding for tourist purposes, and a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012210544/http://granma.cu/ESPANOL/2006/diciembre/juev7/elogian-e.html Old Havana restoration] \u2013 Success on the restoration program of Havana\n</ref>\nBut Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|Astronaut photograph of Havana]]\n\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba, south of the [[Florida Keys]], where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbours: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar\u00e9s. The sluggish [[Almendares River]] traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\n\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the deep blue waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-metre) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of [[La Caba\u00f1a]] and [[Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro|El Morro]], the sites of colonial fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the [[University of Havana]] and the Prince's Castle. Outside the city, higher hills rise on the west and east.\n\n===Climate===\nHavana, like much of Cuba, has a [[tropical climate]] that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the [[trade wind]]s and by the warm offshore currents. Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Havana has a [[tropical savanna climate]] that closely borders on a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Average temperatures range from {{convert|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in January and February to {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in August. The temperature seldom drops below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was {{convert|1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in Bainoa, [[Mayabeque Province]] (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging {{convert|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}} annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country.\n\nTornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba, however, on the evening of January 28, 2019, a very rare strong [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] struck the eastern side of Havana, Cuba's capital city. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195.<ref>{{cite web |title=Havana tornado: Cuba's capital hit by rare twister |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47025852 |website=BBC News |accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129181446/http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |archive-date=2019-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/americas/cuba-tornado-dead-scli-intl/index.html</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cappucci |first1=Matthew |title=A deadly tornado plowed through Havana on Sunday night.

Among these is [[Marianao]], one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centres.

In the past ten years, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.\n\n===Districts===\n<!--linked section from \"Municipalities of Havana\" redirect-->\nThe city is divided into 15 [[municipalities]]<ref name=territorios>{{cite web|url=http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/01TERRITORIO.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001220152/http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/01TERRITORIO.pdf |archivedate=October 1, 2011 }} Population by Province and Municipality</ref> \u2013 or ''boroughs'', which are further subdivided into 105 [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Oficial Statistics for Havana|url=http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/provincias_masinf/la%20habana.htm|publisher=Oficina Nacional de Estadisticas de Cuba (ONE)|accessdate=27 November 2011|language=Spanish}}</ref> (''consejos populares''). <small>(Numbers refer to map).</small>\n\n[[File:Havana Municipalities.png|right|upright=1.6|thumb|Havana district map]]\n# '''[[Playa, Havana|Playa]]''': [[Santa Fe, Havana|Santa Fe]], Siboney, Cubanac\u00e1n, Ampliaci\u00f3n Almendares, [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]], Sierra, Ceiba, Buena Vista.\n# '''[[Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n]]''': El Carmelo, Vedado-Malec\u00f3n, Rampa, Pr\u00edncipe, Plaza, Nuevo Vedado-Puentes Grandes, Col\u00f3n-Nuevo Vedado, [[Vedado]].\n# '''[[Centro Habana]]''': [[Cayo Hueso, Havana|Cayo Hueso]], Pueblo Nuevo, Los Sitios, Dragones, Col\u00f3n.\n# '''[[Old Havana|La Habana Vieja]]''': Prado, Catedral, [[Plaza Vieja, Havana|Plaza Vieja]], Bel\u00e9n, San Isidro, Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, Tallapiedra.\n# '''[[Regla]]''': Guaicanimar, Loma Modelo, [[Casablanca, Havana|Casablanca]].\n# '''[[Habana del Este|La Habana del Este]]''': Camilo Cienfuegos, [[Coj\u00edmar]], Guiteras, Alturas de Alamar, Alamar Este, [[Guanabo]], Campo Florido, [[Alamar|Alamar-Playa]].\n# '''[[Guanabacoa]]''': Ma\u00f1ana-Habana Nueva, Villa I, Villa II, Chivas-Roble, Debeche-Nalon, Hata-Naranjo, Pe\u00f1alver-Bacuranao, Minas-Barreras.\n# '''[[San Miguel del Padr\u00f3n]]''': Rocafort, Luyan\u00f3 Moderno, [[Diezmero]], San Francisco de Paula, Dolores-Veracruz, Jacomino.\n# '''[[Diez de Octubre]]''': Luyan\u00f3, Jes\u00fas del Monte, Lawton, Vista Alegre, Goyle, Sevillano, [[La V\u00edbora, Havana|La V\u00edbora]], Santos Su\u00e1rez, Tamarindo.\n# '''[[Cerro, Havana|Cerro]]''': Latinoamericano, Pilar-Atares, Cerro, Las Ca\u00f1as, El Canal, Palatino, Armada.\n# '''[[Marianao]]''': CAI-Los \u00c1ngeles, Pocito-Palmas, Zamora-Cocosolo, Libertad, Pogoloti-Bel\u00e9n-Finlay, Santa Felicia.\n# '''[[La Lisa]] ''': Alturas de La Lisa, Balc\u00f3n Arimao, El Cano-Valle Grande-Bello 26 y Morado, [[Punta Brava]], Arroyo Arenas, San Agust\u00edn, Versalles-Coronela.\n# '''[[Boyeros]]''': [[Santiago de Las Vegas]], Nuevo Santiago, Boyeros, [[Wajay]], [[Calabazar]], Altahabana-Capdevila, Armada-Aldab\u00f3.\n# '''[[Arroyo Naranjo]]''': Los Pinos, Poey, V\u00edbora Park, Mantilla, P\u00e1rraga, Calvario-Fraternidad, Guinera, El\u00e9ctrico, Managua, Callejas.\n# '''[[Cotorro]]''': San Pedro-Centro Cotorro, Santa Maria del Rosario, Loter\u00eda, Cuatro Caminos, Magdalena-Torriente, Alberro.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Havana Capitol Building in 2019.jpg|thumb|left|[[El Capitolio|Capitolio Nacional]] in 2019]]\n[[File:La Habana Cuba.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings surrounding the [[Parque Central, Havana|Parque Central]]]]\nDue to Havana's almost [[History of Havana|five hundred-year existence]], the city boasts some of the most diverse styles of architecture in the world, from castles built in the late 16th century to modernist present-day high-rises.\n\nThe present condition of many buildings in Havana has deteriorated since the 1959 Revolution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-17935769|title=Cuba's crumbling buildings mean Havana housing shortage|last=Rainsford|first=Sarah|date=2012-05-17|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-24|language=en-GB}}</ref> Numerous collapses have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance and crumbling structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=112640|title=Old Havana Building Collapse Kills Four - Havana Times.org|website=www.havanatimes.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}</ref>\n\n;Neoclassical\n[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassism]] was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837. In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy ''Habaneros'' took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the ''Aldama Palace'' built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\n\nIn 1925 [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]], the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the [[Great Depression|great depression in 1929]]. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the [[Vedado|Vedado district]] (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style\n\n;Colonial and Baroque\n[[File:Edificio en la Habana.jpg|thumb|left|Neo-baroque apartment building]]\nRiches were brought from the colonialists into and through Havana as it was a key [[transshipment]] point between the [[new world]] and [[old world]]. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as [[La Caba\u00f1a|La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana]] (1558\u20131577) designed by [[Battista Antonelli]] and the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Castillo del Morro]] (1589\u20131630). This sits at the entrance of [[Havana Harbor|Havana Bay]] and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\n\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Centro Habana]]. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's colonial architecture, with a diverse range of [[Moorish architecture]], [[Spanish architecture|Spanish]], [[Architecture of Italy|Italian]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]]. The [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary]] (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. [[Cathedral of Havana|The Havana cathedral]] (1748\u20131777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720\u20131746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751\u20131775).\n\n;Art Deco and Eclectic\nThe first echoes of the [[Art Deco]] movement in Havana started in 1927, in the residential area of [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]].<ref name=\"Havana Deco\">{{cite book|last=Alonso|first=Alejandro|title=Havana Deco|year=2003|publisher=W.W.

This 35-story complex was conceived and based on Corbusian ideas of a self-contained city within a city. It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame) and the ultimate symbol of luxury and excess. The [[Hotel Habana Riviera|Havana Riviera]] Hotel (1957) designed by [[Igor B. Polevitzky]], a twenty-one-story edifice, when it opened, the Riviera was the largest purpose-built casino-hotel in Cuba or anywhere in the world, outside Las Vegas (the [[Havana Hilton]] (1958) surpassed its size a year later).\n\n===Landmarks and historical centres===\n* '''[[Old Havana|Habana Vieja]]''': contains the core of the original city of Havana.

La Habana Vieja was founded by the Spanish in 1519 in the natural harbor of the Bay of Havana. It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish [[Galleons]] on the crossing between the [[New World]] and the [[Old World]]. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in [[baroque]] and [[neoclassic style]].\n\nMany buildings have fallen in ruin but a number are being restored.

A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.\n\nWith the deterioration of [[Cuba \u2013 United States relations]] and the imposition of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo]] on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and [[Fidel Castro]] in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.\n\nThrough the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as ''Cubanacan''), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).\n\nHavana has also been a popular [[health tourism]] destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics]]. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], often known as [[night blindness]], has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html A Novel Tourism Concept] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=January 28, 2010 }} Caribbean News Net</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm Cuba sells its medical expertise] BBC News</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Industry===\n[[File:Leyden freighter, Havana Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|M V Leyden freighter in the harbor]]\n[[File:Lonja del Comercio de La Habana vista desde la Avenida del Puerto.jpg|thumb|[[Lonja del Comercio building]]]]\nHavana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.\n\nThe city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centres in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing [[slave]] trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the centre of much of the nation's industry.\n\nThe traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous [[Habanos S.A.|Habanos]] cigars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jtahtinen/economy.html |title=The economy of Havana |publisher=Macalester.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> Although the [[harbour]]s of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Matanzas]], in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.\n\nIn 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labour force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |title=Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |archivedate = 2010-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHavana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011.

In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.\n\nIn Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities.

There is only one political party, the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]], but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates in turn elect members of the Provincial Assembly, which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president functions as the Mayor. There are direct elections for deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local municipal delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. In addition, there is participation from \"mass organisations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.\n\nHavana city borders are contiguous with the [[Mayabeque Province]] on the south and east and to [[Artemisa Province]] on the west, since former [[La Habana Province]] (rural) was abolished in 2010.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Education===\n[[File:University of Havana.JPG|thumb|[[University of Havana]]]]\n[[File:Facultad de Matem\u00e1ticas y Ciencias de la Computaci\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, ''University of Havana'']]\n\n{{Further|Education in Cuba}}\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.\n\nThe [[University of Havana]], located in the [[Vedado]] section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the [[Polytechnic Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda|Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echeverr\u00eda]] where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.\n\nThe [[Cuban National Ballet School]] with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious [[ballet]] school in Cuba.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html La Escuela Nacional de Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000202/http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html |date=2009-06-23 }} \u2013 La Escuela desarrolla una experiencia \u00fanica en el mundo, enmarcada en la Batalla de Ideas.</ref>\n\n===Health===\n{{Further|Healthcare in Cuba}}\nAll Cuban residents have free access to health care in hospitals,<ref name=\"Harvard\">[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html Harvard Public Health Review/Summer 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120530063729/http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html |date=2012-05-30 }} The Cuban Paradox</ref> local polyclinics, and neighborhood family doctors who serve on average 170 families each,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4583668.stm Medical know-how boosts Cuba's wealth] BBC online.</ref> which is one of the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the world.<ref>[http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/indicators.cfm?x=58&y=2&z=1 Commitment to health: resources, access and services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718084329/http://hdr.undp.org/statistics/data/indicators.cfm?x=58&y=2&z=1 |date=July 18, 2006 }} United Nations Human Development report</ref> However, the health system has suffered from shortages of supplies, equipment and medications caused by ending of the [[Soviet Union]] subsidies in the early 1990s and the [[United States embargo against Cuba|US embargo]].<ref name=\"US embargo\">The effects of the U.S. embargo on medicines in Cuba have been studied in numerous reports.<br />\n\u2022 '''R Garfield and S Santana'''.

Water, electricity, and sewage service are administered in this fashion. Electricity is supplied by generators that are fueled with oil. Much of the original power plant installations, which operated before the Revolutionary government assumed control, have become somewhat outdated. Electrical blackouts occurred, prompting the national government in 1986 to allocate the equivalent of $25,000,000 to modernize the electrical system.\n\n==Sports==\nMany Cubans are avid sports fans who particularly favour baseball. Havana's team in the [[Cuban National Series]] is [[Industriales]]. FCBA. The city has several large sports stadiums, the largest one is the [[Estadio Latinoamericano]]. Admission to sporting events is generally free, and impromptu games are played in neighborhoods throughout the city.

All attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed. However, an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of this river.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [[commons:File:LaHabanaalSur.jpg|Fundaci\u00f3n de La Habana a orillas del R\u00edo Onicajinal o Mayabeque]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mayabeque.blogia.com/2009/092601-san-cristobal-de-la-habana-en-el-sur-analisis-historico-geografico-de-su-localiz.php |title=San Cristobal de La Habana en el Sur |publisher=Mayabeque.blogia.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2013-01-08}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established at least two settlements on the north coast, one of them in ''La Chorrera'', today in the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the [[Almendares River]]. The town that became Havana finally originated adjacent to what was then called ''Puerto de Carenas'' (literally, \"[[Careening]] Bay\"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.\n\n[[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] gave Havana \u2013 the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba \u2013 its name: ''San Crist\u00f3bal de la Habana''. The name combines ''San Crist\u00f3bal'', [[patron saint]] of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the ''Conquista'' of other lands.\n\nHavana began as a [[port|trading port]], and suffered regular attacks by [[buccaneer]]s, [[piracy|pirates]], and [[French corsairs]]. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair [[Jacques de Sores]] in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities \u2013 not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive ''contrabando'' ([[black market]]) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the ''[[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]]'' of [[Seville]] (the crown-controlled trading house that held a [[monopoly]] on New World trade).\n\nShips from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, in order to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.\n\nOn December 20, 1592, [[King Philip II of Spain]] granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as \"Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies\" by the [[Spanish Crown]]. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.\n\n====17th century====\n[[File:Panorama of La Habana (Amsterdam, 17th century).jpg|thumb|17th-century depiction of Havana from the [[Beudeker Collection]]]]\nHavana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly [[wood]], combining various [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from [[Canary Islands|Canarian]] characteristics.\n\nIn 1649, an epidemic of the often fatal [[Yellow fever]] brought from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in Colombia affected a third of the European population of Havana.<ref>C Cumo.

Havana built nearly 50% more Ships of the Line than any other Spanish dockyard during the 18th century.</ref>\n\nThe city was captured by the [[Great Britain|British]] during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The [[Battle of Havana (1762)|episode]] began on June 6, 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the [[Royal Navy]] and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana.<ref name=\"Seven Years War\">Pocock, Tom: Battle for Empire: The very first world war 1756\u201363. Chapter Six.</ref> The British immediately opened up trade with their [[North American]] and [[British West Indies|Caribbean colonies]], causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.<ref name=\"Siege\">Thomas, Hugh: Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom 2nd edition. Chapter One</ref>\n\nAfter regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of [[La Caba\u00f1a|San Carlos de la Caba\u00f1a]], the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after [[Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal (San Juan)|Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal]] (the biggest) and [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On January 15, 1796, the remains of [[Christopher Columbus]] were transported to the island from [[Santo Domingo]]. They rested here until 1898, when they were transferred to [[Seville Cathedral|Seville's Cathedral]], after Spain's loss of Cuba.\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:Mapa de La Habana Vieja.JPG|thumb|right|19th-century depiction of Havana]]\nAs trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the [[Antilles]].\n\nIn 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a {{convert|51|km|abbr=on}} stretch between Havana and [[Bejucal]], which was used for transporting [[sugar]] from the valley of [[G\u00fcines]] to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the [[Great Theatre of Havana|Tacon Teatre]], one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] to create a [[Golden Circle (proposed country)|'Golden Circle']] with a 1200&nbsp;mile-radius centered on Havana. After the [[Confederate States of America]] were defeated in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.\n\nIn 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the [[metropolis]] could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish colonialism in the Americas.\n\n===Republican period and post-revolution===\nThe 20th century began with Cuba, and therefore Havana, under occupation by the United States.<ref>Cant\u00f3n Navarro, Jos\u00e9. ''History of Cuba'', p. 81.</ref> The US occupation officially ended when [[Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma]], [[List of Presidents of Cuba|first president of Cuba]], took office on 20 May 1902.\n\nDuring the Republican Period, from 1902 to 1959, the city saw a new era of development. Cuba recovered from the devastation of war to become a well-off country, with the third largest middle class in the hemisphere. Apartment buildings to accommodate the new middle class, as well as mansions for the Cuban tycoons, were built at a fast pace.\n\n[[File:HavanaNewCapitalBldg1920.jpg|thumb|left|[[El Capitolio|Capitolio Nacional]] in 1929]]\n[[File:Museo de La Revolucion, Cuba.jpg|[[Kavanagh building]]|thumb|The former presidential palace now houses a museum]]\nNumerous luxury hotels, casinos and nightclubs were constructed during the 1930s to serve Havana's burgeoning tourist industry, which greatly benefited by the U.S. [[prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on alcohol from 1920 to 1933. In the 1930s, organized crime characters were not unaware of Havana's nightclub and casino life, and they made their inroads in the city. [[Santo Trafficante Jr.]] took the roulette wheel at the Sans Souci Casino, [[Meyer Lansky]] directed the [[Hotel Habana Riviera]], with [[Lucky Luciano]] at the [[Hotel Nacional de Cuba|Hotel Nacional]] Casino. At the time, Havana became an exotic capital of appeal and numerous activities ranging from marinas, grand prix car racing, musical shows, and parks. It was also the favorite destination of [[sex tourists]].<ref>{{cite book\n|title=HAVANA BEFORE CASTRO : when Cuba was a tropical playground.\n|first=Peter\n|last=Moruzzi\n|year=2018\n|publisher=Gibbs Smith\n|isbn=1423603672}}</ref>{{rp|127}}\n\nHavana achieved the title of being the [[Latin American]] city with the biggest middle class population per-capita, simultaneously accompanied by gambling and corruption where gangsters and stars were known to mix socially. During this era, Havana was generally producing more revenue than [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]], whose boom as a tourist destination began only after Havana's casinos closed in 1959. In 1958, about 300,000 American tourists visited the city.\n\nAfter the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution of 1959]], the new r\u00e9gime under [[Fidel Castro]] promised to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]], shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966\u201368, the Cuban government had [[nationalized]] all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to \"certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce\" (law No. 1076<ref>{{cite web|author= Nigel Hunt |url= http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=236 |title= Cuba Nationalization Laws |publisher= cuba heritage .org |accessdate= 2009-07-08}}</ref>).\n\nA severe economic downturn occurred after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the [[Cuba \u2013 Soviet Union relations|Cuban government]]. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet [[satellite state]]s of [[Eastern Europe]]. However, contrary to events in Europe, Cuba's communist government persevered through the 1990s and persists to this day.\n\nAfter many years of [[prohibition]], the communist government increasingly turned to [[tourism in Cuba|tourism]] for new financial revenue, and has allowed foreign investors to build new hotels and develop the hospitality industry. In Old Havana, effort has also gone into rebuilding for tourist purposes, and a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated.<ref>\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012210544/http://granma.cu/ESPANOL/2006/diciembre/juev7/elogian-e.html Old Havana restoration] \u2013 Success on the restoration program of Havana\n</ref>\nBut Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|Astronaut photograph of Havana]]\n\nHavana lies on the northern coast of Cuba, south of the [[Florida Keys]], where the Gulf of Mexico joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbours: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atar\u00e9s. The sluggish [[Almendares River]] traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.\n\nThere are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the deep blue waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-metre) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of [[La Caba\u00f1a]] and [[Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro|El Morro]], the sites of colonial fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the [[University of Havana]] and the Prince's Castle. Outside the city, higher hills rise on the west and east.\n\n===Climate===\nHavana, like much of Cuba, has a [[tropical climate]] that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the [[trade wind]]s and by the warm offshore currents. Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Havana has a [[tropical savanna climate]] that closely borders on a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Average temperatures range from {{convert|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in January and February to {{convert|28|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in August. The temperature seldom drops below {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was {{convert|1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} in Bainoa, [[Mayabeque Province]] (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging {{convert|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}} annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country.\n\nTornadoes can be somewhat rare in Cuba, however, on the evening of January 28, 2019, a very rare strong [[Fujita scale|F4]] [[tornado]] struck the eastern side of Havana, Cuba's capital city. The tornado caused extensive damage, destroying at least 90 homes, killing four people and injuring 195.<ref>{{cite web |title=Havana tornado: Cuba's capital hit by rare twister |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-47025852 |website=BBC News |accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129181446/http://www.startribune.com/the-latest-resident-havana-looks-like-a-horror-movie/504962142/ |archive-date=2019-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/americas/cuba-tornado-dead-scli-intl/index.html</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cappucci |first1=Matthew |title=A deadly tornado plowed through Havana on Sunday night.

In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy ''Habaneros'' took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the ''Aldama Palace'' built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.\n\nIn 1925 [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]], the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the [[Great Depression|great depression in 1929]]. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the [[Vedado|Vedado district]] (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style\n\n;Colonial and Baroque\n[[File:Edificio en la Habana.jpg|thumb|left|Neo-baroque apartment building]]\nRiches were brought from the colonialists into and through Havana as it was a key [[transshipment]] point between the [[new world]] and [[old world]]. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as [[La Caba\u00f1a|La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana]] (1558\u20131577) designed by [[Battista Antonelli]] and the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Castillo del Morro]] (1589\u20131630). This sits at the entrance of [[Havana Harbor|Havana Bay]] and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.\n\nOld Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighbourhood of [[Centro Habana]]. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's colonial architecture, with a diverse range of [[Moorish architecture]], [[Spanish architecture|Spanish]], [[Architecture of Italy|Italian]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]]. The [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary]] (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. [[Cathedral of Havana|The Havana cathedral]] (1748\u20131777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720\u20131746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751\u20131775).\n\n;Art Deco and Eclectic\nThe first echoes of the [[Art Deco]] movement in Havana started in 1927, in the residential area of [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]].<ref name=\"Havana Deco\">{{cite book|last=Alonso|first=Alejandro|title=Havana Deco|year=2003|publisher=W.W.

It contained 400 apartments, garages, a school, a supermarket, and restaurant on the top floor. This was the tallest concrete structure in the world at the time (using no steel frame) and the ultimate symbol of luxury and excess. The [[Hotel Habana Riviera|Havana Riviera]] Hotel (1957) designed by [[Igor B.

It became a stopping point for the treasure laden Spanish [[Galleons]] on the crossing between the [[New World]] and the [[Old World]]. In the 17th century, it was one of the main shipbuilding centers. The city was built in [[baroque]] and [[neoclassic style]].\n\nMany buildings have fallen in ruin but a number are being restored.

Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"Miguel\">[http://world-tourism.org/quality_/E/docs/trade/cubacontrib.pdf International Tourism and the Formation of Productive Clusters in the Cuban Economy Miguel Alejandro Figueras]  {{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The influx was due in large part to [[Cuba-United States relations|Cuba's proximity to the United States]], where restrictive [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.\n\nWith the deterioration of [[Cuba \u2013 United States relations]] and the imposition of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo]] on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and [[Fidel Castro]] in particular, initially opposed any considerable development of the tourism industry, linking it to the debauchery and criminal activities of times past. In the late 1970s, however, Castro changed his stance and, in 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors, tourism included, to foreign capital.\n\nThrough the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as ''Cubanacan''), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).\n\nHavana has also been a popular [[health tourism]] destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics]]. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], often known as [[night blindness]], has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html A Novel Tourism Concept] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=January 28, 2010 }} Caribbean News Net</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm Cuba sells its medical expertise] BBC News</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n\n===Industry===\n[[File:Leyden freighter, Havana Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|M V Leyden freighter in the harbor]]\n[[File:Lonja del Comercio de La Habana vista desde la Avenida del Puerto.jpg|thumb|[[Lonja del Comercio building]]]]\nHavana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.\n\nThe city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centres in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing [[slave]] trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the centre of much of the nation's industry.\n\nThe traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centred elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous [[Habanos S.A.|Habanos]] cigars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jtahtinen/economy.html |title=The economy of Havana |publisher=Macalester.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-17}}</ref> Although the [[harbour]]s of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Matanzas]], in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.\n\nIn 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labour force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |title=Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-17|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |archivedate = 2010-07-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHavana's economy is still in flux, despite Raul Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.<ref>{{cite web|last=AP|title=Lack of Customers Dooms Many Cuban Businesses|url=http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228034327/http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 December 2013|publisher=Weekly Times|accessdate=27 December 2013|date=27 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Commerce and finance===\nAfter the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.\n\nIn Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the [[National Bank of Cuba]], headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.\n\nIn the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, [[casino]]s, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.<ref>{{cite web|title=De una casa colonial a una mansi\u00f3n del Vedado |url=http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013131209/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 October 2004 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\n[[Vedado]] is today Havana's financial district, the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=britannica.com |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012165946/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 October 2007 |work=britannica.com|accessdate=11 July 2011 }}</ref> The University of Havana is located in Vedado.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Iglesia del Santo Angel, La Habana Vieja.jpg|thumb|left|[[Santo Angel Custodio Church]]]]\n[[File:Catedral Ortodoxa Rusa Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Kaz\u00e1n, Cuba.jpg |thumb|left|[[Our Lady of Kazan Orthodox Cathedral|Russian Orthodox Cathedral Our Lady of Kazan]]]]\n{{Historical populations\n|type = \n|footnote =\n|1750 | 70000\n|1931 | 728500\n|1943 | 946000\n|1953 | 1223900\n|1960 | 1529800\n|1975 | 1917500\n|1981 | 1929400\n|1990 | 2107500\n|1997 | 2197700\n|2002 | 2204028\n|2005 | 2181324\n|2009 | 2141993\n|2012 | 2106146\n}}\n\nBy the end of 2012 official Census, 19.1% of the population of Cuba lived in Havana.<ref name=Official_census /> According to the census of 2012, the population was 2,106,146<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/cepde/cpv2012/20131107resumenadelantado/Tablas/4.pdf 2012 Official Census] \u2013 Province, City and ethnic group</ref> The city has an average [[life expectancy]] of 76.81 years at birth.<ref name=Official_census /> In 2009, there were 1,924 people living with [[HIV]]/AIDS in the city, 78.9% of these are men, and 21.1% being women.<ref>[http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/cepde/EncuestaSida/Informe%20resumen%20de%20la%20Encuesta%20a%20PVs%202009.pdf Official Census, people living with HIV/AIDS in Havana]</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2012 official census (the Cuban census and similar studies use the term \"skin colour\" instead of \"race\").<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n* [[White people#Cuba|White]]: 58.4%, ([[Spaniards|Spanish]] descent were most common)<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref name=immigracion>[http://embacuba.cubaminrex.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=5598 Embassy of Cuba in Beijing \u2013 History of Immigration in Cuba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203174406/http://embacuba.cubaminrex.cu/Default.aspx?tabid=5598 |date=2009-02-03 }} \"The first (immigrants) came from various regions of Spain, mostly peasants from the Canaries and Galicia, which like those from China, were subjected to conditions of living and working conditions similar to those of slaves.\"</ref>\n* ''[[Mestizo]] or [[Mulatto]]'' (mixed race): 26.4%\n* [[Afro-Cuban|Black]]: 15.2%\n* [[Chinese Cuban|Asian]]: 0.2%<ref name=immigracion/>\n\nThere are few [[mestizos]] in contrast to many other [[Latin American]] countries, because the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Indian]] population was virtually wiped out by Eurasian diseases in colonial times.<ref>{{Cite book|first = Joseph Patrick|last=Byrne|title= Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues: A\u2013M|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kRAInwEACAAJ|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year = 2008|page = 413|isbn = 0-313-34102-8}}\n</ref>\n\nHavana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1 million inhabitants in the 1943 census.

Moreover, the all-embracing authority of many national institutions has led to a declining role for the city government, which, nevertheless, still provides much of the essential services and has competences in education, health care, city public transport, garbage collection, small industry, agriculture, etc.\n\nVoters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections. There is only one political party, the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]], but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates in turn elect members of the Provincial Assembly, which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president functions as the Mayor. There are direct elections for deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local municipal delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. In addition, there is participation from \"mass organisations\" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.\n\nHavana city borders are contiguous with the [[Mayabeque Province]] on the south and east and to [[Artemisa Province]] on the west, since former [[La Habana Province]] (rural) was abolished in 2010.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n\n===Education===\n[[File:University of Havana.JPG|thumb|[[University of Havana]]]]\n[[File:Facultad de Matem\u00e1ticas y Ciencias de la Computaci\u00f3n.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, ''University of Havana'']]\n\n{{Further|Education in Cuba}}\nThe national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba.

He was created by [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]], and is voiced by Povenmire. The character first appeared in the pilot episode of ''Phineas and Ferb''. He is described as an incompetent and forgetful [[evil scientist]] intent on conquering the \"entire tri-state area\" by creating obscure but nefarious inventions, despite not technically being a true villain and has a good side on some occasions. By the time of ''[[O.W.C.A. Files]]'' and ''Milo Murphy's Law'', the character is redeemed, using his inventions for the good of the world and looking after his daughter Vanessa. Dr. Doofenshmirtz speaks with a caricature of a [[German language|German]] accent and is from the fictional [[Europe]]an country Drusselstein.\n\nDoofenshmirtz appears in several merchandise pieces, including the book series<ref name=\"Book1\">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jasmine|title=Speed Demons|url=https://archive.org/details/speeddemons0000jone|url-access=registration|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=1-4231-1628-3|year=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Book2\">{{cite book|last=Bergen|first=Lara Rice|title=Runaway Hit|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=1-4231-1797-2|year=2009|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/runawayhit0000berg}}</ref><ref name=\"Book3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=Phineas+and+Ferb+books&oe=utf-8&cid=14715976473066931833&sa=title#ps-sellers|title=Wild Surprise.|work=Google Shopping}}</ref><ref name=\"Book4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=Phineas+and+Ferb+books&oe=utf-8&cid=14829553982344007318&sa=title#ps-sellers|title=Thrill-o-rama.|work=Google Shopping}}</ref> and the video game.<ref name=\"Game\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/16586-phineas-and-ferb-ds-game-review |title=Phineas and Ferb :: DS Game Review |publisher=Kidzworld |date= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> He later made an appearance in the ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'' episode \"Fungus Among Us\";<ref>https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/phineas-and-ferb-dr-doofenshmirtz-milo-murphys-law-crossover-disney-xd-1202574269/</ref> following his house being destroyed in the second season premiere, he begins to live in the Murphys' house, and subsequently becomes a main character in the series.<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/milo-murphys-law-phineas-ferb-crossover-is-coming-1022459</ref>\n\n==Role in ''Phineas and Ferb''==\nDoofenshmirtz is portrayed as a bumbling, dimwitted evil genius.

The stories explore his mentally abusive childhood at the hands of his cold and apparently shallow parents in the fictional village of Gimmelshtump, Drusselstein, where his brother, [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Roger Doofenshmirtz|Roger]], is favored over him.<ref name=\"podcast\">{{cite news|url= http://downloads.wired.com/podcasts/assets/thegeekdads/thegeekdadsspecialphineasandferb.mp3?_kip_ipx=1895089171-1238013329|title= \"The Geek Dads\" Podcast interview with Povenmire & Marsh | work=Wired}}</ref> Doofenshmirtz usually has long [[monologues]]<ref name=\"podcast\"/> and displays acts of \"cartoonish\" physical violence<ref name=\"IAT\" group=\"epnote\"/> towards [[Perry the Platypus]]. Often his inventions achieve a single successful shot before being destroyed. This shot usually serves to destroy [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb's]] inventions, preventing their sister, [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] from 'busting' them, i.e. showing their creations to their mother. According to his own life story, he was a [[bratwurst]] salesman, before being ruined by the [[hot dog]] industry; only then did he become an evil scientist.\n\nIn ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]'', a more intelligent and successful version of Dr. Doofenshmirtz (from an alternate reality) appears, with the regular Dr. Doofenshmirtz serving as a supporting character. The alternate Doofenshmirtz later returns in the episode sequel, ''Tales from the Resistance: Back to the 2nd Dimension''.\n\nDespite nearly failing in almost all of his schemes, there are a few times when Doofenshmirtz actually succeeds. One example is in the episode \"Candace Disconnected\", where he builds a Pick 'Em Up-Inator to successfully pick up his daughter from her school and bring her home in a couple of seconds. Another time is in the [[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension|TV film]], when he built an Otherdimension-Inator that involves traveling to alternate dimensions; this is done with the help from Phineas and Ferb, much to Perry's distress. In the episode \"Cranius Maximus\", Doofenshmirtz builds a Key-Find-Inator to successfully steal the Key to the City, something which Perry failed to stop. Another example, which is perhaps the most famous, is in the 2014 special \"Phineas and Ferb Save Summer\", when Doofenshmirtz builds an -inator that uses the mass of the planet Jupiter to move the Earth away from the Sun into an early autumn. Despite being beaten by Perry with a mop, Doofenshmirtz manages to succeed in moving the Earth anyway, much to Perry's dismay. It also may have allowed him to briefly take over the Tri-State Area, as the change in weather caused civil unrest and allowed Doofenshmirtz and his fellow villains to take over City Hall.\n\nIn the [[series finale]] \"Last Day of Summer\", Doofenshmritz built an -inator that involves building a Tri-Governor's Mansion to Danville so that he can be elected as the first Tri-Governor of the Tri-State Area. Through a series of time loops (caused by his Do-Over-Inator, which was activated by [[Candace Flynn|Candace]]), Doof anticipates Perry's every move and defeats him in a series of traps before proceeding with his scheme, which became a complete success. He even took the opportunity to write up a law forbidding Perry and his agents from thwarting him until his term is over, which left Perry very depressed and admitting defeat. Despite succeeding in his lifelong goal, Doof learns that Vanessa wants to have an internship at O.W.C.A. and that his job as Tri-Governor is preventing her from joining the internship, leaving her depressed as well. Deciding that her happiness is more important than his evil ways, Doof decides to give them up, change for the better and allow Vanessa to have the internship. Following this, Doof also becomes a member of O.W.C.A.\n\n=== Running gags ===\nDr. Doofenshmirtz is a part of various [[running gag]]s in ''Phineas and Ferb''. One is his redundant naming of inventions, which almost always end with the [[suffix]] \"inator\".<ref name=\"MB\" group=\"epnote\">{{cite episode|title=Mom's Birthday|season=1|network=Disney Channel|series=Phineas and Ferb|number=11|credits=Director: Zac Moncrief}}</ref> Furthermore, Dr. Doofenshmirtz only recognizes the hat-wearing version of Perry. During every introduction of Dr. Doofenshmirtz in the episodes, the audience (and sometimes the characters), hears the ring tone of Doofenshmirtz, typically with the words \"Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated\", and is almost always sung by a quartet.<ref name=\"jcc\" group=\"epnote\">{{cite episode|title=Attack of the 50 Foot Sister|series=[[Phineas and Ferb]]| season= 2|episode= 51|credits=Writer: Jon Colton Barry, Piero Piluso; Director: [[Zac Moncrief]]|network=[[Disney XD]]}}</ref> Habitually, Doofenshmirtz's daily encounters with Perry follow a chain of events that routinely begins with a [[back-story]] told by Doofenshmirtz<ref name=\"Meap\" group=\"epnote\">{{cite episode|title=The Chronicles of Meap|series=Phineas and Ferb|number=59|season=2|network=Disney XD}}</ref><ref name=\"Plane\" group=\"epnote\">{{cite episode|title=De Plane!

The residents of the town of Danville often mistake Doofenshmirtz for a pharmacist because he is always wearing a white lab coat. This theme was featured in a two-part 2014 Halloween episode entitled \"Night of the Living Pharmacists\".\n\n==Role in ''Milo Murphy's Law''==\n\nDoof makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the ending cliffhanger of the season finale of ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'', and tries to become a good guy throughout the [[Milo Murphy's Law#Season 2 (2019)|second season]].\n\n== Creation and design ==\n[[File:Dan Povenmire Comic-Con 2009.jpg|thumb|245px|Doofenshmirtz is voiced by ''Phineas and Ferb'' co-creator [[Dan Povenmire]].<ref name=\"podcast\"/>]]\nWhen [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]] and [[Dan Povenmire]] worked on the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]],'' they always included a song/musical number and an action/chase scene.

To this day, his sister recognizes the voice and asks him to do it frequently. During recording sessions, Povenmire is easily able to ad-lib and [[improvise]]; the writers can change his lines without throwing him off.<ref name=\"podcast\"/> Povenmire sometimes even adds his own lines or alters his enunciation{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}, and is usually asked to perform the voice in interviews.<ref name=\"podcast\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nDespite a negative review of the ''Phineas and Ferb'' series on ''Toon Zone'', Maxie Zeus notes that Povenmire's performance as Doofenshmirtz is a strong point of the series. Zeus states that \"Dan Povenmire voices him with such energy, and with such perfect timing, that you'll laugh out loud even at the stuff that isn't even ''supposed'' to be funny.\" Zeus also says that the Doofenshmirtz subplot would have made a \"fine bit of sketch writing\" if trimmed down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/articles/21300/phineas-and-ferb-spawn-of-frankenstein|title=\"Phineas and Ferb\": Spawn of Frankenstein|work=Toon Zone|last=Zeus|first=Maxie|date=February 1, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822024814/http://news.toonzone.net/articles/21300/phineas-and-ferb-spawn-of-frankenstein|archivedate=August 22, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Josh Jackson, editor-in-chief for ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste Magazine]],'' wrote in a blog that ''Phineas and Ferb'' was \"the best kids show on TV\" and gave Doofenshmirtz a large amount of praise.

He was created by [[Dan Povenmire]] and [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]], and is voiced by Povenmire. The character first appeared in the pilot episode of ''Phineas and Ferb''. He is described as an incompetent and forgetful [[evil scientist]] intent on conquering the \"entire tri-state area\" by creating obscure but nefarious inventions, despite not technically being a true villain and has a good side on some occasions. By the time of ''[[O.W.C.A. Files]]'' and ''Milo Murphy's Law'', the character is redeemed, using his inventions for the good of the world and looking after his daughter Vanessa. Dr. Doofenshmirtz speaks with a caricature of a [[German language|German]] accent and is from the fictional [[Europe]]an country Drusselstein.\n\nDoofenshmirtz appears in several merchandise pieces, including the book series<ref name=\"Book1\">{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jasmine|title=Speed Demons|url=https://archive.org/details/speeddemons0000jone|url-access=registration|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=1-4231-1628-3|year=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Book2\">{{cite book|last=Bergen|first=Lara Rice|title=Runaway Hit|publisher=Disney Press|isbn=1-4231-1797-2|year=2009|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/runawayhit0000berg}}</ref><ref name=\"Book3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=Phineas+and+Ferb+books&oe=utf-8&cid=14715976473066931833&sa=title#ps-sellers|title=Wild Surprise.|work=Google Shopping}}</ref><ref name=\"Book4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=Phineas+and+Ferb+books&oe=utf-8&cid=14829553982344007318&sa=title#ps-sellers|title=Thrill-o-rama.|work=Google Shopping}}</ref> and the video game.<ref name=\"Game\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kidzworld.com/article/16586-phineas-and-ferb-ds-game-review |title=Phineas and Ferb :: DS Game Review |publisher=Kidzworld |date= |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> He later made an appearance in the ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'' episode \"Fungus Among Us\";<ref>https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/phineas-and-ferb-dr-doofenshmirtz-milo-murphys-law-crossover-disney-xd-1202574269/</ref> following his house being destroyed in the second season premiere, he begins to live in the Murphys' house, and subsequently becomes a main character in the series.<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/milo-murphys-law-phineas-ferb-crossover-is-coming-1022459</ref>\n\n==Role in ''Phineas and Ferb''==\nDoofenshmirtz is portrayed as a bumbling, dimwitted evil genius.

The stories explore his mentally abusive childhood at the hands of his cold and apparently shallow parents in the fictional village of Gimmelshtump, Drusselstein, where his brother, [[List of Phineas and Ferb characters#Roger Doofenshmirtz|Roger]], is favored over him.<ref name=\"podcast\">{{cite news|url= http://downloads.wired.com/podcasts/assets/thegeekdads/thegeekdadsspecialphineasandferb.mp3?_kip_ipx=1895089171-1238013329|title= \"The Geek Dads\" Podcast interview with Povenmire & Marsh | work=Wired}}</ref> Doofenshmirtz usually has long [[monologues]]<ref name=\"podcast\"/> and displays acts of \"cartoonish\" physical violence<ref name=\"IAT\" group=\"epnote\"/> towards [[Perry the Platypus]]. Often his inventions achieve a single successful shot before being destroyed. This shot usually serves to destroy [[Phineas Flynn|Phineas]] and [[Ferb Fletcher|Ferb's]] inventions, preventing their sister, [[Candace Flynn|Candace]] from 'busting' them, i.e. showing their creations to their mother. According to his own life story, he was a [[bratwurst]] salesman, before being ruined by the [[hot dog]] industry; only then did he become an evil scientist.\n\nIn ''[[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension]]'', a more intelligent and successful version of Dr. Doofenshmirtz (from an alternate reality) appears, with the regular Dr. Doofenshmirtz serving as a supporting character. The alternate Doofenshmirtz later returns in the episode sequel, ''Tales from the Resistance: Back to the 2nd Dimension''.\n\nDespite nearly failing in almost all of his schemes, there are a few times when Doofenshmirtz actually succeeds. One example is in the episode \"Candace Disconnected\", where he builds a Pick 'Em Up-Inator to successfully pick up his daughter from her school and bring her home in a couple of seconds. Another time is in the [[Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension|TV film]], when he built an Otherdimension-Inator that involves traveling to alternate dimensions; this is done with the help from Phineas and Ferb, much to Perry's distress. In the episode \"Cranius Maximus\", Doofenshmirtz builds a Key-Find-Inator to successfully steal the Key to the City, something which Perry failed to stop. Another example, which is perhaps the most famous, is in the 2014 special \"Phineas and Ferb Save Summer\", when Doofenshmirtz builds an -inator that uses the mass of the planet Jupiter to move the Earth away from the Sun into an early autumn. Despite being beaten by Perry with a mop, Doofenshmirtz manages to succeed in moving the Earth anyway, much to Perry's dismay. It also may have allowed him to briefly take over the Tri-State Area, as the change in weather caused civil unrest and allowed Doofenshmirtz and his fellow villains to take over City Hall.\n\nIn the [[series finale]] \"Last Day of Summer\", Doofenshmritz built an -inator that involves building a Tri-Governor's Mansion to Danville so that he can be elected as the first Tri-Governor of the Tri-State Area. Through a series of time loops (caused by his Do-Over-Inator, which was activated by [[Candace Flynn|Candace]]), Doof anticipates Perry's every move and defeats him in a series of traps before proceeding with his scheme, which became a complete success. He even took the opportunity to write up a law forbidding Perry and his agents from thwarting him until his term is over, which left Perry very depressed and admitting defeat. Despite succeeding in his lifelong goal, Doof learns that Vanessa wants to have an internship at O.W.C.A. and that his job as Tri-Governor is preventing her from joining the internship, leaving her depressed as well. Deciding that her happiness is more important than his evil ways, Doof decides to give them up, change for the better and allow Vanessa to have the internship. Following this, Doof also becomes a member of O.W.C.A.\n\n=== Running gags ===\nDr. Doofenshmirtz is a part of various [[running gag]]s in ''Phineas and Ferb''. One is his redundant naming of inventions, which almost always end with the [[suffix]] \"inator\".<ref name=\"MB\" group=\"epnote\">{{cite episode|title=Mom's Birthday|season=1|network=Disney Channel|series=Phineas and Ferb|number=11|credits=Director: Zac Moncrief}}</ref> Furthermore, Dr. Doofenshmirtz only recognizes the hat-wearing version of Perry. During every introduction of Dr. Doofenshmirtz in the episodes, the audience (and sometimes the characters), hears the ring tone of Doofenshmirtz, typically with the words \"Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated\", and is almost always sung by a quartet.<ref name=\"jcc\" group=\"epnote\">{{cite episode|title=Attack of the 50 Foot Sister|series=[[Phineas and Ferb]]| season= 2|episode= 51|credits=Writer: Jon Colton Barry, Piero Piluso; Director: [[Zac Moncrief]]|network=[[Disney XD]]}}</ref> Habitually, Doofenshmirtz's daily encounters with Perry follow a chain of events that routinely begins with a [[back-story]] told by Doofenshmirtz<ref name=\"Meap\" group=\"epnote\">{{cite episode|title=The Chronicles of Meap|series=Phineas and Ferb|number=59|season=2|network=Disney XD}}</ref><ref name=\"Plane\" group=\"epnote\">{{cite episode|title=De Plane!

The residents of the town of Danville often mistake Doofenshmirtz for a pharmacist because he is always wearing a white lab coat. This theme was featured in a two-part 2014 Halloween episode entitled \"Night of the Living Pharmacists\".\n\n==Role in ''Milo Murphy's Law''==\n\nDoof makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the ending cliffhanger of the season finale of ''[[Milo Murphy's Law]]'', and tries to become a good guy throughout the [[Milo Murphy's Law#Season 2 (2019)|second season]].\n\n== Creation and design ==\n[[File:Dan Povenmire Comic-Con 2009.jpg|thumb|245px|Doofenshmirtz is voiced by ''Phineas and Ferb'' co-creator [[Dan Povenmire]].<ref name=\"podcast\"/>]]\nWhen [[Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh]] and [[Dan Povenmire]] worked on the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]],'' they always included a song/musical number and an action/chase scene.
