[...] Most Roma neighbourhoods consist of slums, precariously built without planning permission on land that often belongs to the municipalities [...]. As the Bulgarian authorities have not taken steps to address the situation, the people living in these districts have no access to basic public services, whether health care, public transport, waste collection or sanitation.\"<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web\n| year = 2003\n| url = http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/BGR-CbC-III-2004-2-ENG.pdf\n| title = Third report on Bulgaria\n| publisher = Council of Europe - ECRI\n| accessdate = 2009-02-22\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo which the Bulgarian government answered officially in the same document:\n\n<blockquote>ECRI has correctly observed that members of the Roma community encounter \u201cserious difficulties\u201d \u201cin many spheres of life\u201d. The rest of this paragraph, however, regrettably contains sweeping, grossly inaccurate generalizations ... Due to various objective and subjective factors, many (but by no means all!) members of the Roma community found it particularly difficult to adapt to the new realities of the market economy. \u201c\u2026Romani mahala-dwellers are still captives of the past, holding onto and behaving according to preconceptions about the socialist welfare state that clash with the modern realities of a market economy and privatisation.\u201d (Skopje Report, p.6)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.per-usa.org/reports/Roma-Skopje.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710184636/http://www.per-usa.org/reports/Roma-Skopje.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMore concretely, the allegation that the people living in these districts \u201chave no access to basic public services\u201d is largely inaccurate. Certain difficulties (though not remotely on the scale suggested) do exist in this regard, and the authorities are taking concrete measures to address them (see above). However, as the Advisor on Roma and Sinti issues at the OSCE, N. Gheorghe remarked during the Skopje meeting: \u201c\u2026many of the Roma confuse public services with rights to which they are entitled and which are guaranteed by the welfare state\u201d (Skopje Report, p.16). ...\n\nConcerning the issue of the electricity supply it should be noted that dwellers of such neighbourhoods sometimes refuse to pay their electricity bills. This attitude could at least in part be explained by the fact that \u201c\u2026Romani mahala-dwellers believe they have rights as citizens to electricity and other services, and that the state has an obligation to provide and to a large extent to subsidize them\u201d (Skopje Report, p. 7). In these circumstances electricity suppliers may find themselves with no other option but to \u201csometimes cut off\u201d the electricity supply in order to incite the consumers to commence honouring their debts. Such cut-offs are part of standard practice and the ethnic origin of the consumers is irrelevant in these cases.\n\nWith respect to welfare benefits, which allegedly \u201cin some cases, moreover, Roma do not receive\u201d while \u201cthey are entitled\u201d to them, it should be underscored that Bulgaria\u2019s social welfare legislation sets uniform objective criteria for access to welfare benefits for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin (furthermore, any discrimination, including on ethnic grounds is expressly prohibited by law). The question of who is entitled or not entitled to welfare benefits is determined by the relevant services on the basis of a means test. Every single decision of these services must be (and is) in written form and clearly motivated. If a claimant is not satisfied with a decision, he/she is entitled to appeal it before the regional welfare office. Consequently, this allegation of ECRI is also erroneous.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>\n\nA monitoring report by the [[Open Society Institute]] found that Romani children and teenagers are less likely to enroll in primary and secondary schools than the majority population and less likely to complete their education if they do. Between 60% and 77% of Romani children enroll in primary education (ages 6\u201315), compared to 90-94% of ethnic Bulgarians. Only 6%-12% of Romani teenagers enroll in secondary education (ages 16\u201319). The drop-out rate is significant, but hard to measure, as many are formally enrolled but rarely attend classes.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://www.eumap.org/topics/minority/reports/roma_education/reports/national/bulgaria/romeduc_bulgaria.pdf |title=Equal access to quality education for Roma, Bulgaria |pages=32\u201334 |publisher=Open Society Institute - EU Monitoring and Advocacy Program (EUMAP) |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227083217/http://www.eumap.org/topics/minority/reports/roma_education/reports/national/bulgaria/romeduc_bulgaria.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe report also indicates that Romani children and teenagers attend de facto segregated \"Roma schools\" in majority-Romani neighbourhoods and villages. These \"Roma schools\" offer inferior quality education; many are in bad physical condition and lack necessary facilities such as computers. As a result, Romani literacy rates, already below those for ethnic Bulgarians, are much lower still for Romani who have attended segregated schools.<ref>Equal access to quality education for Roma, Bulgaria, pp. 18-20.</ref>\n\nThe official position of the Bulgarian government to such segregation is:\n\n<blockquote>\"There had never been a policy of \"segregation\" of Roma children in the national education system. The fact that in some neighbourhoods in certain towns particular schools were attended predominantly by pupils of Roma origin was an [[unintended consequence]] of the administrative division of the school system. According to the rules valid for all children irrespective of their ethnic origin, admittance to any public school was linked administratively to the domicile of the family. In neighbourhoods where the population was predominantly of Roma origin, this system produced schools, attended predominantly by pupils of Roma origin. It is precisely this situation that the authorities are taking special measures to rectify. Therefore, the word \u201csegregation\" with respect to Roma children is inaccurate.\"<ref name=autogenerated1/></blockquote>\n\nRomani children are often sent to special schools for children with intellectual disabilities or boarding schools for children with \"deviant behavior\" (so-called \"delinquent schools\"). According to reports of the [[Bulgarian Helsinki Committee]] (BHC), Romani made up half the number of students in schools for children with intellectual disabilities and about two-thirds of the students of the boarding schools, where the BHC found a variety of human rights abuses, including physical violence. In both sets of special schools, the quality of teaching is very poor and essential things such as desks, textbooks and teaching materials are inadequate or altogether lacking.<ref>{{cite book | last = Bulgarian Helsinki Committee | title = \u041f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430 \u0432 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f (Remedial Schools in Bulgaria) | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-954-9738-14-8 }}{{cite book | last = Bulgarian Helsinki Committee | title = \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0432\u044a\u0437\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430-\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0438 (Social-Pedagogical Boarding Schools and Correctional Boarding Schools) | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-954-9738-03-2 | pages = 391\u2013392 }}{{cite book | last = Bulgarian Helsinki Committee | title = \u0412 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0430: \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0430 \u0432 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f (In the Name of the Institution: Schools for Delinquent Children in Bulgaria) | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-954-9738-21-6 }}</ref>\n\nOn two occasions, the European Committee of Social Rights has found violations of the [[European Social Charter]] in situations with Bulgaria's Romani population: in 2006, concerning right to housing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Complaints/CC31Merits_en.pdf |title=La Charte sociale europ\u00e9enne |website=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}</ref> and in 2008, concerning right to health<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/socialcharter/Complaints/CC46Merits_en.pdf |title=La Charte sociale europ\u00e9enne |website=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}</ref> \u2014 in both cases on complaints from the [[European Roma Rights Centre]].\n\n===Political representation===\nAccording to a report of POLITEA, \"For the most of the 1990s the only representation the Romani got was through the mainstream political parties.

[...] Most Roma neighbourhoods consist of slums, precariously built without planning permission on land that often belongs to the municipalities [...]. As the Bulgarian authorities have not taken steps to address the situation, the people living in these districts have no access to basic public services, whether health care, public transport, waste collection or sanitation.\"<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web\n| year = 2003\n| url = http://hudoc.ecri.coe.int/XMLEcri/ENGLISH/Cycle_03/03_CbC_eng/BGR-CbC-III-2004-2-ENG.pdf\n| title = Third report on Bulgaria\n| publisher = Council of Europe - ECRI\n| accessdate = 2009-02-22\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo which the Bulgarian government answered officially in the same document:\n\n<blockquote>ECRI has correctly observed that members of the Roma community encounter \u201cserious difficulties\u201d \u201cin many spheres of life\u201d. The rest of this paragraph, however, regrettably contains sweeping, grossly inaccurate generalizations ... Due to various objective and subjective factors, many (but by no means all!) members of the Roma community found it particularly difficult to adapt to the new realities of the market economy. \u201c\u2026Romani mahala-dwellers are still captives of the past, holding onto and behaving according to preconceptions about the socialist welfare state that clash with the modern realities of a market economy and privatisation.\u201d (Skopje Report, p.6)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.per-usa.org/reports/Roma-Skopje.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710184636/http://www.per-usa.org/reports/Roma-Skopje.pdf |archivedate=10 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMore concretely, the allegation that the people living in these districts \u201chave no access to basic public services\u201d is largely inaccurate. Certain difficulties (though not remotely on the scale suggested) do exist in this regard, and the authorities are taking concrete measures to address them (see above). However, as the Advisor on Roma and Sinti issues at the OSCE, N. Gheorghe remarked during the Skopje meeting: \u201c\u2026many of the Roma confuse public services with rights to which they are entitled and which are guaranteed by the welfare state\u201d (Skopje Report, p.16). ...\n\nConcerning the issue of the electricity supply it should be noted that dwellers of such neighbourhoods sometimes refuse to pay their electricity bills. This attitude could at least in part be explained by the fact that \u201c\u2026Romani mahala-dwellers believe they have rights as citizens to electricity and other services, and that the state has an obligation to provide and to a large extent to subsidize them\u201d (Skopje Report, p. 7). In these circumstances electricity suppliers may find themselves with no other option but to \u201csometimes cut off\u201d the electricity supply in order to incite the consumers to commence honouring their debts. Such cut-offs are part of standard practice and the ethnic origin of the consumers is irrelevant in these cases.\n\nWith respect to welfare benefits, which allegedly \u201cin some cases, moreover, Roma do not receive\u201d while \u201cthey are entitled\u201d to them, it should be underscored that Bulgaria\u2019s social welfare legislation sets uniform objective criteria for access to welfare benefits for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin (furthermore, any discrimination, including on ethnic grounds is expressly prohibited by law). The question of who is entitled or not entitled to welfare benefits is determined by the relevant services on the basis of a means test. Every single decision of these services must be (and is) in written form and clearly motivated. If a claimant is not satisfied with a decision, he/she is entitled to appeal it before the regional welfare office. Consequently, this allegation of ECRI is also erroneous.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>\n\nA monitoring report by the [[Open Society Institute]] found that Romani children and teenagers are less likely to enroll in primary and secondary schools than the majority population and less likely to complete their education if they do. Between 60% and 77% of Romani children enroll in primary education (ages 6\u201315), compared to 90-94% of ethnic Bulgarians. Only 6%-12% of Romani teenagers enroll in secondary education (ages 16\u201319). The drop-out rate is significant, but hard to measure, as many are formally enrolled but rarely attend classes.<ref>{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://www.eumap.org/topics/minority/reports/roma_education/reports/national/bulgaria/romeduc_bulgaria.pdf |title=Equal access to quality education for Roma, Bulgaria |pages=32\u201334 |publisher=Open Society Institute - EU Monitoring and Advocacy Program (EUMAP) |accessdate=2007-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227083217/http://www.eumap.org/topics/minority/reports/roma_education/reports/national/bulgaria/romeduc_bulgaria.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe report also indicates that Romani children and teenagers attend de facto segregated \"Roma schools\" in majority-Romani neighbourhoods and villages. These \"Roma schools\" offer inferior quality education; many are in bad physical condition and lack necessary facilities such as computers. As a result, Romani literacy rates, already below those for ethnic Bulgarians, are much lower still for Romani who have attended segregated schools.<ref>Equal access to quality education for Roma, Bulgaria, pp. 18-20.</ref>\n\nThe official position of the Bulgarian government to such segregation is:\n\n<blockquote>\"There had never been a policy of \"segregation\" of Roma children in the national education system. The fact that in some neighbourhoods in certain towns particular schools were attended predominantly by pupils of Roma origin was an [[unintended consequence]] of the administrative division of the school system. According to the rules valid for all children irrespective of their ethnic origin, admittance to any public school was linked administratively to the domicile of the family. In neighbourhoods where the population was predominantly of Roma origin, this system produced schools, attended predominantly by pupils of Roma origin. It is precisely this situation that the authorities are taking special measures to rectify. Therefore, the word \u201csegregation\" with respect to Roma children is inaccurate.\"<ref name=autogenerated1/></blockquote>\n\nRomani children are often sent to special schools for children with intellectual disabilities or boarding schools for children with \"deviant behavior\" (so-called \"delinquent schools\"). According to reports of the [[Bulgarian Helsinki Committee]] (BHC), Romani made up half the number of students in schools for children with intellectual disabilities and about two-thirds of the students of the boarding schools, where the BHC found a variety of human rights abuses, including physical violence.
