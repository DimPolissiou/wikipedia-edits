{"title_page": "Maximum entropy probability distribution", "text_new": "{{Short description|Probability distribution that has the most entropy of a class}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}\n{{more footnotes|date=December 2013}}\n}}\n\nIn [[statistics]] and [[information theory]], a '''maximum entropy probability distribution''' has [[information entropy|entropy]] that is at least as great as that of all other members of a specified class of [[probability distribution]]s. According to the [[principle of maximum entropy]], if nothing is known about a distribution except that it belongs to a certain class (usually defined in terms of specified properties or measures), then the distribution with the largest entropy should be chosen as the least-informative default. The motivation is twofold: first, maximizing entropy minimizes the amount of [[prior information]] built into the distribution; second, many physical systems tend to move towards maximal entropy configurations over time.\n\n== Definition of entropy and differential entropy ==\n{{further|Entropy (information theory)}}\n\nIf ''X'' is a [[discrete random variable]] with distribution given by\n:<math>\\operatorname{Pr}(X=x_k) = p_k \\quad\\mbox{ for } k=1,2,\\ldots</math>\nthen the entropy of ''X'' is defined as\n:<math>H(X) = - \\sum_{k\\ge 1}p_k\\log p_k .</math>\n\nIf ''X'' is a [[continuous random variable]] with [[probability density function|probability density]] ''p''(''x''), then the [[differential entropy]] of ''X'' is defined as<ref>Williams, D. (2001), ''Weighing the Odds'', [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-00618-X}}  (pages 197-199).</ref><ref>Bernardo, J. M., Smith, A. F. M.

(1994), ''Kendall's Advanced Theory of Statistics, Vol 2B, Bayesian Inference'', [[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]]. {{ISBN|0-340-52922-9}} (Section 5.40)</ref>\n:<math>H(X) = - \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x)\\log p(x)\\, dx.</math>\n\nThe quantity {{nowrap|''p''(''x'') log ''p''(''x'')}} is understood to be zero whenever {{nowrap|1=''p''(''x'') = 0}}.\n\nThis is a special case of more general forms described in the articles [[Entropy (information theory)]], [[Principle of maximum entropy]], and differential entropy. In connection with maximum entropy distributions, this is the only one needed, because maximizing <math>H(X)</math> will also maximize the more general forms.\n\nThe base of the [[logarithm]] is not important as long as the same one is used consistently: change of base merely results in a rescaling of the entropy. Information theorists may prefer to use base 2 in order to express the entropy in [[bit]]s; mathematicians and physicists will often prefer the [[natural logarithm]], resulting in a unit of [[Nat (unit)|nat]]s for the entropy.\n\nThe choice of the measure <math>dx</math> is however crucial in determining the entropy and the resulting maximum entropy distribution, even though the usual recourse to the [[Lebesgue measure]] is often defended as \"natural\"\n\n== Distributions with measured constants ==\nMany statistical distributions of applicable interest are those for which the [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] or other measurable quantities are constrained to be constants. The following theorem by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] gives the form of the probability density under these constraints.\n\n=== Continuous case ===\nSuppose ''S'' is a [[closed set|closed subset]] of the [[real number]]s '''R''' and we choose to specify ''n'' [[measurable function]]s ''f''<sub>1</sub>,...,''f''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''n'' numbers ''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>''n''</sub>. We consider the class ''C'' of all real-valued random variables which are supported on ''S'' \n(i.e. whose density function is zero outside of ''S'') and which satisfy \nthe ''n'' moment conditions: \n:<math>\\operatorname{E}(f_j(X)) \\geq a_j\\quad\\mbox{ for } j=1,\\ldots,n</math>  \nIf there is a member in ''C'' whose density function is positive everywhere in ''S'', and if there exists a maximal entropy distribution for ''C'', then its probability density ''p''(''x'') has the following shape:\n:<math>p(x)=\\exp\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^n \\lambda_j f_j(x)\\right)\\quad \\mbox{ for all } x\\in S</math>\nwhere we assume that <math>f_0(x)=1</math>.

The constraints can be written as\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f_j(x)p(x)dx=a_j</math>\n\nWe consider the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]\n\n:<math>J(p)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x)\\ln{p(x)}dx-\\eta_0\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x)dx-1\\right)-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\lambda_j\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_j(x)p(x)dx-a_j\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\eta_0</math> and <math>\\lambda_j, j\\geq 1</math> are the Lagrange multipliers. The zeroth constraint ensures the [[Probability axioms#Second axiom|second axiom of probability]]. The other constraints are that the measurements of the function are given constants up to order <math>n</math>. The entropy attains an extremum when the [[functional derivative]] is equal to zero:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta J}{\\delta p}\\left(p\\right)=\\ln{p(x)}+1-\\eta_0-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\lambda_j f_j(x)=0</math>\n\nIt is an exercise for the reader{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} that this extremum is indeed a maximum. Therefore, the maximum entropy probability distribution in this case must be of the form (<math>\\lambda_0:=\\eta_0-1</math>)\n\n:<math>p(x)=e^{-1+\\eta_0}\\cdot e^{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\lambda_j f_j(x)} =  \\exp\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n}\\lambda_j f_j(x)\\right) \\; .</math>\n\nThe proof of the discrete version is essentially the same.\n\n=== Uniqueness of the maximum === \nSuppose <math>p</math>, <math>p'</math> are distributions satisfying the expectation-constraints. Letting <math>\\alpha\\in(0,1)</math> and considering the distribution <math>q=\\alpha\\cdot p+(1-\\alpha)\\cdot p'</math> it is clear that this distribution satisfies the expectation-constraints and furthermore has as support <math>\\mathrm{supp}(q)=\\mathrm{supp}(p)\\cup \\mathrm{supp}(p')</math>. From basic facts about entropy, it holds that <math>\\mathcal{H}(q)\\geq \\alpha\\mathcal{H}(p)+(1-\\alpha)\\mathcal{H}(p')</math>. Taking limits <math>\\alpha\\longrightarrow 1</math> and <math>\\alpha\\longrightarrow 0</math> respectively yields <math>\\mathcal{H}(q)\\geq \\mathcal{H}(p),\\mathcal{H}(p')</math>.\n\nIt follows that a distribution satisfying the expectation-constraints and maximising entropy must necessarily have full support \u2014 ''i. e.'' the distribution is almost everywhere positive. It follows that the maximising distribution must be an internal point in the space of distributions satisfying the expectation-constraints, that is, it must be a local extreme. Thus it suffices to show that the local extreme is unique, in order to show both that the entropy-maximising distribution is unique (and this also shows that the local extreme is the global maximum).\n\nSuppose <math>p,p'</math> are local extremes. Reformulating the above computations these are characterised by parameters <math>\\vec{\\lambda},\\vec{\\lambda}'\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}</math> via <math>p(x)=\\frac{e^{\\langle\\vec{\\lambda},\\vec{f}(x)\\rangle}}{C(\\vec{\\lambda})}</math> and similarly for <math>p'</math>, where <math>C(\\vec{\\lambda})=\\int_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}} e^{\\langle\\vec{\\lambda},\\vec{f}(x)\\rangle}~dx</math>. We now note a series of identities: Via the satisfaction of the expectation-constraints and utilising gradients/directional derivatives, one has <math>D\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\lambda}}=\\left.\\frac{DC(\\cdot)}{C(\\cdot)}\\right|_{\\vec{\\lambda}}=\\mathbb{E}_{p}[\\vec{f}(X)]=\\vec{a}</math> and similarly for <math>\\vec{\\lambda}'</math>. Letting <math>u=\\vec{\\lambda}'-\\vec{\\lambda}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}</math> one obtains:\n\n:<math>\n0=\\langle u,\\vec{a}-\\vec{a}\\rangle\n=D_{u}\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\lambda}'}-D_{u}\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\lambda}}\n=D_{u}^{2}\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec{\\gamma}=\\theta\\vec{\\lambda}+(1-\\theta)\\vec{\\lambda}'</math> for some <math>\\theta\\in(0,1)</math>. Computing further one has\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n0 &= &D_{u}^{2}\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\\\\\n&= &\\left.D_{u}\\left(\\frac{D_{u}C(\\cdot)}{C(\\cdot)}\\right)\\right|_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\\\\\n&= &\\left.\\frac{D_{u}^{2}C(\\cdot)}{C(\\cdot)}\\right|_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\n-\\left.\\frac{(D_{u}C(\\cdot))^{2}}{C(\\cdot)^{2}}\\right|_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\\\\\n&= &\\mathbb{E}_{q}[(\\langle u,\\vec{f}(X)\\rangle)^{2}]-\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{q}[\\langle u,\\vec{f}(X)\\rangle]\\right)^{2}=\\mathrm{Var}_{q}(\\langle u,\\vec{f}(X)\\rangle)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>q</math> is similar to the distribution above, only parameterised by <math>\\vec{\\gamma}</math>. ''Assuming'' that no non-trivial linear combination of the observables is almost everywhere (a.e.) constant, (which ''e.g.'' holds if the observables are independent and not a.e. constant), it holds that <math>\\langle u,\\vec{f}(X)\\rangle</math> has non-zero variance, unless <math>u=0</math>. By the above equation it is thus clear, that the latter must be the case. Hence <math>\\vec{\\lambda}'-\\vec{\\lambda}=u=0</math>, so the parameters characterising the local extrema <math>p,p'</math> are identical, which means that the distributions themselves are identical. Thus, the local extreme is unique and by the above discussion, the maximum is unique\u2014provided a local extreme actually exists.\n\n=== Caveats ===\nNote that not all classes of distributions contain a maximum entropy distribution. It is possible that a class contain distributions of arbitrarily large entropy (e.g. the class of all continuous distributions on '''R''' with mean 0 but arbitrary standard deviation), or that the entropies are bounded above but there is no distribution which attains the maximal entropy.<ref group=lower-alpha>For example, the class of all continuous distributions ''X'' on '''R''' with {{nowrap|E(''X'') {{=}} 0}} and {{nowrap|E(''X''<sup>2</sup>) {{=}} E(''X''<sup>3</sup>) {{=}} 1}} (see Cover, Ch 12).</ref> It is also possible that the expected value restrictions for the class ''C'' force the probability distribution to be zero in certain subsets of ''S''. In that case our theorem doesn't apply, but one can work around this by shrinking the set ''S''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nEvery probability distribution is trivially a maximum entropy probability distribution under the constraint that the distribution have its own entropy.  To see this, rewrite the density as <math>p(x)=\\exp{(\\ln{p(x)})}</math> and compare to the expression of the theorem above.  By choosing <math>\\ln{p(x)} \\rightarrow f(x)</math> to be the measurable function and\n\n:<math>\\int \\exp{(f(x))} f(x) dx=-H</math>\n\nto be the constant, <math>p(x)</math> is the maximum entropy probability distribution under the constraint\n\n:<math>\\int p(x)f(x)dx=-H</math>.\n\nNontrivial examples are distributions that are subject to multiple constraints that are different from the assignment of the entropy.  These are often found by starting with the same procedure <math>\\ln{p(x)} \\rightarrow f(x)</math> and finding that <math>f(x)</math> can be separated into parts.\n\nA table of examples of maximum entropy distributions is given in Lisman (1972) <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Lisman |first1=J.

This uniform density can be related to Laplace's [[principle of indifference]], sometimes called the principle of insufficient reason. More generally, if we're given a subdivision ''a''=''a''<sub>0</sub> < ''a''<sub>1</sub> < ... < ''a''<sub>''k''</sub> = ''b'' of the interval [''a'',''b''] and probabilities ''p''<sub>1</sub>,...,''p''<sub>''k''</sub> which add up to one, then we can consider the class of all continuous distributions such that\n:<math>\\operatorname{Pr}(a_{j-1}\\le X < a_j) = p_j \\quad \\mbox{ for } j=1,\\ldots,k</math>\nThe density of the maximum entropy distribution for this class is constant on each of the intervals [''a''<sub>''j''-1</sub>,''a''<sub>''j''</sub>). The uniform distribution on the finite set {''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} (which assigns a probability of 1/''n'' to each of these values) is the maximum entropy distribution among all discrete distributions supported on this set.\n\n=== Positive and specified mean: the exponential distribution ===\n\nThe [[exponential distribution]], for which the density function is\n\n:<math> p(x|\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} & x \\ge 0, \\\\\n0 & x < 0,\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nis the maximum entropy distribution among all continuous distributions supported in [0,\u221e) that have a specified mean of 1/\u03bb.\n\n=== Specified variance: the normal distribution ===\n\nThe [[normal distribution]] N(\u03bc,\u03c3<sup>2</sup>), for which the density function is\n\n:<math>\np(x| \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi} } e^{ -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} },\n</math>\n\nhas maximum entropy among all [[real number|real]]-valued distributions supported on (-\u221e,\u221e) with a specified [[variance]] ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup> (a particular [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]).

(See the [[Differential entropy#Maximization in the normal distribution|differential entropy]] article for a derivation.)\n\nIn the case of distributions supported on [0,\u221e], the maximum entropy distribution depends on relationships between the first and second moments.

Based on this information alone, what would be a reasonable assumption for the number of dice showing 1, 2, ..., 6? This is an instance of the situation considered above, with {''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>6</sub>} = {1,...,6} and \u03bc = ''S''/''N''.\n\nFinally, among all the discrete distributions supported on the infinite set {''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,...} with mean \u03bc, the maximum entropy distribution has the shape:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Pr}(X=x_k) = Cr^{x_k} \\quad\\mbox{ for } k=1,2,\\ldots ,</math>\nwhere again the constants ''C'' and ''r'' were determined by the requirements that the sum of all the probabilities must be 1 and the expected value must be \u03bc.

According to the [[principle of maximum entropy]], if nothing is known about a distribution except that it belongs to a certain class (usually defined in terms of specified properties or measures), then the distribution with the largest entropy should be chosen as the least-informative default. The motivation is twofold: first, maximizing entropy minimizes the amount of [[prior information]] built into the distribution; second, many physical systems tend to move towards maximal entropy configurations over time.\n\n== Definition of entropy and differential entropy ==\n{{further|Entropy (information theory)}}\n\nIf ''X'' is a [[discrete random variable]] with distribution given by\n:<math>\\operatorname{Pr}(X=x_k) = p_k \\quad\\mbox{ for } k=1,2,\\ldots</math>\nthen the entropy of ''X'' is defined as\n:<math>H(X) = - \\sum_{k\\ge 1}p_k\\log p_k .</math>\n\nIf ''X'' is a [[continuous random variable]] with [[probability density function|probability density]] ''p''(''x''), then the [[differential entropy]] of ''X'' is defined as<ref>Williams, D.

The constraints can be written as\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f_j(x)p(x)dx=a_j</math>\n\nWe consider the [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]\n\n:<math>J(p)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x)\\ln{p(x)}dx-\\eta_0\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p(x)dx-1\\right)-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\lambda_j\\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_j(x)p(x)dx-a_j\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\eta_0</math> and <math>\\lambda_j, j\\geq 1</math> are the Lagrange multipliers. The zeroth constraint ensures the [[Probability axioms#Second axiom|second axiom of probability]]. The other constraints are that the measurements of the function are given constants up to order <math>n</math>. The entropy attains an extremum when the [[functional derivative]] is equal to zero:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\delta J}{\\delta p}\\left(p\\right)=\\ln{p(x)}+1-\\eta_0-\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\lambda_j f_j(x)=0</math>\n\nIt is an exercise for the reader{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} that this extremum is indeed a maximum. Therefore, the maximum entropy probability distribution in this case must be of the form (<math>\\lambda_0:=\\eta_0-1</math>)\n\n:<math>p(x)=e^{-1+\\eta_0}\\cdot e^{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\lambda_j f_j(x)} =  \\exp\\left(\\sum_{j=0}^{n}\\lambda_j f_j(x)\\right) \\; .</math>\n\nThe proof of the discrete version is essentially the same.\n\n=== Uniqueness of the maximum === \nSuppose <math>p</math>, <math>p'</math> are distributions satisfying the expectation-constraints. Letting <math>\\alpha\\in(0,1)</math> and considering the distribution <math>q=\\alpha\\cdot p+(1-\\alpha)\\cdot p'</math> it is clear that this distribution satisfies the expectation-constraints and furthermore has as support <math>\\mathrm{supp}(q)=\\mathrm{supp}(p)\\cup \\mathrm{supp}(p')</math>. From basic facts about entropy, it holds that <math>\\mathcal{H}(q)\\geq \\alpha\\mathcal{H}(p)+(1-\\alpha)\\mathcal{H}(p')</math>. Taking limits <math>\\alpha\\longrightarrow 1</math> and <math>\\alpha\\longrightarrow 0</math> respectively yields <math>\\mathcal{H}(q)\\geq \\mathcal{H}(p),\\mathcal{H}(p')</math>.\n\nIt follows that a distribution satisfying the expectation-constraints and maximising entropy must necessarily have full support \u2014 ''i. e.'' the distribution is almost everywhere positive. It follows that the maximising distribution must be an internal point in the space of distributions satisfying the expectation-constraints, that is, it must be a local extreme. Thus it suffices to show that the local extreme is unique, in order to show both that the entropy-maximising distribution is unique (and this also shows that the local extreme is the global maximum).\n\nSuppose <math>p,p'</math> are local extremes. Reformulating the above computations these are characterised by parameters <math>\\vec{\\lambda},\\vec{\\lambda}'\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}</math> via <math>p(x)=\\frac{e^{\\langle\\vec{\\lambda},\\vec{f}(x)\\rangle}}{C(\\vec{\\lambda})}</math> and similarly for <math>p'</math>, where <math>C(\\vec{\\lambda})=\\int_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}} e^{\\langle\\vec{\\lambda},\\vec{f}(x)\\rangle}~dx</math>. We now note a series of identities: Via the satisfaction of the expectation-constraints and utilising gradients/directional derivatives, one has <math>D\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\lambda}}=\\left.\\frac{DC(\\cdot)}{C(\\cdot)}\\right|_{\\vec{\\lambda}}=\\mathbb{E}_{p}[\\vec{f}(X)]=\\vec{a}</math> and similarly for <math>\\vec{\\lambda}'</math>. Letting <math>u=\\vec{\\lambda}'-\\vec{\\lambda}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}</math> one obtains:\n\n:<math>\n0=\\langle u,\\vec{a}-\\vec{a}\\rangle\n=D_{u}\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\lambda}'}-D_{u}\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\lambda}}\n=D_{u}^{2}\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\vec{\\gamma}=\\theta\\vec{\\lambda}+(1-\\theta)\\vec{\\lambda}'</math> for some <math>\\theta\\in(0,1)</math>. Computing further one has\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n0 &= &D_{u}^{2}\\log(C(\\cdot))\\vert_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\\\\\n&= &\\left.D_{u}\\left(\\frac{D_{u}C(\\cdot)}{C(\\cdot)}\\right)\\right|_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\\\\\n&= &\\left.\\frac{D_{u}^{2}C(\\cdot)}{C(\\cdot)}\\right|_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\n-\\left.\\frac{(D_{u}C(\\cdot))^{2}}{C(\\cdot)^{2}}\\right|_{\\vec{\\gamma}}\\\\\n&= &\\mathbb{E}_{q}[(\\langle u,\\vec{f}(X)\\rangle)^{2}]-\\left(\\mathbb{E}_{q}[\\langle u,\\vec{f}(X)\\rangle]\\right)^{2}=\\mathrm{Var}_{q}(\\langle u,\\vec{f}(X)\\rangle)\\\\\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>q</math> is similar to the distribution above, only parameterised by <math>\\vec{\\gamma}</math>. ''Assuming'' that no non-trivial linear combination of the observables is almost everywhere (a.e.) constant, (which ''e.g.'' holds if the observables are independent and not a.e. constant), it holds that <math>\\langle u,\\vec{f}(X)\\rangle</math> has non-zero variance, unless <math>u=0</math>. By the above equation it is thus clear, that the latter must be the case. Hence <math>\\vec{\\lambda}'-\\vec{\\lambda}=u=0</math>, so the parameters characterising the local extrema <math>p,p'</math> are identical, which means that the distributions themselves are identical. Thus, the local extreme is unique and by the above discussion, the maximum is unique\u2014provided a local extreme actually exists.\n\n=== Caveats ===\nNote that not all classes of distributions contain a maximum entropy distribution. It is possible that a class contain distributions of arbitrarily large entropy (e.g. the class of all continuous distributions on '''R''' with mean 0 but arbitrary standard deviation), or that the entropies are bounded above but there is no distribution which attains the maximal entropy.<ref group=lower-alpha>For example, the class of all continuous distributions ''X'' on '''R''' with {{nowrap|E(''X'') {{=}} 0}} and {{nowrap|E(''X''<sup>2</sup>) {{=}} E(''X''<sup>3</sup>) {{=}} 1}} (see Cover, Ch 12).</ref> It is also possible that the expected value restrictions for the class ''C'' force the probability distribution to be zero in certain subsets of ''S''. In that case our theorem doesn't apply, but one can work around this by shrinking the set ''S''.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nEvery probability distribution is trivially a maximum entropy probability distribution under the constraint that the distribution have its own entropy.  To see this, rewrite the density as <math>p(x)=\\exp{(\\ln{p(x)})}</math> and compare to the expression of the theorem above.  By choosing <math>\\ln{p(x)} \\rightarrow f(x)</math> to be the measurable function and\n\n:<math>\\int \\exp{(f(x))} f(x) dx=-H</math>\n\nto be the constant, <math>p(x)</math> is the maximum entropy probability distribution under the constraint\n\n:<math>\\int p(x)f(x)dx=-H</math>.\n\nNontrivial examples are distributions that are subject to multiple constraints that are different from the assignment of the entropy.  These are often found by starting with the same procedure <math>\\ln{p(x)} \\rightarrow f(x)</math> and finding that <math>f(x)</math> can be separated into parts.\n\nA table of examples of maximum entropy distributions is given in Lisman (1972) <ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Lisman |first1=J.

This uniform density can be related to Laplace's [[principle of indifference]], sometimes called the principle of insufficient reason. More generally, if we're given a subdivision ''a''=''a''<sub>0</sub> < ''a''<sub>1</sub> < ... < ''a''<sub>''k''</sub> = ''b'' of the interval [''a'',''b''] and probabilities ''p''<sub>1</sub>,...,''p''<sub>''k''</sub> which add up to one, then we can consider the class of all continuous distributions such that\n:<math>\\operatorname{Pr}(a_{j-1}\\le X < a_j) = p_j \\quad \\mbox{ for } j=1,\\ldots,k</math>\nThe density of the maximum entropy distribution for this class is constant on each of the intervals [''a''<sub>''j''-1</sub>,''a''<sub>''j''</sub>). The uniform distribution on the finite set {''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>} (which assigns a probability of 1/''n'' to each of these values) is the maximum entropy distribution among all discrete distributions supported on this set.\n\n=== Positive and specified mean: the exponential distribution ===\n\nThe [[exponential distribution]], for which the density function is\n\n:<math> p(x|\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x} & x \\ge 0, \\\\\n0 & x < 0,\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nis the maximum entropy distribution among all continuous distributions supported in [0,\u221e] that have a specified mean of 1/\u03bb.\n\n=== Specified variance: the normal distribution ===\n\nThe [[normal distribution]] N(\u03bc,\u03c3<sup>2</sup>), for which the density function is\n\n:<math>\np(x| \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi} } e^{ -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} },\n</math>\n\nhas maximum entropy among all [[real number|real]]-valued distributions supported on (-\u221e,\u221e) with a specified [[variance]] ''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup> (a particular [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]).

He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as '''William Rufus''' ({{lang|la|Rufus}} being Latin for \"the Red\"), perhaps because of his ruddy appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life.<ref>Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 11\u201312</ref>{{efn|{{lang|la|De Miraculis Sancti Eadmundi|italic=no}} is alone in calling him William Longsword.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', p. 10</ref>}}\n\nWilliam was a figure of complex temperament, capable of both bellicosity and flamboyance. He did not marry, nor did he father any offspring, which has led to speculations of possible [[homosexuality]] by historians.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', p. 16</ref> He died after being hit by an arrow while hunting, under circumstances that remain unclear. Circumstantial evidence in the behaviour of those around him raises strong, but unproven, suspicions of murder.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', pp. 9-11</ref> His younger brother [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] hurriedly succeeded him as king.\n\n[[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] observed William was \"A rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little show of conventional religious piety or morality\u2014indeed, according to his critics, addicted to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy.\" On the other hand, he was a wise ruler and victorious general. Barlow noted, \"His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and kept up the pressure on the [[Vexin]].\"<ref>Frank Barlow, \"William II (c.1060\u20131100)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29449, online accessed 28 Nov 2013]</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nWilliam's exact date of birth is not known, but it was some time between the years 1056 and 1060. He was the third of four sons born to [[William the Conqueror]] and [[Matilda of Flanders]], the eldest being [[Robert Curthose]], the second [[Richard, son of William the Conqueror|Richard]], and the youngest [[Henry I of England|Henry]]. Richard died around 1075 while hunting in the [[New Forest]]. William succeeded to the throne of England on his father's death in 1087, but Robert inherited Normandy.<ref name=Douglas393>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 393</ref>\n\nWilliam had five or six sisters. The existence of sisters [[Adeliza]] and Matilda is not absolutely certain, but four sisters are more securely attested:\n* [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]], who married [[Stephen, Count of Blois|the Count of Blois]]\n* [[Cecilia of Normandy|Cecily]], who became a nun\n* [[Agatha of Normandy|Agatha]], who died unmarried\n* [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]], who married the Duke of Brittany.<ref name=Douglas395>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 395</ref>\n\nRecords indicate strained relations between the three surviving sons of William I. William's contemporary, chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], wrote about an incident that took place at [[L'Aigle]] in Normandy in 1077 or 1078: William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by emptying a [[chamber pot]] onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father had to intercede to restore order.<ref name=Barlow33>Barlow ''William Rufus pp. 33\u201334</ref>{{efn|Barlow suggests that William and Henry probably urinated over Robert.<ref name=Barlow33/>}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in the 12th century, William Rufus was \"well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting.\"<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 70</ref>\n\n==England and France==\n[[File:Great Seal of William Rufus.jpg|thumb|left|Great Seal of William II]]\n\nThe division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both.<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 125 f.</ref> The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the [[Rebellion of 1088]], under the leadership of the powerful Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror.<ref name=Carpenter129>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 129.</ref> As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably [[Maine (province)|Maine]]. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests to the end of his life, exemplified by his response to the attempt by [[Elias I, Count of Maine|Elias de la Fl\u00e8che]], [[Counts and dukes of Maine|Count of Maine]], to take [[Le Mans]] in 1099.<ref>Barlow, ''William Rufus'', pp. 402\u2013406.</ref>\n\nWilliam Rufus was thus secure in what was then the most powerful kingdom in Europe, given the contemporary eclipse of the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations; and his right of investiture in the Norman tradition prevailed within his kingdom, during the age of the [[Investiture Controversy]] that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. The king's personal power, through an effective and loyal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. The king's administration and law unified the realm, rendering him relatively impervious to papal condemnation.  In 1097 he commenced the original [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]], which when completed in 1099 was the largest hall in Europe, built \"to impress his subjects with the power and majesty of his authority\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cescinsky |first1=Herbert |last2=Gribble |first2=Ernest R. |date=February 1922 |title=Westminster Hall and Its Roof |journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs |volume=40 |issue=227 |pages=76\u201384 |jstor=861585}} {{Subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n[[File:Silver penny of William II (YORYM 2000 2062) obverse.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver penny of William II showing a crowned head facing forward (1089), [[Yorkshire Museum]], York]]\nLess than two years after becoming king, William II lost his father's adviser and confidant, the Italian-Norman [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. After Lanfranc's death in 1089, the king delayed appointing a new archbishop for many years, appropriating ecclesiastical revenues in the interim. In panic, owing to serious illness in 1093, William nominated as archbishop another Norman-Italian, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]&nbsp;\u2013 considered the greatest theologian of his generation&nbsp;\u2013 but this led to a long period of animosity between Church and State, Anselm being a stronger supporter of the [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian reforms]] in the Church than Lanfranc. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, in the course of which the king declared of Anselm that, \"Yesterday I hated him with great hatred, today I hate him with yet greater hatred and he can be certain that tomorrow and thereafter I shall hate him continually with ever fiercer and more bitter hatred.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 53</ref> The English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings, were unable to support Anselm publicly. In 1095 William called a council at [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] to bring Anselm to heel, but the archbishop remained firm. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The diplomatic and flexible [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], a new pope, was involved in a major conflict with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV]], who supported an [[antipope]]. Reluctant to make another enemy, Urban came to a [[concordat]] with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical ''status quo''. Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign.<ref>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 132</ref>\n\nHowever, this conflict was symptomatic of medieval English politics, as exemplified by the murder of [[Thomas Becket]] during the reign of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] king [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (his great-nephew through his brother Henry) and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s actions centuries later, and as such should not be seen as a defect of William's reign in particular.{{efn|According to [[Eadmer]], an unusually well placed witness, William II \"protested that Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]] could not possibly keep at the same time both the allegiance which he owed to the King and obedience to the Apostolic See against the King's will.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 54</ref> Anselm found himself in similar conflict with William II's successor, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as also reported by Eadmer.}} Of course, contemporary churchmen were themselves not above engaging in such politics: it is reported that, when Archbishop Lanfranc suggested to William I that he imprison the rebellious bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], he exclaimed \"What! he is a clergyman.\" Lanfranc retorted that \"You will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent.\" (Odo held both titles.)<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 60</ref>\n\nWhile there are complaints of contemporaries regarding William's personal behaviour, he was instrumental in assisting the foundation of [[Bermondsey Abbey]], endowing it with the manor of Bermondsey; and it is reported that his \"customary oath\" was \"By the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Face at Lucca]]!\"{{efn|For an interesting discussion of such blasphemous oaths, see Barlow, F., ''William Rufus'', Univ. of California Press, 1983, pp. 116\u20138. An alternative, pagan interpretation of this oath proposed by [[Margaret Murray]] is that William swore by the \"face of [[Loki]]\": Murray, Margaret A., ''The God of the Witches'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 1970, p.&nbsp;164.}} It seems reasonable to suppose that such details are indicative of William's personal beliefs.\n\n==War and rebellion==\n\nWilliam Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the [[Domesday Book]], a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, [[Robert de Mowbray]], the earl of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], refused to attend the ''[[Curia regis|Curia Regis]]'', the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, [[William II, Count of Eu|William of Eu]], accused of treachery, was blinded and [[Castration|castrated]].<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built [[Carlisle Castle]], taking control of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], which had previously been claimed by the Scots.<ref name=Carpenter129/> Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the [[Battle of Alnwick (1093)|Battle of Alnwick]], on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm's brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald]] seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]], who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, [[Edgar, King of Scotland|Edgar]]. Edgar conquered [[Lothian]] in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by [[Edgar \u00c6theling]]. The new king recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.\n\nWilliam made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.<ref>Philip J. Potter, ''Gothic Kings of Britain: The Lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016-1399'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_zW8TBBVQkC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 47].</ref>\n\nIn 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the [[First Crusade]]. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his [[Duchy of Normandy]] to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equates to about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. He then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-II-duke-of-Normandy|title=Robert II {{!}} duke of Normandy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=12 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs regent in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099. He secured northern Maine but failed to seize the French-controlled part of the [[Vexin]] region. According to William of Malmesbury he was planning to invade the [[Duchy of Aquitaine]] at the time of his death.<ref>Gillingham, William II, p.97</ref>\n\n==Death==\nWilliam went hunting on 2 August 1100 in the New Forest, probably near [[Brockenhurst]], and was killed by an arrow through the lung, though the circumstances remain unclear. The earliest statement of the event was in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', which noted that the king was \"shot by an arrow by one of his own men.\"<ref name=QRufus420>Quoted in Barlow ''William Rufus'' p. 421</ref> Later chroniclers added the name of the killer, a nobleman named [[Walter Tirel]], although the description of events was later embroidered with other details that may or may not be true.<ref name=Rufus420>Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 420\u2013423</ref> The first mention of any location more exact than the New Forest comes from [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], who wrote in 1530 that William died at Thorougham, a placename that is no longer used, but that probably referred to a location on what is now Park Farm on the [[Beaulieu, Hampshire|Beaulieu]] estates.<ref name =Lloyd19>{{cite book |title=The Death of Rufus |last=Lloyd |first=Arthur|year=2000 |publisher=The New Forest Ninth Centenary trust  |isbn=0-9526120-5-4 |pages=19\u201320 }}</ref><ref name =Lloyd1>{{cite book |title=The Death of Rufus |last=Lloyd |first=Arthur |year=2000 |publisher=The New Forest Ninth Centenary trust|isbn=0-9526120-5-4 |page=1 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tomb of William Rufus, Winchester Cathedral (Robert Chambers, p.161, 1832) - Copy.jpg|thumb|Tomb of William Rufus, [[Winchester Cathedral]] (Robert Chambers, p.161, 1832)<ref name=Chambers>{{cite book|last1=Chambers|first1=Robert|title=The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Including Anecdote, Biography, & History, Curiosities of Literature and Oddities of Human Life and Character, Volume 2|date=1832|publisher=W. & R.

A peasant later found it. William's younger brother, [[Henry I of England|Henry]], hastened to Winchester to secure the royal treasury, then to London, where he was crowned within days, before either archbishop could arrive. [[William of Malmesbury]], in his account of William's death, stated that the body was taken to [[Winchester Cathedral]] by a few countrymen.<ref name =Lloyd11>{{cite book |title=The Death of Rufus |last=Lloyd |first=Arthur|year=2000 |publisher=The New Forest Ninth Centenary trust|isbn=0-9526120-5-4 |pages=11\u201312 }}</ref>\n\nTo the chroniclers, men of the Church, such an \"[[act of God]]\" was a just end for a wicked king, and was regarded as a fitting demise for a ruler who came into conflict with the religious orders to which they belonged.<ref>Plumtree, James. \"Stories of the Death of Kings: Retelling the Demise and Burial of William I, William II and Henry I\", ''Southern African Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies'' 21 (2012 for 2011), pp. 10-17 [https://www.academia.edu/3123675/Stories_of_the_Death_of_Kings_Retelling_the_Demise_and_Burial_of_William_I_William_II_and_Henry_I]</ref> Over the following centuries, the obvious suggestion that one of William's enemies had a hand in this event has repeatedly been made: chroniclers of the time point out themselves that Tirel was renowned as a keen bowman, and thus was unlikely to have loosed such an impetuous shot. Moreover, Bartlett says that rivalry between brothers was the pattern of political conflict in this period.<ref>Robert Bartlett, ''England under the Norman and Angevin Kings 1075-1225'' (2000) p 6</ref> William's brother Henry was among the hunting party that day and succeeded him as king.\n\nModern scholars have reopened the question, and some have found the assassination theory credible or compelling,<ref>Grinnell-Milne ''Killing of William Rufus''</ref> but the theory is not universally accepted.

This Stone having been much mutilated, and the inscriptions on each of its three sides defaced, this more Durable Memorial, with the original inscriptions, was erected in the year 1841, by Wm [William] Sturges Bourne Warden.\n\nKing William the second, surnamed Rufus being slain, as before related, was laid in a cart, belonging to one Purkis,{{efn|The claim was first made by a certain Mr Purkis of the family of charcoal-burners and cottagers remaining at the same spot, who claimed descent when, in 1806, he sold a bridle he claimed was the king's to [[Sir Richard Phillips]], claiming also to have possessed a wheel from the cart that carried his body.<ref>Timbs ''Historic Ninepins'' p. 92</ref> Sir Francis Palgrave in his ''The History of Normandy and of England'', reported the story uncritically.

According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', he was \"hated by almost all his people and abhorrent to God.\"<ref>Garmonsway (ed.) ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' p. 235</ref> [[Chronicle]]rs tended to take a dim view of William's reign, arguably on account of his long and difficult struggles with the Church: these chroniclers were themselves generally clerics, and so might be expected to report him somewhat negatively. His chief minister was [[Ranulf Flambard]], whom he appointed [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1099: this was a political appointment, to a [[Episcopal see|see]] that was also a great [[fief]]dom. The particulars of the king's relationship with the people of England are not credibly documented. Contemporaries of William, as well as those writing after his death, roundly denounced him for presiding over what these dissenters considered a dissolute court. In keeping with tradition of Norman leaders, William scorned the English and the English culture.<ref>Cantor ''Civilization of the Middle Ages'' pp. 280\u2013284</ref>\n\n==Sexuality==\n\nContemporaries of William raised concerns about a court dominated by homosexuality and effeminacy, although this appears to have had more to do with their luxurious attire than with actual sexual practices.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mills |first1=Robert |title=Seeing Sodomy in the Middle Ages |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226169262 |pages=82-83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6J0BgAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Emma Mason has noted that while during his reign William himself was never openly accused of homosexuality, in the decades after his death numerous medieval writers spoke of this and a few began to describe him as a \"sodomite\".<ref name=\":0\">Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', pp. 9\u201325</ref> Modern historians cannot state with certainty whether William was homosexual or not; however, he never took a wife or a mistress, or fathered any children. As a bachelor king without an heir, William would have been pressed to take a wife and would have had numerous proposals for marriage.<ref name=\":0\" /> That he never accepted any of these proposals nor had any relations with women may show that he either had no desire for women, or he may have taken a vow of chastity or celibacy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBarlow said that the Welsh chronicles claim that Henry was able to succeed to the throne because his brother had made use of [[Concubinage|concubines]] and thus died childless, although no illegitimate offspring are named. Barlow also allows that William may have been sterile. Noting that no \"favourites\" were identified, and that William's \"baronial friends and companions were mostly married men\", despite having concluded that the chroniclers were \"hostile and biased witnesses\", Barlow considers that \"there seems no reason why they should have invented this particular charge\" (of homosexuality) and states that, in his opinion, \"On the whole the evidence points to the king's bisexuality\".{{sfn|Barlow|2000|p=109}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barlow |first= Frank |authorlink=Frank Barlow (historian)|title=William Rufus |publisher=Yale University Press  |edition= Second|location=New Haven, CT |year=2000 |isbn=0-300-08291-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bosanquet, G.

He was less successful in extending control into Wales. William is commonly known as '''William Rufus''' ({{lang|la|Rufus}} being Latin for \"the Red\"), perhaps because of his ruddy appearance or, more likely, due to having red hair as a child that grew out in later life.<ref>Barlow ''William Rufus'' pp. 11\u201312</ref>{{efn|{{lang|la|De Miraculis Sancti Eadmundi|italic=no}} is alone in calling him William Longsword.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', p. 10</ref>}}\n\nWilliam was a figure of complex temperament, capable of both bellicosity and flamboyance. He did not marry, nor did he father any offspring, which has led to speculations of possible [[homosexuality]] by historians.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', p. 16</ref> He died after being hit by an arrow while hunting, under circumstances that remain unclear. Circumstantial evidence in the behaviour of those around him raises strong, but unproven, suspicions of murder.<ref>Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', pp. 9-11</ref> His younger brother [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] hurriedly succeeded him as king.\n\n[[Frank Barlow (historian)|Frank Barlow]] observed William was \"A rumbustious, devil-may-care soldier, without natural dignity or social graces, with no cultivated tastes and little show of conventional religious piety or morality\u2014indeed, according to his critics, addicted to every kind of vice, particularly lust and especially sodomy.\" On the other hand, he was a wise ruler and victorious general. Barlow noted, \"His chivalrous virtues and achievements were all too obvious. He had maintained good order and satisfactory justice in England and restored good peace to Normandy. He had extended Anglo-Norman rule in Wales, brought Scotland firmly under his lordship, recovered [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and kept up the pressure on the [[Vexin]].\"<ref>Frank Barlow, \"William II (c.1060\u20131100)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford University Press, 2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29449, online accessed 28 Nov 2013]</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nWilliam's exact date of birth is not known, but it was some time between the years 1056 and 1060. He was the third of four sons born to [[William the Conqueror]] and [[Matilda of Flanders]], the eldest being [[Robert Curthose]], the second [[Richard, son of William the Conqueror|Richard]], and the youngest [[Henry I of England|Henry]]. Richard died around 1075 while hunting in the [[New Forest]]. William succeeded to the throne of England on his father's death in 1087, but Robert inherited Normandy.<ref name=Douglas393>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 393</ref>\n\nWilliam had five or six sisters. The existence of sisters [[Adeliza]] and Matilda is not absolutely certain, but four sisters are more securely attested:\n* [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]], who married [[Stephen, Count of Blois|the Count of Blois]]\n* [[Cecilia of Normandy|Cecily]], who became a nun\n* [[Agatha of Normandy|Agatha]], who died unmarried\n* [[Constance of Normandy|Constance]], who married the Duke of Brittany.<ref name=Douglas395>Douglas ''William the Conqueror'' p. 395</ref>\n\nRecords indicate strained relations between the three surviving sons of William I. William's contemporary, chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]], wrote about an incident that took place at [[L'Aigle]] in Normandy in 1077 or 1078: William and Henry, having grown bored with casting dice, decided to make mischief by emptying a [[chamber pot]] onto their brother Robert from an upper gallery, thus infuriating and shaming him. A brawl broke out, and their father had to intercede to restore order.<ref name=Barlow33>Barlow ''William Rufus pp. 33\u201334</ref>{{efn|Barlow suggests that William and Henry probably urinated over Robert.<ref name=Barlow33/>}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Malmesbury]], writing in the 12th century, William Rufus was \"well set; his complexion florid, his hair yellow; of open countenance; different coloured eyes, varying with certain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very tall, and his belly rather projecting.\"<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 70</ref>\n\n==England and France==\n[[File:Great Seal of William Rufus.jpg|thumb|left|Great Seal of William II]]\n\nThe division of William the Conqueror's lands into two parts presented a dilemma for those nobles who held land on both sides of the English Channel. Since the younger William and his brother Robert were natural rivals, these nobles worried that they could not hope to please both of their lords, and thus ran the risk of losing the favour of one ruler or the other, or both.<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 125 f.</ref> The only solution, as they saw it, was to unite England and Normandy once more under one ruler. The pursuit of this aim led them to revolt against William in favour of Robert in the [[Rebellion of 1088]], under the leadership of the powerful Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], who was a half-brother of William the Conqueror.<ref name=Carpenter129>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 129.</ref> As Robert failed to appear in England to rally his supporters, William won the support of the English with silver and promises of better government, and defeated the rebellion, thus securing his authority. In 1091 he invaded Normandy, crushing Robert's forces and forcing him to cede a portion of his lands. The two made up their differences and William agreed to help Robert recover lands lost to France, notably [[Maine (province)|Maine]]. This plan was later abandoned, but William continued to pursue a ferociously warlike defence of his French possessions and interests to the end of his life, exemplified by his response to the attempt by [[Elias I, Count of Maine|Elias de la Fl\u00e8che]], [[Counts and dukes of Maine|Count of Maine]], to take [[Le Mans]] in 1099.<ref>Barlow, ''William Rufus'', pp. 402\u2013406.</ref>\n\nWilliam Rufus was thus secure in what was then the most powerful kingdom in Europe, given the contemporary eclipse of the [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors. As in Normandy, his bishops and abbots were bound to him by feudal obligations; and his right of investiture in the Norman tradition prevailed within his kingdom, during the age of the [[Investiture Controversy]] that brought excommunication upon the Salian Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]]. The king's personal power, through an effective and loyal [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], penetrated to the local level to an extent unmatched in France. The king's administration and law unified the realm, rendering him relatively impervious to papal condemnation.  In 1097 he commenced the original [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]], which when completed in 1099 was the largest hall in Europe, built \"to impress his subjects with the power and majesty of his authority\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cescinsky |first1=Herbert |last2=Gribble |first2=Ernest R. |date=February 1922 |title=Westminster Hall and Its Roof |journal=The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs |volume=40 |issue=227 |pages=76\u201384 |jstor=861585}} {{Subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n\n[[File:Silver penny of William II (YORYM 2000 2062) obverse.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver penny of William II showing a crowned head facing forward (1089), [[Yorkshire Museum]], York]]\nLess than two years after becoming king, William II lost his father's adviser and confidant, the Italian-Norman [[Lanfranc]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. After Lanfranc's death in 1089, the king delayed appointing a new archbishop for many years, appropriating ecclesiastical revenues in the interim. In panic, owing to serious illness in 1093, William nominated as archbishop another Norman-Italian, [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]&nbsp;\u2013 considered the greatest theologian of his generation&nbsp;\u2013 but this led to a long period of animosity between Church and State, Anselm being a stronger supporter of the [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian reforms]] in the Church than Lanfranc. William and Anselm disagreed on a range of ecclesiastical issues, in the course of which the king declared of Anselm that, \"Yesterday I hated him with great hatred, today I hate him with yet greater hatred and he can be certain that tomorrow and thereafter I shall hate him continually with ever fiercer and more bitter hatred.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 53</ref> The English clergy, beholden to the king for their preferments and livings, were unable to support Anselm publicly. In 1095 William called a council at [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] to bring Anselm to heel, but the archbishop remained firm. In October 1097, Anselm went into exile, taking his case to the Pope. The diplomatic and flexible [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], a new pope, was involved in a major conflict with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV]], who supported an [[antipope]]. Reluctant to make another enemy, Urban came to a [[concordat]] with William, whereby William recognised Urban as pope, and Urban gave sanction to the Anglo-Norman ecclesiastical ''status quo''. Anselm remained in exile, and William was able to claim the revenues of the archbishop of Canterbury to the end of his reign.<ref>Carpenter ''Struggle for Mastery'' p. 132</ref>\n\nHowever, this conflict was symptomatic of medieval English politics, as exemplified by the murder of [[Thomas Becket]] during the reign of the later [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] king [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (his great-nephew through his brother Henry) and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s actions centuries later, and as such should not be seen as a defect of William's reign in particular.{{efn|According to [[Eadmer]], an unusually well placed witness, William II \"protested that Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]] could not possibly keep at the same time both the allegiance which he owed to the King and obedience to the Apostolic See against the King's will.\"<ref>Bosanquet (tr.) ''Eadmer's History'' p. 54</ref> Anselm found himself in similar conflict with William II's successor, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as also reported by Eadmer.}} Of course, contemporary churchmen were themselves not above engaging in such politics: it is reported that, when Archbishop Lanfranc suggested to William I that he imprison the rebellious bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]], he exclaimed \"What! he is a clergyman.\" Lanfranc retorted that \"You will not seize the bishop of Bayeux, but confine the earl of Kent.\" (Odo held both titles.)<ref>William of Malmesbury ''History of the Norman Kings'' p. 60</ref>\n\nWhile there are complaints of contemporaries regarding William's personal behaviour, he was instrumental in assisting the foundation of [[Bermondsey Abbey]], endowing it with the manor of Bermondsey; and it is reported that his \"customary oath\" was \"By the [[Holy Face of Lucca|Face at Lucca]]!\"{{efn|For an interesting discussion of such blasphemous oaths, see Barlow, F., ''William Rufus'', Univ. of California Press, 1983, pp. 116\u20138. An alternative, pagan interpretation of this oath proposed by [[Margaret Murray]] is that William swore by the \"face of [[Loki]]\": Murray, Margaret A., ''The God of the Witches'', [[Oxford University Press|OUP]], 1970, p.&nbsp;164.}} It seems reasonable to suppose that such details are indicative of William's personal beliefs.\n\n==War and rebellion==\n\nWilliam Rufus inherited the Anglo-Norman settlement detailed in the [[Domesday Book]], a survey undertaken at his father's command, essentially for the purposes of taxation, which was an example of the control of the English monarchy. If he was less effective than his father in containing the Norman lords' propensity for rebellion and violence, through charisma or political skills, he was forceful in overcoming the consequences. In 1095, [[Robert de Mowbray]], the earl of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]], refused to attend the ''[[Curia regis|Curia Regis]]'', the thrice-annual court where the King announced his governmental decisions to the great lords. William led an army against Robert and defeated him. Robert was dispossessed and imprisoned, and another noble, [[William II, Count of Eu|William of Eu]], accused of treachery, was blinded and [[Castration|castrated]].<ref>Carpenter, ''Struggle for Mastery'', p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn external affairs, William had some successes. In 1091 he repulsed an invasion by King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]], forcing Malcolm to pay homage. In 1092 he built [[Carlisle Castle]], taking control of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]], which had previously been claimed by the Scots.<ref name=Carpenter129/> Subsequently, the two kings quarrelled over Malcolm's possessions in England, and Malcolm again invaded, ravaging Northumbria. At the [[Battle of Alnwick (1093)|Battle of Alnwick]], on 13 November 1093, Malcolm was ambushed by Norman forces led by Robert de Mowbray. Malcolm and his son Edward were killed and Malcolm's brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Donald]] seized the throne. William supported Malcolm's son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan II]], who held power for a short time, and then another of Malcolm's sons, [[Edgar, King of Scotland|Edgar]]. Edgar conquered [[Lothian]] in 1094 and eventually removed Donald in 1097 with William's aid in a campaign led by [[Edgar \u00c6theling]]. The new king recognised William's authority over Lothian and attended William's court.\n\nWilliam made two forays into Wales in 1097. Nothing decisive was achieved, but a series of castles was constructed as a marchland defensive barrier.<ref>Philip J. Potter, ''Gothic Kings of Britain: The Lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016-1399'' (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h_zW8TBBVQkC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 47].</ref>\n\nIn 1096, William's brother Robert Curthose joined the [[First Crusade]]. He needed money to fund this venture and pledged his [[Duchy of Normandy]] to William in return for a payment of 10,000 marks, which equates to about a quarter of William's annual revenue. In a display of the effectiveness of English taxation, William raised the money by levying a special, heavy, and much-resented tax upon the whole of England. He then ruled Normandy as regent in Robert's absence. Robert did not return until September 1100, one month after William's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-II-duke-of-Normandy|title=Robert II {{!}} duke of Normandy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=12 September 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs regent in Normandy, William campaigned in France from 1097 to 1099.

This Stone having been much mutilated, and the inscriptions on each of its three sides defaced, this more Durable Memorial, with the original inscriptions, was erected in the year 1841, by Wm [William] Sturges Bourne Warden.\n\nKing William the second, surnamed Rufus being slain, as before related, was laid in a cart, belonging to one Purkis,{{efn|The claim was first made by a certain Mr Purkis of the family of charcoal-burners and cottagers remaining at the same spot, who claimed descent when, in 1806, he sold a bridle he claimed was the king's to [[Sir Richard Phillips]], claiming also to have possessed a wheel from the cart that carried his body.<ref>Timbs ''Historic Ninepins'' p. 92</ref> Sir Francis Palgrave in his ''The History of Normandy and of England'', reported the story uncritically.

According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', he was \"hated by almost all his people and abhorrent to God.\"<ref>Garmonsway (ed.) ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' p. 235</ref> [[Chronicle]]rs tended to take a dim view of William's reign, arguably on account of his long and difficult struggles with the Church: these chroniclers were themselves generally clerics, and so might be expected to report him somewhat negatively. His chief minister was [[Ranulf Flambard]], whom he appointed [[Bishop of Durham]] in 1099: this was a political appointment, to a [[Episcopal see|see]] that was also a great [[fief]]dom. The particulars of the king's relationship with the people of England are not credibly documented. Contemporaries of William, as well as those writing after his death, roundly denounced him for presiding over what these dissenters considered a dissolute court. In keeping with tradition of Norman leaders, William scorned the English and the English culture.<ref>Cantor ''Civilization of the Middle Ages'' pp. 280\u2013284</ref>\n\n==Sexuality==\n\nContemporaries of William raised concerns about a court dominated by homosexuality and effeminacy, although this appears to have had more to do with their luxurious attire than with actual sexual practices.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mills |first1=Robert |title=Seeing Sodomy in the Middle Ages |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226169262 |pages=82-83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6J0BgAAQBAJ |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe historian Emma Mason has noted that while during his reign William himself was never openly accused of homosexuality, in the decades after his death numerous medieval writers spoke of this and a few began to describe him as a \"sodomite\".<ref name=\":0\">Mason, ''King Rufus: The Life and Murder of William II of England'', pp. 9\u201325</ref> Modern historians cannot state with certainty whether William was homosexual or not; however, he never took a wife or a mistress, or fathered any children. As a bachelor king without an heir, William would have been pressed to take a wife and would have had numerous proposals for marriage.<ref name=\":0\" /> That he never accepted any of these proposals nor had any relations with women may show that he either had no desire for women, or he may have taken a vow of chastity or celibacy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBarlow said that the Welsh chronicles claim that Henry was able to succeed to the throne because his brother had made use of [[Concubinage|concubines]] and thus died childless, although no illegitimate offspring are named. Barlow also allows that William may have been sterile. Noting that no \"favourites\" were identified, and that William's \"baronial friends and companions were mostly married men\", despite having concluded that the chroniclers were \"hostile and biased witnesses\", Barlow considers that \"there seems no reason why they should have invented this particular charge\" (of homosexuality) and states that, in his opinion, \"On the whole the evidence points to the king's bisexuality\".{{sfn|Barlow|2000|p=109}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barlow |first= Frank |authorlink=Frank Barlow (historian)|title=William Rufus |publisher=Yale University Press  |edition= Second|location=New Haven, CT |year=2000 |isbn=0-300-08291-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bosanquet, G.

Like many protocols of the era, MEGAlink is an expanded version of the seminal [[XMODEM]]. While it was a relatively simple and high-performance system, it remains relatively obscure because it was overshadowed by [[ZMODEM]], which had been released a year earlier and saw rapid uptake.\n\n==History==\nThrough the early 1980s a number of new [[file transfer protocol]]s for BBS users appeared in order to address issues in the original [[XMODEM]] system.

XMODEM remained extremely popular.\n\nIn 1986, [[Chuck Forsberg]] released [[ZMODEM]], a radically improved file transfer protocol that offered many features, high performance, and ran on services that corrupted XMODEM transfers. The only downside to ZMODEM was that it was very complex, which made it difficult or impossible to implement on some machines, especially the large installed base of systems like the [[Commodore 64]].\n\nMEGAlink was introduced as part of Meiners' [[GT PowerComm]] [[terminal emulator]] to address this issue. It offered high performance, similar to that of ZMODEM, while being much simpler to implement. In spite of this attractive combination of features, MEGAlink never became popular, and few other terminal emulators appear to have added support{{sfn|Bigley|Tapamila|1987|p=63}} - a review article in 1988 shows only PowerComm and one other program supporting it.{{sfn|Review|1988}}\n\nThe move from 8-bit to 16-bit computers was taking place at the same time, and by the late 1980s any benefits in terms of simplicity had been muted. ZMODEM went on to be almost universal.\n\n==Description==\n===XMODEM===\n[[XMODEM]] is a simple protocol, and that is the primary reason for its popularity.{{sfn|Christensen|1982}}\n\nThe file to be sent is broken up into 128-byte chunks that form the [[Payload (computing)|payload data]] of its [[Network packet|packets]]. A 3-byte header consisting of the <tt>SOH</tt> character and two 8-bit integers is added in front of the data and a 1-byte [[checksum]] at the end, making the overall packet 132 bytes long. The protocol is triggered by the receiver, who sends a <tt>[[Acknowledgement (data networks)|NAK]]</tt> character to start the transfer, waits for a packet in response, and then sends <tt>ACK</tt> if the packet was received correctly, or <tt>NAK</tt> if it wasn't.{{sfn|Forsberg|1985}}\n\nBecause the phone system has a certain amount of [[Latency (engineering)|latency]], it takes some time for the <tt>ACK</tt> or <tt>NAK</tt> to travel back through the lines and trigger the sending of the next packet. At 300&nbsp;bit/s this represents a short time compared to the time needed to send the packet of data, so this can be ignored. At 2400&nbsp;bit/s, common latencies mean as much as 50% of the available time is being wasted waiting for replies.{{sfn|Forsberg|1985}}\n\nA wide variety of solutions were offered to address this problem. One is to make the packet size larger so the latency represents a smaller fraction of the time needed to send a packet. This was used in a number of protocols, notably [[YMODEM]].{{sfn|Forsberg|1985}} Another solution is to use a [[sliding window]] that allows multiple packets to be sent without needing an <tt>ACK</tt> for every one, as used in WXMODEM and others.\n\n===MEGAlink===\nMEGAlink is essentially a combination of features from prior attempts to improve XMODEM performance. The most basic change was to expand the basic packet size from 128 bytes to 512. This not only reduces the relative effects of latency, but also increases the amount of data compared to extraneous information like the header and footer bytes, improving its [[channel efficiency]].{{sfn|Meiners|1987}}\n\nMEGAlink deliberately avoided the sliding window solution, eliminating the need to send an <tt>ACK</tt> at all. The sender would simply continue to send packets until, or if, an <tt>NAK</tt> was received. The <tt>NAK</tt> was sent with two following bytes, the first containing the packet number where the error occurred, and the second as a [[two's complement]] of that number. The sender would then restart the transfer from that point.{{sfn|Meiners|1987}}\n\nIn order to quickly re-send data when required, the sender had to maintain a [[data buffer]] of the file's data so it could rapidly rewind to that point. Machines of the era had small amounts of memory, 64&nbsp;kB was not uncommon, so large buffers were not easily arranged. To address the fact that the sender might not have enough memory to send very long streams, MEGAlink allowed the sender to request an <tt>ACK</tt> at any point.{{sfn|Meiners|1987}}\n\nTo do this, the sender sent an [[ASCII]] <tt>RS</tt> (Record Separator) character. If the receiver sees an <tt>RS</tt> instead of the expected <tt>SOH</tt> at the start of the next packet, it immediately sends a reply consisting of an <tt>ACK</tt> and the packet number and inverse as in the case of the <tt>NAK</tt>. The sender can then remove any data prior to that packet from its buffer. For example, [[GT PowerComm]] used a buffer large enough for 32 packets, and sent an <tt>RS</tt>s request every 16 packets or so.{{sfn|Meiners|1987}}\n\nOther changes to the protocol are more minor. To allow operation over some networks, like [[PC Pursuit]], <tt>XON</tt> and <tt>XOFF</tt> characters were escaped with a <tt>DLE</tt> and then XORed with 64. This required any <tt>DLE</tt> in the original data to be escaped in the same fashion.{{sfn|Meiners|1987}}\n\n===32-bit CRC===\nThe original version of MEGAlink used 16-bit [[cyclic redundancy check]] (CRC), as was the case for many other XMODEM offshoots. Like those versions, the receiver indicated it was capable of receiving CRCs by sending an initial <tt>C</tt> instead of a <tt>NAK</tt> to begin the transfer. MEGAlink was later modified to support 32-bit CRCs as well, which it did by starting packets with an <tt>EM</tt> instead of <tt>SOH</tt>. The \"zero packet\", containing file information, was always sent with a standard <tt>SOH</tt> and 16-bit CRC, only the following data packets used the <tt>EM</tt> format.{{sfn|Meiners|1987}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite magazine\n |first1=Tom |last1=Bigley\n |first2=Glen |last2=Tapamila\n |title=A Pocket Guide to File Transfer Protocols\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Az8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA63\n |magazine=InfoWorld\n |date=7 December 1987\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |title = XMODEM Protocol Overview\n |first = Ward\n |last = Christensen\n |authorlink = Ward Christensen\n |date = 1 January 1982\n |url = http://techheap.packetizer.com/communication/modems/xmodem.html\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |first=Chuck |last=Forsberg\n |url=http://textfiles.com/programming/ymodem.txt\n |title=XMODEM / YMODEM Protocol Reference by Chuck Forsberg\n |date=10 October 1985\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |first=Paul |last=Meiners\n |title=MEGAlink: A File Transfer Protocol\n |date=9 August 1987\n |url=https://cpeterso.com/code/protocols/MEGALINK.TXT\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia\n |encyclopedia=Clearinghouse Review\n |title=Shareware's Best Communications Programs\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d1vNZAIv6lIC&pg=PA1326\n |date=April 1988\n |page=1326\n |ref=CITEREFReview1988\n}}\n\n{{Modem file transfer protocols}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MEGAlink}}\n[[Category:BBS file transfer protocols]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1987]]\n", "text_old": "'''MEGAlink''' is a [[file transfer protocol]] for [[modem]]-equipped [[microcomputers]]s written by Paul Meiners in 1987.
