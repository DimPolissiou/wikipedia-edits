It is the only [[historically black college]] in the state. Though located in a rural setting {{convert|10|mi|0}} east of [[Guthrie, Oklahoma|Guthrie]], Langston also serves an urban mission, with University Centers in both [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] (at the same campus as the [[OSU-Tulsa]] facility) and [[Oklahoma City]], and a nursing program set to open in [[Ardmore, Oklahoma|Ardmore]].

''Victorian'' refers to the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] (1837\u20131901), called the [[Victorian era]], during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction. However, many elements of what is typically termed \"Victorian\" architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria's reign. The styles often included interpretations and [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] revivals of historic styles. The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it followed [[Georgian architecture]] and later [[Regency architecture]], and was succeeded by [[Edwardian architecture]].\n\n==Victorian architecture in the United Kingdom==\n[[File:Selwyn College Gatehouse Tower, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|[[Selwyn College, Cambridge]] ]]\nDuring the early 19th century, the romantic [[medieval]] [[Gothic revival]] style was developed as a reaction to the [[symmetry]] of [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]], and such buildings as [[Fonthill Abbey]] were built. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new [[technology]], construction was able to incorporate metal materials as building components. Structures were erected with [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]] frames however, due to being weak in tension, these materials were effectively phased out in place for more structurally sound [[steel]] <ref>Blank, Alan; McEvoy, Michael; Plank, Roger (1993). Architecture and Construction in Steel. Taylor & Francis. {{ISBN|0-419-17660-8}}</ref>. One of the greatest exponents of iron frame construction was [[Joseph Paxton]], architect of [[the Crystal Palace]]. Paxton also continued to build such houses as [[Mentmore Towers]], in the still popular [[English Renaissance]] styles. New methods of construction were developed in this era of prosperity, but ironically the architectural styles, as developed by such architects as [[Augustus Pugin]], were typically retrospective.\n\nIn [[Scotland]], the architect [[Alexander Thomson]] who practiced in [[Glasgow]] was a pioneer of the use of [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] for commercial buildings, blending neo-classical conventionality with Egyptian and oriental themes to produce many truly original structures. Other notable Scottish architects of this period are [[Archibald Simpson]] and [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] whose stylistically varied work can be seen in the [[architecture of Aberdeen]].\n\nWhile Scottish architects pioneered this style it soon spread right across the United Kingdom and remained popular for another 40 years. Its architectural value in preserving and reinventing the past is significant. Its influences were diverse but the Scottish architects who practiced it were inspired by unique ways to blend architecture, purpose, and everyday life in a meaningful way.\n\n[[File:Central Hall.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Central Hall of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]\n\n* [[Jacobethan]] (1830\u20131870; the precursor to the [[Queen Anne Revival architecture|Queen Anne]] style)\n* [[Neo-Renaissance|Renaissance Revival]] (1840\u20131890)\n* [[Neo-Grec]] (1845\u20131865)\n* [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]]\n* [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] (1855\u20131880; originated in [[France]])\n* [[Queen Anne Revival architecture|Queen Anne Revival]] (1870\u20131910)\n* [[Scots Baronial Style architecture|Scots Baronial]] (predominantly Scotland)\n* British [[Arts and Crafts movement]] (1880\u20131910)\n\n===Other styles popularised during the period===\n\nWhile not uniquely Victorian, and part of revivals that began before the era, these styles are strongly associated with the 19th century owing to the large number of examples that were erected during that period.

Some chose the United States, and others went to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Normally, they applied architectural styles that were fashionable when they left England. By the latter half of the century, however, improving transport and communications meant that even remote parts of the Empire had access to publications such as the magazine ''[[The Builder]]'', which helped colonial architects keep informed about current fashion. Thus, the influence of English architecture spread across the world. Several prominent architects produced English-derived designs around the world, including [[William Butterfield]] ([[St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide]]) and [[Jacob Wrey Mould]] (Chief Architect of Public Works in [[New York City]]).\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Melbourne Collins Street Architecture.jpg|thumb|right|Modern skyscrapers on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]], have been deliberately set back from the street in order to retain Victorian-era buildings.]]\nThe Victorian period flourished in Australia and is generally recognised as being from 1840 to 1890, which saw a [[gold rush]] and population boom during the 1880s in the state of Victoria.

A list of these styles most commonly includes [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] (1855\u201385), [[Stick-Eastlake]] (1860\u2013ca. 1890), [[Folk Victorian]] (1870-1910), [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] (1880\u20131910), [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] (1880\u20131900), and [[Shingle Style architecture|Shingle]] (1880\u20131900). As in the United Kingdom, examples of Gothic Revival and Italianate continued to be constructed during this period, and are therefore sometimes called Victorian. Some historians classify the later years of Gothic Revival as a distinctive Victorian style named High Victorian Gothic. [[Stick-Eastlake]], a manner of geometric, machine-cut decorating derived from Stick and Queen Anne, is sometimes considered a distinct style. On the other hand, terms such as \"[[Painted Ladies]]\" or \"[[Gingerbread (architecture)|gingerbread]]\" may be used to describe certain Victorian buildings, but do not constitute a specific style. The names of architectural styles (as well as their adaptations) varied between countries. Many homes combined the elements of several different styles and are not easily distinguishable as one particular style or another.\n\n[[File:Victorian facades on 16th Street in San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Victorian facades on 16th Street, San Francisco]]\nIn the United States of America, notable cities which developed or were rebuilt largely during this era include [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Deal, New Jersey|Deal]], [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], the [[Brooklyn Heights]] and [[Victorian Flatbush]] sections of New York City, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Chicago]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Detroit]], [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Jersey City]]/[[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Atlanta]], [[Milwaukee]], [[New Orleans]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Midtown Sacramento|Midtown]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Angelino Heights, Los Angeles|Angelino Heights]] and [[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

''Victorian'' refers to the reign of [[Queen Victoria]] (1837\u20131901), called the [[Victorian era]], during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction. However, many elements of what is typically termed \"Victorian\" architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria's reign. The styles often included interpretations and [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] revivals of historic styles. The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it followed [[Georgian architecture]] and later [[Regency architecture]], and was succeeded by [[Edwardian architecture]].\n\n==Victorian architecture in the United Kingdom==\n[[File:Selwyn College Gatehouse Tower, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|[[Selwyn College, Cambridge]] ]]\nDuring the early 19th century, the romantic [[medieval]] [[Gothic revival]] style was developed as a reaction to the [[symmetry]] of [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]], and such buildings as [[Fonthill Abbey]] were built. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new [[technology]], construction was able to incorporate metal materials as building components. Structures were erected with [[cast iron]] and [[wrought iron]] frames however, due to being weak in tension, these materials were effectively phased out in place for more structurally sound [[steel]] <ref>Blank, Alan; McEvoy, Michael; Plank, Roger (1993). Architecture and Construction in Steel. Taylor & Francis. {{ISBN|0-419-17660-8}}</ref>. One of the greatest exponents of iron frame construction was [[Joseph Paxton]], architect of [[the Crystal Palace]]. Paxton also continued to build such houses as [[Mentmore Towers]], in the still popular [[English Renaissance]] styles. New methods of construction were developed in this era of prosperity, but ironically the architectural styles, as developed by such architects as [[Augustus Pugin]], were typically retrospective.\n\nIn [[Scotland]], the architect [[Alexander Thomson]] who practiced in [[Glasgow]] was a pioneer of the use of [[cast iron]] and [[steel]] for commercial buildings, blending neo-classical conventionality with Egyptian and oriental themes to produce many truly original structures. Other notable Scottish architects of this period are [[Archibald Simpson]] and [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] whose stylistically varied work can be seen in the [[architecture of Aberdeen]].\n\nWhile Scottish architects pioneered this style it soon spread right across the United Kingdom and remained popular for another 40 years. Its architectural value in preserving and reinventing the past is significant. Its influences were diverse but the Scottish architects who practiced it were inspired by unique ways to blend architecture, purpose, and everyday life in a meaningful way.\n\n[[File:Central Hall.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Central Hall of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]\n\n* [[Jacobethan]] (1830\u20131870; the precursor to the [[Queen Anne Revival architecture|Queen Anne]] style)\n* [[Neo-Renaissance|Renaissance Revival]] (1840\u20131890)\n* [[Neo-Grec]] (1845\u20131865)\n* [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]]\n* [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] (1855\u20131880; originated in [[France]])\n* [[Queen Anne Revival architecture|Queen Anne Revival]] (1870\u20131910)\n* [[Scots Baronial Style architecture|Scots Baronial]] (predominantly Scotland)\n* British [[Arts and Crafts movement]] (1880\u20131910)\n\n===Other styles popularised during the period===\n\nWhile not uniquely Victorian, and part of revivals that began before the era, these styles are strongly associated with the 19th century owing to the large number of examples that were erected during that period.

Some chose the United States, and others went to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Normally, they applied architectural styles that were fashionable when they left England. By the latter half of the century, however, improving transport and communications meant that even remote parts of the Empire had access to publications such as the magazine ''[[The Builder]]'', which helped colonial architects keep informed about current fashion. Thus, the influence of English architecture spread across the world.

A list of these styles most commonly includes [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] (1855\u201385), [[Stick-Eastlake]] (1860\u2013ca. 1890), [[Folk Victorian]] (1870-1910), [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] (1880\u20131910), [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] (1880\u20131900), and [[Shingle Style architecture|Shingle]] (1880\u20131900). As in the United Kingdom, examples of Gothic Revival and Italianate continued to be constructed during this period, and are therefore sometimes called Victorian. Some historians classify the later years of Gothic Revival as a distinctive Victorian style named High Victorian Gothic. [[Stick-Eastlake]], a manner of geometric, machine-cut decorating derived from Stick and Queen Anne, is sometimes considered a distinct style. On the other hand, terms such as \"[[Painted Ladies]]\" or \"[[Gingerbread (architecture)|gingerbread]]\" may be used to describe certain Victorian buildings, but do not constitute a specific style. The names of architectural styles (as well as their adaptations) varied between countries. Many homes combined the elements of several different styles and are not easily distinguishable as one particular style or another.\n\n[[File:Victorian facades on 16th Street in San Francisco.jpg|thumb|Victorian facades on 16th Street, San Francisco]]\nIn the United States of America, notable cities which developed or were rebuilt largely during this era include [[Alameda, California|Alameda]], [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Deal, New Jersey|Deal]], [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], the [[Brooklyn Heights]] and [[Victorian Flatbush]] sections of New York City, [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Chicago]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Detroit]], [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Jersey City]]/[[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Cape May, New Jersey|Cape May]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Atlanta]], [[Milwaukee]], [[New Orleans]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Midtown Sacramento|Midtown]] in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Angelino Heights, Los Angeles|Angelino Heights]] and [[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

The chosen nodes are arranged into a path, called a \"chain\" or \"circuit\", through which the message will be transmitted. To preserve the anonymity of the sender, no node in the circuit is able to tell whether the node before it is the originator or another intermediary like itself. Likewise, no node in the circuit is able to tell how many other nodes are in the circuit and only the final node, the \"exit node\", is able to determine its own location in the chain.<ref name=tor-design/>\n\nUsing [[asymmetric key cryptography]], the originator obtains a [[public key]] from the directory node to send an encrypted message to the first (\"entry\") node, establishing a connection  and a [[shared secret]] (\"session key\"). Using the established encrypted link to the entry node, the originator can then relay a message through the first node to a second node in the chain using encryption that only the second node, and not the first, can decrypt. When the second node receives the message, it establishes a connection with the first node. While this extends the encrypted link from the originator, the second node cannot determine whether the first node is the originator or just another node in the circuit. The originator can then send a message through the first and second nodes to a third node, encrypted such that only the third node is able to decrypt it. The third, as with the second, becomes linked to the originator but connects only with the second. This process can be repeated to build larger and larger chains, but is typically limited to preserve performance.<ref name=tor-design/>\n\nWhen the chain is complete, the originator can send data over the Internet anonymously. When the final recipient of the data sends data back, the intermediary nodes maintain the same link back to the originator, with data again layered, but in reverse such that the final node this time removes the first layer of encryption and the first node removes the last layer of encryption before sending the data, for example a web page, to the originator.<ref name=tor-design/>\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n{{see also|Tor (anonymity network)#Weaknesses}}\n\n=== Timing analysis ===\n{{see also|Traffic analysis}}\nOne of the reasons typical Internet connections are not considered anonymous, is the ability of [[Internet service provider]]s to trace and log connections between computers. For example, when a person accesses a particular website, the data itself may be secured through a connection like [[HTTPS]] such that the user's password, emails, or other content is not visible to an outside party, but there is a record of the connection itself, what time it occurred, and the amount of data transferred. Onion routing creates and obscures a path between two computers such that there's no discernible connection directly from a person to a website, but there still exist records of connections between computers. Traffic analysis searches those records of connections made by a potential originator and tries to match timing and data transfers to connections made to a potential recipient. If an attacker has compromised both ends of a route, a sender may be seen to have transferred an amount of data to an unknown computer a specified amount of seconds before a different unknown computer transferred data of the same exact size to a particular destination.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shmatikov |first=Wang |author2=Ming-Hsiu Vitaly |title=Timing analysis in low-latency mix networks: attacks and defenses|journal=Proceedings of the 11th European Conference on Research in Computer Security |volume=4189 |year=2006 |series=ESORICS'06 |pages=18\u201333 |doi=10.1007/11863908_2 |isbn=978-3-540-44601-9 |citeseerx=10.1.1.64.8818 }}</ref><ref name=\"Dingledine\">{{cite web|url=https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.html|title=Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router|last=Dingledine|first=Roger|last2=Mathewson|first2=Nick|publisher=USENIX Association|language=en-US|location=San Diego, CA|date=August 2004|accessdate=24 October 2012|last3=Syverson|first3=Paul}}</ref> Factors that may facilitate traffic analysis include nodes failing or leaving the network<ref name=\"Dingledine\"/> and a compromised node keeping track of a session as it occurs when chains are periodically rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Wright | first1 = Matthew.

A compromised exit node is thus able to acquire the raw data being transmitted, potentially including passwords, private messages, bank account numbers, and other forms of personal information. Dan Egerstad, a Swedish researcher, used such an attack to collect the passwords of over 100 email accounts related to foreign embassies.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bangeman |first=Eric |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070830-security-researcher-stumbles-across-embassy-e-mail-log-ins.html |title=Security researcher stumbles across embassy e-mail log-ins |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\n\nExit node vulnerabilities are similar to those on unsecured wireless networks, where the data being transmitted by a user on the network may be intercepted by another user or by the router operator. Both issues are solved by using a secure end-to-end connection like [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] or [[secure HTTP]] (S-HTTP). If there is [[end-to-end encryption]] between the sender and the recipient, and the sender isn't lured into trusting into a wrong SSL certificate offered by the exit node, then not even the last intermediary can view the original message.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Internet}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anonymous remailer]]\n* [[Bitblinder]]\n* [[Chaum mixes]]\n* [[Cryptography]]\n* [[Degree of anonymity]]\n* [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange]]\n* [[Java Anon Proxy]]\n* [[Key-based routing]]\n* [[Matryoshka doll]]\n* [[Mix network]]\n* [[Mixmaster anonymous remailer]]\n* [[Public-key cryptography]]\n* [[Proxy server]]\n* [[Tox (protocol)|Tox]] \u2013 implements onion routing\n* [[Tribler]] \u2013 implements onion routing\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.onion-router.net Onion-Router.net] - site formerly hosted at the Center for High Assurance Computer Systems of the [[U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]]\n* Sylverson, P.

Onion routing creates and obscures a path between two computers such that there's no discernible connection directly from a person to a website, but there still exist records of connections between computers. Traffic analysis searches those records of connections made by a potential originator and tries to match timing and data transfers to connections made to a potential recipient. If an attacker has compromised both ends of a route, a sender may be seen to have transferred an amount of data to an unknown computer a specified amount of seconds before a different unknown computer transferred data of the same exact size to a particular destination.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shmatikov |first=Wang |author2=Ming-Hsiu Vitaly |title=Timing analysis in low-latency mix networks: attacks and defenses|journal=Proceedings of the 11th European Conference on Research in Computer Security |volume=4189 |year=2006 |series=ESORICS'06 |pages=18\u201333 |doi=10.1007/11863908_2 |isbn=978-3-540-44601-9 |citeseerx=10.1.1.64.8818 }}</ref><ref name=\"Dingledine\">{{cite web|url=https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.html|title=Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router|last=Dingledine|first=Roger|last2=Mathewson|first2=Nick|publisher=USENIX Association|language=en-US|location=San Diego, CA|date=August 2004|accessdate=24 October 2012|last3=Syverson|first3=Paul}}</ref> Factors that may facilitate traffic analysis include nodes failing or leaving the network<ref name=\"Dingledine\"/> and a compromised node keeping track of a session as it occurs when chains are periodically rebuilt.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Wright | first1 = Matthew.

A compromised exit node is thus able to acquire the raw data being transmitted, potentially including passwords, private messages, bank account numbers, and other forms of personal information. Dan Egerstad, a Swedish researcher, used such an attack to collect the passwords of over 100 email accounts related to foreign embassies.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bangeman |first=Eric |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070830-security-researcher-stumbles-across-embassy-e-mail-log-ins.html |title=Security researcher stumbles across embassy e-mail log-ins |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2007-08-30 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\n\nExit node vulnerabilities are similar to those on unsecured wireless networks, where the data being transmitted by a user on the network may be intercepted by another user or by the router operator. Both issues are solved by using a secure end-to-end connection like [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] or [[secure HTTP]] (S-HTTP). If there is [[end-to-end encryption]] between the sender and the recipient, and the sender isn't lured into trusting into a wrong SSL certificate offered by the exit node, then not even the last intermediary can view the original message.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Internet}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anonymous remailer]]\n* [[Bitblinder]]\n* [[Chaum mixes]]\n* [[Cryptography]]\n* [[Degree of anonymity]]\n* [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange]]\n* [[Java Anon Proxy]]\n* [[Key-based routing]]\n* [[Matryoshka doll]]\n* [[Mix network]]\n* [[Mixmaster anonymous remailer]]\n* [[Public-key cryptography]]\n* [[Proxy server]]\n* [[Tox (protocol)|Tox]] \u2013 implements onion routing\n* [[Tribler]] \u2013 implements onion routing\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.onion-router.net Onion-Router.net] - site formerly hosted at the Center for High Assurance Computer Systems of the [[U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]]\n* Sylverson, P.

These materials are charged in batches into a [[blast furnace]] where the iron compounds in the ore give up excess oxygen and become liquid iron. At intervals of a few hours, the accumulated liquid iron is tapped from the blast furnace and either cast into [[pig iron]] or directed to other vessels for further steel making operations. Historically the [[Bessemer process]] was a major advancement in the production of economical steel, but it has now been entirely replaced by other processes such as the [[basic oxygen furnace]].\n\nMolten steel is cast into large blocks called ''blooms''. During the casting process various methods are used, such as addition of [[aluminum]], so that impurities in the steel float to the surface where they can be cut off the finished bloom.\n\nBecause of the energy cost and structural stress associated with heating and cooling a blast furnace, typically these primary steel making vessels will operate on a continuous production campaign of several years duration. Even during periods of low steel demand, it may not be feasible to let the blast furnace grow cold, though some adjustment of the production rate is possible.\n\nIntegrated mills are large facilities that are typically only economical to build in 2,000,000-ton per year annual capacity and up. Final products made by an integrated plant are usually large structural sections, heavy plate, strip, wire rod, [[rail tracks|railway rails]], and occasionally [[long steel products|long products]] such as [[Structural steel|bars]] and [[pipe (material)|pipe]].\n\nA major [[environmental hazard]] associated with integrated steel mills is the pollution produced in the manufacture of [[coke (fuel)|coke]], which is an essential intermediate product in the reduction of iron ore in a blast furnace.\n\nIntegrated mills may also adopt some of the processes used in mini-mills, such as arc furnaces and direct casting, to reduce production costs.\n\n==Minimill{{Anchor|Minimill}}==\n[[File:Block-Grobstrasse Witten.tif|thumb|An ingot of steel entering a rolling mill]]\nA minimill is traditionally a secondary steel producer; however, [[Nucor]] (one of the world's largest steel producers) and [[Commercial Metals Company | Commercial Metals Company (CMC)]] use minimills exclusively.  Usually it obtains most of its iron from [[scrap]] steel, recycled from used automobiles and equipment or byproducts of manufacturing. [[Direct reduced iron]] (DRI) is sometimes used with scrap, to help maintain desired chemistry of the steel, though usually DRI is too expensive to use as the primary raw steelmaking material.  A typical mini-mill will have an [[electric arc furnace]] for scrap melting, a [[Ladle (foundry)|ladle furnace]] or [[vacuum furnace]] for precision control of chemistry, a strip or billet [[Continuous Casting|continuous caster]] for converting molten steel to solid form, a [[reheat furnace]] and a [[rolling mill]].\n\nOriginally the mini mill was adapted to production of bar products only, such as [[concrete]] [[rebar|reinforcing bar]], flats, angles, channels, pipe, and light rails. Since the late 1980s, successful introduction of the [[Continuous_casting#Direct_strip_casting|direct strip casting]] process has made mini mill production of strip feasible.  Often a mini mill will be constructed in an area with no other steel production, to take advantage of local markets, resources, or lower-cost labour.  Mini mill plants may specialize, for example, in making coils of rod for [[wire drawing|wire-drawing]] use, or pipe, or in special sections for transportation and agriculture.\n\nCapacities of mini mills vary: some plants may make as much as 3,000,000 tons per year, a typical size is in the range 200,000 to 400,000 tons per year, and some old or specialty plants may make as little as 50,000 tons per year of finished product. [[Nucor Corporation]], for example, annually produces around 9,100,000 tons of sheet steel from its four sheet mills, 6,700,000 tons of bar steel from its 10 bar mills and 2,100,000 tons of plate steel from its two plate mills.\n\nSince the electric arc furnace can be easily started and stopped on a regular basis, mini mills can follow the market demand for their products easily, operating on 24-hour schedules when demand is high and cutting back production when sales are lower. <!-- Origins of steel mills, history, notable producers, references, PICTURES anyone? -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Foundry]]\n* [[List of steel producers]]\n* [[Steel#Steel industry|Steel \u00a7 Steel industry]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* McGannon, Harold E.
