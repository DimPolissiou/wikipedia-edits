The reservoir is owned by the [[Canal & River Trust]] and, like the nearby [[Combs, Derbyshire|Combs]] reservoir, is a feeder reservoir for the Peak Forest Canal. The feeder runs through Whaley Bridge, and with the Combs feed enters the canal system in a pool close to the transhipment shed at the Whaley Bridge canal basin.\n\nThe reservoir is fed from the Todd Brook, a stream which has a catchment area of around {{convert|1700|ha}} including the moorland on [[Shining Tor]] and farmland around [[Kettleshulme]] village. Water enters the reservoir on its north bank via a small waterfall. The first several inches of water do not flow into the reservoir but flow down the reservoir's run-off into the [[River Goyt]]. The reservoir often receives little or no inflow during periods when rainfall does not allow the level to exceed the barrier, and this often affects  the reservoir's water level, particularly in the summer months.\n\nThe reservoir's dam is built from earth with a [[puddle clay]] core. The embankment is straight in plan and approximately 310m long. The average crest level is 187.3mAOD. In August 2019, concrete panels on its spillway were dislodged after heavy rain, triggering the evacuation of parts of Whaley Bridge and the surrounding area due to the possibility of the dam collapsing.\n\n==Dam works==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nGrowth of traffic on the Peak Forest Canal meant that that water supply from Combs Reservoir proved insufficient, despite the trustees of the [[Macclesfield Canal]] allowing the transfer of water from the summit level of their [[Sutton Lane Ends|Sutton]] Reservoir. The General Assembly of the Peak Forest Canal company approved the adoption of the site of Toddbrook Reservoir in June 1834 on the advice of Samuel Taylor, a land surveyor (a further reservoir on the Hockham Brook above [[Chapel Milton]] was never completed). Negotiations for the sale of the land began in June 1834 but were not concluded until 1839. Work did not go smoothly: from the start, concerns were expressed over the geology of the site and the known existence of coal workings below the valley, and various sites were considered for the dam. John Wood drew up the first plans, though these were amended on the advice of various consultant engineers, including Robert Matthews (engineer of the [[Rochdale Canal]]) and Nicholas Brown, who had experience of building reservoirs.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=75\u201376}}</ref> Contracts for the reservoir construction were awarded to William Collinge and Richard and William Walker in August 1836. Geological problems continued to dog the project, and the site of the dam was altered on the advice of [[William Mackenzie (contractor)|William Mackenzie]] in 1837. As a stopgap, waters from the Todd Brook were diverted around the reservoir site and into the canal, and this solution proved so effective that consideration was even given to abandoning the reservoir project. Ultimately, however, construction continued using new plans supervised by Mackenzie and the reservoir's completion was reported in the canal committee's annual report of June 1841. The {{convert|24|m|adj=on}} dam was at the time the tallest ever built for a canal reservoir.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=77\u201378}}</ref>\n\nConsultant engineer Nicholas Brown's report of 1836 had specified a puddle trench varying from 12 feet at the brook end to 6 feet in width,<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=190}}</ref> but investigations in the late 20th century led to doubt as to whether it was constructed as laid out on original drawings or with more porous core material. The peak of the dam wall is supported either side by embankments with a slope of 1:2.<ref name=tedd140 /> Underneath the dam, the geology includes glacial sands and gravel, [[Till|glacial till]] overlying mudstones, sandstones, shales and coal measures.<ref name=civeng>{{cite web|url=https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/engineers-battle-night-save-derbyshire-dam-02-08-2019 |title=Engineers battle through night to prevent catastrophic dam failure |last=Horgan |first=Rob  |publisher= New Civil Engineer |access-date= 4 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt was known that local coal mining had been a threat to the dam's integrity for many years, with complaints dating from 1880 that water was leaking into coal mines.<ref name=Labrum9 /> After the Whaley Bridge Colliery proposed to work coal below the site, the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]], who owned the canal at the time, purchased coal measures beneath the reservoir site for \u00a38,550 after evidence of subsidence came to light.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=79}}</ref>\n\nLeakage was observed from the foot of the dam and investigated in 1931. The leak coincided with a hollow in the upstream slope of the dam which was filled in. In November 1975, low water revealed that another hollow had formed in the same area which led to regular monitoring of the dam. In 1977 it was noted that there had been {{convert|12|cm}} of subsidence since 1975. The reservoir was drained and a four metre wide hole was discovered, partly filled by silt and a tree which appeared to have been drawn in by the flow of water into the hole. Between 1978 and 1980, further investigations included drilling  bore holes into the affected areas. In 1981 a {{convert|1.2|m|adj=on}} diameter masonry culvert was discovered which had probably been built into the dam wall at the time of its construction to divert ground water, which can undermine a dam from below. Leaks had developed around it, as had happened to other dams where pipework or drainage had been built through a clay dam wall creating a weak spot.<ref name=tedd140 /> Repairs were made and a layer of waterproof clay was laid over the weak spot on the upstream face of the dam. The clay core was reinforced by injecting grout along a 60 metre length and the reservoir was refilled in December 1983.<ref name=tedd140 /><!--From Boyes: In 1976\u201377 both Toddbrook and Combs Reservoirs were drained to allow the dams to be checked. A depression {{convert|8|m}} in diameter was discovered on the inner face of the Toddbrook embankment, considered to have resulted from a weakness where the brook passed under the dam, the fault of the original contractor. Grouting was applied and a new wave wall added to the embankment.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=80}}</ref>-->\n\n[[File:Toddbrook_Reservoir,_the_dam_-_geograph.org.uk_-_77850.jpg|thumb|left |The 1969 dam wall spillway in 2005. Note channel for original spillway in foreground.]]\nIn December 1964, high rainfall resulted in damage to the dam\u2019s [[spillway]]. The water level rose to one metre above the overflow spillway at the side of the reservoir and remained high for 24 hours but did not rise above the main dam wall and the spillway prevented the water flowing over it and washing the earth embankment away. However, the high volume of water damaged the lower part of the spillway channel and escaping water started to erode the right bank at the base of the dam. The damage was repaired in 1965 but flood studies judged the spillway to be inadequate. It was noted by the [[Environment Agency]] that damage had occurred to nine other dams of similar design where the spillway delivered water to the foot of the dam.<ref name=tedd140 />\n\nIn 1969 an additional concrete spillway was built on the downstream face of the dam along a length of {{convert|75|m}}. This new [[weir]] was formed by adding concrete capping to the earth embankment to protect it from flowing water and was set above the existing spillway so that excess water would initially overflow along the original path.<ref name=tedd140>{{cite web |url=http://evidence.environment-agency.gov.uk/FCERM/Libraries/FCERM_Project_Documents/Lessons_from_Historical_Dam_Incidents.sflb.ashx |title=Delivering Benefits Through Evidence Lessons from Historical Dam Incidents |last1=Charles |first1=J Andrew|last2=Tedd |first2=Paul|last3=Warren |first3=Alan |publisher=Environment Agency |access-date=1 August 2019 |page=140}}</ref><ref name=Labrum9 />  In the 1980s, [[British Waterways]] carried out significant repair works to deal with leaks involving the mine shafts around the dam and a culvert was constructed under the current beach/launching area of the reservoir.

The \u00a3500,000 project entailed fish stocks being moved to other locations before repairing pitching to the wall of the dam.

The reservoir is owned by the [[Canal & River Trust]] and, like the nearby [[Combs, Derbyshire|Combs]] reservoir, is a feeder reservoir for the Peak Forest Canal. The feeder runs through Whaley Bridge, and with the Combs feed enters the canal system in a pool close to the transhipment shed at the Whaley Bridge canal basin.\n\nThe reservoir is fed from the Todd Brook, a stream which has a catchment area of around {{convert|1700|ha}} including the moorland on [[Shining Tor]] and farmland around [[Kettleshulme]] village. Water enters the reservoir on its north bank via a small waterfall. The first several inches of water do not flow into the reservoir but flow down the reservoir's run-off into the [[River Goyt]]. The reservoir often receives little or no inflow during periods when rainfall does not allow the level to exceed the barrier, and this often affects  the reservoir's water level, particularly in the summer months.\n\nThe reservoir's dam is built from earth with a [[puddle clay]] core. The embankment is straight in plan and approximately 310m long. The average crest level is 187.3mAOD. In August 2019, concrete panels on its spillway were dislodged after heavy rain, triggering the evacuation of parts of Whaley Bridge and the surrounding area due to the possibility of the dam collapsing.\n\n==Dam works==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nGrowth of traffic on the Peak Forest Canal meant that that water supply from Combs Reservoir proved insufficient, despite the trustees of the [[Macclesfield Canal]] allowing the transfer of water from the summit level of their [[Sutton Lane Ends|Sutton]] Reservoir. The General Assembly of the Peak Forest Canal company approved the adoption of the site of Toddbrook Reservoir in June 1834 on the advice of Samuel Taylor, a land surveyor (a further reservoir on the Hockham Brook above [[Chapel Milton]] was never completed). Negotiations for the sale of the land began in June 1834 but were not concluded until 1839. Work did not go smoothly: from the start, concerns were expressed over the geology of the site and the known existence of coal workings below the valley, and various sites were considered for the dam. John Wood drew up the first plans, though these were amended on the advice of various consultant engineers, including Robert Matthews (engineer of the [[Rochdale Canal]]) and Nicholas Brown, who had experience of building reservoirs.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=75\u201376}}</ref> Contracts for the reservoir construction were awarded to William Collinge and Richard and William Walker in August 1836. Geological problems continued to dog the project, and the site of the dam was altered on the advice of [[William Mackenzie (contractor)|William Mackenzie]] in 1837. As a stopgap, waters from the Todd Brook were diverted around the reservoir site and into the canal, and this solution proved so effective that consideration was even given to abandoning the reservoir project. Ultimately, however, construction continued using new plans supervised by Mackenzie and the reservoir's completion was reported in the canal committee's annual report of June 1841. The {{convert|24|m|adj=on}} dam was at the time the tallest ever built for a canal reservoir.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=77\u201378}}</ref>\n\nConsultant engineer Nicholas Brown's report of 1836 had specified a puddle trench varying from 12 feet at the brook end to 6 feet in width,<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=190}}</ref> but investigations in the late 20th century led to doubt as to whether it was constructed as laid out on original drawings or with more porous core material. The peak of the dam wall is supported either side by embankments with a slope of 1:2.<ref name=tedd140 /> Underneath the dam, the geology includes glacial sands and gravel, [[Till|glacial till]] overlying mudstones, sandstones, shales and coal measures.<ref name=civeng>{{cite web|url=https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/engineers-battle-night-save-derbyshire-dam-02-08-2019 |title=Engineers battle through night to prevent catastrophic dam failure |last=Horgan |first=Rob  |publisher= New Civil Engineer |access-date= 4 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt was known that local coal mining had been a threat to the dam's integrity for many years, with complaints dating from 1880 that water was leaking into coal mines.<ref name=Labrum9 /> After the Whaley Bridge Colliery proposed to work coal below the site, the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]], who owned the canal at the time, purchased coal measures beneath the reservoir site for \u00a38,550 after evidence of subsidence came to light.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=79}}</ref>\n\nLeakage was observed from the foot of the dam and investigated in 1931. The leak coincided with a hollow in the upstream slope of the dam which was filled in. In November 1975, low water revealed that another hollow had formed in the same area which led to regular monitoring of the dam. In 1977 it was noted that there had been {{convert|12|cm}} of subsidence since 1975. The reservoir was drained and a four metre wide hole was discovered, partly filled by silt and a tree which appeared to have been drawn in by the flow of water into the hole. Between 1978 and 1980, further investigations included drilling  bore holes into the affected areas. In 1981 a {{convert|1.2|m|adj=on}} diameter masonry culvert was discovered which had probably been built into the dam wall at the time of its construction to divert ground water, which can undermine a dam from below. Leaks had developed around it, as had happened to other dams where pipework or drainage had been built through a clay dam wall creating a weak spot.<ref name=tedd140 /> Repairs were made and a layer of waterproof clay was laid over the weak spot on the upstream face of the dam. The clay core was reinforced by injecting grout along a 60 metre length and the reservoir was refilled in December 1983.<ref name=tedd140 /><!--From Boyes: In 1976\u201377 both Toddbrook and Combs Reservoirs were drained to allow the dams to be checked. A depression {{convert|8|m}} in diameter was discovered on the inner face of the Toddbrook embankment, considered to have resulted from a weakness where the brook passed under the dam, the fault of the original contractor. Grouting was applied and a new wave wall added to the embankment.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyes|2012|p=80}}</ref>-->\n\n[[File:Toddbrook_Reservoir,_the_dam_-_geograph.org.uk_-_77850.jpg|thumb|left |The 1969 dam wall spillway in 2005. Note channel for original spillway in foreground.]]\nIn December 1964, high rainfall resulted in damage to the dam\u2019s [[spillway]]. The water level rose to one metre above the overflow spillway at the side of the reservoir and remained high for 24 hours but did not rise above the main dam wall and the spillway prevented the water flowing over it and washing the earth embankment away. However, the high volume of water damaged the lower part of the spillway channel and escaping water started to erode the right bank at the base of the dam. The damage was repaired in 1965 but flood studies judged the spillway to be inadequate. It was noted by the [[Environment Agency]] that damage had occurred to nine other dams of similar design where the spillway delivered water to the foot of the dam.<ref name=tedd140 />\n\nIn 1969 an additional concrete spillway was built on the downstream face of the dam along a length of {{convert|75|m}}. This new [[weir]] was formed by adding concrete capping to the earth embankment to protect it from flowing water and was set above the existing spillway so that excess water would initially overflow along the original path.<ref name=tedd140>{{cite web |url=http://evidence.environment-agency.gov.uk/FCERM/Libraries/FCERM_Project_Documents/Lessons_from_Historical_Dam_Incidents.sflb.ashx |title=Delivering Benefits Through Evidence Lessons from Historical Dam Incidents |last1=Charles |first1=J Andrew|last2=Tedd |first2=Paul|last3=Warren |first3=Alan |publisher=Environment Agency |access-date=1 August 2019 |page=140}}</ref><ref name=Labrum9 />  In the 1980s, [[British Waterways]] carried out significant repair works to deal with leaks involving the mine shafts around the dam and a culvert was constructed under the current beach/launching area of the reservoir. A stone marker on the main beach showed its location for many years, but was relocated to the footpath opposite Toddbrook Lodge during access work for the 2009 draining.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe reservoir was partially drained again in 2009 for inspection<ref>{{Cite|url=http://www.whaleybridge.net/forum/posts/t189-Toddbrook-Reservoir/page2|title = Toddbrook Reservoir forum posts at whalyebridge.net|date=14 September 2009}}</ref> before being fully drained for repairs in 2010. The \u00a3500,000 project entailed fish stocks being moved to other locations before repairing pitching to the wall of the dam. Other work  involved repairs to the 100-year-old pipework used to feed water stored in the reservoir at a controlled rate into the Peak Forest Canal and included; clearing silt and debris from pipework inlets, removing old valves and connections to pipework, cleaning, inspecting and repairing old pipework, re-lining old pipework with a resin \u201csock\u201d liner cured under pressure using ultraviolet lights, replacement of valves, testing of the new system and replacement of screens to intakes.<ref>{{Cite|url=http://www.whaleybridge.com/2011/01/toddbrook-reservoir-refilling-to-start-in-new-year/|title = Toddbrook Reservoir refilling to start in new year|date=5 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==2019 incident==\n[[File:Playground under construction (geograph 3891775).jpg|thumb|right|A view looking down the spillway in 2014 before the concrete slabs to the left of the picture were damaged in 2019]]\nOn 1 August 2019, a major incident was declared and 1,500 residents were evacuated from parts of [[Whaley Bridge]], [[Furness Vale]] and [[New Mills]] after concrete slabs on the 1969 overflow spillway were partially dislodged by high volumes of water following several days of heavy rain.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-49189955 | title = Whaley Bridge dam collapse: Town evacuated over Toddbrook Reservoir fears| publisher = BBC News | date = 1 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/reservoir-sealed-police-people-told-16681771|title=Thousands of Whaley Bridge residents evacuated as 'danger to life' warning issued over fears dam could burst|work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |first1=Chris |last1=Slater |first2=Damon |last2=Wilkinson |first3=Paul |last3=Britton |first4=Todd| last4=Fitzgerald |first5=Sam |last5=Yarwood |date=1 August 2019 |accessdate=3 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=RAF>{{cite news |date= 2 August 2019 |title=Whaley Bridge dam collapse: RAF Chinook brought in |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-49201467 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=2 August 2019 }}</ref> The [[Environment Agency]] issued a 'danger to life' warning due to the possibility of the dam collapsing.
