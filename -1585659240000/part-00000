At the time, Christopher Craig, then aged 16, a friend and accomplice of Bentley, was accused of the murder.\n\nBentley was convicted as a party to murder, by the [[English law]] principle of common purpose, \"[[Common purpose|joint enterprise]]\". The jury at the trial found Bentley guilty based on the prosecution's interpretation of the ambiguous phrase \"Let him have it\" (Bentley's alleged exhortation to Craig), after the judge, [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Lord Chief Justice Goddard]], had described Bentley as \"mentally aiding the murder of [[Police Constable]] Sidney Miles\". Goddard sentenced Bentley to be hanged: at the time, no other sentence was possible because of the conditions of the crime.\n\nThe Bentley case became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' and led to a 45-year-long campaign to win Derek Bentley a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] [[Pardon#United Kingdom|pardon]], which was granted in 1993, and then a further campaign for the quashing of his murder conviction, which occurred in 1998.\n\n==Early life==\n\nDerek Bentley entered Norbury Manor [[Secondary Modern School]] in 1944, after failing the [[Eleven plus exam|eleven-plus examination]]. Just before leaving, in March 1948 Bentley and another boy were arrested for theft. Six months later, he was sentenced to serve three years at [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood Approved School]], near [[Bristol]]. Christopher Craig also attended the same Secondary Modern school.\n\n==Health and mental development==\nDerek Bentley had a series of health and developmental problems. His parents reported that in a childhood accident he had broken his nose and since then he had three [[seizure|fits]], including one in which they said he nearly died of choking.<ref name = CCRC>{{cite BAILII\n|litigants    = R v Bentley (Deceased)\n|court        = EWCA\n|division     = Crim\n|year         = 1998\n|num          = 2516\n|parallelcite = [2001] 1 Cr App R 21, [1999] Crim LR 330\n|date         = 30 July 1998\n|courtname    = Court of Appeal of England and Wales\n}}</ref> The family also said they were bombed out three times during [[World War II]], and in one of these incidents, the house in which he lived collapsed around him, but a court did not find any indication that he was physically injured in the incident.<ref name=\"MICB\">''Murder In Cold Blood'' {{ISBN|1-871-61216-0}}</ref>{{rp|102}}\n\nKingswood Training School administered diagnostic tests to Bentley during the time of his detention there. In December 1948 (when he was {{frac|15|1|2}} years old), his mental age was estimated at 10 years, 4 months, when he scored 66 on an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] test. Kingswood staff reported him to be \"lazy, indifferent, voluble and of the 'wise guy' type\", whilst a court described him as \"indifferent, smug, self-satisfied and ready to tell tales\". After his arrest in November 1952, further IQ tests were administered to him at [[Brixton Prison]]. He was described there as \"borderline feeble-minded\", with a verbal score of 71, a performance IQ of 87 and a full scale IQ of 77.<ref name = CCRC/>\n\nIn December 1948, Bentley had an estimated \"reading age\" of 4 years, 6 months.<ref name=\"MICB\"/>{{rp|103}} He was discovered to still be \"quite [[Literacy|illiterate]]\" at the time of his arrest in November 1952. The prison medical officer said he \"cannot even recognise or write down all the letters of the alphabet\".<ref name = CCRC/>\n\nBentley was examined twice by EEG: a reading on 16 November 1949<ref name = CCRC/> indicated he was an epileptic and a reading on \n9 February 1950 was \"abnormal\". Both were taken at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol.<ref name = Yallop/>\n\n==Release From Kingswood==\n\nBentley was released from Kingswood school on 28 July 1950, a year early, though he remained under the care of Kingswood until 29 September 1954, by which time he was dead. He was a [[recluse]] for the rest of 1950, rarely venturing out of the house, breaking his isolation in January 1951. In March 1951, he was employed by a furniture removal firm but was forced to leave the job after injuring his back in March 1952. In May 1952, Bentley was taken on by the [[County Borough of Croydon|Croydon Corporation]] as a [[waste collector|dustbin man]], one month later, in June 1952 he was demoted to [[Street sweeper|street sweeping]] for unsatisfactory performance. One month after that, he was sacked by the Corporation. He was unemployed for the rest of his life.<ref name = Yallop>{{Cite book| last = Yallop|first = David|title = To Encourage the Others|publisher = Bantam Books|location = New York|year = 1991|isbn = 978-0-552-13451-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Crime==\nOn the night of Sunday 2 November 1952<Ref>https://nswbar.asn.au/docs/webdocs/BN03_2016_Bentley.pdf</Ref> Bentley and a sixteen-year-old companion, Christopher Craig, attempted to burgle the warehouse of the Barlow & Parker confectionery company at 27\u201329 Tamworth Road, [[Croydon]]. Craig armed himself with a [[Colt New Service]] [[.455 Webley]] calibre revolver, of which he had shortened the barrel so that it could be easily carried in his pocket. He also carried a number of undersized rounds for the revolver, some of which he had modified by hand to fit the gun. Bentley carried a [[knuckle-duster]], which he had been given by Craig, who had been fined the previous year for possessing a firearm without a certificate.<ref>The Trial of Craig and Bentley - Montgomery Hyde</ref>\n\nAt around 9.15pm, neighbours called police after spotting Craig and Bentley climbing over the gate and up a drainpipe to the roof of the warehouse.\n\nWhen police arrived, Craig and Bentley hid behind the lift-housing. Craig taunted the police. One of the officers, [[Sergeant|Detective Sergeant]] [[Frederick William Fairfax|Frederick Fairfax]], climbed the drainpipe to the roof and grabbed hold of Bentley, but Bentley broke free. What happened then is uncertain: police witnesses later claimed that Fairfax ordered Craig to \"Hand over the gun, lad\" and Bentley shouted, \"Let him have it, Chris\". Craig fired, striking Fairfax in the shoulder. Fairfax was nonetheless again able to restrain Bentley, who told Fairfax that Craig had further ammunition for the gun. Bentley had not used either of the weapons in his pockets.\n\nA group of uniformed police officers arrived and were sent onto the roof. The first to reach the roof was [[Police Constable]] Sidney Miles, who was immediately killed by a shot to the head. After exhausting his ammunition and being cornered, Craig jumped 30 feet (10 metres) from the roof onto a [[greenhouse]], fracturing his spine and left wrist and had to remain in hospital.\n\n==Trial==\n\nBoth Craig and Bentley were charged with the murder of PC Miles on the following day, 3 November 1952. They were tried by jury before the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Lord Goddard]], at the [[Old Bailey]] in London between 9 December and 11 December 1952. [[Christmas Humphreys]], Senior Treasury Counsel, led for the prosecution.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gangland: the case of Bentley and Craig|series=Crimes of the century|author=Francis Selwyn|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1988|isbn=0-415-00907-3|page=101 }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the burglary attempt and Miles's death, murder was a capital offence in England and Wales. Minors under 18 were not sentenced to death: consequently, of the two defendants, despite Craig having fired the fatal shot, only Bentley faced the death penalty if convicted.  The doctrine of felony murder or \"constructive malice\" meant that a charge of [[manslaughter]] was not an option, as the \"malicious intent\" of the armed robbery was transferred to the shooting. Bentley's best defence was that he was effectively under arrest when Miles was killed. There were three principal points of contention at trial:\n\nFirstly, the defence claimed there was ambiguity in the evidence as to how many shots were fired and by whom. A later [[forensic ballistics]] expert cast doubt on whether Craig could have hit Miles if he had shot at him deliberately:<ref name = Yallop/> The fatal bullet was not found. Craig had used bullets of different undersized calibres, and the sawn-off barrel made it inaccurate to a degree of six feet at the range from which he fired.\n\nSecondly, there was controversy over the existence and meaning of Bentley's alleged instruction to Craig, \"let him have it, Chris\". Craig and Bentley denied that Bentley had said the words while the police officers testified that he had said them. Further, Bentley's counsel argued that even if he had said the words, it could not be proven that Bentley had intended the words to mean the informal meaning of \"shoot him, Chris\" instead of the literal meaning of \"give him the gun, Chris\".\n\nThirdly, there was disagreement over whether Bentley was fit to stand trial in light of his mental capacity. The Principal Medical Officer responsible was Dr Matheson and he referred Bentley to Dr. Hill, a [[psychiatrist]] at the [[Maudsley Hospital]]. Hill's report stated that Bentley was illiterate and of low intelligence, almost borderline [[mental retardation|retarded]]. However, Matheson was of the opinion that whilst agreeing that Bentley was of low intelligence, he was not suffering from epilepsy at the time of the alleged offence and he was not a \"feeble-minded person\" under the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913|Mental Deficiency Acts]]. Matheson said that he was sane and fit to plead and stand trial. [[English law]] at the time did not recognise the concept of [[diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]] due to [[mental retardation|retarded development]], though it existed in [[Scottish law]] (it was introduced to England by the [[Homicide Act 1957]]). [[Criminal insanity]]&nbsp;\u2013 where the accused is unable to distinguish right from wrong&nbsp;\u2013 was then the only medical defence to murder. Bentley, while suffering severe debilitation, was not insane.\n\nThe jury took 75 minutes to decide that both Craig and Bentley were guilty of Miles's murder, with a plea for mercy for Bentley. Bentley was [[death sentence|sentenced to death]] whilst Craig was ordered to be detained [[at Her Majesty's Pleasure]]. He was eventually released in May 1963 after serving 10 years' imprisonment, married two years later and subsequently became a plumber.\n\nBentley was originally scheduled to be hanged on 30 December 1952 but this was postponed to allow for an [[appeal]]. Bentley's lawyers filed appeals highlighting the ambiguities of the [[Forensic ballistics|ballistic]] evidence, Bentley's mental age and the fact that he did not fire the fatal shot. Bentley's appeal was heard on 13 January 1953 and was unsuccessful.\n\n===Decision not to reprieve Bentley===\nWhen his appeal was turned down, Bentley's life was placed in the hands of the [[Home Secretary]] [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell Fyfe]], who had to decide whether to recommend that [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] exercise the [[Royal prerogative of mercy]] to convert his death sentence into [[life imprisonment]]. Lord Goddard forwarded the jury's recommendation of mercy, but added that he himself \"could find no mitigating circumstances\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31152 |first=K.

He went on to say that Bentley's case also involved the issue of the police force, since it was a police officer who was killed. Maxwell Fyfe then stresses that a reprieve would mean the Home Secretary is \"intervening in the due process of the law\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Political adventure: the memoirs of the Earl of Kilmuir |last=Kilmuir |first=1st Earl of |authorlink=David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |year=1964 |page=206}}</ref> Maxwell Fyfe, in the words of the letter sent out, failed to discover any sufficient ground to justify him in advising Her Majesty to interfere with the due course of the law.\n\nThere was much political pressure, including a memorandum signed by over 200 members of Parliament. Despite several attempts, Parliament was given no opportunity to debate Bentley's sentence until it had been carried out.<ref name = Guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1953/jan/28/fromthearchive|title=Efforts to save Bentley Fail|work=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> The [[Home Office]] also refused Dr. Hill permission to make his report public.\n\nAt 9am on 28 January 1953, Bentley was hanged at [[Wandsworth (HM Prison)|Wandsworth Prison]], London by [[Albert Pierrepoint]], with [[Harry Allen (executioner)|Harry Allen]] assisting. There were protests outside the prison and two people were arrested and fined for damage to property.\n\nIn March 1966 Bentley's remains were removed from Wandsworth and re-interred in [[Croydon Cemetery]].<ref>London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide and Gazetteer, by Hugh Meller & Brian Parsons</ref>\n\n==''To Encourage the Others''==\nIn his 1971 book ''To Encourage the Others'' (the title is an acknowledged allusion to [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide#Chapters XXI\u2013XXX|Candide]]''), [[David Yallop]] documented Bentley's psychiatric problems, inconsistencies in the police and [[forensic evidence]] and the conduct of the trial. He proposed the theory that Miles was actually killed by a bullet from a gun other than Craig's sawn-off .455 revolver. Yallop drew this conclusion from an interview in March 1971 with Dr. David Haler, the [[pathologist]] who carried out the [[autopsy]] on Miles, who Yallop reports estimated the head wound was inflicted by a bullet of between .32 and .38 calibre fired from between six and nine feet away. Craig had been firing from a distance of just under 40 feet and had used a variety of undersized .41, and .45 calibre rounds in his revolver; Yallop asserted it would have been impossible for him to use a bullet of .38 or smaller calibre. Haler did not offer in his trial evidence any estimate of the size of the bullet that had killed Miles. In July 1970, during an interview with Yallop, Craig accepted that the bullet that killed Miles came from his gun, but maintained that all of his shots were fired over the rear garden of a house adjacent to the warehouse, approximately 20 degrees to the right of Miles's location from where Craig had been firing.\n\nThe standard [[Metropolitan Police]] pistol at the time was the [[.32 ACP|.32-calibre]] [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] [[Webley Self-Loading Pistol|automatic]], a number of which were issued on the night. In his book ''The Scientific Investigation of Crime'', the prosecution's ballistics expert Lewis Nickolls stated that he recovered four bullets from the roof, two of .45, one of .41 and one of .32 calibre. The last was not entered as an exhibit in the trial, nor mentioned in Nickolls' evidence to the court.\n\nWhen Yallop telephoned Haler the day after the initial interview, he reportedly confirmed his estimate of the bullet size. Shortly before the publication of Yallop's book, Haler was provided with a transcript of the interview, and Yallop says Haler again confirmed as accurate. After the subsequent broadcast of the [[BBC]] ''[[Play for Today]]'' adaptation of ''To Encourage the Others'', directed by [[Alan Clarke]] and starring Charles Bolton, Haler sought to deny that he had given any specific estimate of the size of the bullet that killed Miles beyond being \"of large calibre\".\n\n==Posthumous pardon==\nFollowing the execution there was a public sense of unease about the decision, resulting in a long campaign to secure a posthumous pardon. The campaign was initially led by Bentley's parents until their deaths in the 1970s, after which the drive to clear Bentley's name was led by his sister Iris. In March 1966 his remains were removed from [[Wandsworth Prison]] and reburied in a family grave. In August 1970, [[Lord Goddard]] told Yallop that he thought Bentley was going to be reprieved, said he should have been, and attacked Maxwell Fyfe for allowing the execution to go ahead.<ref name = Yallop/>\n\nOn 29 July 1993, Bentley was granted a [[royal pardon]] in respect of the sentence of death passed upon him and carried out. However, in English law this did not quash his conviction for murder.\n\nEventually, on 30 July 1998, the Court of Appeal quashed Bentley's conviction for murder.<ref name = CCRC/> However, Bentley's sister Iris had died of cancer the year before.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/derek-bentleys-sister-dies-1284574.html|title=Derek Bentley's sister dies|work=The Independent|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> Her daughter, Maria Bentley-Dingwall, who was born 10 years after Derek Bentley's execution, continued the campaign after her mother's death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.derekbentley.com/980731/telegraph_archive_1998_07_31_nben31.html|title=Bentley cleared after 45 years|website=www.derekbentley.com}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Craig, by then aged 62 (born May 1936), issued a statement welcoming the pardon for Bentley, stating that \"his innocence has now been proved\". He also apologised to the families of both PC Miles and Bentley for his actions, as well as his own family for the press intrusion they had suffered over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/142351.stm|title=BBC News - UK - Craig's relief at Bentley pardon|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThough Bentley had never been accused of attacking any of the police officers, who were shot at by Craig, for him to be convicted of murder as an accessory in a joint enterprise it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that he knew that Craig had a deadly weapon when they began the break-in. The [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Lord Bingham of Cornhill]], ruled that Lord Goddard had not made it clear to the jury that the prosecution was required to have proved Bentley had known that Craig was armed. He further ruled that Lord Goddard had failed to raise the question of Bentley's withdrawal from their joint enterprise. This would require the prosecution to prove the absence of any attempt by Bentley to signal to Craig that he wanted Craig to surrender his weapons to the police. Lord Bingham ruled that Bentley's trial had been unfair because the judge had misdirected the jury and, in his summing-up, had put unfair pressure on the jury to convict. It is possible that Lord Goddard may have been under pressure while summing up since much of the evidence was not directly relevant to Bentley's defence. Lord Bingham did not rule that Bentley was innocent, merely that there had been fundamental defects in the trial process.\n\nAnother factor in the posthumous defence was that a \"confession\" recorded by Bentley, which was claimed by the prosecution to be a \"verbatim record of dictated monologue\", was shown by [[forensic linguistics]] methods to have been largely edited by policemen. [[Linguist]] Malcolm Coulthard showed that certain patterns, such as the frequency of the word \"then\" and the grammatical use of \"then\" after the grammatical subject (\"I then\" rather than \"then I\"), were not consistent with Bentley's use of language (his [[idiolect]]), as evidenced in court testimony.<ref>R.M. Coulthard (2000): \"Whose text is it? On the linguistic investigation of authorship\", in S. Sarangi and R.M. Coulthard: ''Discourse and Social Life'', London, Longman, pp270\u201387</ref> These patterns fit better the recorded testimony of the policemen involved. This is one of the earliest uses of forensic linguistics on record.\n\nIn a case with similarities to the Bentley case, a [[House of Lords]] judgment of 17 July 1997 cleared Philip English of murdering Sergeant Bill Forth in March 1993, the reasons being given by [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]]. English had been handcuffed before his companion Paul Weddle killed Sgt Forth with a concealed knife. The existing joint enterprise law allowed the conviction of English for murder because they had both been attacking Sgt Forth with wooden staves, making English an accessory to any murder committed by Weddle as part of that assault. [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]] made the 'fine distinction' that a concealed knife was a far more deadly weapon than a wooden stave, so that proof of English's knowledge of it was necessary for conviction. The appeal may have influenced the allowing of a posthumous referral of the Bentley case.\n\nLord Mustill had asked for new laws on [[homicide]] when setting out his reasons at the time of Lord Hutton's ruling on English's appeal. However, Lord Bingham's ruling blamed Lord Goddard for a miscarriage of justice without making further alteration to the law on joint enterprise. The English judgement, delivered just over two months after the Labour government took office, remained the most recent precedent in joint enterprise law, though the Bentley verdict attracted far more media attention.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 1980 book ''Theatre in Education - Four Secondary School Programmes'', edited and introduced by Pam Schweitzer, includes the play \"Example\", with an introduction by Harry Miller, who played Bentley in the original 1975 production. The play was devised by the Coventry Bellgrade TIE Team for fifth and sixth form students.\n\nThe 1990 book ''Let Him Have It, Chris'' written by [[M J Trow]] explores the inconsistencies in the police version of events.\n\nThe 1991 feature film ''[[Let Him Have It]]'', starring [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Bentley and [[Paul Reynolds (actor)|Paul Reynolds]] as Craig, relates the story, as do the songs \"Derek Bentley\" by [[Karl Dallas]] (in which the lyrics imply that Bentley was guilty but sympathise with him), \"[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Let Him Dangle]]\" by [[Elvis Costello]], \"Let Him Have It\" by [[The Bureau]], and \"Bentley and Craig\" by [[Ralph McTell]], whose mother was a friend of the Bentley family, also covered by June Tabor (on Aleyn, TSCD490, 1997).\n\nThe 1992-3 TV sitcom ''[[Grace & Favour]]'', a spin off from ''[[Are You Being Served]]'', contains an episode called \"The Gun\" which is a satire of the Derek Bentley case. The plot involves a misplaced gun that is fired by accident and the words \"Let him have it\".\n\n==See also==\n*''[[R v Betts and Ridley]]''\n*[[List of British police officers killed in the line of duty]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Cited works and further reading==\n* {{Cite book|last1=Berry-Dee|first1=Christopher|last2=Odell|first2=Robinn|title=Dad, Help Me Please: The Story of Derek Bentley|year=1991|publisher=W.

At the time, Christopher Craig, then aged 16, a friend and accomplice of Bentley, was accused of the murder.\n\nBentley was convicted as a party to murder, by the [[English law]] principle of common purpose, \"[[Common purpose|joint enterprise]]\". The jury at the trial found Bentley guilty based on the prosecution's interpretation of the ambiguous phrase \"Let him have it\" (Bentley's alleged exhortation to Craig), after the judge, [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Lord Chief Justice Goddard]], had described Bentley as \"mentally aiding the murder of [[Police Constable]] Sidney Miles\". Goddard sentenced Bentley to be hanged: at the time, no other sentence was possible because of the conditions of the crime.\n\nThe Bentley case became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' and led to a 45-year-long campaign to win Derek Bentley a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] [[Pardon#United Kingdom|pardon]], which was granted in 1993, and then a further campaign for the quashing of his murder conviction, which occurred in 1998.\n\n==Early life==\n\nDerek Bentley entered Norbury Manor [[Secondary Modern School]] in 1944, after failing the [[Eleven plus exam|eleven-plus examination]]. Just before leaving, in March 1948 Bentley and another boy were arrested for theft. Six months later, he was sentenced to serve three years at [[Kingswood, South Gloucestershire|Kingswood Approved School]], near [[Bristol]]. Christopher Craig also attended the same Secondary Modern school.\n\n==Health and mental development==\nDerek Bentley had a series of health and developmental problems.

In December 1948 (when he was {{frac|15|1|2}} years old), his mental age was estimated at 10 years, 4 months, when he scored 66 on an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]] test. Kingswood staff reported him to be \"lazy, indifferent, voluble and of the 'wise guy' type\", whilst a court described him as \"indifferent, smug, self-satisfied and ready to tell tales\". After his arrest in November 1952, further IQ tests were administered to him at [[Brixton Prison]]. He was described there as \"borderline feeble-minded\", with a verbal score of 71, a performance IQ of 87 and a full scale IQ of 77.<ref name = CCRC/>\n\nIn December 1948, Bentley had an estimated \"reading age\" of 4 years, 6 months.<ref name=\"MICB\"/>{{rp|103}} He was discovered to still be \"quite [[Literacy|illiterate]]\" at the time of his arrest in November 1952.

He was a [[recluse]] for the rest of 1950, rarely venturing out of the house, breaking his isolation in January 1951. In March 1951, he was employed by a furniture removal firm but was forced to leave the job after injuring his back in March 1952. In May 1952, Bentley was taken on by the [[County Borough of Croydon|Croydon Corporation]] as a [[waste collector|dustbin man]], one month later, in June 1952 he was demoted to [[Street sweeper|street sweeping]] for unsatisfactory performance. One month after that, he was sacked by the Corporation. He was unemployed for the rest of his life.<ref name = Yallop>{{Cite book| last = Yallop|first = David|title = To Encourage the Others|publisher = Bantam Books|location = New York|year = 1991|isbn = 978-0-552-13451-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Crime==\nOn the night of Sunday 2 November 1952<Ref>https://nswbar.asn.au/docs/webdocs/BN03_2016_Bentley.pdf</Ref> Bentley and a sixteen-year-old companion, Christopher Craig, attempted to burgle the warehouse of the Barlow & Parker confectionery company at 27\u201329 Tamworth Road, [[Croydon]]. Craig armed himself with a [[Colt New Service]] [[.455 Webley]] calibre revolver, of which he had shortened the barrel so that it could be easily carried in his pocket. He also carried a number of undersized rounds for the revolver, some of which he had modified by hand to fit the gun. Bentley carried a [[knuckle-duster]], which he had been given by Craig, who had been fined the previous year for possessing a firearm without a certificate.<ref>The Trial of Craig and Bentley - Montgomery Hyde</ref>\n\nAt around 9.15pm, neighbours called police after spotting Craig and Bentley climbing over the gate and up a drainpipe to the roof of the warehouse.\n\nWhen police arrived, Craig and Bentley hid behind the lift-housing. Craig taunted the police. One of the officers, [[Sergeant|Detective Sergeant]] [[Frederick William Fairfax|Frederick Fairfax]], climbed the drainpipe to the roof and grabbed hold of Bentley, but Bentley broke free. What happened then is uncertain: police witnesses later claimed that Fairfax ordered Craig to \"Hand over the gun, lad\" and Bentley shouted, \"Let him have it, Chris\". Craig fired, striking Fairfax in the shoulder. Fairfax was nonetheless again able to restrain Bentley, who told Fairfax that Craig had further ammunition for the gun. Bentley had not used either of the weapons in his pockets.\n\nA group of uniformed police officers arrived and were sent onto the roof. The first to reach the roof was [[Police Constable]] Sidney Miles, who was immediately killed by a shot to the head. After exhausting his ammunition and being cornered, Craig jumped 30 feet (10 metres) from the roof onto a [[greenhouse]], fracturing his spine and left wrist and had to remain in hospital.\n\n==Trial==\n\nBoth Craig and Bentley were charged with the murder of PC Miles on the following day, 3 November 1952. They were tried by jury before the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Rayner Goddard, Baron Goddard|Lord Goddard]], at the [[Old Bailey]] in London between 9 December and 11 December 1952. [[Christmas Humphreys]], Senior Treasury Counsel, led for the prosecution.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gangland: the case of Bentley and Craig|series=Crimes of the century|author=Francis Selwyn|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1988|isbn=0-415-00907-3|page=101 }}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the burglary attempt and Miles's death, murder was a capital offence in England and Wales. Minors under 18 were not sentenced to death: consequently, of the two defendants, despite Craig having fired the fatal shot, only Bentley faced the death penalty if convicted.  The doctrine of felony murder or \"constructive malice\" meant that a charge of [[manslaughter]] was not an option, as the \"malicious intent\" of the armed robbery was transferred to the shooting. Bentley's best defence was that he was effectively under arrest when Miles was killed. There were three principal points of contention at trial:\n\nFirstly, the defence claimed there was ambiguity in the evidence as to how many shots were fired and by whom. A later [[forensic ballistics]] expert cast doubt on whether Craig could have hit Miles if he had shot at him deliberately:<ref name = Yallop/> The fatal bullet was not found. Craig had used bullets of different undersized calibres, and the sawn-off barrel made it inaccurate to a degree of six feet at the range from which he fired.\n\nSecondly, there was controversy over the existence and meaning of Bentley's alleged instruction to Craig, \"let him have it, Chris\". Craig and Bentley denied that Bentley had said the words while the police officers testified that he had said them. Further, Bentley's counsel argued that even if he had said the words, it could not be proven that Bentley had intended the words to mean the informal meaning of \"shoot him, Chris\" instead of the literal meaning of \"give him the gun, Chris\".\n\nThirdly, there was disagreement over whether Bentley was fit to stand trial in light of his mental capacity. The Principal Medical Officer responsible was Dr Matheson and he referred Bentley to Dr. Hill, a [[psychiatrist]] at the [[Maudsley Hospital]]. Hill's report stated that Bentley was illiterate and of low intelligence, almost borderline [[mental retardation|retarded]]. However, Matheson was of the opinion that whilst agreeing that Bentley was of low intelligence, he was not suffering from epilepsy at the time of the alleged offence and he was not a \"feeble-minded person\" under the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913|Mental Deficiency Acts]]. Matheson said that he was sane and fit to plead and stand trial. [[English law]] at the time did not recognise the concept of [[diminished responsibility in English law|diminished responsibility]] due to [[mental retardation|retarded development]], though it existed in [[Scottish law]] (it was introduced to England by the [[Homicide Act 1957]]). [[Criminal insanity]]&nbsp;\u2013 where the accused is unable to distinguish right from wrong&nbsp;\u2013 was then the only medical defence to murder. Bentley, while suffering severe debilitation, was not insane.\n\nThe jury took 75 minutes to decide that both Craig and Bentley were guilty of Miles's murder, with a plea for mercy for Bentley. Bentley was [[death sentence|sentenced to death]] whilst Craig was ordered to be detained [[at Her Majesty's Pleasure]]. He was eventually released in May 1963 after serving 10 years' imprisonment, married two years later and subsequently became a plumber.\n\nBentley was originally scheduled to be hanged on 30 December 1952 but this was postponed to allow for an [[appeal]]. Bentley's lawyers filed appeals highlighting the ambiguities of the [[Forensic ballistics|ballistic]] evidence, Bentley's mental age and the fact that he did not fire the fatal shot. Bentley's appeal was heard on 13 January 1953 and was unsuccessful.\n\n===Decision not to reprieve Bentley===\nWhen his appeal was turned down, Bentley's life was placed in the hands of the [[Home Secretary]] [[David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir|David Maxwell Fyfe]], who had to decide whether to recommend that [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] exercise the [[Royal prerogative of mercy]] to convert his death sentence into [[life imprisonment]]. Lord Goddard forwarded the jury's recommendation of mercy, but added that he himself \"could find no mitigating circumstances\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31152 |first=K.

He went on to say that Bentley's case also involved the issue of the police force, since it was a police officer who was killed. Maxwell Fyfe then stresses that a reprieve would mean the Home Secretary is \"intervening in the due process of the law\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Political adventure: the memoirs of the Earl of Kilmuir |last=Kilmuir |first=1st Earl of |authorlink=David Maxwell Fyfe, 1st Earl of Kilmuir |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |year=1964 |page=206}}</ref> Maxwell Fyfe, in the words of the letter sent out, failed to discover any sufficient ground to justify him in advising Her Majesty to interfere with the due course of the law.\n\nThere was much political pressure, including a memorandum signed by over 200 members of Parliament.

There were protests outside the prison and two people were arrested and fined for damage to property.\n\nIn March 1966 Bentley's remains were removed from Wandsworth and re-interred in [[Croydon Cemetery]].<ref>London Cemeteries: An Illustrated Guide and Gazetteer, by Hugh Meller & Brian Parsons</ref>\n\n==''To Encourage the Others''==\nIn his 1971 book ''To Encourage the Others'' (the title is an acknowledged allusion to [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide#Chapters XXI\u2013XXX|Candide]]''), [[David Yallop]] documented Bentley's psychiatric problems, inconsistencies in the police and [[forensic evidence]] and the conduct of the trial. He proposed the theory that Miles was actually killed by a bullet from a gun other than Craig's sawn-off .455 revolver. Yallop drew this conclusion from an interview in March 1971 with Dr. David Haler, the [[pathologist]] who carried out the [[autopsy]] on Miles, who Yallop reports estimated the head wound was inflicted by a bullet of between .32 and .38 calibre fired from between six and nine feet away. Craig had been firing from a distance of just under 40 feet and had used a variety of undersized .41, and .45 calibre rounds in his revolver; Yallop asserted it would have been impossible for him to use a bullet of .38 or smaller calibre. Haler did not offer in his trial evidence any estimate of the size of the bullet that had killed Miles. In July 1970, during an interview with Yallop, Craig accepted that the bullet that killed Miles came from his gun, but maintained that all of his shots were fired over the rear garden of a house adjacent to the warehouse, approximately 20 degrees to the right of Miles's location from where Craig had been firing.\n\nThe standard [[Metropolitan Police]] pistol at the time was the [[.32 ACP|.32-calibre]] [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] [[Webley Self-Loading Pistol|automatic]], a number of which were issued on the night. In his book ''The Scientific Investigation of Crime'', the prosecution's ballistics expert Lewis Nickolls stated that he recovered four bullets from the roof, two of .45, one of .41 and one of .32 calibre. The last was not entered as an exhibit in the trial, nor mentioned in Nickolls' evidence to the court.\n\nWhen Yallop telephoned Haler the day after the initial interview, he reportedly confirmed his estimate of the bullet size. Shortly before the publication of Yallop's book, Haler was provided with a transcript of the interview, and Yallop says Haler again confirmed as accurate. After the subsequent broadcast of the [[BBC]] ''[[Play for Today]]'' adaptation of ''To Encourage the Others'', directed by [[Alan Clarke]] and starring Charles Bolton, Haler sought to deny that he had given any specific estimate of the size of the bullet that killed Miles beyond being \"of large calibre\".\n\n==Posthumous pardon==\nFollowing the execution there was a public sense of unease about the decision, resulting in a long campaign to secure a posthumous pardon. The campaign was initially led by Bentley's parents until their deaths in the 1970s, after which the drive to clear Bentley's name was led by his sister Iris. In March 1966 his remains were removed from [[Wandsworth Prison]] and reburied in a family grave. In August 1970, [[Lord Goddard]] told Yallop that he thought Bentley was going to be reprieved, said he should have been, and attacked Maxwell Fyfe for allowing the execution to go ahead.<ref name = Yallop/>\n\nOn 29 July 1993, Bentley was granted a [[royal pardon]] in respect of the sentence of death passed upon him and carried out. However, in English law this did not quash his conviction for murder.\n\nEventually, on 30 July 1998, the Court of Appeal quashed Bentley's conviction for murder.<ref name = CCRC/> However, Bentley's sister Iris had died of cancer the year before.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/derek-bentleys-sister-dies-1284574.html|title=Derek Bentley's sister dies|work=The Independent|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref> Her daughter, Maria Bentley-Dingwall, who was born 10 years after Derek Bentley's execution, continued the campaign after her mother's death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.derekbentley.com/980731/telegraph_archive_1998_07_31_nben31.html|title=Bentley cleared after 45 years|website=www.derekbentley.com}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Craig, by then aged 62 (born May 1936), issued a statement welcoming the pardon for Bentley, stating that \"his innocence has now been proved\". He also apologised to the families of both PC Miles and Bentley for his actions, as well as his own family for the press intrusion they had suffered over the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/142351.stm|title=BBC News - UK - Craig's relief at Bentley pardon|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThough Bentley had never been accused of attacking any of the police officers, who were shot at by Craig, for him to be convicted of murder as an accessory in a joint enterprise it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that he knew that Craig had a deadly weapon when they began the break-in. The [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[Lord Bingham of Cornhill]], ruled that Lord Goddard had not made it clear to the jury that the prosecution was required to have proved Bentley had known that Craig was armed. He further ruled that Lord Goddard had failed to raise the question of Bentley's withdrawal from their joint enterprise. This would require the prosecution to prove the absence of any attempt by Bentley to signal to Craig that he wanted Craig to surrender his weapons to the police. Lord Bingham ruled that Bentley's trial had been unfair because the judge had misdirected the jury and, in his summing-up, had put unfair pressure on the jury to convict. It is possible that Lord Goddard may have been under pressure while summing up since much of the evidence was not directly relevant to Bentley's defence. Lord Bingham did not rule that Bentley was innocent, merely that there had been fundamental defects in the trial process.\n\nAnother factor in the posthumous defence was that a \"confession\" recorded by Bentley, which was claimed by the prosecution to be a \"verbatim record of dictated monologue\", was shown by [[forensic linguistics]] methods to have been largely edited by policemen. [[Linguist]] Malcolm Coulthard showed that certain patterns, such as the frequency of the word \"then\" and the grammatical use of \"then\" after the grammatical subject (\"I then\" rather than \"then I\"), were not consistent with Bentley's use of language (his [[idiolect]]), as evidenced in court testimony.<ref>R.M. Coulthard (2000): \"Whose text is it? On the linguistic investigation of authorship\", in S. Sarangi and R.M. Coulthard: ''Discourse and Social Life'', London, Longman, pp270\u201387</ref> These patterns fit better the recorded testimony of the policemen involved. This is one of the earliest uses of forensic linguistics on record.\n\nIn a case with similarities to the Bentley case, a [[House of Lords]] judgment of 17 July 1997 cleared Philip English of murdering Sergeant Bill Forth in March 1993, the reasons being given by [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]]. English had been handcuffed before his companion Paul Weddle killed Sgt Forth with a concealed knife. The existing joint enterprise law allowed the conviction of English for murder because they had both been attacking Sgt Forth with wooden staves, making English an accessory to any murder committed by Weddle as part of that assault. [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]] made the 'fine distinction' that a concealed knife was a far more deadly weapon than a wooden stave, so that proof of English's knowledge of it was necessary for conviction. The appeal may have influenced the allowing of a posthumous referral of the Bentley case.\n\nLord Mustill had asked for new laws on [[homicide]] when setting out his reasons at the time of Lord Hutton's ruling on English's appeal. However, Lord Bingham's ruling blamed Lord Goddard for a miscarriage of justice without making further alteration to the law on joint enterprise. The English judgement, delivered just over two months after the Labour government took office, remained the most recent precedent in joint enterprise law, though the Bentley verdict attracted far more media attention.\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe 1980 book ''Theatre in Education - Four Secondary School Programmes'', edited and introduced by Pam Schweitzer, includes the play \"Example\", with an introduction by Harry Miller, who played Bentley in the original 1975 production. The play was devised by the Coventry Bellgrade TIE Team for fifth and sixth form students.\n\nThe 1990 book ''Let Him Have It, Chris'' written by [[M J Trow]] explores the inconsistencies in the police version of events.\n\nThe 1991 feature film ''[[Let Him Have It]]'', starring [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Bentley and [[Paul Reynolds (actor)|Paul Reynolds]] as Craig, relates the story, as do the songs \"Derek Bentley\" by [[Karl Dallas]] (in which the lyrics imply that Bentley was guilty but sympathise with him), \"[[Spike (Elvis Costello album)|Let Him Dangle]]\" by [[Elvis Costello]], \"Let Him Have It\" by [[The Bureau]], and \"Bentley and Craig\" by [[Ralph McTell]], whose mother was a friend of the Bentley family, also covered by June Tabor (on Aleyn, TSCD490, 1997).\n\nThe 1992-3 TV sitcom ''[[Grace & Favour]]'', a spin off from ''[[Are You Being Served]]'', contains an episode called \"The Gun\" which is a satire of the Derek Bentley case. The plot involves a misplaced gun that is fired by accident and the words \"Let him have it\".\n\n==See also==\n*''[[R v Betts and Ridley]]''\n*[[List of British police officers killed in the line of duty]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Cited works and further reading==\n* {{Cite book|last1=Berry-Dee|first1=Christopher|last2=Odell|first2=Robinn|title=Dad, Help Me Please: The Story of Derek Bentley|year=1991|publisher=W.

Whenever they were able to seize a town or city they would come to the tombs and turn them into ruins and destruction ... and they would destroy whatever mosques were with the tombs also.... Their brutality did not stop there but they also came to whatever graves were visible and destroyed them also. And when the ruler of the Hijaz regions caved in to them they destroyed all the graves of the Companions and razed them to the ground.... In fact, it has been noticed that the Ulema of the Wahhabis consider their own opinions correct and not possibly wrong, while they consider the opinions of others wrong and not possibly correct. More than that, they consider what others than themselves do in the way of erecting tombs and circumambulating them, as near to idolatry.... In this respect they are near the Khawarij who used to declare those who dissented with them apostate and fight them as we already mentioned.\"<ref>Muhammad Abu Zahra, ''Tarikh al-Madhahib al-Islamiyya'', pp. 235-38</ref>\n\n== Views on Ahmadiyya movement in Islam ==\n{{main article|Ahmadiyya Movement}}\n{{Ahmadiyya|collapsed=1}}\n\nAccording to Muhammad Abu Zahra, ''Ghulam Ahmad'' deviated from the mainstream [[aqidah]] of Islam due to his distinct views which is not shared by any other [[Schools of Islamic theology]].

The Wahhabis did not restrain themselves to proselytism only, but resorted to warmongering against whoever disagreed with them on the grounds that they were fighting innovation (''bid`a''), and innovations are an evil that must be fought.... Whenever they were able to seize a town or city they would come to the tombs and turn them into ruins and destruction ... and they would destroy whatever mosques were with the tombs also.... Their brutality did not stop there but they also came to whatever graves were visible and destroyed them also. And when the ruler of the Hijaz regions caved in to them they destroyed all the graves of the Companions and razed them to the ground.... In fact, it has been noticed that the Ulema of the Wahhabis consider their own opinions correct and not possibly wrong, while they consider the opinions of others wrong and not possibly correct. More than that, they consider what others than themselves do in the way of erecting tombs and circumambulating them, as near to idolatry.... In this respect they are near the Khawarij who used to declare those who dissented with them apostate and fight them as we already mentioned.\"<ref>Muhammad Abu Zahra, ''Tarikh al-Madhahib al-Islamiyya'', pp. 235-38</ref>\n\n== Views on Ahmadiyya movement in Islam ==\n{{main article|Ahmadiyya Movement}}\n{{Ahmadiyya|collapsed=1}}\n\nAccording to Muhammad Abu Zahra, ''Ghulam Ahmad'' deviated from the mainstream [[aqidah]] of Islam due to his distinct views which is not shared by any other [[Schools of Islamic theology]]. First of all, ''Ghulam'' claimed that he found the grave of [[Jesus]] which is not accepted by any other Islamic school of divinity.

Later, it was the residence of several lines of the [[Reuss (state)|Reussians]] until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Over the 19th century, Gera became a centre of the textile industry and saw a period of rapid growth. In 1952, the city also became an administrative centre in [[East Germany|GDR]] as one of the capitals of [[Gera (Bezirk)|Gera administrative district (Bezirk)]]. In 1990, Gera became part of re-established Thuringia. The loss of its administrative functions as well as its industrial core (caused both by structural change among the European textile industry and the economic system change after the German reunification) precipitated the city's slide into an enduring economic crisis.\n\nSince 1990, many of Gera's buildings have been restored and big urban planning programmes like the [[Bundesgartenschau]] 2007 were implemented to stimulate Gera's economy. Sights include some retained buildings of the royal residence epoque and many public and private buildings from the economic heyday between 1870 and 1930. The famous painter [[Otto Dix]] was born in Gera in 1891.\n\nGera lies in a hilly landscape in the east of Thuringia, within the wide valley of the [[White Elster]] river.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gera - Stadtmauer.JPG|thumb|left|Medieval city wall]]\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe place name ''Gera'' originally referred to the area of the Elster river valley where the city stands now. The name most likely{{Original research inline|date=March 2011}} originated before the European [[Migration Period]] \u2013 the Slavic people who first settled the area during the 8th century adopted the name. The first known documentary mention of Gera dates from 995.\n\nIn 999 Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] assigned the \"province\" of Gera to the [[Quedlinburg Abbey]]. In turn, the church assigned the protectorship of this area in 1209 to the [[Vogt]]s of [[Weida, Thuringia|Weida]] (in German: ''V\u00f6gte von Weida'') who served as its administrators. The Vogts of Weida were the ancestors of the [[Reuss (state)|Reussians]], who ruled Gera until 1918. Gera was first mentioned as a town in 1237, though it is unclear in which year Gera got the municipal law. The small town got circumvallated in the 13th century on an area of 350 x 350 m and the Vogts' city castle was built in the south-western corner at today's Burgstra\u00dfe. A municipal seal was first used in 1350, the council was first named in 1360 and the town hall was mentioned in 1426. The abbess of Quedlinburg remained the formal sovereign of Gera until 1358, as the [[House of Wettin|Wettins]] followed her up. The Vogt's couldn't emancipate theirselfs from Wettin rule. In 1450, Gera was almost totally destroyed during the [[Saxon Fratricidal War]], but it could recuperate quick because the starting textile manufacture brought wealth to the town.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\n[[File:Heinrich Posthumus Reu\u00df.jpg|thumb|Henry II of Reuss]]\nThe [[German Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Gera in 1533 against the will of the Vogts by the Wettins. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] in 1546, the Wettins lost Gera to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]], who however had no influence on the city, so that the Vogts resp. the Reussians (which arose from the Vogts in the mid-16th century) as indeed rulers were strengthened. During the 16th century, some cloth-makers from the [[Spanish Netherlands]] migrated to Gera as religious refugees at [[Henry II, Count of Reuss-Gera|Count Henry's]] invitation and raised the textile business in Gera. In the 18th century, there was a first peak in this industry ([[Putting-out system]]), which can be seen today at the large agents houses.\n\nIn 1673, the Reussians were raised to [[Imperial Count]]s which granted them full sovereignty within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; Gera became their royal residence. In 1686 and 1780, big town fires destroyed most buildings in Gera. The town was rebuilt relatively uniform during the 1780s in late-Baroque style, which marks the inner city until today.\n\nIn 1806 [[Napoleon]] established his Imperial Headquarters at Gera during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. From here, on October 12, 1806, the French Emperor purposely sent an arrogant and threatening letter to King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] \u2013 a letter that enticed [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] to war and a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Jena]] a few days later.<ref>Christopher Clark, \"The Iron Kingdom\" (London, 2006), p. 305</ref>\n\n=== Since 1815 ===\n[[File:Gera - Heinrichstrasse mit Stadtmuseum.jpg|thumb|left|The Heinrichstra\u00dfe in the 1900s]]\nThe Gera line of Reussians died out in 1802, so that it had no royal residence until the new one moved there from [[Schleiz]] in 1848. From 1848 to 1918 Gera served as the capital of the [[Principality of Reuss-Gera]]. With the industrial revolution in the mid-19th century, Gera grew rapidly, due largely to its textile industry, which saw the first [[Power loom]] installed in 1836. In 1859, Gera was first connected by railway to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] via [[Zeitz]] and [[Wei\u00dfenfels]]. During the following decades, rail lines in all directions made Gera to a transport hub, and the town kept growing. The second electric tram in Germany was installed in Gera in 1892.\n\nAfter World War I, during the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], the prince of Reuss was forced to abdicate and as the resultant \"[[Republic of Reuss]]\" joined the newly founded state of [[Thuringia]] in 1920. After the incorporation of some suburbs in the 1910s and 1920s Gera, with some 80,000 inhabitants, was the largest city in Thuringia, although the more centrally located [[Weimar]] became its capital.\n\n[[File:Gera Germany during American occupation in 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Gera after bombing, 1945]]After the Nazi takeover of Germany, the Jewish community of Gera was destroyed, the synagogue burnt down in the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938 and the city's Jews emigrated or were murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. A month before the end of World War II, on 6 April 1945, U.S. bombing destroyed parts of the city and killed 514 residents. Some 300 buildings were hit, including the Osterstein castle and several historic buildings in city centre, many of which weren't rebuilt after the war. U.S. forces occupied Gera on 14 April 1945 but were replaced by the Soviets on 1 July 1945.<ref>G\u00fcnter Sagan: ''Ostth\u00fcringen im Bombenkrieg 1939\u20131945.''

The demonstrations were put down by Soviet military forces, including armored units.<ref>''Der Schrei nach Freiheit. 17. Juni 1953 in Th\u00fcringen.''

The population rose during the GDR period, and massive ''[[Plattenbau]]'' prefabricated apartment blocks, built throughout East Germany, were constructed in Gera.\n\nAfter [[German reunification]] in 1990, Gera became part of the restored state of Thuringia. However, Gera lost most of its administrative functions after reunification, and nearly all the city's factories were closed. This led to a continuing economic crisis with significant unemployment, and the city's population declined from 135,000 in 1990 to less than 100,000 a decade later.\n\nThe city hosted the [[Bundesgartenschau]] (federal horticultural exhibition) in 2007.\n\n== Geography and demographics ==\n[[File:Gera - Heinrich bridge 2009 1 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|The White Elster river in Gera]]\n\n=== Topography ===\nGera is located in a smooth-hilly landscape in eastern Thuringia at the [[White Elster]] river, between the [[Thuringian Highland]] approx. {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} in the south-west, the [[Ore Mountains]] approx. {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} in the south-east and the [[Leipzig Bay]] approx. {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} in the north. The municipal territory is marked by the Elster valley, crossing it in south-northern direction. West of the valley, the landscape is more hilly and forested (with the Gera Municipal Forest), whereas the eastern parts are more flat and in agricultural use. The elevation is between 180 metres (the level of the White Elster river) and {{convert|354|m|2|abbr=on}} (when measured at Gera-Falka at the furthest southeastern point). Usually the height [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] for the city appears as {{convert|205|m|abbr=on}} when measured at the market place.\n\nSmall tributaries of the White Elster river within the borders of Gera are the ''Erlbach'' on the western side and the ''Wipsenbach'', ''Gessenbach'' and ''Brahme'' on the eastern side.\n\n=== Climate ===\nGera has a [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb) or an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system.<ref name = koppen>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.\n\n=== Administrative division ===\n[[File:Gera - Statistische Gliederung.png|thumb|District map]]\nGera abuts the following municipalities: \n* in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district in the north: [[Wetterzeube]] and [[Gutenborn]] in the federal state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]\n* in the [[Greiz (district)|Greiz]] district in the east: [[P\u00f6lzig]], [[Hirschfeld, Thuringia|Hirschfeld]], [[Brahmenau]], [[Schwaara]], [[Korbu\u00dfen]], [[Ronneburg, Thuringia|Ronneburg]], [[Kauern]], [[Hilbersdorf]] and [[Linda bei Weida|Linda]]; in the south: [[Endsch\u00fctz]], [[W\u00fcnschendorf/Elster|W\u00fcnschendorf]], [[Zedlitz]] and [[Hundhaupten]]; in the west: [[Saara, Greiz|Saara]], [[Kraftsdorf]], [[Hartmannsdorf, Greiz|Hartmannsdorf]] and [[Bad K\u00f6stritz]]\n* in the [[Saale-Holzland-Kreis|Saale-Holzland]] district: [[Silbitz]] in the north-west.\n\nGera is divided in different ways. Historically, there are more than 60 villages in the densely settled Elster valley area belonging to Gera today. The actual division knows on the one hand statistical districts and on the other hand political districts. The 12 statistical districts are covering the whole city area and consist of (sometimes) several political districts, urban quarters and/or rural villages. The 16 political districts are covering only few parts of Gera, but not the central urban areas, instead usually rural districts got incorporated during the second half of the 20th century. Each political district can (but doesn't have to) consist of more than one village. Each political district elects an own district council and a district mayor, whereas the statistical districts don't have any political function.\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\nThe 12 statistical districts are:\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\nThe 16 political districts are:\n|}\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n* 1 \u2013 Stadtmitte\n* 2 \u2013 Debschwitz\n* 3 \u2013 Gera-Ost\n* 4 \u2013 Gera-Nord/Langenberg\n* 5 \u2013 Bieblach-Ost\n* 6 \u2013 Bieblach/Tinz\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n* 7 \u2013 Untermhaus\n* 8 \u2013 Gera-Westvororte\n* 9 \u2013 Zw\u00f6tzen/Liebschwitz\n* 10 \u2013 Lusan-Laune\n* 11 \u2013 Lusan-Zentrum\n* 12 \u2013 Lusan-Br\u00fcte\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n* Aga\n* Cretzschwitz/S\u00f6llmnitz\n* Falka\n* Frankenthal\n* Hain\n* Hermsdorf\n* Langenberg\n* Liebschwitz\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n* Milbitz/Thieschitz/Rubitz\n* Naulitz\n* Roben\n* R\u00f6psen\n* Scheubengrobsdorf\n* Thr\u00e4nitz\n* Trebnitz\n* Wei\u00dfig\n|}\n\nThe main urban quarters are the city centre, Untermhaus (incorporated 1919) in the west, Langenberg (1950), Tinz (1919) and Bieblach (1905) in the north, Leumnitz (1919) in the east, Pforten (1919) and Zw\u00f6tzen (1919) in the south-east as well as Debschwitz (1912) and Lusan (1919) in the south-west.\n\n=== Demographics ===\n[[File:Gera Einwohnerentwicklung1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Demographic development until 2003]]\nDuring the centuries, Gera has been a quite small town of 2,000 inhabitants. As the textile business saw a first peak, the population rose to 7,000 in 1800 and further to 17,000 after the early stage of industrialisation in 1870. Gera's heyday between 1870 and 1930 led to a demographic boom with a population of 83,000 at the end of this phase in 1930. In 1950, Gera had 98,000 inhabitants and the all-time peak was reached in 1988 with a population of 135,000. After the German reunification in 1990, the city saw a significant decline in population, despite the large incorporations of 1994. The population shrunk to 113,000 in 2000 and 95,000 in 2012.\n\nThe average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.55% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. [[Suburbanization]] played only a small role in Gera. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Gera to search a better life in west Germany or other major east German cities like [[Jena]] or [[Leipzig]]. Since 2010, emigration is no big issue anymore. Now, the birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is getting a bigger problem because the immigration isn't sufficient to compensate it yet. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 12% (according to 2011 EU census). A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Gera has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.\n\nThe birth deficit was 715 in 2012, this is -7.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +3.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).<ref>According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik]</ref> The most important regions of origin of Gera migrants are bordering rural areas of Thuringia, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Saxony]] as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nLike other eastern German cities, Gera has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.6% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 5.0% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Gera are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]], [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]] and [[Ukrainians in Germany|Ukrainians]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved a bit: the unemployment rate declined from 22% in 2005 to 11% in 2013, which is still the highest one out of all Thuringian districts. Due to the official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 9.8% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.6% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census) making one of the world's lowest amounts of religious people.\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Largest groups of foreign residents'''\n|-\\\n!

The historic city centre is quite small and located between Sorge in the north, Nicolaistra\u00dfe in the east, Stadtgraben in the south and Reichsstra\u00dfe in the west. It survived World War II, but during the 1960s and 1970s, the GDR government demolished larger inner-city areas to rebuild them with modern concrete architecture, which marks the view of Gera's centre, particularly in the north-west until today. Between 1870 and 1930, the city was largely extended in all directions. As distinct from other German cities, there is no citywide spatial separation between the worker's quarters and the upper-class mansion districts, instead, the mansions and the tenements are situated near to each other, spread over all the districts. The hilly areas and those next to the river and the parks are more upscale, whereas the areas next to the railway and the factories are more working-class styled. Nevertheless, the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] architecture is quite diverse and interesting in Gera. Most buildings were extensively refurbished after 1990. Especially Gera's mansion architecture from the 1900s and 1910s is unique. The 1920s brought some modern-style [[Bauhaus]] buildings to the then rich city. During the GDR period, urban growth was handled by establishing big [[Plattenbau]] settlements on the city's periphery, like the Lusan district in south and the Bieblach district in north.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Friedrich engels strasse gera.jpg|Gr\u00fcnderzeit architecture at Friedrich-Engels-Stra\u00dfe\nFile:Villa eichenberg gera.JPG|Villa Eichenberg\nFile:Villa hirsch gera.jpg|Villa Hirsch\nFile:Buga07 VillaJahr.JPG|Villa Jahr (1905\u20131907)\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0327-315, Gera, Rundfunkgeb\u00e4ude.jpg|Haus Meyer (1927)\nFile:Gera Privatklinik Sch\u00e4fer.jpg|Former Klinik Sch\u00e4fer, Bauhaus style (1929)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Sights and architectural heritage ===\n\n==== Churches ====\n* The ''St. Saviour's Church'' at Nicolaiberg is the evangelical main church of Gera, built between 1717 and 1720 by [[David Schatz]] in Baroque style. \n* The ''Trinity Church'' at Heinrichstra\u00dfe is an evangelical parish church (since 1886), built between 1609 and 1611 as cemetery church. \n* The ''St. John's Church'' at Clara-Zetkin-Stra\u00dfe is an evangelical parish church, built between 1881 and 1885 in neo-Gothic style. \n* The ''St. Mary's Church'' at Untermhaus district is the evangelical parish church of the former village Untermhaus, built around 1450. \n* The ''St. Elizabeth's Church'' at Kleiststra\u00dfe is the catholic parish church of Gera, built in 2000 in modern style as one of only few bigger new churches in Thuringia after 1990. \n* The ''St. Martin's Church'' at Zw\u00f6tzen district is an evangelical parish church, built in 1895 in neo-Gothic style. \n* The ''Fourteen Holy Helpers Church'' at Langenberg district is an evangelical parish church, was rebuilt during the 1750s.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Gera - Salvatorkirche.jpg|St. Saviour's Church\nFile:Trinitatiskirche Gera.jpg|Trinity Church\nFile:Gera - Johanniskirche.jpg|St. John's Church\nFile:Gera Untermhaus St. Marienkirche (2007).JPG|St. Mary's Church\nFile:Zw\u00f6tzen, Kirche.JPG|St. Martin's Church\nFile:Kirche-Langenberg.jpg|Fourteen Holy Helpers Church \n</gallery>\n\n==== Other sights ====\n* The ''town hall'' at Marktplatz is one of the biggest Renaissance town halls in Germany with a nearly 60 m high tower, built between 1573 and 1576. The Marktplatz itself forms a good ensemble of 18th century patricians houses in late-Baroque style. \n* The ''Stadttheater'' at K\u00fcchengartenallee is the former royal Reussian theatre, built in 1902 by [[Heinrich Seeling]] in neo-Baroque style. \n* The ''Stadtapotheke'' (city pharmacy) is a Renaissance building at Marktplatz with a beautiful bay, established in 1592. \n* The ''K\u00fcchengarten'' with the ''Orangerie'' is a park ensemble west of the city centre, established in 1732 by the Reussians.   \n* The ''H\u00f6hler'' is a cellar system under the city centre with a length of approx. {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}}, established in 17th and 18th century for storing beer. A part can be visited via an entrance at Nicolaiberg 3. \n* The ''Schloss Tinz'' was the royal summer residence of the Reussians, built in 1748 in Baroque style with a surrounding park. \n* The ''Schloss Osterstein'' was the main royal residence of the Reussians, built during the 16th century in Renaissance style. It was hit by bombs in 1945 and partially demolished in 1962. Only the tower remained.  \n* The ''city wall'' was demolished in the 19th century, only a small part at Stadtgraben remained.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Gera Rathaus 2008-2.JPG|Town hall\nFile:Gera Theater (2007).JPG|Theatre\nFile:Gera - Stadtapotheke 2009.jpg|Stadtapotheke\nFile:Gera Orangerie (2007).jpg|Orangerie at K\u00fcchengarten\nFile:Gera - Schloss Tinz.jpg|Schloss Tinz\nFile:Gera Osterstein Bergfried.JPG|Schloss Osterstein: tower\nFile:Gera - Stadtmauer.JPG|City wall\n</gallery>\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n=== Agriculture, industry and services ===\n[[File:Alte Textilfabrik - geo-en.hlipp.de - 1097.jpg|thumb|A former textile factory in Gera]]\n[[File:Gera Arcaden.jpg|thumb|Shopping centre \"Gera Arcaden\"]]\n\nAgriculture has some importance in the rural districts of Gera, especially in the northern and eastern city parts. Approximately 57% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use:  growing maize, rapeseed and crops as well as pasturing cattle.\n\nThe city's economy features industrial machinery (Dagro Gera GmbH), communications (DTKS GmbH, [[Deutsche Telekom]]), security locks (Schlo\u00dfsicherungen Gera GmbH), optics (POG Pr\u00e4zisionsoptik Gera GmbH), electrical equipment (Electronicon Kondensatoren GmbH), and margarine manufacturing (Oth\u00fcna). Other companies include a compressor manufacturer (Kompressorenwerk Kaeser), a precision-tool maker (SMK-Pr\u00e4zisionsmechanik), and a subsidiary of the construction company Max B\u00f6gl. The e-commerce service-provider D+S Europe has a service centre in Gera with several hundred workers, and Rittal, a manufacturer of information-technology enclosures, {{as of | 2009 | alt = recently}} moved from Bad K\u00f6stritz to Gera. Some industrial branches operating before 1990 no longer have major importance.  Sectors either no longer existing or sharply reduced include those in toolmaking ([[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] Wema Union), textiles (VEB Modedruck), textile machinery (VEB Textima), electronic equipment (VEB Elektronik Gera).  Other industries that had a presence included [[Carl Zeiss AG|VEB Carl Zeiss Jena]] and a brewery. One important industrial branch had been uranium-ore mining in nearby Ronneburg ([[Wismut (mining company)|Wismut]]), whereby the region became the [[Soviet Union]]'s leading uranium supplier. In 2012 Gera had 41 companies with more than 20 workers in the industrial sector, employing 3,400 people and generating an overall turnover of \u20ac452 million.<ref>\n[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=kr000641   According to Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik]</ref>\n\nGera is a supra-centre according to the [[Central Place Theory]] in German regional planning. This makes the city a regional centre for retailing, with three major shopping centres: ''Gera-Arcaden'', ''Amthor-Passage'' and ''Elster-Forum''. Health services are important, with one of the biggest hospitals in Thuringia, the SRH Waldklinikum. Nevertheless, Gera's economy is weak compared to equal-sized neighbouring cities like [[Jena]] or [[Zwickau]]. While Jena counts 51,000 and Zwickau 50,000 jobs liable to pay into the German social insurance, Gera had only 35,000 of those full-time jobs in 2012. The commuter balance was +14,000 in Jena and +16,000 in Zwickau, but only +2,000 in Gera, which is one of the lowest ratios among German supra-centres, highlighting the lack of ability of Gera to provide jobs for the region. The unemployment rate reached 11.2% in September 2013 - the highest among all Thuringian districts.\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n==== By rail ====\n[[File:Gera Bahnhofshalle.JPG|thumb|Gera main station hall]]\nSince the late 19th century, Gera has been a hub in the railway network. The first railway ran to the [[Thuringian Railway]] in [[Wei\u00dfenfels]] (with connection to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]) via [[Zeitz]] in 1859. Further main lines were opened to [[G\u00f6\u00dfnitz]] (with connection to [[Chemnitz]]) in 1865, to [[Saalfeld]] in 1871, to [[Leipzig]] (via Zeitz) in 1873, to [[Plauen]] in 1875, to [[Weimar]] (with connection to [[Erfurt]]) via [[Jena]] in 1876 and to [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] in 1883. The secondary railways to [[Werdau]] (opened in 1876) and [[Meuselwitz]] (opened via [[P\u00f6lzig]] in 1901 and via [[Lumpzig]] in 1887) are abandoned. Nevertheless, none of these lines are electrified or in use for long-distance trains. Today, there are regional express trains to [[G\u00f6ttingen]] via Jena and Erfurt, to Leipzig via Zeitz, to [[Altenburg]], [[Glauchau]] and [[Zwickau]] via the G\u00f6\u00dfnitz line, to [[Greiz]], to Hof and to Saalfeld. Local trains provide connections to Weimar via Jena, Leipzig, [[Weischlitz]] (near Plauen), Hof and Saalfeld. The most lines run every two hours, so that there is hourly service (express and local trains in alternation) to most directions. The electrification of the west-eastern mainline Weimar \u2013 Jena \u2013 Gera \u2013 G\u00f6\u00dfnitz is in discussion for closing that gap in the network and enable Gera's connection to long-distance trains, which can be reached today either via Jena or via Leipzig.\n\nThe most important stations in Gera are the ''[[Gera Hauptbahnhof|Gera main station]]'' (former Prussian station), where all the trains stop, and the ''Gera southern station'' (former Saxonian station), where all the trains, except the local ones to Weimar, stop. More stations in Gera are ''Langenberg'' at the Leipzig line, ''Zw\u00f6tzen'' at the Saalfeld and Hof line as well as ''Gera Ost'' and ''Liebschwitz'' at the Plauen line. Freight transport by rail is immaterial in Gera since the 1990s.\n\n==== By road ====\nThe two [[German autobahns|Autobahnen]] crossing each other nearby at ''Hermsdorf junction'' are the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] (Frankfurt\u2013Dresden) and the [[Bundesautobahn 9]] (Berlin\u2013Munich), which were both built during the 1930s. Furthermore, there are three [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n connecting Gera: the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 2]] to [[Zeitz]] in the north and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] in the south, the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 7]] to [[Jena]] (via [[Eisenberg, Thuringia|Eisenberg]]) in the west and to [[Altenburg]] in the east and the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 92]] to [[Plauen]] (via [[Greiz]]) in the south. Important secondary roads run to Altenburg (via [[Lumpzig]]), to [[Werdau]] (via [[Linda bei Weida|Linda]]), to [[W\u00fcnschendorf/Elster|W\u00fcnschendorf]], to [[Stadtroda]] and to [[Hermsdorf, Thuringia|Hermsdorf]]. As part of the [[Bundesgartenschau]] 2007, a new bypass road was built in the east to improve the connection of southern city parts to the A 4 and to relieve the city centre from transit traffic.\n\n==== By aviation ====\nThe closest regional airports are the [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], about {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} north and the [[Erfurt-Weimar Airport]], about {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Gera. Both serve mainly holiday flights. The nearest major airports are the [[Frankfurt Airport]], the [[Munich Airport]] and the prospective [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]]. In the eastern part of Gera lies the airfield Gera-Leumnitz meant for private aviation.\n\n==== By bike ====\nCycling is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. For tourists, there are the ''Wei\u00dfe Elster track'' and the ''Thuringian city string track (Radweg Th\u00fcringer St\u00e4dtekette)''. Both connect points of tourist interest, the first along the [[White Elster]] valley from the [[Elster Mountains]] at the Czech border to [[Saale]] river in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and second from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and Gera to [[Altenburg]]. For inner city every-day traffic, some cycle lanes exist along several main streets.\n\n==== Trams and buses ====\n[[File:Gera, Leibnitzstrasse, ecke Cubaerstrasse - geo-en.hlipp.de - 1091.jpg|thumb|Tram at Leibnitzstra\u00dfe]]\nThe [[Trams in Gera|Gera tram network]] was the second in Germany that launched electrical engines in 1892. Today, there are two long lines, one from Bieblach via city centre to Lusan (line 3) and another one \u2013 opened in 2006 \u2013 from Untermhaus via city centre to Zw\u00f6tzen (line 1). The third short line is a connection between Lusan and the Zw\u00f6tzen railway station (line 2). Another line is planned to connect Langenberg and the northern city parts. On line 3 is one course every 5 minutes, on line 1 every 10 minutes and on line 2 every 20 minutes.\n\nThe bus network connects districts without trams as well as neighbouring municipalities that do not have a rail connection.\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:Gera 034.jpg|thumb|Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum school]]\nTertiary institutions are the private college ''SRH Fachhochschule f\u00fcr Gesundheit Gera'' ([[Fachhochschule|university of applied sciences]] for health) with 500 students and the ''Berufsakademie Gera'' ([[Cooperative education]]) with 700 students.\n\nFurthermore, there are four [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s, all of them are state-owned. The Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum focuses on music education as an elite boarding school, in addition to the common curriculum.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Mayor and city council ===\nThe current mayor [[Julian Vonarb]] (independent) has been in office since 2018. Since 1990, there have been six freely-elected mayors.

Later, it was the residence of several lines of the [[Reuss (state)|Reussians]] until the end of monarchy in Germany in 1918. Over the 19th century, Gera became a centre of the textile industry and saw a period of rapid growth. In 1952, the city also became an administrative centre in [[East Germany|GDR]] as one of the capitals of [[Gera (Bezirk)|Gera administrative district (Bezirk)]]. In 1990, Gera became part of re-established Thuringia. The loss of its administrative functions as well as its industrial core (caused both by structural change among the European textile industry and the economic system change after the German reunification) precipitated the city's slide into an enduring economic crisis.\n\nSince 1990, many of Gera's buildings have been restored and big urban planning programmes like the [[Bundesgartenschau]] 2007 were implemented to stimulate Gera's economy. Sights include some retained buildings of the royal residence epoque and many public and private buildings from the economic heyday between 1870 and 1930. The famous painter [[Otto Dix]] was born in Gera in 1891.\n\nGera lies in a hilly landscape in the east of Thuringia, within the wide valley of the [[White Elster]] river.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Gera - Stadtmauer.JPG|thumb|left|Medieval city wall]]\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe place name ''Gera'' originally referred to the area of the Elster river valley where the city stands now. The name most likely{{Original research inline|date=March 2011}} originated before the European [[Migration Period]] \u2013 the Slavic people who first settled the area during the 8th century adopted the name. The first known documentary mention of Gera dates from 995.\n\nIn 999 Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] assigned the \"province\" of Gera to the [[Quedlinburg Abbey]]. In turn, the church assigned the protectorship of this area in 1209 to the [[Vogt]]s of [[Weida, Thuringia|Weida]] (in German: ''V\u00f6gte von Weida'') who served as its administrators. The Vogts of Weida were the ancestors of the [[Reuss (state)|Reussians]], who ruled Gera until 1918. Gera was first mentioned as a town in 1237, though it is unclear in which year Gera got the municipal law. The small town got circumvallated in the 13th century on an area of 350 x 350 m and the Vogts' city castle was built in the south-western corner at today's Burgstra\u00dfe. A municipal seal was first used in 1350, the council was first named in 1360 and the town hall was mentioned in 1426. The abbess of Quedlinburg remained the formal sovereign of Gera until 1358, as the [[House of Wettin|Wettins]] followed her up. The Vogt's couldn't emancipate theirselfs from Wettin rule. In 1450, Gera was almost totally destroyed during the [[Saxon Fratricidal War]], but it could recuperate quick because the starting textile manufacture brought wealth to the town.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\n[[File:Heinrich Posthumus Reu\u00df.jpg|thumb|Henry II of Reuss]]\nThe [[German Reformation|Reformation]] was introduced in Gera in 1533 against the will of the Vogts by the Wettins. After the [[Schmalkaldic War]] in 1546, the Wettins lost Gera to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]], who however had no influence on the city, so that the Vogts resp. the Reussians (which arose from the Vogts in the mid-16th century) as indeed rulers were strengthened. During the 16th century, some cloth-makers from the [[Spanish Netherlands]] migrated to Gera as religious refugees at [[Henry II, Count of Reuss-Gera|Count Henry's]] invitation and raised the textile business in Gera. In the 18th century, there was a first peak in this industry ([[Putting-out system]]), which can be seen today at the large agents houses.\n\nIn 1673, the Reussians were raised to [[Imperial Count]]s which granted them full sovereignty within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; Gera became their royal residence. In 1686 and 1780, big town fires destroyed most buildings in Gera. The town was rebuilt relatively uniform during the 1780s in late-Baroque style, which marks the inner city until today.\n\nIn 1806 [[Napoleon]] established his Imperial Headquarters at Gera during the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]]. From here, on October 12, 1806, the French Emperor purposely sent an arrogant and threatening letter to King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] \u2013 a letter that enticed [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] to war and a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Jena]] a few days later.<ref>Christopher Clark, \"The Iron Kingdom\" (London, 2006), p. 305</ref>\n\n=== Since 1815 ===\n[[File:Gera - Heinrichstrasse mit Stadtmuseum.jpg|thumb|left|The Heinrichstra\u00dfe in the 1900s]]\nThe Gera line of Reussians died out in 1802, so that it had no royal residence until the new one moved there from [[Schleiz]] in 1848. From 1848 to 1918 Gera served as the capital of the [[Principality of Reuss-Gera]]. With the industrial revolution in the mid-19th century, Gera grew rapidly, due largely to its textile industry, which saw the first [[Power loom]] installed in 1836. In 1859, Gera was first connected by railway to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] via [[Zeitz]] and [[Wei\u00dfenfels]]. During the following decades, rail lines in all directions made Gera to a transport hub, and the town kept growing. The second electric tram in Germany was installed in Gera in 1892.\n\nAfter World War I, during the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], the prince of Reuss was forced to abdicate and as the resultant \"[[Republic of Reuss]]\" joined the newly founded state of [[Thuringia]] in 1920. After the incorporation of some suburbs in the 1910s and 1920s Gera, with some 80,000 inhabitants, was the largest city in Thuringia, although the more centrally located [[Weimar]] became its capital.\n\n[[File:Gera Germany during American occupation in 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Gera after bombing, 1945]]After the Nazi takeover of Germany, the Jewish community of Gera was destroyed, the synagogue burnt down in the [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938 and the city's Jews emigrated or were murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. A month before the end of World War II, on 6 April 1945, U.S. bombing destroyed parts of the city and killed 514 residents. Some 300 buildings were hit, including the Osterstein castle and several historic buildings in city centre, many of which weren't rebuilt after the war. U.S. forces occupied Gera on 14 April 1945 but were replaced by the Soviets on 1 July 1945.<ref>G\u00fcnter Sagan: ''Ostth\u00fcringen im Bombenkrieg 1939\u20131945.'' Michael-Imhof-Verlag, Petersberg 2013, {{ISBN|978-3-86568-636-7}}, pp. 178\u2013179.</ref>\n\nGera became part of the [[GDR]] in 1949 and was a flash point in the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]] as thousands of workers \u2013 among them many employees of the Soviet-established [[Wismut (mining company)|Wismut]] [[uranium mining]] entity in the nearby [[Ore Mountains]] (''Erzgebirge'') \u2013 demanded higher wages and free elections. The demonstrations were put down by Soviet military forces, including armored units.<ref>''Der Schrei nach Freiheit. 17. Juni 1953 in Th\u00fcringen.'' Exhibit of the [[Stiftung Ettersberg]] in the Th\u00fcringian Landtag, June 2012.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0617-0323, Gera, Wohnblocks.jpg|thumb|Inner-city ''Plattenbau'' architecture in 1974, with St. John's Church in background]]With governmental reorganization in East Germany, the city became the capital of the newly created [[Gera (Bezirk)|District of Gera]] in 1952. The population rose during the GDR period, and massive ''[[Plattenbau]]'' prefabricated apartment blocks, built throughout East Germany, were constructed in Gera.\n\nAfter [[German reunification]] in 1990, Gera became part of the restored state of Thuringia. However, Gera lost most of its administrative functions after reunification, and nearly all the city's factories were closed. This led to a continuing economic crisis with significant unemployment, and the city's population declined from 135,000 in 1990 to less than 100,000 a decade later.\n\nThe city hosted the [[Bundesgartenschau]] (federal horticultural exhibition) in 2007.\n\n== Geography and demographics ==\n[[File:Gera - Heinrich bridge 2009 1 (aka).jpg|thumb|left|The White Elster river in Gera]]\n\n=== Topography ===\nGera is located in a smooth-hilly landscape in eastern Thuringia at the [[White Elster]] river, between the [[Thuringian Highland]] approx. {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} in the south-west, the [[Ore Mountains]] approx. {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} in the south-east and the [[Leipzig Bay]] approx. {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} in the north. The municipal territory is marked by the Elster valley, crossing it in south-northern direction. West of the valley, the landscape is more hilly and forested (with the Gera Municipal Forest), whereas the eastern parts are more flat and in agricultural use. The elevation is between 180 metres (the level of the White Elster river) and {{convert|354|m|2|abbr=on}} (when measured at Gera-Falka at the furthest southeastern point). Usually the height [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] for the city appears as {{convert|205|m|abbr=on}} when measured at the market place.\n\nSmall tributaries of the White Elster river within the borders of Gera are the ''Erlbach'' on the western side and the ''Wipsenbach'', ''Gessenbach'' and ''Brahme'' on the eastern side.\n\n=== Climate ===\nGera has a [[humid continental climate]] (Dfb) or an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system.<ref name = koppen>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The city's topography creates a microclimate caused through the basin position with sometimes [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] in winter (quite cold nights under {{convert|-20|C|F}}) and heat and inadequate air circulation in summer. Annual precipitation is only {{convert|591|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.\n\n=== Administrative division ===\n[[File:Gera - Statistische Gliederung.png|thumb|District map]]\nGera abuts the following municipalities: \n* in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district in the north: [[Wetterzeube]] and [[Gutenborn]] in the federal state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]\n* in the [[Greiz (district)|Greiz]] district in the east: [[P\u00f6lzig]], [[Hirschfeld, Thuringia|Hirschfeld]], [[Brahmenau]], [[Schwaara]], [[Korbu\u00dfen]], [[Ronneburg, Thuringia|Ronneburg]], [[Kauern]], [[Hilbersdorf]] and [[Linda bei Weida|Linda]]; in the south: [[Endsch\u00fctz]], [[W\u00fcnschendorf/Elster|W\u00fcnschendorf]], [[Zedlitz]] and [[Hundhaupten]]; in the west: [[Saara, Greiz|Saara]], [[Kraftsdorf]], [[Hartmannsdorf, Greiz|Hartmannsdorf]] and [[Bad K\u00f6stritz]]\n* in the [[Saale-Holzland-Kreis|Saale-Holzland]] district: [[Silbitz]] in the north-west.\n\nGera is divided in different ways. Historically, there are more than 60 villages in the densely settled Elster valley area belonging to Gera today. The actual division knows on the one hand statistical districts and on the other hand political districts. The 12 statistical districts are covering the whole city area and consist of (sometimes) several political districts, urban quarters and/or rural villages. The 16 political districts are covering only few parts of Gera, but not the central urban areas, instead usually rural districts got incorporated during the second half of the 20th century. Each political district can (but doesn't have to) consist of more than one village. Each political district elects an own district council and a district mayor, whereas the statistical districts don't have any political function.\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\" |\nThe 12 statistical districts are:\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\nThe 16 political districts are:\n|}\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n* 1 \u2013 Stadtmitte\n* 2 \u2013 Debschwitz\n* 3 \u2013 Gera-Ost\n* 4 \u2013 Gera-Nord/Langenberg\n* 5 \u2013 Bieblach-Ost\n* 6 \u2013 Bieblach/Tinz\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n* 7 \u2013 Untermhaus\n* 8 \u2013 Gera-Westvororte\n* 9 \u2013 Zw\u00f6tzen/Liebschwitz\n* 10 \u2013 Lusan-Laune\n* 11 \u2013 Lusan-Zentrum\n* 12 \u2013 Lusan-Br\u00fcte\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n* Aga\n* Cretzschwitz/S\u00f6llmnitz\n* Falka\n* Frankenthal\n* Hain\n* Hermsdorf\n* Langenberg\n* Liebschwitz\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"25%\" |\n* Milbitz/Thieschitz/Rubitz\n* Naulitz\n* Roben\n* R\u00f6psen\n* Scheubengrobsdorf\n* Thr\u00e4nitz\n* Trebnitz\n* Wei\u00dfig\n|}\n\nThe main urban quarters are the city centre, Untermhaus (incorporated 1919) in the west, Langenberg (1950), Tinz (1919) and Bieblach (1905) in the north, Leumnitz (1919) in the east, Pforten (1919) and Zw\u00f6tzen (1919) in the south-east as well as Debschwitz (1912) and Lusan (1919) in the south-west.\n\n=== Demographics ===\n[[File:Gera Einwohnerentwicklung1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Demographic development until 2003]]\nDuring the centuries, Gera has been a quite small town of 2,000 inhabitants. As the textile business saw a first peak, the population rose to 7,000 in 1800 and further to 17,000 after the early stage of industrialisation in 1870. Gera's heyday between 1870 and 1930 led to a demographic boom with a population of 83,000 at the end of this phase in 1930. In 1950, Gera had 98,000 inhabitants and the all-time peak was reached in 1988 with a population of 135,000. After the German reunification in 1990, the city saw a significant decline in population, despite the large incorporations of 1994. The population shrunk to 113,000 in 2000 and 95,000 in 2012.\n\nThe average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.55% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. [[Suburbanization]] played only a small role in Gera. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Gera to search a better life in west Germany or other major east German cities like [[Jena]] or [[Leipzig]]. Since 2010, emigration is no big issue anymore. Now, the birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is getting a bigger problem because the immigration isn't sufficient to compensate it yet. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 12% (according to 2011 EU census). A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Gera has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.\n\nThe birth deficit was 715 in 2012, this is -7.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +3.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6).<ref>According to [http://www.tls.thueringen.de/startseite_hinweis.asp Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik]</ref> The most important regions of origin of Gera migrants are bordering rural areas of Thuringia, [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Saxony]] as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.\n\nLike other eastern German cities, Gera has only a small amount of foreign population: circa 1.6% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 5.0% are migrants (according to [[2011 EU census]]). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Gera are [[Russians in Germany|Russians]], [[Vietnamese people in Germany|Vietnamese people]] and [[Ukrainians in Germany|Ukrainians]]. During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved a bit: the unemployment rate declined from 22% in 2005 to 11% in 2013, which is still the highest one out of all Thuringian districts. Due to the official atheism in former [[East Germany|GDR]], most of the population is non-religious. 9.8% are members of the [[Evangelical Church in Central Germany]] and 2.6% are Catholics (according to 2011 EU census) making one of the world's lowest amounts of religious people.\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Largest groups of foreign residents'''\n|-\\\n!

The historic city centre is quite small and located between Sorge in the north, Nicolaistra\u00dfe in the east, Stadtgraben in the south and Reichsstra\u00dfe in the west. It survived World War II, but during the 1960s and 1970s, the GDR government demolished larger inner-city areas to rebuild them with modern concrete architecture, which marks the view of Gera's centre, particularly in the north-west until today. Between 1870 and 1930, the city was largely extended in all directions. As distinct from other German cities, there is no citywide spatial separation between the worker's quarters and the upper-class mansion districts, instead, the mansions and the tenements are situated near to each other, spread over all the districts. The hilly areas and those next to the river and the parks are more upscale, whereas the areas next to the railway and the factories are more working-class styled. Nevertheless, the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] architecture is quite diverse and interesting in Gera. Most buildings were extensively refurbished after 1990. Especially Gera's mansion architecture from the 1900s and 1910s is unique. The 1920s brought some modern-style [[Bauhaus]] buildings to the then rich city. During the GDR period, urban growth was handled by establishing big [[Plattenbau]] settlements on the city's periphery, like the Lusan district in south and the Bieblach district in north.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Friedrich engels strasse gera.jpg|Gr\u00fcnderzeit architecture at Friedrich-Engels-Stra\u00dfe\nFile:Villa eichenberg gera.JPG|Villa Eichenberg\nFile:Villa hirsch gera.jpg|Villa Hirsch\nFile:Buga07 VillaJahr.JPG|Villa Jahr (1905\u20131907)\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0327-315, Gera, Rundfunkgeb\u00e4ude.jpg|Haus Meyer (1927)\nFile:Gera Privatklinik Sch\u00e4fer.jpg|Former Klinik Sch\u00e4fer, Bauhaus style (1929)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Sights and architectural heritage ===\n\n==== Churches ====\n* The ''St. Saviour's Church'' at Nicolaiberg is the evangelical main church of Gera, built between 1717 and 1720 by [[David Schatz]] in Baroque style. \n* The ''Trinity Church'' at Heinrichstra\u00dfe is an evangelical parish church (since 1886), built between 1609 and 1611 as cemetery church. \n* The ''St. John's Church'' at Clara-Zetkin-Stra\u00dfe is an evangelical parish church, built between 1881 and 1885 in neo-Gothic style. \n* The ''St. Mary's Church'' at Untermhaus district is the evangelical parish church of the former village Untermhaus, built around 1450. \n* The ''St. Elizabeth's Church'' at Kleiststra\u00dfe is the catholic parish church of Gera, built in 2000 in modern style as one of only few bigger new churches in Thuringia after 1990. \n* The ''St. Martin's Church'' at Zw\u00f6tzen district is an evangelical parish church, built in 1895 in neo-Gothic style. \n* The ''Fourteen Holy Helpers Church'' at Langenberg district is an evangelical parish church, was rebuilt during the 1750s.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Gera - Salvatorkirche.jpg|St. Saviour's Church\nFile:Trinitatiskirche Gera.jpg|Trinity Church\nFile:Gera - Johanniskirche.jpg|St. John's Church\nFile:Gera Untermhaus St. Marienkirche (2007).JPG|St. Mary's Church\nFile:Zw\u00f6tzen, Kirche.JPG|St. Martin's Church\nFile:Kirche-Langenberg.jpg|Fourteen Holy Helpers Church \n</gallery>\n\n==== Other sights ====\n* The ''town hall'' at Marktplatz is one of the biggest Renaissance town halls in Germany with a nearly 60 m high tower, built between 1573 and 1576. The Marktplatz itself forms a good ensemble of 18th century patricians houses in late-Baroque style. \n* The ''Stadttheater'' at K\u00fcchengartenallee is the former royal Reussian theatre, built in 1902 by [[Heinrich Seeling]] in neo-Baroque style. \n* The ''Stadtapotheke'' (city pharmacy) is a Renaissance building at Marktplatz with a beautiful bay, established in 1592. \n* The ''K\u00fcchengarten'' with the ''Orangerie'' is a park ensemble west of the city centre, established in 1732 by the Reussians.   \n* The ''H\u00f6hler'' is a cellar system under the city centre with a length of approx. {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=on}}, established in 17th and 18th century for storing beer. A part can be visited via an entrance at Nicolaiberg 3. \n* The ''Schloss Tinz'' was the royal summer residence of the Reussians, built in 1748 in Baroque style with a surrounding park. \n* The ''Schloss Osterstein'' was the main royal residence of the Reussians, built during the 16th century in Renaissance style. It was hit by bombs in 1945 and partially demolished in 1962. Only the tower remained.  \n* The ''city wall'' was demolished in the 19th century, only a small part at Stadtgraben remained.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Gera Rathaus 2008-2.JPG|Town hall\nFile:Gera Theater (2007).JPG|Theatre\nFile:Gera - Stadtapotheke 2009.jpg|Stadtapotheke\nFile:Gera Orangerie (2007).jpg|Orangerie at K\u00fcchengarten\nFile:Gera - Schloss Tinz.jpg|Schloss Tinz\nFile:Gera Osterstein Bergfried.JPG|Schloss Osterstein: tower\nFile:Gera - Stadtmauer.JPG|City wall\n</gallery>\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n=== Agriculture, industry and services ===\n[[File:Alte Textilfabrik - geo-en.hlipp.de - 1097.jpg|thumb|A former textile factory in Gera]]\n[[File:Gera Arcaden.jpg|thumb|Shopping centre \"Gera Arcaden\"]]\n\nAgriculture has some importance in the rural districts of Gera, especially in the northern and eastern city parts. Approximately 57% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use:  growing maize, rapeseed and crops as well as pasturing cattle.\n\nThe city's economy features industrial machinery (Dagro Gera GmbH), communications (DTKS GmbH, [[Deutsche Telekom]]), security locks (Schlo\u00dfsicherungen Gera GmbH), optics (POG Pr\u00e4zisionsoptik Gera GmbH), electrical equipment (Electronicon Kondensatoren GmbH), and margarine manufacturing (Oth\u00fcna). Other companies include a compressor manufacturer (Kompressorenwerk Kaeser), a precision-tool maker (SMK-Pr\u00e4zisionsmechanik), and a subsidiary of the construction company Max B\u00f6gl. The e-commerce service-provider D+S Europe has a service centre in Gera with several hundred workers, and Rittal, a manufacturer of information-technology enclosures, {{as of | 2009 | alt = recently}} moved from Bad K\u00f6stritz to Gera. Some industrial branches operating before 1990 no longer have major importance.  Sectors either no longer existing or sharply reduced include those in toolmaking ([[Volkseigener Betrieb|VEB]] Wema Union), textiles (VEB Modedruck), textile machinery (VEB Textima), electronic equipment (VEB Elektronik Gera).  Other industries that had a presence included [[Carl Zeiss AG|VEB Carl Zeiss Jena]] and a brewery. One important industrial branch had been uranium-ore mining in nearby Ronneburg ([[Wismut (mining company)|Wismut]]), whereby the region became the [[Soviet Union]]'s leading uranium supplier. In 2012 Gera had 41 companies with more than 20 workers in the industrial sector, employing 3,400 people and generating an overall turnover of \u20ac452 million.<ref>\n[http://www.tls.thueringen.de/datenbank/TabAnzeige.asp?tabelle=kr000641   According to Th\u00fcringer Landesamt f\u00fcr Statistik]</ref>\n\nGera is a supra-centre according to the [[Central Place Theory]] in German regional planning. This makes the city a regional centre for retailing, with three major shopping centres: ''Gera-Arcaden'', ''Amthor-Passage'' and ''Elster-Forum''. Health services are important, with one of the biggest hospitals in Thuringia, the SRH Waldklinikum. Nevertheless, Gera's economy is weak compared to equal-sized neighbouring cities like [[Jena]] or [[Zwickau]]. While Jena counts 51,000 and Zwickau 50,000 jobs liable to pay into the German social insurance, Gera had only 35,000 of those full-time jobs in 2012. The commuter balance was +14,000 in Jena and +16,000 in Zwickau, but only +2,000 in Gera, which is one of the lowest ratios among German supra-centres, highlighting the lack of ability of Gera to provide jobs for the region. The unemployment rate reached 11.2% in September 2013 - the highest among all Thuringian districts.\n\n=== Transport ===\n\n==== By rail ====\n[[File:Gera Bahnhofshalle.JPG|thumb|Gera main station hall]]\nSince the late 19th century, Gera has been a hub in the railway network. The first railway ran to the [[Thuringian Railway]] in [[Wei\u00dfenfels]] (with connection to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]) via [[Zeitz]] in 1859. Further main lines were opened to [[G\u00f6\u00dfnitz]] (with connection to [[Chemnitz]]) in 1865, to [[Saalfeld]] in 1871, to [[Leipzig]] (via Zeitz) in 1873, to [[Plauen]] in 1875, to [[Weimar]] (with connection to [[Erfurt]]) via [[Jena]] in 1876 and to [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] in 1883. The secondary railways to [[Werdau]] (opened in 1876) and [[Meuselwitz]] (opened via [[P\u00f6lzig]] in 1901 and via [[Lumpzig]] in 1887) are abandoned. Nevertheless, none of these lines are electrified or in use for long-distance trains. Today, there are regional express trains to [[G\u00f6ttingen]] via Jena and Erfurt, to Leipzig via Zeitz, to [[Altenburg]], [[Glauchau]] and [[Zwickau]] via the G\u00f6\u00dfnitz line, to [[Greiz]], to Hof and to Saalfeld. Local trains provide connections to Weimar via Jena, Leipzig, [[Weischlitz]] (near Plauen), Hof and Saalfeld. The most lines run every two hours, so that there is hourly service (express and local trains in alternation) to most directions. The electrification of the west-eastern mainline Weimar \u2013 Jena \u2013 Gera \u2013 G\u00f6\u00dfnitz is in discussion for closing that gap in the network and enable Gera's connection to long-distance trains, which can be reached today either via Jena or via Leipzig.\n\nThe most important stations in Gera are the ''[[Gera Hauptbahnhof|Gera main station]]'' (former Prussian station), where all the trains stop, and the ''Gera southern station'' (former Saxonian station), where all the trains, except the local ones to Weimar, stop. More stations in Gera are ''Langenberg'' at the Leipzig line, ''Zw\u00f6tzen'' at the Saalfeld and Hof line as well as ''Gera Ost'' and ''Liebschwitz'' at the Plauen line. Freight transport by rail is immaterial in Gera since the 1990s.\n\n==== By road ====\nThe two [[German autobahns|Autobahnen]] crossing each other nearby at ''Hermsdorf junction'' are the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] (Frankfurt\u2013Dresden) and the [[Bundesautobahn 9]] (Berlin\u2013Munich), which were both built during the 1930s. Furthermore, there are three [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n connecting Gera: the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 2]] to [[Zeitz]] in the north and [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]] in the south, the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 7]] to [[Jena]] (via [[Eisenberg, Thuringia|Eisenberg]]) in the west and to [[Altenburg]] in the east and the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 92]] to [[Plauen]] (via [[Greiz]]) in the south. Important secondary roads run to Altenburg (via [[Lumpzig]]), to [[Werdau]] (via [[Linda bei Weida|Linda]]), to [[W\u00fcnschendorf/Elster|W\u00fcnschendorf]], to [[Stadtroda]] and to [[Hermsdorf, Thuringia|Hermsdorf]]. As part of the [[Bundesgartenschau]] 2007, a new bypass road was built in the east to improve the connection of southern city parts to the A 4 and to relieve the city centre from transit traffic.\n\n==== By aviation ====\nThe closest regional airports are the [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], about {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} north and the [[Erfurt-Weimar Airport]], about {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Gera. Both serve mainly holiday flights. The nearest major airports are the [[Frankfurt Airport]], the [[Munich Airport]] and the prospective [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]]. In the eastern part of Gera lies the airfield Gera-Leumnitz meant for private aviation.\n\n==== By bike ====\nCycling is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. For tourists, there are the ''Wei\u00dfe Elster track'' and the ''Thuringian city string track (Radweg Th\u00fcringer St\u00e4dtekette)''. Both connect points of tourist interest, the first along the [[White Elster]] valley from the [[Elster Mountains]] at the Czech border to [[Saale]] river in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and second from [[Eisenach]] via [[Erfurt]], [[Weimar]], [[Jena]] and Gera to [[Altenburg]]. For inner city every-day traffic, some cycle lanes exist along several main streets.\n\n==== Trams and buses ====\n[[File:Gera, Leibnitzstrasse, ecke Cubaerstrasse - geo-en.hlipp.de - 1091.jpg|thumb|Tram at Leibnitzstra\u00dfe]]\nThe [[Trams in Gera|Gera tram network]] was the second in Germany that launched electrical engines in 1892. Today, there are two long lines, one from Bieblach via city centre to Lusan (line 3) and another one \u2013 opened in 2006 \u2013 from Untermhaus via city centre to Zw\u00f6tzen (line 1). The third short line is a connection between Lusan and the Zw\u00f6tzen railway station (line 2). Another line is planned to connect Langenberg and the northern city parts. On line 3 is one course every 5 minutes, on line 1 every 10 minutes and on line 2 every 20 minutes.\n\nThe bus network connects districts without trams as well as neighbouring municipalities that do not have a rail connection.\n\n=== Education ===\n[[File:Gera 034.jpg|thumb|Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum school]]\nTertiary institutions are the private college ''SRH Fachhochschule f\u00fcr Gesundheit Gera'' ([[Fachhochschule|university of applied sciences]] for health) with 500 students and the ''Berufsakademie Gera'' ([[Cooperative education]]) with 700 students.\n\nFurthermore, there are four [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s, all of them are state-owned. The Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum focuses on music education as an elite boarding school, in addition to the common curriculum.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Mayor and city council ===\nThe current mayor [[Julian Vonarb]] (independent) has been in office since 2018. Since 1990, there have been six freely-elected mayors. Since 1994, mayors in Thuringia are elected [[direct election|directly]] by the people.\n\nThe previous municipal election was held in 2014 with the result:<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.wahlen.thueringen.de/datenbank/wahl1/WAHL.asp?wahlart=GW&wJahr=2014&zeigeErg=WK&auswertung=1&wknr=052&gemnr=&terrKrs=&gemteil=000&buchstabe=&Langname=&wahlvorschlag=&sort=&druck=&XLS=&anzahlH=0&Nicht_existierende=&x_vollbildDatenteil=&optik=&aktual=&ShowLand=&ShowWK=&ShowPart=\n | title=Municipal election 2014 -

The [[Prevention of Violence Act 1939]] was brought in response to an Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of violence under the [[S-Plan]]. This act had been allowed to expire in 1953 and was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] a response to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. From 1974 to 1989 the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually.\n* In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent [[Terrorism Act 2000]], which contained many of their powers, and then the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].\n* The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was formally introduced into the Parliament November 19, 2001 two months after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States. It received royal assent and went into force on December 13, 2001. On December 16, 2004 the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] it remained in force. The [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the [[Terrorism Act 2006]] creates new offences related to terrorism, and amends existing ones. The Act was drafted in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], and like its predecessors some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial.\n\nSince 1978 the UK's terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared [[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]], whose often influential reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full.\n;{{US}}\n* U.S. legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of [[deadly force]] by law enforcement organizations.\n* Search and seizure is governed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].\n* The U.S. passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] after the September 11 attacks, as well as a range of other legislation and [[executive orders]] relating to national security.\n* The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate anti-terrorism, as well as national response to major natural disasters and accidents.\n* The [[Posse Comitatus Act]] limits domestic employment of the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]], requiring Presidential approval prior to deploying the Army and/or the Air Force. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] policy also applies this limitation to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]], because the Posse Comitatus Act does not cover naval services, even though they are federal military forces. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] can be employed domestically on Presidential order, as was done during the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[Beltway Sniper]] incidents.\n* External or international use of lethal force would require a [[Presidential finding]].\n* In February 2017, sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the U.S. government program [[Countering Violent Extremism Task Force|Countering Violent Extremism]] (CVE) to solely focus on Islamist extremism.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources], Reuters 2017-02-02</ref>\n\n; {{AUS}}\n* Australia has passed several anti-terrorism acts. In 2004, a bill comprising three acts [[Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004|Anti-terrorism Act, 2004, (No 2) and (No 3)]] was passed. Then Attorney-General, [[Philip Ruddock]], introduced the ''Anti-terrorism bill, 2004'' on March 31. He described it as ''\"a bill to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects&nbsp;\u2013 a task made more urgent following the recent tragic [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombings in Spain]].\"'' He said that Australia's counter-terrorism laws \"require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism.\" The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] supplemented the powers of the earlier acts. The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year. The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005#The \"Shoot to Kill\" Clause|Australian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2005]] included a \"shoot-to-kill\" clause.

[[Amnesty International]] included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the Madrid Agenda arising from the Madrid Summit on Democracy and Terrorism (Madrid March 8\u201311, 2005):\n\n{{quote|Democratic principles and values are essential tools in the fight against terrorism. Any successful strategy for dealing with terrorism requires terrorists to be isolated. Consequently, the preference must be to treat terrorism as criminal acts to be handled through existing systems of law enforcement and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We recommend: (1) taking effective measures to make impunity impossible either for acts of terrorism or for the abuse of human rights in counter-terrorism measures. (2) the incorporation of human rights laws in all anti-terrorism programmes and policies of national governments as well as international bodies.\"<ref name=\"Amnesty International 2005\">Amnesty International (2005): \"Counter-terrorism and criminal law in the EU. [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior61/013/2005/en/ online]</ref>}}\n\nWhile international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states, proponents of human rights (as well as [[human security]]) have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation. They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the international effort to cooperate to combat terrorism.<ref name=\"Human Rights News 2004\">Human Rights News (2004): \"Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism\", in the Briefing to the 60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. [http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/01/29/global7127.htm online]</ref>\n\n=== Preemptive neutralization ===\nSome countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy. This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack. [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Russia]] have taken this approach, while Western European states generally do not.\n\nAnother major method of preemptive neutralization is [[interrogation]] of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots, targets, the identity of other terrorists, whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement. Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase [[suggestibility]], such as [[sleep deprivation]] or drugs. Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment, or due to the confusion brought on by it. These methods are not tolerated by European powers. In 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the [[Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978)|Ireland v. United Kingdom]] case that [[five techniques|such methods]] amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, and that such practices were in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] Article 3 (art. 3).\n\n==== Non-military ====\nThe [[human security]] paradigm outlines a non-military approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity. Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and [[sustainability]] for all people. Such activities empower citizens providing 'freedom from fear' and 'freedom from want'.\n\nThis can take many forms including the provision of clean drinking water, education, vaccination programs, provision of food and shelter and protection from violence, military or otherwise. Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors including governments, [[NGOs]], and citizens.\n\n[[Foreign internal defense]] programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government. FID can involve both non-military and military aspects of counter-terrorism.\n\nA 2017 study found that \"governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Foreign Aid as a Counterterrorism Tool - Burcu Savun, Daniel C.

Local [[firefighter]]s and emergency medical personnel (often called \"first responders\") have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks, although police may deal with threats of such attacks.\n\n=== Target-hardening ===\n\nWhatever the target of terrorists, there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark, or reducing the damage of attacks. One method is to place [[Hostile vehicle mitigation]] to enforce protective standoff distance outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and [[truck bomb]]ing. Another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation.<ref>{{cite journal\n | author = Ronchi, E.\n | title = Disaster management: Design buildings for rapid evacuation\n | year = 2015\n | journal = Nature\n | volume = 528\n | issue = 7582\n | pages = 333\n | doi=10.1038/528333b\n | pmid=26672544\n| bibcode = 2015Natur.528..333R\n }}</ref>\n\nAircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights, and have reinforced doors, which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening. UK [[railway stations]] removed their [[waste container|rubbish bins]] in response to the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] threat, as convenient locations for depositing bombs.\n\nScottish stations removed theirs after the [[7 July 2005 London Bombings]] as a precautionary measure. The [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] purchased bomb-resistant barriers after the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Iron Dome Intercepts Rockets from the Gaza Strip.jpg|thumb|[[Iron Dome]] air defense system. It intercepts artillery rockets fired by terrorist onto Israeli cities and towns.]]\nAs [[Israel]] is suffering from constant shelling of its cities, towns and settlements by [[artillery rocket]]s from the [[Gaza Strip]] (mainly by [[Hamas]], but also by other Palestinian factions) and [[Lebanon]] (mainly by [[Hezbollah]]), Israel developed several defensive measures against artillery, rockets and missiles. These include building a [[bomb shelter]] in every building and [[school]], but also deploying active protection systems like the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow ABM]], [[Iron Dome]] and [[David's Sling]] batteries which intercept the incoming threat in the air. [[Iron Dome]] has successfully intercepted hundreds of [[Qassam rocket]]s and [[Grad rocket]]s fired by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.\n\nA more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked. Terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] or the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Industrial chemicals in manufacturing, shipping, and storage need greater protection, and some efforts are in progress.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64224-2005Jan10.html\n | title = D.C. Wants Rail Hazmats Banned: S.C. Wreck Renews Fears for Capital\n | author = Weiss, Eric M.\n | date = January 11, 2005\n | page = B01\n | journal=The Washington Post\n}}</ref> To put this risk into perspective, the first [[Poison gas in World War I#1915: large scale use and lethal gases|major lethal chemical attack in WWI]] used 160 tons of chlorine. Industrial shipments of chlorine, widely used in water purification and the chemical industry, travel in 90 or 55 ton tank cars.\n\nTo give one more example, the North American electrical grid has already demonstrated, in the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], its vulnerability to natural disasters coupled with inadequate, possibly insecure, [[SCADA]] (supervisory control and data acquisition) networks. Part of the vulnerability is due to deregulation leading to much more interconnection in a grid designed for only occasional power-selling between utilities. A small number of terrorists, attacking key power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers, could wreak havoc.\n\nEquipping likely targets with containers (i.e., bags) of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by suicide bombers. The technique was apparently used on a limited scale by British authorities in the 1940s.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3484277.stm\n | title = Suicide bombing 'pig fat threat\n | date = February 13, 2004\n | accessdate=January 2, 2010\n | journal=BBC News}}</ref> The approach stems from the idea that Muslims perpetrating the attack would not want to be \"soiled\" by the lard in the moment prior to dying. The idea has been suggested more recently as a deterrent to suicide bombings in Israel.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/57793\n | title = Swine: Secret Weapon Against Islamic Terror?\n | date = December 9, 2007\n | journal = ArutzSheva\n}}</ref> However, the actual effectiveness of this tactic is probably limited as it is possible that a sympathetic Islamic scholar could issue a [[fatwa]] proclaiming that a suicide bomber would not be polluted by the swine products.\n\n=== Command and control ===\nIn North America and other continents, for a threatened or completed terrorist attack, the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is apt to be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response. ICS has varied levels of escalation, such as might be needed for multiple incidents in a given area (<!-- This bracket is unbalanced! Please correct.-->e.g., [[Attacks on the London Underground#2005 terrorist bomb attacks|the 2005 bombings in London]] or the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], or all the way to a [[National Response Plan]] invocation if national-level resources are needed. National response, for example, might be needed for a nuclear, biological, radiological, or large chemical attack.\n\n=== Damage mitigation ===\n[[Fire department]]s, perhaps supplemented by public works agencies, utility providers (e.g., gas, water, electricity), and heavy construction contractors, are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack.\n\n=== Local security ===\nAgain under an incident command model, local police can isolate the incident area, reducing confusion, and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists, often using [[#Counter-terrorism tactical units|specialized counter-terrorist tactical units]].  Bringing in such units will normally involve civil or military authority beyond the local level.\n\n=== Medical services ===\n[[Emergency medical services]] will triage, treat, and transport the more seriously affected victims to hospitals, which will also need to have mass casualty and [[triage]] plans in place.\n\n[[Public health surveillance|Public health agencies]], from local to national level, may be designated to deal with identification, and sometimes mitigation, of possible biological attacks, and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination.\n\n== Tactical units ==\n[[File:UTK PGK broke the door.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Malaysia Police]] ''Pasukan Gerakan Khas'' officers]]\n\nToday, many countries have [[List of special police units|special units]] designated to handle terrorist threats. Besides various [[security agency|security agencies]], there are [[Special Weapons And Tactics|elite tactical units]], also known as [[Special Mission Unit|special mission units]], whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks.\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:NSG Air Assault Mumbai Attacks.jpg|left|thumb|224x224px|[[National Security Guard|NSG]] commandos launching their assault on terrorist occupied [[Nariman House]] during the [[2008 Mumbai Attacks]]]] -->\nSuch units perform both in preventive actions, [[hostage rescue]] and responding to on-going attacks. Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counter-terrorist teams. Tactics, techniques and procedures for [[Manhunt (military)|manhunting]] are under constant development.\n\nMost of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area, or threaten to do so. It is far harder to deal with assassination, or even reprisals on individuals, due to the short (if any) warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author       = Stathis N.

See [[Counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism organizations]] for national command, intelligence, and incident mitigation.\n\nThe majority of counter-terrorism operations at the tactical level, are conducted by state, federal and national [[police|law enforcement agencies]] or [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]].

In this environment, the development of a persistent Anti-terrorism protection system is a daunting task. Such a system should bring together diverse state-of-the-art technologies to enable persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and enable potential actions. Designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project.\n\nA particular design problem for this system is that it will face many [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the future. The threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more. A potential solution is to incorporate [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as [[uncertainty]] unfolds and updated information arrives. And the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario, but an array of scenarios. Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available. Using these '[[real options]]' will create a flexible Anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01160.x| title = Reducing Risk Through Real Options in Systems Design: The Case of Architecting a Maritime Domain Protection System| year = 2009| last1 = Buurman | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = S. | last3 = Babovic | first3 = V. | journal = Risk Analysis| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 366\u2013379 | pmid = 19076327}}</ref>\n\n=== Law enforcement/Police ===\nWhile some countries with longstanding terrorism problems, such as Israel, have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks,<ref>Juergensmeyer, Mark (2000).

Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena,<ref>Kilburn Jr., John C. and Costanza, S.E.  2009  \"Immigration and Homeland Security\"  published in Battleground: Immigration (Ed: Judith Ann Warner); Greenwood Publishing, Ca.</ref> measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security. Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas in a way that is accessible.\n\n[[File:V\u00e9hicule intervention GIGN.JPG|thumb|Assault car of the French [[GIGN]].]]\n\n=== International Counter-Terrorism Agencies ===\n[[File:SEK-Einsatz vom Schlauchboot (10584688934).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spezialeinsatzkommando|SEK]] members of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (Germany) during an exercise]]\n+ indicates military organization allowed to operate domestically.\n* {{flag|Albania}}: [[RENEA]]\n* {{flag|Algeria}}: [[Special Intervention Group|GIS]], {{ill|D\u00e9tachement sp\u00e9cial d'intervention|lt=DSI|fr}}, [[GOSP]].\n* {{flag|Argentina}}: GEOF (Special Group of Federal Operations, Federal Arg Police) Falcon Commando (Comando Halcon, State Buenos Aires Police)\n* {{flag|Australia}}: State and [[Australian Federal Police]], [[Police Tactical Group]]s, [[Special Air Service Regiment|Tactical Assault Group]] (TAG East & TAG West), and [[Australian Security and Intelligence Organization]] (ASIO)\n* {{flag|Austria}}: [[EKO Cobra]];

Instead the counter-terrorism function is an element of the role, allowing flexibility in their employment, with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context.\n\nIn some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena; [[United States Department of Defense]] policy, based on the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], forbids domestic counter-terrorism operations by the U.S. military. Units allocated some operational counter-terrorism task are frequently [[Special Forces]] or similar assets.\n\nIn cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. such as the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]], the British police formally turned responsibility over to the [[Special Air Service]] when the situation went beyond police capabilities.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Counterterrorism Handbook}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Civilian casualty ratio]]\n* [[Counterinsurgency]]\n* [[Counter-IED efforts]]\n* [[Counterjihad]]\n* [[Deradicalization]]\n* [[Explosive detection]]\n* [[Extrajudicial execution]]\n* [[Extraordinary rendition]]\n* [[Fatwa on Terrorism]]\n* [[Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism]]\n* [[Informant]]\n* [[International counter-terrorism operations of Russia]]\n* [[Irregular warfare]]\n* [[Manhunt (law enforcement)]]\n* [[Manhunt (military)]]\n* [[Preventive State]]\n* [[Security increase]]\n* [[Sociology of terrorism]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]], Central Intelligence Agency\n* [[Targeted killing]]\n* [[Terrorism Research Center]]\n* [[War amongst the people]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Ariel Merari, \"Terrorism as a Strategy in Insurgency,\" ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Vol. 5, No. 4 (Winter 1993), pp.&nbsp;213\u2013251.\n* Edwin Bakker, Tinka Veldhuis, [http://www.icct.nl/news/a-fear-management-approach-to-counter-terrorism ''A Fear Management Approach to Counter-Terrorism'' (International Centre for Counter-Terrorism \u2013 The Hague, 2012)]\n* J.M.

The [[Prevention of Violence Act 1939]] was brought in response to an Irish Republican Army (IRA) campaign of violence under the [[S-Plan]]. This act had been allowed to expire in 1953 and was repealed in 1973 to be replaced by the [[Prevention of Terrorism Acts]] a response to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. From 1974 to 1989 the temporary provisions of the act were renewed annually.\n* In 2000 the Acts were replaced with the more permanent [[Terrorism Act 2000]], which contained many of their powers, and then the [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]].\n* The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] was formally introduced into the Parliament November 19, 2001 two months after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the United States. It received royal assent and went into force on December 13, 2001. On December 16, 2004 the Law Lords ruled that Part 4 was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but under the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] it remained in force. The [[Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005]] was drafted to answer the Law Lords ruling and the [[Terrorism Act 2006]] creates new offences related to terrorism, and amends existing ones. The Act was drafted in the aftermath of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], and like its predecessors some of its terms have proven to be highly controversial.\n\nSince 1978 the UK's terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared [[Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation]], whose often influential reports are submitted to Parliament and published in full.\n;{{US}}\n* U.S. legal issues surrounding this issue include rulings on the domestic employment of [[deadly force]] by law enforcement organizations.\n* Search and seizure is governed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].\n* The U.S. passed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] after the September 11 attacks, as well as a range of other legislation and [[executive orders]] relating to national security.\n* The [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] was established to consolidate domestic security agencies to coordinate anti-terrorism, as well as national response to major natural disasters and accidents.\n* The [[Posse Comitatus Act]] limits domestic employment of the [[United States Army]] and the [[United States Air Force]], requiring Presidential approval prior to deploying the Army and/or the Air Force. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] policy also applies this limitation to the [[United States Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Navy]], because the Posse Comitatus Act does not cover naval services, even though they are federal military forces. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] can be employed domestically on Presidential order, as was done during the [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the [[Beltway Sniper]] incidents.\n* External or international use of lethal force would require a [[Presidential finding]].\n* In February 2017, sources claimed that the Trump administration intends to rename and revamp the U.S. government program [[Countering Violent Extremism Task Force|Countering Violent Extremism]] (CVE) to solely focus on Islamist extremism.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources], Reuters 2017-02-02</ref>\n\n; {{AUS}}\n* Australia has passed several anti-terrorism acts. In 2004, a bill comprising three acts [[Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004|Anti-terrorism Act, 2004, (No 2) and (No 3)]] was passed. Then Attorney-General, [[Philip Ruddock]], introduced the ''Anti-terrorism bill, 2004'' on March 31. He described it as ''\"a bill to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism laws in a number of respects&nbsp;\u2013 a task made more urgent following the recent tragic [[11 March 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombings in Spain]].\"'' He said that Australia's counter-terrorism laws \"require review and, where necessary, updating if we are to have a legal framework capable of safeguarding all Australians from the scourge of terrorism.\" The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]] supplemented the powers of the earlier acts. The Australian legislation allows police to detain suspects for up to two weeks without charge and to electronically track suspects for up to a year. The [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005#The \"Shoot to Kill\" Clause|Australian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2005]] included a \"shoot-to-kill\" clause.

Any successful strategy for dealing with terrorism requires terrorists to be isolated. Consequently, the preference must be to treat terrorism as criminal acts to be handled through existing systems of law enforcement and with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We recommend: (1) taking effective measures to make impunity impossible either for acts of terrorism or for the abuse of human rights in counter-terrorism measures. (2) the incorporation of human rights laws in all anti-terrorism programmes and policies of national governments as well as international bodies.\"<ref name=\"Amnesty International 2005\">Amnesty International (2005): \"Counter-terrorism and criminal law in the EU.

They argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the international effort to cooperate to combat terrorism.<ref name=\"Human Rights News 2004\">Human Rights News (2004): \"Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism\", in the Briefing to the 60th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.

This includes capturing, killing, or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack. [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Russia]] have taken this approach, while Western European states generally do not.\n\nAnother major method of preemptive neutralization is [[interrogation]] of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots, targets, the identity of other terrorists, whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement. Sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase [[suggestibility]], such as [[sleep deprivation]] or drugs. Such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment, or due to the confusion brought on by it. These methods are not tolerated by European powers. In 1978 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled in the [[Ireland v. United Kingdom (1978)|Ireland v. United Kingdom]] case that [[five techniques|such methods]] amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, and that such practices were in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] Article 3 (art. 3).\n\n==== Non-military ====\nThe [[human security]] paradigm outlines a non-military approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity. Causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and [[sustainability]] for all people. Such activities empower citizens providing 'freedom from fear' and 'freedom from want'.\n\nThis can take many forms including the provision of clean drinking water, education, vaccination programs, provision of food and shelter and protection from violence, military or otherwise. Successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors including governments, [[NGOs]], and citizens.\n\n[[Foreign internal defense]] programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government. FID can involve both non-military and military aspects of counter-terrorism.\n\nA 2017 study found that \"governance and civil society aid is effective in dampening domestic terrorism, but this effect is only present if the recipient country is not experiencing a civil conflict.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Foreign Aid as a Counterterrorism Tool - Burcu Savun, Daniel C.

[[Iron Dome]] has successfully intercepted hundreds of [[Qassam rocket]]s and [[Grad rocket]]s fired by Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.\n\nA more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked. Terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the [[Bhopal disaster]] or the [[Halifax Explosion]]. Industrial chemicals in manufacturing, shipping, and storage need greater protection, and some efforts are in progress.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64224-2005Jan10.html\n | title = D.C.

A small number of terrorists, attacking key power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers, could wreak havoc.\n\nEquipping likely targets with containers (i.e., bags) of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by suicide bombers.

The idea has been suggested more recently as a deterrent to suicide bombings in Israel.<ref>{{cite journal\n | url = http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/57793\n | title = Swine: Secret Weapon Against Islamic Terror?\n | date = December 9, 2007\n | journal = ArutzSheva\n}}</ref> However, the actual effectiveness of this tactic is probably limited as it is possible that a sympathetic Islamic scholar could issue a [[fatwa]] proclaiming that a suicide bomber would not be polluted by the swine products.\n\n=== Command and control ===\nIn North America and other continents, for a threatened or completed terrorist attack, the [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is apt to be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response. ICS has varied levels of escalation, such as might be needed for multiple incidents in a given area (<!-- This bracket is unbalanced! Please correct.-->e.g., [[Attacks on the London Underground#2005 terrorist bomb attacks|the 2005 bombings in London]] or the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], or all the way to a [[National Response Plan]] invocation if national-level resources are needed. National response, for example, might be needed for a nuclear, biological, radiological, or large chemical attack.\n\n=== Damage mitigation ===\n[[Fire department]]s, perhaps supplemented by public works agencies, utility providers (e.g., gas, water, electricity), and heavy construction contractors, are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack.\n\n=== Local security ===\nAgain under an incident command model, local police can isolate the incident area, reducing confusion, and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists, often using [[#Counter-terrorism tactical units|specialized counter-terrorist tactical units]].  Bringing in such units will normally involve civil or military authority beyond the local level.\n\n=== Medical services ===\n[[Emergency medical services]] will triage, treat, and transport the more seriously affected victims to hospitals, which will also need to have mass casualty and [[triage]] plans in place.\n\n[[Public health surveillance|Public health agencies]], from local to national level, may be designated to deal with identification, and sometimes mitigation, of possible biological attacks, and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination.\n\n== Tactical units ==\n[[File:UTK PGK broke the door.JPG|thumb|[[Royal Malaysia Police]] ''Pasukan Gerakan Khas'' officers]]\n\nToday, many countries have [[List of special police units|special units]] designated to handle terrorist threats. Besides various [[security agency|security agencies]], there are [[Special Weapons And Tactics|elite tactical units]], also known as [[Special Mission Unit|special mission units]], whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks.\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:NSG Air Assault Mumbai Attacks.jpg|left|thumb|224x224px|[[National Security Guard|NSG]] commandos launching their assault on terrorist occupied [[Nariman House]] during the [[2008 Mumbai Attacks]]]] -->\nSuch units perform both in preventive actions, [[hostage rescue]] and responding to on-going attacks. Countries of all sizes can have highly trained counter-terrorist teams. Tactics, techniques and procedures for [[Manhunt (military)|manhunting]] are under constant development.\n\nMost of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area, or threaten to do so. It is far harder to deal with assassination, or even reprisals on individuals, due to the short (if any) warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author       = Stathis N.

In this environment, the development of a persistent Anti-terrorism protection system is a daunting task. Such a system should bring together diverse state-of-the-art technologies to enable persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and enable potential actions. Designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project.\n\nA particular design problem for this system is that it will face many [[Uncertainty|uncertainties]] in the future. The threat of terrorism may increase, decrease or remain the same, the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict, and there are technological uncertainties. Yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more. A potential solution is to incorporate [[Flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as [[uncertainty]] unfolds and updated information arrives. And the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario, but an array of scenarios. Flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available. Using these '[[real options]]' will create a flexible Anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1539-6924.2008.01160.x| title = Reducing Risk Through Real Options in Systems Design: The Case of Architecting a Maritime Domain Protection System| year = 2009| last1 = Buurman | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = S. | last3 = Babovic | first3 = V. | journal = Risk Analysis| volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 366\u2013379 | pmid = 19076327}}</ref>\n\n=== Law enforcement/Police ===\nWhile some countries with longstanding terrorism problems, such as Israel, have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks,<ref>Juergensmeyer, Mark (2000).

Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena,<ref>Kilburn Jr., John C. and Costanza, S.E.  2009  \"Immigration and Homeland Security\"  published in Battleground: Immigration (Ed: Judith Ann Warner); Greenwood Publishing, Ca.</ref> measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness. Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security. Both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists, and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas in a way that is accessible.\n\n[[File:V\u00e9hicule intervention GIGN.JPG|thumb|Assault car of the French [[GIGN]].]]\n\n=== International Counter-Terrorism Agencies ===\n[[File:SEK-Einsatz vom Schlauchboot (10584688934).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spezialeinsatzkommando|SEK]] members of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (Germany) during an exercise]]\n+ indicates military organization allowed to operate domestically.\n* {{flag|Albania}}: [[RENEA]]\n* {{flag|Algeria}}: [[Special Intervention Group|GIS]], {{ill|D\u00e9tachement sp\u00e9cial d'intervention|lt=DSI|fr}}, [[GOSP]].\n* {{flag|Argentina}}: GEOF (Special Group of Federal Operations, Federal Arg Police) Falcon Commando (Comando Halcon, State Buenos Aires Police)\n* {{flag|Australia}}: State and [[Australian Federal Police]], [[Police Tactical Group]]s, [[Special Air Service Regiment|Tactical Assault Group]] (TAG East & TAG West), and [[Australian Security and Intelligence Organization]] (ASIO)\n* {{flag|Austria}}: [[EKO Cobra]];

Instead the counter-terrorism function is an element of the role, allowing flexibility in their employment, with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context.\n\nIn some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena; [[United States Department of Defense]] policy, based on the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], forbids domestic counter-terrorism operations by the U.S. military. Units allocated some operational counter-terrorism task are frequently [[Special Forces]] or similar assets.\n\nIn cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required, to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations. such as the [[Iranian Embassy Siege]], the British police formally turned responsibility over to the [[Special Air Service]] when the situation went beyond police capabilities.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Counterterrorism Handbook}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Civilian casualty ratio]]\n* [[Counterinsurgency]]\n* [[Counter-IED efforts]]\n* [[Counterjihad]]\n* [[Deradicalization]]\n* [[Explosive detection]]\n* [[Extrajudicial execution]]\n* [[Extraordinary rendition]]\n* [[Fatwa on Terrorism]]\n* [[Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism]]\n* [[Informant]]\n* [[International counter-terrorism operations of Russia]]\n* [[Irregular warfare]]\n* [[Manhunt (law enforcement)]]\n* [[Manhunt (military)]]\n* [[Preventive State]]\n* [[Security increase]]\n* [[Sociology of terrorism]]\n* [[Special Activities Division]], Central Intelligence Agency\n* [[Targeted killing]]\n* [[Terrorism Research Center]]\n* [[War amongst the people]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Ariel Merari, \"Terrorism as a Strategy in Insurgency,\" ''Terrorism and Political Violence'', Vol. 5, No. 4 (Winter 1993), pp.&nbsp;213\u2013251.\n* Edwin Bakker, Tinka Veldhuis, [http://www.icct.nl/news/a-fear-management-approach-to-counter-terrorism ''A Fear Management Approach to Counter-Terrorism'' (International Centre for Counter-Terrorism \u2013 The Hague, 2012)]\n* J.M.
