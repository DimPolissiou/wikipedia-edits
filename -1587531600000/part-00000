Lorelai has a strained relationship with her wealthy parents, [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]], after running away as a teen to raise her daughter on her own. Lorelai remains estranged from her parents for many years, until the events of the pilot episode, where she asks her parents for help with paying Rory's tuition. Her parents agree, on the condition that she visits them for dinner every Friday.\n\nBesides an on-again, off-again relationship with Rory's father, Christopher Hayden, Lorelai had a few romantic relationships that included [[Max Medina]] ([[Scott Cohen (actor)|Scott Cohen]]), a teacher at Chilton to whom she was briefly engaged; Alex Lesman ([[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]]), an outdoorsy coffee house entrepreneur; [[Jason Stiles (Gilmore Girls)|Jason Stiles]] ([[Chris Eigeman]]), a childhood acquaintance, and [[Luke Danes]] ([[Scott Patterson]]), the owner of Luke's Diner in Stars Hollow, who she bonded with throughout the run of the show. As she frequented Luke's Diner, they grew to be close friends and eventually fell in love. Luke and Lorelai marry in the [[Netflix]] revival miniseries ''[[Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life|A Year in the Life]]''. Lorelai is often included on lists of \"top TV moms\".\n\nGraham received widespread critical acclaim for her performance as Lorelai, and was nominated for several awards. She was nominated for two [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s in 2000 and 2001, and a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 2001. Graham also won two [[Teen Choice Awards]] for her role.\n\n==Arc==\n\n===Background===\nLorelai Victoria Gilmore was born to Richard and Emily Gilmore on April 25, 1968. Named after her grandmother, Lorelai was raised in Hartford, Connecticut by wealthy parents who attempted to bring her up to be a proper young lady of society, go to an [[Ivy League]] college, marry a man with wealth and good-breeding. Her life growing up was complicated due to putting up with an overbearing, neurotic mother and a workaholic father, who both expected Lorelai to live in their world of privilege. \n\n\nAs a teenager, she discovered she was pregnant with her boyfriend Christopher's baby at the age of 16. This greatly embarrassed and disappointed her parents as well as the parents of Christopher, Straub and Francine Hayden. Straub Hayden initially suggested for Lorelai to have an abortion, however Emily would not allow this, and Richard suggested that Lorelai and Christopher should marry instead. Christopher agreed, but Lorelai refused, convinced that marrying so young simply wouldn't work out. When Lorelai realized she was in labor, she left a note for her parents and drove alone to the hospital.<ref name=\"Dear Emily and Richard\">{{cite episode | title = \"Dear Emily and Richard\"| url = http://www.tv.com/gilmore-girls/dear-emily-and-richard/episode/217932/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;12 | series = Gilmore Girls | serieslink = Gilmore Girls | airdate = 2003-02-07| season = 3| number = 13}}</ref> After her daughter, [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], was born on October 8, 1984, Lorelai briefly lived with her parents then ran away to [[Stars Hollow]], a small town in rural Connecticut, to find her own life. The owner of the Independence Inn, Mia, gave her a job as a maid, and let her and Rory live in the back in a renovated potting shed. The Independence Inn is where she met her best friend, Sookie St. James, who was executive chef at the Independence Inn. Lorelai worked her way up over the years, and was eventually promoted to executive manager, which is her job as the show opens. For many years after running away from home, Lorelai had almost no contact with her parents, except for visits during major holidays.\n\n===Storylines===\nWhen the series starts, Rory gets accepted into Chilton Preparatory School, a private and expensive high school. In order to pay the attendance fees, Lorelai goes as a last choice to Emily and Richard who agree to loan the money. In exchange for paying for Rory's tutition at Chilton, Emily and Richard instate mandatory \"Friday night dinners\" to which Lorelai reluctantly agrees, which allows them to get to know their granddaughter.<ref name=\"Pilot\">{{cite episode | title = \"Pilot\"| url = http://www.tv.com/gilmore-girls/pilot/episode/2800/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;0 | series = Gilmore Girls | serieslink = Gilmore Girls | airdate = 2000-10-05| season = 1| number = 1}}</ref> Lorelai meets Rory's teacher [[Max Medina]] ([[Scott Cohen (actor)|Scott Cohen]]) at Rory's first parent-teacher meeting in Chilton. They both become interested in one another and soon start seeing each other. When Lorelai wants to split as it becomes too serious, she kisses Max in Chilton, which provokes a scandal in the school and puts an end to their relationship. While they are separate, Lorelai has a one-night stand with Christopher ([[David Sutcliffe]]) after a heated argument with her parents. Christopher proposes to her, but she rejects him telling him he is not ready to take care of Rory and her. Lorelai later rekindles her relationship with Max and they become engaged. As their wedding is approaching, Lorelai has second thoughts and calls Christopher during her bachelorette party. Suddenly, Lorelai decides to go on a road-trip with Rory during which they will visit [[Harvard University]] and calls off the wedding.\n\nChristopher comes back to town for Rory's debutante ball. During the evening, Lorelai and Christopher share a kiss as she finds him changed, but he tells her he is now in a serious relationship with a woman named Sherrie. Afterward, Lorelai and Sookie make plans about opening their Inn, but the building they want, Fran Weston's inn 'the Dragonfly', is not for sale. When [[Luke Danes]] ([[Scott Patterson]])'s nephew [[Jess Mariano]] ([[Milo Ventimiglia]]) and Rory get into a car accident, Lorelai blames Jess which leads to a serious argument between Luke and Lorelai. They reconcile only months later. Christopher returns to Stars Hollow and after he tells Lorelai he has problems in his relationship with Sherrie, they spend the night together before Sookie's wedding. They are both now ready to commit, but when Christopher learns Sherrie is pregnant, he leaves Lorelai and returns to Sherrie. In the third season, Lorelai then meets Alex Lesman ([[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]]) at a lecture about inns and they begin dating. While she is on her way to the Friday night dinner, Lorelai comes across Max and they catch up. They again run into each other at Chilton's bicentennial and share a kiss. After several days, the two meet at a Chilton's parent committee evening and Max makes it clear he does not want them to reunite. On Lorelai's birthday, Richard gives her payout from an investment he had made at her birth, however she decides to repay her parents for the loan, which shocks Emily. Fran dies which gives the possibility to Lorelai and Sookie to buy the Dragonfly. The Independence Inn closes and Lorelai plans on using the money aimed for the Dragonfly to pay for [[Yale University]]'s fees. However, Rory asks her grandparents for their financial help, reinstating in return the Friday night dinners. Lorelai and Sookie decide to buy the Dragonfly on Rory's graduation day.\n\nIn the fourth season, Luke gets married to lawyer Nicole on a cruise but they soon divorce and Lorelai and Sookie begin the renovations of the inn. Richard forms a new partnership with his former associate's son, [[Jason Stiles (Gilmore Girls)|Jason Stiles]] ([[Chris Eigeman]]) who happens to be an old camp friend of Lorelai. After he has a disagreement with Emily about Richard's new business launch party, Lorelai furious goes to talk to him and at the end of their discussion he invites her to dinner but she refuses. Later on, Jason succeeds into getting invited by Emily to a Friday night dinner and he and Lorelai get closer. She eventually accepts his invitation to dinner and start seeing each other without telling her parents. As she is running out of money to renovate the inn, Lorelai asks Luke's help who offers her a loan. When Emily organizes a dinner with Jason's parents, Jason's father Floyd announces he is going to sue his son and Richard because they have taken his clients. Floyd also tells Lorelai's parents about her relationship with his son, which shocks Emily. In the fallout of Floyd's announcement, Richard decides to associate with Floyd jeopardizing Jason's career. When the former tells her he will sue her father, Lorelai breaks up with him. Luke whose marriage to lawyer Nicole failed, finally realizes the woman he truly loves is Lorelai. She serves as a date for his sister's wedding and sees him under a new light. At the end of the evening he tells her they should spend more time together. Lorelai and Sookie open their inn and after a misunderstanding about Jason, Luke and Lorelai finally kiss for the first time.\n\nIn the fifth season, Lorelai embarks on a relationship with Luke and after she discovers Rory has lost her virginity to married Dean, who was her first love and former boyfriend. Dean had married another girl, after breaking up with Rory. This entanglement with a married man strains Rory and Lorelai's mother-daughter relationship. Eventually Rory apologizes. Christopher panicking over Sherrie's departure to Paris, leaving him alone with their baby, calls Lorelai for help. Rory later tells Christopher to leave her mother alone. After no news following her visit to his house, she invites Christopher to the inn with Rory and notices the tension between them. Luke also worries when he learns about the dinner. When Christopher's father dies, Lorelai and Rory go at his house to support him. However, Lorelai does not mention her visit to Luke. Emily tells Christopher that the relationship between Lorelai and Luke is getting serious and that he should do something if he wants to end up with Lorelai. At Richard and Emily's wedding renewal ceremony, Lorelai finally admits to Luke her visit to Christopher when she notices his presence. Christopher tells Luke that his relationship with Lorelai won't last because he is destined to be with Lorelai. This leads to Luke breaking up with Lorelai but they later reunite. Lorelai, however, remains furious at Emily for some time and eventually forgives her. Lorelai is worried about Rory's relationship with [[Logan Huntzberger]] ([[Matt Czuchry]]) and his family's influence on her. At the conclusion of the season, they steal a yacht and end up at the police station. Rory decides to take a year off from Yale which upsets Lorelai and when her parents, who initially agreed to help, change their mind and permit Rory to move in with them, prompts Lorelai to propose to Luke.\n\nIn the sixth season, Lorelai and Rory do not talk for months while Luke agrees to marry Lorelai and they renovate her house. When Luke reveals he cannot trust Lorelai after she has received a message from Christopher, the two fight. Lorelai and Rory finally reconcile and she decides to return to Yale. Luke learns he has a daughter but does not tell Lorelai. Lorelai later finds out about Luke's daughter and they decide to postpone the wedding. When Christopher receives an inheritance, he starts to pay for Yale and the Friday night dinners aren't so mandatory anymore. After posing an ultimatum to Luke which leads to their break-up, Lorelai finds comfort in Christopher and they start dating again.\n\nIn the final season of the original series, Lorelai and Christopher jet off to Paris, where they impulsively get married. When Lorelai returns home and informs Rory and the rest of Stars Hollow, including Luke that she and Christopher are married she gets mixed reactions. Rory is upset at first, but comes around since she all she really wants is her mom (and for that matter her dad) to be happy. Throughout the season, Christopher and Lorelai face some significant problems, the biggest one is when Lorelai needs to write a character reference for Luke so he can partial custody of his daughter, April. Christopher finds a draft of the letter and when reading it, he realizes that Lorelai still loves Luke. Lorelai tries to deny it, but the both soon realize that they're better off as friends. In the end, Lorelai reunites with Luke. She realizes how much she loves Luke when she finds out that he was the one who planned Rory's goodbye party for the entire town. Lorelai realizes that Luke has been there for her from the beginning and loves her and her daughter. In one of the final scenes of the show, Lorelai and Luke share a passionate kiss.\n\nIn 2016 Netflix revival of the show, Lorelai is still with Luke. They are living together in her home, he still runs the diner and she still owns her inn, but they have not married (at this point). Throughout the four episodes, Lorelai goes through a lot, especially with her relationship with her mother. Lorelai and Emily always had a strained relationship yet over the years it had gotten better. In the revival, the two go to family therapy. Lorelai also goes on her own version of \"Wild\" where she tries to find herself. When she returns, she realizes her life is with Luke in Stars Hollow and she's happy. The show ends with Lorelai and Luke's wedding in the center of Stars Hollow at dawn with some of her closest friends, Michel, Lane, Kirk and Rory.\n\nIn the very last scene of the show, Lorelai sits with Rory as they reflect on 'it all'. Suddenly, Rory turns to her mother and tells her she is pregnant.\n\n==Character development==\n\n===Casting===\n{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=\"She had to have everything.

Also, the character is narcissistic and at times emotionally unstable, with strains of sociopathy. She talks fast and uses words to keep her \"loneliness at bay\" which, while opinion, seems to be a relatively insightful view of her.

[...] Lorelai's downfall is her intense, overwhelming self-absorption. She's chronically rude to people in the service industry, and she is always in the market for special treatment. She is not a good friend to Sookie, even though she thinks she is; she kinda, sorta takes advantage of Sookie's pleaser tendencies and frequently ignores, minimizes, or dismisses Sookie's ideas and problems. Her self-absorption erodes any opportunity for self-awareness. She likes to refer to her \"emotional baggage,\" but she assiduously avoids doing anything about it.

Portrayed by actress [[Lauren Graham]], she appeared in every episode of the show from the [[Pilot (Gilmore Girls)|pilot]] in 2000 to the [[Bon Voyage (Gilmore Girls)|series finale]] in 2007.\n\nLorelai is introduced as a young single mother of a teenage daughter, [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]]. Lorelai has a strained relationship with her wealthy parents, [[Richard Gilmore|Richard]] and [[Emily Gilmore|Emily]], after running away as a teen to raise her daughter on her own. Lorelai remains estranged from her parents for many years, until the events of the pilot episode, where she asks her parents for help with paying Rory's tuition. Her parents agree, on the condition that she visits them for dinner every Friday.\n\nBesides an on-again, off-again relationship with Rory's father, Christopher Hayden, Lorelai had a few romantic relationships that included [[Max Medina]] ([[Scott Cohen (actor)|Scott Cohen]]), a teacher at Chilton to whom she was briefly engaged; Alex Lesman ([[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]]), an outdoorsy coffee house entrepreneur; [[Jason Stiles (Gilmore Girls)|Jason Stiles]] ([[Chris Eigeman]]), a childhood acquaintance, and [[Luke Danes]] ([[Scott Patterson]]), the owner of Luke's Diner in Stars Hollow, who she bonded with throughout the run of the show. As she frequented Luke's Diner, they grew to be close friends and eventually fell in love. Luke and Lorelai marry in the [[Netflix]] revival miniseries ''[[Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life|A Year in the Life]]''. Lorelai is often included on lists of \"top TV moms\".\n\nGraham received widespread critical acclaim for her performance as Lorelai, and was nominated for several awards. She was nominated for two [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s in 2000 and 2001, and a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 2001. Graham also won two [[Teen Choice Awards]] for her role.\n\n==Arc==\n\n===Background===\nLorelai Victoria Gilmore was born to Richard and Emily Gilmore on April 25, 1968. Named after her grandmother, Lorelai was raised in Hartford, Connecticut by wealthy parents who attempted to bring her up to be a proper young lady of society, go to an [[Ivy League]] college, marry a man with wealth and good-breeding. Her life growing up was complicated due to putting up with an overbearing, neurotic mother and a workaholic father, who both expected Lorelai to live in their world of privilege. \n\n\nAs a teenager, she discovered she was pregnant with her boyfriend Christopher's baby at the age of 16. This greatly embarrassed and disappointed her parents as well as the parents of Christopher, Straub and Francine Hayden. Straub Hayden initially suggested for Lorelai to have an abortion, however Emily would not allow this, and Richard suggested that Lorelai and Christopher should marry instead. Christopher agreed, but Lorelai refused, convinced that marrying so young simply wouldn't work out. When Lorelai realized she was in labor, she left a note for her parents and drove alone to the hospital.<ref name=\"Dear Emily and Richard\">{{cite episode | title = \"Dear Emily and Richard\"| url = http://www.tv.com/gilmore-girls/dear-emily-and-richard/episode/217932/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;12 | series = Gilmore Girls | serieslink = Gilmore Girls | airdate = 2003-02-07| season = 3| number = 13}}</ref> After her daughter, [[Rory Gilmore|Rory]], was born on October 8, 1984, Lorelai briefly lived with her parents then ran away to [[Stars Hollow]], a small town in rural Connecticut, to find her own life. The owner of the Independence Inn, Mia, gave her a job as a maid, and let her and Rory live in the back in a renovated potting shed. The Independence Inn is where she met her best friend, Sookie St. James, who was executive chef at the Independence Inn. Lorelai worked her way up over the years, and was eventually promoted to executive manager, which is her job as the show opens. For many years after running away from home, Lorelai had almost no contact with her parents, except for visits during major holidays.\n\n===Storylines===\nWhen the series starts, Rory gets accepted into Chilton Preparatory School, a private and expensive high school. In order to pay the attendance fees, Lorelai goes as a last choice to Emily and Richard who agree to loan the money. In exchange for paying for Rory's tutition at Chilton, Emily and Richard instate mandatory \"Friday night dinners\" to which Lorelai reluctantly agrees, which allows them to get to know their granddaughter.<ref name=\"Pilot\">{{cite episode | title = \"Pilot\"| url = http://www.tv.com/gilmore-girls/pilot/episode/2800/summary.html?tag=ep_list;ep_title;0 | series = Gilmore Girls | serieslink = Gilmore Girls | airdate = 2000-10-05| season = 1| number = 1}}</ref> Lorelai meets Rory's teacher [[Max Medina]] ([[Scott Cohen (actor)|Scott Cohen]]) at Rory's first parent-teacher meeting in Chilton. They both become interested in one another and soon start seeing each other. When Lorelai wants to split as it becomes too serious, she kisses Max in Chilton, which provokes a scandal in the school and puts an end to their relationship. While they are separate, Lorelai has a one-night stand with Christopher ([[David Sutcliffe]]) after a heated argument with her parents. Christopher proposes to her, but she rejects him telling him he is not ready to take care of Rory and her. Lorelai later rekindles her relationship with Max and they become engaged. As their wedding is approaching, Lorelai has second thoughts and calls Christopher during her bachelorette party. Suddenly, Lorelai decides to go on a road-trip with Rory during which they will visit [[Harvard University]] and calls off the wedding.\n\nChristopher comes back to town for Rory's debutante ball. During the evening, Lorelai and Christopher share a kiss as she finds him changed, but he tells her he is now in a serious relationship with a woman named Sherrie. Afterward, Lorelai and Sookie make plans about opening their Inn, but the building they want, Fran Weston's inn 'the Dragonfly', is not for sale. When [[Luke Danes]] ([[Scott Patterson]])'s nephew [[Jess Mariano]] ([[Milo Ventimiglia]]) and Rory get into a car accident, Lorelai blames Jess which leads to a serious argument between Luke and Lorelai. They reconcile only months later. Christopher returns to Stars Hollow and after he tells Lorelai he has problems in his relationship with Sherrie, they spend the night together before Sookie's wedding. They are both now ready to commit, but when Christopher learns Sherrie is pregnant, he leaves Lorelai and returns to Sherrie. In the third season, Lorelai then meets Alex Lesman ([[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]]) at a lecture about inns and they begin dating. While she is on her way to the Friday night dinner, Lorelai comes across Max and they catch up. They again run into each other at Chilton's bicentennial and share a kiss. After several days, the two meet at a Chilton's parent committee evening and Max makes it clear he does not want them to reunite. On Lorelai's birthday, Richard gives her payout from an investment he had made at her birth, however she decides to repay her parents for the loan, which shocks Emily. Fran dies which gives the possibility to Lorelai and Sookie to buy the Dragonfly. The Independence Inn closes and Lorelai plans on using the money aimed for the Dragonfly to pay for [[Yale University]]'s fees. However, Rory asks her grandparents for their financial help, reinstating in return the Friday night dinners. Lorelai and Sookie decide to buy the Dragonfly on Rory's graduation day.\n\nIn the fourth season, Luke gets married to lawyer Nicole on a cruise but they soon divorce and Lorelai and Sookie begin the renovations of the inn. Richard forms a new partnership with his former associate's son, [[Jason Stiles (Gilmore Girls)|Jason Stiles]] ([[Chris Eigeman]]) who happens to be an old camp friend of Lorelai. After he has a disagreement with Emily about Richard's new business launch party, Lorelai furious goes to talk to him and at the end of their discussion he invites her to dinner but she refuses. Later on, Jason succeeds into getting invited by Emily to a Friday night dinner and he and Lorelai get closer. She eventually accepts his invitation to dinner and start seeing each other without telling her parents. As she is running out of money to renovate the inn, Lorelai asks Luke's help who offers her a loan. When Emily organizes a dinner with Jason's parents, Jason's father Floyd announces he is going to sue his son and Richard because they have taken his clients. Floyd also tells Lorelai's parents about her relationship with his son, which shocks Emily. In the fallout of Floyd's announcement, Richard decides to associate with Floyd jeopardizing Jason's career. When the former tells her he will sue her father, Lorelai breaks up with him. Luke whose marriage to lawyer Nicole failed, finally realizes the woman he truly loves is Lorelai. She serves as a date for his sister's wedding and sees him under a new light. At the end of the evening he tells her they should spend more time together. Lorelai and Sookie open their inn and after a misunderstanding about Jason, Luke and Lorelai finally kiss for the first time.\n\nIn the fifth season, Lorelai embarks on a relationship with Luke and after she discovers Rory has lost her virginity to married Dean, who was her first love and former boyfriend. Dean had married another girl, after breaking up with Rory. This entanglement with a married man strains Rory and Lorelai's mother-daughter relationship. Eventually Rory apologizes. Christopher panicking over Sherrie's departure to Paris, leaving him alone with their baby, calls Lorelai for help. Rory later tells Christopher to leave her mother alone. After no news following her visit to his house, she invites Christopher to the inn with Rory and notices the tension between them. Luke also worries when he learns about the dinner. When Christopher's father dies, Lorelai and Rory go at his house to support him. However, Lorelai does not mention her visit to Luke. Emily tells Christopher that the relationship between Lorelai and Luke is getting serious and that he should do something if he wants to end up with Lorelai. At Richard and Emily's wedding renewal ceremony, Lorelai finally admits to Luke her visit to Christopher when she notices his presence. Christopher tells Luke that his relationship with Lorelai won't last because he is destined to be with Lorelai. This leads to Luke breaking up with Lorelai but they later reunite. Lorelai, however, remains furious at Emily for some time and eventually forgives her. Lorelai is worried about Rory's relationship with [[Logan Huntzberger]] ([[Matt Czuchry]]) and his family's influence on her. At the conclusion of the season, they steal a yacht and end up at the police station. Rory decides to take a year off from Yale which upsets Lorelai and when her parents, who initially agreed to help, change their mind and permit Rory to move in with them, prompts Lorelai to propose to Luke.\n\nIn the sixth season, Lorelai and Rory do not talk for months while Luke agrees to marry Lorelai and they renovate her house. When Luke reveals he cannot trust Lorelai after she has received a message from Christopher, the two fight. Lorelai and Rory finally reconcile and she decides to return to Yale. Luke learns he has a daughter but does not tell Lorelai. Lorelai later finds out about Luke's daughter and they decide to postpone the wedding. When Christopher receives an inheritance, he starts to pay for Yale and the Friday night dinners aren't so mandatory anymore. After posing an ultimatum to Luke which leads to their break-up, Lorelai finds comfort in Christopher and they start dating again.\n\nIn the final season of the original series, Lorelai and Christopher jet off to Paris, where they impulsively get married. When Lorelai returns home and informs Rory and the rest of Stars Hollow, including Luke that she and Christopher are married she gets mixed reactions. Rory is upset at first, but comes around since she all she really wants is her mom (and for that matter her dad) to be happy. Throughout the season, Christopher and Lorelai face some significant problems, the biggest one is when Lorelai needs to write a character reference for Luke so he can partial custody of his daughter, April. Christopher finds a draft of the letter and when reading it, he realizes that Lorelai still loves Luke. Lorelai tries to deny it, but the both soon realize that they're better off as friends. In the end, Lorelai reunites with Luke. She realizes how much she loves Luke when she finds out that he was the one who planned Rory's goodbye party for the entire town. Lorelai realizes that Luke has been there for her from the beginning and loves her and her daughter. In one of the final scenes of the show, Lorelai and Luke share a passionate kiss.\n\nIn 2016 Netflix revival of the show, Lorelai is still with Luke. They are living together in her home, he still runs the diner and she still owns her inn, but they have not married (at this point). Throughout the four episodes, Lorelai goes through a lot, especially with her relationship with her mother. Lorelai and Emily always had a strained relationship yet over the years it had gotten better. In the revival, the two go to family therapy. Lorelai also goes on her own version of \"Wild\" where she tries to find herself. When she returns, she realizes her life is with Luke in Stars Hollow and she's happy. The show ends with Lorelai and Luke's wedding in the center of Stars Hollow at dawn with some of her closest friends, Michel, Lane, Kirk and Rory.\n\nIn the very last scene of the show, Lorelai sits with Rory as they reflect on 'it all'. Suddenly, Rory turns to her mother and tells her she is pregnant.\n\n==Character development==\n\n===Casting===\n{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=\"She had to have everything.

You've got to be funny, you've got to talk really fast, you've got to be able to act, you've got to be sexy, but not scary sexy. You've got to be strong, but not like 'I hate men.' It's a lot that goes into this character, and it was really a tough find.

Also, the character is narcissistic and at times emotionally unstable, with strains of sociopathy. She talks fast and uses words to keep her \"loneliness at bay\" which, while opinion, seems to be a relatively insightful view of her.

[...] Lorelai's downfall is her intense, overwhelming self-absorption. She's chronically rude to people in the service industry, and she is always in the market for special treatment. She is not a good friend to Sookie, even though she thinks she is; she kinda, sorta takes advantage of Sookie's pleaser tendencies and frequently ignores, minimizes, or dismisses Sookie's ideas and problems. Her self-absorption erodes any opportunity for self-awareness. She likes to refer to her \"emotional baggage,\" but she assiduously avoids doing anything about it.

Much to her parents horror, she is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. She drives a [[Jeep Wrangler]]. Her favorite band is [[The Bangles]].\n\n==Reception==\n[[E!

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]), and extends to the south and west.\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] Peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

County, Washington|Snohomish County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state by population, with a total of 103,019 residents at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]), and extends to the south and west.\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] Peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

The SNES and Game Boy games were released only in Europe in 1995 and the Virtual Boy game was released exclusively in North America in November 1995. It was released for PC in 1997. The game received widespread negative reviews and the version released for the Virtual Boy is generally considered to be the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst game]] of its [[List of Virtual Boy games|22 releases]].\n\n== Versions ==\n\n===Virtual Boy===\nThe game is focused around the Mariner's (the main character) [[trimaran]], which the player moves around a 3-D world, shooting enemies on [[personal water craft]]s called Smokers. It is a form of 3D [[shoot 'em up]], similar to that of the All-Range Mode in ''[[Star Fox 64]]''.\n\nThe objective is to keep the Smokers from grabbing Atollers (inhabitants of Atoll) placed around the playing field. To keep them from being captured, the player must shoot the Smokers using the L and R buttons on the Virtual Boy's controller while moving around with either of the two directional pads.\n\nLike all other Virtual Boy games, ''Waterworld'' uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses [[parallax]], an optical trick that is used to simulate a 3D effect.<ref>{{cite web |title=Backwards Compatible: The Virtual Boy |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2585841.htm |work=ABC Good Game |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2015-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821211042/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2585841.htm |archive-date=2009-08-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Multiplayer functionality was originally advertised for this version of ''Waterworld'',<ref name=\"GP88\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Waterworld|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=88 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1996|page=56}}</ref> but the Virtual Boy's link cable was never released, and multiplayer was not implemented in the final release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vr32.de/modules/interviews/?3 |title=Steve Woita \u00ab Interviews \u00ab Planet Virtual Boy |publisher=Vr32.de |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109190056/http://www.vr32.de/modules/interviews/?3|archivedate=November 9, 2007 |date=November 23, 1993 |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Super NES===\n''Waterworld'' for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] was released in 1995 in Europe by [[Ocean Software]].

The point of the game was to destroy the Smokers' boats and dive for sunken artifacts, at which point the game switches to a side on perspective so that the player can directly control the Mariner underwater.\n\n===Genesis===\nA [[Sega Genesis]] port of the Super NES version was also produced by Ocean. Planned for release in Europe in fall 1995, it was never distributed. A complete version of the game was eventually leaked on the net.\n\n===Saturn===\nThe cancelled [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was to feature a 3D virtual ocean with a dynamic surface.<ref name=\"GP88\"/> It began development in late 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=Sega Gamers' Day|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=87 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1996|page=115|quote=After spending almost two years in development, Waterworld for the Saturn is nearing completion.}}</ref>\n\n===PC===\nIn April 1995, [[Interplay Entertainment]] announced that they had garnered the rights to make a ''Waterworld'' game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-14/business/fi-54786_1_game-titles|title=Irvine Firm Picks Up Rights for 'Waterworld' Games|first=HOPE|last=HAMASHIGE|date=14 April 1995|via=LA Times|access-date=2015-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307044113/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-14/business/fi-54786_1_game-titles|archive-date=2016-03-07|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was developed by [[Intelligent Games]] and published by Interplay.

In the game, players play as a War Chief and lead a taskforce of 2 to 14 men depending upon the mission.

The SNES and Game Boy games were released only in Europe in 1995 and the Virtual Boy game was released exclusively in North America in November 1995. It was released for PC in 1997. The game received widespread negative reviews and the version released for the Virtual Boy is generally considered to be the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst game]] of its [[List of Virtual Boy games|22 releases]].\n\n== Versions ==\n\n===Virtual Boy===\nThe game is focused around the Mariner's (the main character) [[trimaran]], which the player moves around a 3-D world, shooting enemies on [[personal water craft]]s called Smokers. It is a form of 3D [[shoot 'em up]], similar to that of the All-Range Mode in ''[[Star Fox 64]]''.\n\nThe objective is to keep the Smokers from grabbing Atollers (inhabitants of Atoll) placed around the playing field. To keep them from being captured, the player must shoot the Smokers using the L and R buttons on the Virtual Boy's controller while moving around with either of the two directional pads.\n\nLike all other Virtual Boy games, ''Waterworld'' uses a red-and-black color scheme and uses [[parallax]], an optical trick that is used to simulate a 3D effect.<ref>{{cite web |title=Backwards Compatible: The Virtual Boy |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2585841.htm |work=ABC Good Game |date=2009-06-01 |accessdate=2015-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821211042/http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s2585841.htm |archive-date=2009-08-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Multiplayer functionality was originally advertised for this version of ''Waterworld'',<ref name=\"GP88\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Waterworld|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=88 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1996|page=56}}</ref> but the Virtual Boy's link cable was never released, and multiplayer was not implemented in the final release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vr32.de/modules/interviews/?3 |title=Steve Woita \u00ab Interviews \u00ab Planet Virtual Boy |publisher=Vr32.de |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109190056/http://www.vr32.de/modules/interviews/?3|archivedate=November 9, 2007 |date=November 23, 1993 |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Super NES===\n''Waterworld'' for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] was released in 1995 in Europe by [[Ocean Software]]. It was only released in PAL territories, but an NTSC version had been scheduled for release in December 1995, and given a lengthy review in that month's issue of [[Nintendo Power]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/NintendoPower1988-2004/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20079%20%28December%201995%29#page/n45/mode/2up|title=Water World Review|publisher=Nintendo Power|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=46-52|issue=79}}</ref>\n\nThe game was played from an overhead/isometric perspective with the player controlling the Mariner's boat on the ocean. The point of the game was to destroy the Smokers' boats and dive for sunken artifacts, at which point the game switches to a side on perspective so that the player can directly control the Mariner underwater.\n\n===Genesis===\nA [[Sega Genesis]] port of the Super NES version was also produced by Ocean. Planned for release in Europe in fall 1995, it was never distributed. A complete version of the game was eventually leaked on the net.\n\n===Saturn===\nThe cancelled [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was to feature a 3D virtual ocean with a dynamic surface.<ref name=\"GP88\"/> It began development in late 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=Sega Gamers' Day|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=87 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=October 1996|page=115|quote=After spending almost two years in development, Waterworld for the Saturn is nearing completion.}}</ref>\n\n===PC===\nIn April 1995, [[Interplay Entertainment]] announced that they had garnered the rights to make a ''Waterworld'' game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-14/business/fi-54786_1_game-titles|title=Irvine Firm Picks Up Rights for 'Waterworld' Games|first=HOPE|last=HAMASHIGE|date=14 April 1995|via=LA Times|access-date=2015-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307044113/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-14/business/fi-54786_1_game-titles|archive-date=2016-03-07|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was developed by [[Intelligent Games]] and published by Interplay. It was released for [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] personal computers in 1997. It is a real-time strategy video game. The game contains 25 missions. In the game, players play as a War Chief and lead a taskforce of 2 to 14 men depending upon the mission. The main objective of the game is to amass enough hydro (fresh water), food, weapons, and critical information to successfully evade the \"Smokers\" and revert the inundated world to its former glory.<ref name=\"Gamespot\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/waterworld-review/1900-2531843/|title=Waterworld Review|first=Marc|last=Dultz|date=2 December 1997|access-date=2018-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914061308/https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/waterworld-review/1900-2531843/|archive-date=2018-09-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}\n\n''Waterworld'' received predominantly negative reviews. [[GameSpot]] gave the PC version a review score of 4.5/10.<ref name= \"Gamespot\"/>\n\nThe Virtual Boy version gathered particularly negative reviews for its poor gameplay and graphics.

They are often raped and then forcibly converted to Islam. To prevent them from going back home or reporting the rape to the police, the girls are forcibly married to the perpetrators. Reports obtained by the NGO [[Global Human Rights Defence]] indicate that the perpetrators will often put a fake age of the girl on the marriage certificate to hide that she is underage. When the family of the girl tries to report this to the police, they are often met by biased officers who refuse to file an FIR (First Information Report). The conversions are backed by powerful religious instititutions and leaders who also offer incentives to people to convert. Moreover, the perpetrators will often force the victim to sign a report saying that she converted and married out of her own free will, hindering the attempts of the family to have their girl returned to them. Additionally, the perpetrators will often file counter-suits against the victim's family for harassment and for attempting to convert the girl back to her former religion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human rights report 2019|url=https://ghrdorg.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/report-ghrd-2019.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://ghrdorg.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/report-ghrd-2019.pdf|archive-date=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Human rights report 2019|url=https://eptoday.com/files/Religious%20Minorities%20Report.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://eptoday.com/files/Religious%20Minorities%20Report.pdf|archive-date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to senior journalist Shahzeb Jillani, under-age girls from poor farming communities are especially vulnerable to conversions, he says, \u201cWealthy Muslim farmers see them as fair game for abductions, rape, and prolonged sexual exploitation in captivity.

They are often raped and then forcibly converted to Islam. To prevent them from going back home or reporting the rape to the police, the girls are forcibly married to the perpetrators. Reports obtained by the NGO [[Global Human Rights Defence]] indicate that the perpetrators will often put a fake age of the girl on the marriage certificate to hide that she is underage. When the family of the girl tries to report this to the police, they are often met by biased officers who refuse to file an FIR (First Information Report). The conversions are backed by powerful religious instititutions and leaders who also offer incentives to people to convert. Moreover, the perpetrators will often force the victim to sign a report saying that she converted and married out of her own free will, hindering the attempts of the family to have their girl returned to them. Additionally, the perpetrators will often file counter-suits against the victim's family for harassment and for attempting to convert the girl back to her former religion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human rights report 2019|url=https://ghrdorg.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/report-ghrd-2019.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://ghrdorg.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/report-ghrd-2019.pdf|archive-date=26 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Human rights report 2019|url=https://eptoday.com/files/Religious%20Minorities%20Report.pdf|format=PDF|access-date=26 March 2020|archive-url=https://eptoday.com/files/Religious%20Minorities%20Report.pdf|archive-date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to senior journalist Shahzeb Jillani, under-age girls from poor farming communities are especially vulnerable to conversions, he says, \u201cWealthy Muslim farmers see them as fair game for abductions, rape, and prolonged sexual exploitation in captivity.
