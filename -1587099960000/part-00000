(a Magistrate) (1796) A Treatise on The Police of the Metropolis. Third edition. London. C. Dilly</ref> observed that \"[i]t rarely happens that thieves go upon the highway, or commit burglaries, until the money they have previously acquired is exhausted,\" and that \"...without a safe and ready market he [the thief] is undone.\" \n\nRecognizing the key role played by dealers in stolen goods in facilitating profit from theft and motivation for offenders to steal and with an aim to influence harsher legislation and sentencing of professional [[Fence (criminal)|fences]], the American jurisprudentialist [[Jerome Hall]]<ref>Hall, J. (1952) Theft, Law and Society. Second Edition. Indianapolis. Bobbs_Merril Co</ref> emphasised the role of the professional fence in the marketing of stolen goods and created a [[Sociopolitical typology|typology]] that distinguished between professional fences, part-time dealers, and those who knowingly buy stolen goods for their own consumption. A number of [[ethnographic|ethnography]] studies (e.g. Klockars 1974;<ref>Klockars, C. (1974) The Professional Fence. New York. Free Press</ref> Henry 1977<ref>Henry, S. (1976) Fencing With Accounts: The Language of Moral Bridging. British Journal of Law and Society. 3: 91-100</ref> and Steffensmeir 1986<ref>Steffensmeier, D. J. (1986) The Fence: In the Shadow of Two Worlds. New Jersey: Rowman and Littlefield</ref>) hinted at the influence of the market for stolen goods upon levels of theft of certain goods. \n\nA systematic study of the various ways that stolen goods are stored, sold and bought - going beyond the previous focus upon the guilty mind and level of involvement of dealers and consumers - was conducted by [[Mike Sutton (criminologist)|Mike Sutton]], who created a fivefold market typology based on his  interviews with expert prolific thieves, inexperienced thieves, fences, drug dealers and stolen goods consumers. In 1998, the UK [[Home Office]] published Sutton's report<ref>Sutton, M. (1998) Handling Stolen Goods and Theft: A Market Reduction Approach. Home Office Research Study 178. Home Office.

(a Magistrate) (1796) A Treatise on The Police of the Metropolis. Third edition. London. C. Dilly</ref> observed that \"[i]t rarely happens that thieves go upon the highway, or commit burglaries, until the money they have previously acquired is exhausted,\" and that \"...without a safe and ready market he [the thief] is undone.\" \n\nRecognizing the key role played by dealers in stolen goods in facilitating profit from theft and motivation for offenders to steal and with an aim to influence harsher legislation and sentencing of professional [[Fence (criminal)|fences]], the American jurisprudentialist [[Jerome Hall]]<ref>Hall, J. (1952) Theft, Law and Society. Second Edition. Indianapolis. Bobbs_Merril Co</ref> emphasised the role of the professional fence in the marketing of stolen goods and created a [[Sociopolitical typology|typology]] that distinguished between professional fences, part-time dealers, and those who knowingly buy stolen goods for their own consumption. A number of [[ethnographic|ethnography]] studies (e.g. Klockars 1974;<ref>Klockars, C. (1974) The Professional Fence. New York. Free Press</ref> Henry 1977<ref>Henry, S.

(1986) The Fence: In the Shadow of Two Worlds. New Jersey: Rowman and Littlefield</ref>) hinted at the influence of the market for stolen goods upon levels of theft of certain goods. \n\nA systematic study of the various ways that stolen goods are stored, sold and bought - going beyond the previous focus upon the guilty mind and level of involvement of dealers and consumers - was conducted by [[Mike Sutton (criminologist)|Mike Sutton]], who created a fivefold market typology based on his  interviews with expert prolific thieves, inexperienced thieves, fences, drug dealers and stolen goods consumers.

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, ''a sexton was just another name for a janitor.''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. Peyton excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father for the order's focus towards the Holy Family and its precision towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America|Catholic University]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C. to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941 Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]] as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started letters to Bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]] to [[Madrid, Spain]] across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan ''\"The family that prays together stays together.\"''\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer, was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title ''\"The Rosary Priest\".''\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer, the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, ''a sexton was just another name for a janitor.''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree. Peyton excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father for the order's focus towards the Holy Family and its precision towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America|Catholic University]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C. to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941 Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]] as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started letters to Bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]].
