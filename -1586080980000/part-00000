Its history is associated closely with the development of Russian and world science in the communications area, and with a great scientific and technical base.\n\nFrom 1931 to 1940 the outstanding Russian scientist in radio mechanics, and corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Professor [[Mikhail Aleksandrovich Bonch-Bruevich|Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich]], was the Head of the Chair of theoretical radio engineering in the Leningrad Electro-Technical Institute. He was a doctor of technical sciences, one of the originators of Spark Discharge Theory, as well as the Theory of Radio wave Transmission in the Upper Atmosphere, and creator of the first electronic tubes, radio-telephone transmitters, radio-telephone tube stations, etc.\nIn honor of Professor Bonch-Bruevich's scientific contributions, and in accordance with the USSR Council of People's Commissars' Decree of 8 June 1940, the ''Leningrad Institute of Communication Engineers'' was renamed as the ''Leningrad Electro-Technical Institute of Communications (LEIC), named after Bonch-Bruevich''.\n\nIn 1993 SUT was reconstituted, and gained its new status as the ''Bonch-Bruevich Saint Petersburg State University of Telecommunications'', by order of the Ministry of Communication of Russian Federation. New chairs were created: digital signal processing, communication networks, information safety of telecommunication systems, biomedical technology, information-managing systems, global information technologies, global info-communication networks and systems.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nAs of September 2014, the university has 8 faculties, 1 institute and 6 research centers. \nThe full list of faculties, according to the official web-site:\n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Faculty of RADIO TECHNOLOGIES of COMMUNICATION.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]).\n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Faculty of INFOCOMMUNICATION NETWORKS and SYSTEMS.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]).\n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Faculty of INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]). \n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Faculty of FUNDAMENTAL TRAINING.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]). \n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Faculty of ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]).T \n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Faculty of HUMANITIES.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]). \n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Faculty of PART-TIME and DISTANCE LEARNING.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]). \n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Faculty of UPSKILLING AND RETRAINING OF ACADEMIC ENGINEERS.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]).\n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs Institute OF MILITARY EDUCATION.]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/eng/study-programs/faculties-and-degree-programs]). \n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/nauchno-obrazovatelnyj-tsentr-issledovanie-problem-infokommunikatsionnykh-tekhnologij-i-protokolov Research and Education Center \"Research of problems in infocommunication technologies and protocols\".]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/nauchno-obrazovatelnyj-tsentr-issledovanie-problem-infokommunikatsionnykh-tekhnologij-i-protokolov]).\n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/nauchno-obrazovatelnyj-tsentr-besprovodnye-infotelekommunikatsionnye-seti Research and Education Center \"Wireless infotelecommunication networks\".]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/nauchno-obrazovatelnyj-tsentr-besprovodnye-infotelekommunikatsionnye-seti]).\n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/nauchno-obrazovatelnyj-tsentr-tekhnologii-informatsionnykh-i-obrazovatelnykh-sistem Research and Education Center  \"Technology of information and education systems\".]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/nauchno-obrazovatelnyj-tsentr-tekhnologii-informatsionnykh-i-obrazovatelnykh-sistem]).\n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/noc-vimt Research and Education Center \"Media Center\".]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/noc-vimt]).\nScientific and Technological Center \"Optical communication elements\" \n* '''[http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/nauchno-obrazovatelnyj-tsentr-laboratoriya-programmirovaniya Research and Education Center \"Programming laboratory\".]''' ([http://www.sut.ru/teaching/nauchno-obrazovatelnye-tsentry/nauchno-obrazovatelnyj-tsentr-laboratoriya-programmirovaniya]).\nEducation Center Cisco Systems.\n\nEducation Center Huawei Technologies.\n\n== College and University Branches ==\n\nSaint-Petersburg College of  Telecommunications\n\nArchangelsk College of  Telecommunications\n\nSmolensk College of  Telecommunications\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Boris Gryzlov]]\n* [[Leonid Reiman]]\n* [[Dr Hamadoun I.

Britain, most of its [[Allies of World War I|allies]], and many European neutrals soon followed. Russia and a few other countries waited until the next year, and the United States adopted daylight saving in 1918. Most jurisdictions abandoned DST in the years after the war ended in 1918, with exceptions including Canada, the UK, France, Ireland, and the United States. It became common during [[World War II]], and was widely adopted in America and Europe from the 1970s as a result of the [[1970s energy crisis]].

In all countries that use daylight saving, the clock is advanced in spring and set back in autumn; the spring change reduces the length of that day and the autumn change increases it. For a midnight shift in spring, a digital display of local time would appear to jump from 23:59:59.9 to 01:00:00.0. For the same clock in autumn, the local time would appear to repeat the hour preceding midnight, i.e. jumping from 23:59:59.9 to 23:00:00.0.\n\nIn most countries that use daylight saving time, the time applied in the winter is considered as \"standard\" time and the shift is considered to be a positive offset. The opposite is also possible, with Ireland, for example, defining its summer time to be the legal standard and [[Winter time (clock lag)|winter time]] to be a negative offset.<ref>{{cite web |title=Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971 |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1971/act/17/section/1/enacted/en/html |website=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB) |language=en}}</ref> Morocco sets its clocks back one hour during the month of [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]] relative to its standard time.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kasraoui |first1=Safaa |title=Morocco to Switch Clocks Back 1 Hour on May 5 for Ramadan |url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2019/04/270773/morocco-gmt-dst-ramadan/ |work=Morocco World News |date=April 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe time at which to change clocks differs across jurisdictions. Members of the [[European Union]] conduct a coordinated shift, shifting all zones at the same instant, at 01:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which means that it changes at 02:00 [[Central European Time]] (CET), equivalent to 03:00 [[Eastern European Time]] (EET); as a result, the time differences across European time zones remain constant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.npl.co.uk/reference/faqs/at-what-time-should-clocks-go-forward-or-back-for-summer-time-faq-time|last= National Physical Laboratory|title= At what time should clocks go forward or back for summer time (FAQ \u2013 Time)|date= March 31, 2016|accessdate= October 17, 2016|quote= The time at which summer time begins and ends is given in the relevant EU Directive and UK Statutory Instrument as 1&nbsp;am.

For example, Central European Time is usually six hours ahead of [[Eastern Time Zone|North American Eastern Time]], except for a few weeks in March and October/November, while the United Kingdom and mainland Chile could be five hours apart during the northern summer, three hours during the southern summer, and four hours for a few weeks per year.

The savings in electricity may also be offset by extra use of other types of energy, such as heating fuel.\n\nThe period of daylight saving time before the longest day is shorter than the period after, in several countries including the United States and Europe. For example, in the U.S. the period of daylight saving time is defined by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for daylight saving time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.\n\nDST's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Aries\" /> (For comparison, air conditioning uses 16.5% of energy in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/|title=MIT Wristband Could Make AC Obsolete|last=Vanhemert|first=Kyle|date=October 30, 2013|work=Wired|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>)  Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of [[incandescent lighting]], once a primary use of electricity.<ref name=\"Bartlett\">{{cite book |author=Roscoe G.

[...] The rise of ''daylight savings time'' appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when ''saving'' is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether ''saving'' is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving).

American English replaces ''standard'' with ''daylight'': for example, ''[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Standard Time]]'' (''PST'') becomes ''Pacific Daylight Time'' (''PDT''). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is ''[[British Summer Time]]'' (BST), and British English typically inserts ''summer'' into other time zone names, e.g. ''[[Central European Time]]'' (''CET'') becomes ''[[Central European Summer Time]]'' (''CEST'').\n\nThe North American English mnemonic \"spring forward, fall back\" (also \"spring ahead&nbsp;...\", \"spring up&nbsp;...\", and \"...&nbsp;fall behind\") helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks.<ref name=\"Downing-Prerau\" />\n\n==Computing==\n[[File:Daylightsavings.svg|thumb|upright|\nalt=Strong man in sandals and with shaggy hair, facing away from audience/artist, grabbing a hand of a clock bigger than he is and attempting to force it backwards.

In Unix-like systems the TZ [[environment variable]] specifies the [[List of tz zones by name|location name]], as in <code>TZ=':America/New_York'</code>. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the {{kbd|/etc/localtime}} file, which is usually a [[symbolic link]] or [[hard link]] to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent [[Unix time]]; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.\n\nOlder or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by [[POSIX]], which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, <code>TZ='EST5EDT,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00'</code> specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007. Such a TZ value must be changed whenever DST rules change, and the new value applies to all years, mishandling some older timestamps.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.unix.org/version3/ |publisher=The Open Group |title=IEEE Std 1003.1\u20132004 |year=2004 |chapterurl=http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html#tag_08_03 |chapter=Other environment variables }}</ref>\n\n===Microsoft Windows===\n{{Update section|date=February 2020|reason=information about more recent versions of Windows would be useful}} \nAs with zoneinfo, a user of [[Microsoft Windows]] configures DST by specifying the name of a location, and the operating system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change.

In [[Windows 98]], Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year.

This causes several problems, including compatibility when [[multi boot]]ing with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a [[Windows registry]] entry <var>RealTimeIsUniversal</var> that had been introduced many years earlier, when [[Windows NT]] supported [[RISC]] machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained.<ref name=RealTimeIsUniversal>{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/mswish/ut-rtc.html |title=IBM PC Real Time Clock should run in UT |publisher=Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge |author=Markus Kuhn |date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.<ref name=KB2922223>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2922223 |title=You cannot change system time if RealTimeIsUniversal registry entry is enabled in Windows |author=Microsoft }}</ref><ref name=KB2800213>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2800213 |title=High CPU usage during DST changeover in Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2 |author=Microsoft }}</ref>\n\nThe [[NTFS]] file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local\u2014or seasonal\u2014time. However, the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some [[file archiver]]s. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a [[checksum algorithm]]).

The period for daylight saving time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.\n\nDST's potential to save energy comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"Aries\" /> (For comparison, air conditioning uses 16.5% of energy in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/|title=MIT Wristband Could Make AC Obsolete|last=Vanhemert|first=Kyle|date=October 30, 2013|work=Wired|access-date=June 13, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>)  Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light in the evening and increases it in the morning.

[...] The rise of ''daylight savings time'' appears to have resulted from the avoidance of a miscue: when ''saving'' is used, readers might puzzle momentarily over whether ''saving'' is a gerund (the saving of daylight) or a participle (the time for saving).

American English replaces ''standard'' with ''daylight'': for example, ''[[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Standard Time]]'' (''PST'') becomes ''Pacific Daylight Time'' (''PDT''). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is ''[[British Summer Time]]'' (BST), and British English typically inserts ''summer'' into other time zone names, e.g. ''[[Central European Time]]'' (''CET'') becomes ''[[Central European Summer Time]]'' (''CEST'').\n\nThe North American English mnemonic \"spring forward, fall back\" (also \"spring ahead&nbsp;...\", \"spring up&nbsp;...\", and \"...&nbsp;fall behind\") helps people remember in which direction to shift the clocks.<ref name=\"Downing-Prerau\" />\n\n==Computing==\n[[File:Daylightsavings.svg|thumb|upright|\nalt=Strong man in sandals and with shaggy hair, facing away from audience/artist, grabbing a hand of a clock bigger than he is and attempting to force it backwards.

In Unix-like systems the TZ [[environment variable]] specifies the [[List of tz zones by name|location name]], as in <code>TZ=':America/New_York'</code>. In many of those systems there is also a system-wide setting that is applied if the TZ environment variable is not set: this setting is controlled by the contents of the {{kbd|/etc/localtime}} file, which is usually a [[symbolic link]] or [[hard link]] to one of the zoneinfo files. Internal time is stored in timezone-independent [[Unix time]]; the TZ is used by each of potentially many simultaneous users and processes to independently localize time display.\n\nOlder or stripped-down systems may support only the TZ values required by [[POSIX]], which specify at most one start and end rule explicitly in the value. For example, <code>TZ='EST5EDT,M3.2.0/02:00,M11.1.0/02:00'</code> specifies time for the eastern United States starting in 2007.

For example, before 2005, DST in [[Israel]] varied each year and was skipped some years. [[Windows 95]] used rules correct for 1995 only, causing problems in later years. In [[Windows 98]], Microsoft marked Israel as not having DST, forcing Israeli users to shift their computer clocks manually twice a year. The 2005 [[Israeli Daylight Saving Law]] established predictable rules using the Jewish calendar but Windows zone files could not represent the rules' dates in a year-independent way.

This causes several problems, including compatibility when [[multi boot]]ing with operating systems that set the clock to UTC, and double-adjusting the clock when multi booting different Windows versions, such as with a rescue boot disk. This approach is a problem even in Windows-only systems: there is no support for per-user timezone settings, only a single system-wide setting. In 2008 Microsoft hinted that future versions of Windows will partially support a [[Windows registry]] entry <var>RealTimeIsUniversal</var> that had been introduced many years earlier, when [[Windows NT]] supported [[RISC]] machines with UTC clocks, but had not been maintained.<ref name=RealTimeIsUniversal>{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/mswish/ut-rtc.html |title=IBM PC Real Time Clock should run in UT |publisher=Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge |author=Markus Kuhn |date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref> Since then at least two fixes related to this feature have been published by Microsoft.<ref name=KB2922223>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2922223 |title=You cannot change system time if RealTimeIsUniversal registry entry is enabled in Windows |author=Microsoft }}</ref><ref name=KB2800213>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2800213 |title=High CPU usage during DST changeover in Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2 |author=Microsoft }}</ref>\n\nThe [[NTFS]] file system used by recent versions of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local\u2014or seasonal\u2014time. However, the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied from the hard disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some [[file archiver]]s. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect should be kept in mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files for equality (such as using a [[checksum algorithm]]).  A ready clue is if the time stamps differ by precisely 1 hour.\n\n==Permanent daylight saving time==\n{{see also|Permanent daylight saving time in the United States|Decree time|Summer time in Europe#Future|label2=Decree time in Russia}}\n[[File:Willett memorial.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A standing stone in a grassy field surrounded by trees.

Late sunrise times can become unpopular in the winter months which essentially forces workers and schoolchildren to begin the day in darkness. In 1974 following the enactment of the Emergency Daylight Saving Time Act in the [[United States]], complaints of children going to school in the dark and working people commuting and starting their work day in pitch darkness during the winter months led to the repeal of the act in October 1974 when standard time was restored until February 23, 1975. In 1976, the United States returned to the schedule set under the [[Uniform Time Act of 1966]]. In 1971, year-round daylight time in the [[United Kingdom]] was abandoned after a 3-year experiment because of complaints about winter sunrise times.

The main building is located on [[Moskovsky Prospekt]], number 9.\n\nThe University provides training in specialties and areas of bachelor and master training.\n\nEmperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University is an academic partner of the Center for international logistics of Russian Railways and [[Deutsche Bahn AG]].\n\n== History ==\n\nEmperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University was one of the first technical universities in Russia. Its earliest precursors date back to 1798-1809 as a part of the training provided in the Department of Water Communications by N. P. Rumyantsev.\n\nThe University was established on 2 December ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] 20 November), 1809, by a manifesto issued by [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]]. The grand opening took place on 13 November (O.S. 1 November) 1810.\n\nThe aim of University establishment was specialized training for construction of land and waterway lines of communication. Waterways were the most developed communication lines at that time. The main disadvantage of shipping was evident in winter, when ships had to stand idle until navigation could start. In the summer ships were driven upstream by [[burlak]]s.\n\n== University at the time of de Betancourt ==\n\nThe first head of the Institute was [[Agust\u00edn de Betancourt|Agust\u00edn de Betancourt y Molina]] (1758\u20141824) as a general inspector. The institution was opened as a cadet corps and was connected closely to the leading institutions of higher education, located in the capital. The ones were the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]], Main Engineering School of [[Russian Empire]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]]. The institute was a paramilitary boarding school. Duration of the education course including the gymnasium was 8 years. Graduates obtained the degree of engineer of communication lines and the rank of [[poruchik]] or [[podporuchik]].\n\nA museum was founded in 1813 at the Institute (now the Russian Federation Central Museum of Railway Transport).\n\n==Current status==\n\nIn 1993 University was renamed as '''Petersburg State Transport University (Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University, PGUPS)'''.\n\nThe University has 11,142 students (as of 2018). The University is a center for the training of conductors in St. Petersburg.\n\n==Traditions ==\nEvery year since 2016, the State Museum monument [[St. Isaac's Cathedral]] hosts a solemn ceremony of awarding diplomas with honors to graduates of the St. Petersburg state University of Railways of Emperor Alexander I.\n\n==Research==\nThe research division coordinates the activities and provides administrative guidance to all departments conducting research, organizes fundamental, search and applied research and development work, as well as other types of work related to the implementation of scientific activities of the University.\n\nThe University has formed a detailed structure of the research complex, which includes research institutes, research centers, and research laboratories. Every year the University holds a scientific conference.\n\nResearchers of PGUPS with colleagues-scientists traditionally conduct round tables and seminars on improving the activities of railway transport and the introduction of innovative scientific developments of scientists of PGUPS in the main activity of the company \"Russian Railways\".\n\n==Rankings==\n\n[[File:University-StPeterburg-p1030659.jpg#/media/\u0424\u0430\u0439\u043b:University-StPeterburg-p1030659.jpg|thumb|The main building, designed in 1952 by architect V.

The main building is located on [[Moskovsky Prospekt]], number 9.\n\nThe University provides training in specialties and areas of bachelor and master training.\n\nEmperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University is an academic partner of the Center for international logistics of Russian Railways and [[Deutsche Bahn AG]].\n\n== History ==\n\nEmperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University was one of the first technical universities in Russia. Its earliest precursors date back to 1798-1809 as a part of the training provided in the Department of Water Communications by N. P. Rumyantsev.\n\nThe University was established on 2 December ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] 20 November), 1809, by a manifesto issued by [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]]. The grand opening took place on 13 November (O.S. 1 November) 1810.\n\nThe aim of University establishment was specialized training for construction of land and waterway lines of communication. Waterways were the most developed communication lines at that time. The main disadvantage of shipping was evident in winter, when ships had to stand idle until navigation could start. In the summer ships were driven upstream by [[burlak]]s.\n\n== University at the time of de Betancourt ==\n\nThe first head of the Institute was [[Agust\u00edn de Betancourt|Agust\u00edn de Betancourt y Molina]] (1758\u20141824) as a general inspector. The institution was opened as a cadet corps and was connected closely to the leading institutions of higher education, located in the capital. The ones were the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]], Main Engineering School of [[Russian Empire]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University]]. The institute was a paramilitary boarding school. Duration of the education course including the gymnasium was 8 years. Graduates obtained the degree of engineer of communication lines and the rank of [[poruchik]] or [[podporuchik]].\n\nA museum was founded in 1813 at the Institute (now the Russian Federation Central Museum of Railway Transport).\n\n==Current status==\n\nIn 1993 University was renamed as '''Petersburg State Transport University (Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University, PGUPS)'''.\n\nThe University has 11,142 students (as of 2018). The University is a center for the training of conductors in St. Petersburg.\n\n==Traditions ==\nEvery year since 2016, the State Museum monument [[St. Isaac's Cathedral]] hosts a solemn ceremony of awarding diplomas with honors to graduates of the St. Petersburg state University of Railways of Emperor Alexander I.\n\n==Research==\nThe research division coordinates the activities and provides administrative guidance to all departments conducting research, organizes fundamental, search and applied research and development work, as well as other types of work related to the implementation of scientific activities of the University.\n\nThe University has formed a detailed structure of the research complex, which includes research institutes, research centers, and research laboratories. Every year the University holds a scientific conference.\n\nResearchers of PGUPS with colleagues-scientists traditionally conduct round tables and seminars on improving the activities of railway transport and the introduction of innovative scientific developments of scientists of PGUPS in the main activity of the company \"Russian Railways\".\n\n==Rankings==\n\n[[File:University-StPeterburg-p1030659.jpg#/media/\u0424\u0430\u0439\u043b:University-StPeterburg-p1030659.jpg|thumb|The main building, designed in 1952 by architect V.
