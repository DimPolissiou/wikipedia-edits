In Manhattan, the highway is named after Seth Child, an early Manhattan pioneer. Most of the highway is four-laned with mixed-access, and serves as a major arterial highway for the western portions of the city. The highway is almost wholly inside the Manhattan [[city limit]], and ends near the Riley County shops along US-24 north of Manhattan.\n\nThe first K-113 was designated by 1936, and ran from [[K-13 (Kansas highway)|K-13]] west of [[Bigelow, Kansas|Bigelow]] north to [[K-16 (Kansas highway)|K-16]] in [[Blue Rapids, Kansas|Blue Rapids]]. This alignment was decommissioned in late 1958. The current K-113 was first designated in 1957 as US-24 Spur in Manhattan. Then in a July 7, 1965 resolution, US-24 Spur was renumbered to K-113, and was completed by 1967.\n\n== Route description ==\nThe road begins at [[K-18 (Kansas highway)|K-18]] in the western part of [[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]] with a [[diverging diamond interchange]].
