Production continued in other countries into the 1950s for the private market. It remains famous for its excellent [[STOL]] performance and low [[stall speed]] of 31 mph (50 km/h);<ref>http://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acdata_php/acdata_fi156_en.php</ref> French-built later variants often appear at air shows.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Conception and production===\nIn 1935, the RLM (''[[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]'', Reich Aviation Ministry) invited several aviation companies to submit design proposals that would compete for the production contract for a new ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' aircraft design suitable for liaison, army co-operation (today called [[forward air control]]), and [[medical evacuation]]. This resulted in the [[Messerschmitt Bf 163]] and [[Siebel Si 201]] competing against the Fieseler firm's entry. Conceived by chief designer Reinhold Mewes and technical director [[Erich Bachem]], Fieseler's design had a far better short take off and landing (\"[[STOL]]\") performance. A fixed [[Leading-edge slats|slat]] ran along the entire length of the leading edge of the long wings, while a hinged and slotted set of control surfaces ran along the entire length of trailing edge. This was inspired by earlier 1930s Junkers ''Doppelfl\u00fcgel'', \"double-wing\" aircraft wing control surface design concepts. For the Fi 156, this setup along each wing panel's trailing edge was split nearly 50/50 between the inboard-located [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] and outboard-located [[aileron]]s, which, in turn, included [[trim tab]] devices over half of each aileron's trailing edge length.\n[[File:Fieseler Fi156.jpg|thumb|right|Fi 156 in flight]]\nA design feature rare for land-based aircraft enabled the wings on the ''Storch'' to be [[folding wing|folded back]] along the fuselage in a manner similar to the wings of the U.S. Navy's [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighter. This allowed the aircraft to be carried on a trailer or even towed slowly behind a vehicle. The primary hinge for the folding wing was located in the wing root, where the rear wing spar met the cabin. The long legs of the main landing gear contained oil-and-spring shock absorbers that had a travel of 40&nbsp;cm (15-3/4&nbsp;inches), allowing the aircraft to land on comparatively rough and uneven surfaces; this was combined with a \"pre-travel\" distance of 20&nbsp;cm, before the oleos began damping the landing gear shock.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sengfelder |first=G\u00fcnther |date=1993 |title=German Aircraft Landing Gear |url= |location=Atglen, PA USA |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |page=84 |isbn=0-88740-470-7 |quote=(Photo caption) The long shock absorber leg of the Fi 156 with its streamlined fairing. 200 mm of idle stroke was available in addition to the 400 mm stroke of the shock absorber.}}</ref> In flight, the main landing gear legs hung down, giving the aircraft the appearance of a long-legged, big-winged bird, hence its nickname, ''Storch''. With its very low landing speed, the ''Storch'' often appeared to land vertically, or even backwards in strong winds from directly ahead.\n\n===German production===\nAbout 2,900 Fi 156s, mostly Cs, were produced from 1937 to 1945 at the [[Fieseler]] Factory in [[Kassel]]. In 1942, production started in the [[Morane-Saulnier]] factory at [[Puteaux]] in [[France]]. Due to the demand for Fieseler as a subcontractor for building the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]] and the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]], Storch production was shifted to the Leichtbau Budweis in [[\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice|Budweis]] in 1943.\n\n===Soviet production===\nIn 1939, after the signing of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Germany provided several aircraft, including the Fi 156C, to the [[Soviet Union]].  [[Oleg Antonov (aircraft designer)|Oleg Antonov]] was made responsible for putting the aircraft into production to meet Soviet requirements, and given a choice between designing an equivalent aircraft or merely copying the German design, the latter was selected. Two versions were envisaged:  the SS three seat liaison aircraft, and the N-2 air ambulance capable of carrying two stretchers plus a medic.  A prototype was constructed in Kaunas, Lithuania, which flew before the end of 1940, and production was getting under way as the factory was lost to the German advance in 1941.  While Antonov's efforts had produced a heavier aircraft, which required as much as three times the field for landing and take off as the German Fi 156C, it also had much greater range and increased load capability.<ref name=gunston95>{{ref book osprey encyc of russian aircraft|20}}</ref> After the war Antonov went on to design the legendary [[Antonov An-2|An-2]] STOL biplane, which was similarly famous for its excellent STOL performance.\n\n===Czech production===\nIn 1944 production was moved from the Leichtbau Budweis to the [[Bene\u0161-Mr\u00e1z|Mr\u00e1z]] factory in [[Choce\u0148]] which produced 138 examples of the Fi 156, locally designated as \"K-65 \u010c\u00e1p\". Production ended in 1949.\n\n===French production===\n[[File:MORANE-SAULNIER MS.505 CRIQUET D-EGTY vl.jpg|thumb|Morane-Saulnier MS.505 Criquet]]\nImmediately after the liberation of France in 1944, the production of Fi&nbsp;156 at the [[Morane-Saulnier]] factory was continued at the request of the ''[[French Air Force|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'' and designated MS 500 for the batch of aircraft produced with the remaining stock of [[Argus As 10|Argus]] air-cooled inverted V8 engines. Further modifications and use of different engines (inline and radial) are known under different type numbers. The use of the aircraft in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] highlighted the weakness of the wood in the construction of the airframe; it was then decided to build the wings of metal. Among the modifications, the defensive weapon aiming through the back window was dropped, although some aircraft were modified in the field to take a [[MAC 1934|MAC 34T]] machine gun firing through one of the side windows. Some 141 aircraft were built before the end of World War II, and a total of 925 aircraft were built before the end of the production of all types of ''Criquet'' by Morane-Saulnier in 1965.\n\n===Romanian production===\nLicence production was also started in Romania in October 1943 at the [[\u00centreprinderea de Construc\u021bii Aeronautice Rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti|ICAR]] factory in [[Bucharest]]. Only 10 were built by the time the ICAR factory was bombed in May 1944. Production resumed later in 1944, but only six were completed before repair work halted production. From June 1945 until 1946, a further 64 aircraft were built.<ref name=\"Mark Axworthy, Cornel Scafes, Cristian Craciunoiu. 1995, pp249\u2013250\">Axworthy et al. 1995, pp. 249\u2013250.</ref>\n\n===Summary of production===\nProduction per factory and per type until 31 March 1945:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The use of modern materials provides better STOL performance than the original with a take-off run of 30&nbsp;m and landing-roll of 50&nbsp;m with no headwind. It was originally designed and manufactured in Australia<ref>[http://www.casa.gov.au/wcmswr/_assets/main/casadata/cota/download/va505.pdf \"Australian Type Certificate for the Slepcev Storch.\"] ''Civil Aviation Safety Authority'' (Australia).

Even though the mountain was surrounded by Italian troops, German [[commando]] [[Otto Skorzeny]] and 90 [[paratrooper]]s used gliders to land on the peak and quickly captured it. However, the problem of how to get back off remained. A [[Focke-Achgelis Fa 223]] [[helicopter]] was sent, but it broke down en route. Instead, pilot Heinrich Gerlach flew in a ''Storch''. It landed in 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft), and after Mussolini and Skorzeny boarded, it took off in 80&nbsp;m (250&nbsp;ft), even though the aircraft was overloaded. The ''Storch'' involved in rescuing Mussolini bore the radio code letters, or ''Stammkennzeichen'', of \"SJ + LL\"<ref>[http://www.luftwaffe-experten.org/stam-s.html \"The LEMB Stammkennzeichen Database.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010074632/http://www.luftwaffe-experten.org/stam-s.html |date=October 10, 2014 }} ''The LEMB Stammkennzeichen Database Project.'' Retrieved: 14 November 2012.</ref> in the motion picture coverage of the daring rescue.\n\nOn 26 April 1945, a ''Storch'' was one of the last aircraft to land on the improvised airstrip in the [[Grosser Tiergarten|Tiergarten]] near the [[Brandenburg Gate]] during the [[Battle of Berlin]] and the death throes of the [[Third Reich]]. It was flown by the test pilot [[Hanna Reitsch]], who flew ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] from Munich to Berlin to answer a summons from Hitler.<ref>Beevor 2002, p. 322.</ref>\n[[File:Air Vice Marshal Broadhurst in his Fi 156 Italy c1943.jpg|thumb|right|Air Vice Marshal Harry Broadhurst and his ''Storch'', Italy, 1943]]\nA ''Storch'' was the victim of the last [[dogfight]] on the Western Front and another was downed by a direct Allied counterpart of the Storch, an L-4 Grasshopper, the military version of the well-known American [[Piper J-3 Cub]] civilian training and sport aircraft. The pilot and co-pilot of the L-4, lieutenants Duane Francis and Bill Martin, opened fire on the ''Storch'' with their .45 caliber pistols, forcing the German air crew to land and surrender.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAf0maieLjs</ref>\n\n[[Erwin Rommel|Field Marshal Rommel]] used ''Storch'' aircraft for transport and battlefield surveillance during the North African desert campaign of World War II.\n\nDuring the war a number of ''St\u00f6rche'' were captured by the Allies. One became the personal aircraft of [[Bernard Montgomery|Field Marshal Montgomery]]. Others were used as the personal aircraft of Air Vice Marshal [[Arthur Coningham (RAF officer)|Arthur Coningham]] and Air Vice Marshal [[Harry Broadhurst]], who acquired his ''Storch'' in North Africa, and flew it subsequently in Italy and North-West Europe.\n\nThe British captured 145, of which 64 were given to the French as war compensation from Germany.\n\n===Post World War II===\n[[File:Fieseler Fi-156 OE-ADS Sprayer STT 29.07.65 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|An Austrian-registered ''Storch'' fitted with spraying equipment at [[Stuttgart Airport]] in 1965]]\nThe [[French Air Force]] (''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'') and the [[French Army Light Aviation]] (''Aviation L\u00e9g\u00e8re de l\u2019Arm\u00e9e de Terre'') used the ''Criquet'' from 1945 to 1958 throughout the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]]. The [[Swiss Air Force]] and other mountainous European countries continued to use the ''Storch'' for rescues in terrain where STOL performance was necessary, as with the historically significant [[1946 C-53 Skytrooper crash on the Gauli Glacier|Gauli Glacier crash]] rescue in November 1946, as a pair of [[Swiss Air Force#History|''Flugwaffe'']]-flown Storches were the sole means to get its twelve survivors to safety. After [[World War II]], Storch aircraft were used in utility roles including agricultural spraying. Many Storches are still operational today and are commonly shown at air shows. In North America, both the [[Collings Foundation]] and the [[Fantasy of Flight]] museum have airworthy Fi 156 ''Storch'' aircraft in their collections.\n\n==Variants==\n* '''Fi 156 V1''': Prototype equipped with an adjustable metal propeller, registration D-IKVN (produced in 1935\u20131936)\n* '''Fi 156 V2''': Prototype equipped with a wooden propeller.

Production continued in other countries into the 1950s for the private market. It remains famous for its excellent [[STOL]] performance and low [[stall speed]] of 31 mph (50 km/h);<ref>http://www.flugzeuginfo.net/acdata_php/acdata_fi156_en.php</ref> French-built later variants often appear at air shows.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Conception and production===\nIn 1935, the RLM (''[[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]'', Reich Aviation Ministry) invited several aviation companies to submit design proposals that would compete for the production contract for a new ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' aircraft design suitable for liaison, army co-operation (today called [[forward air control]]), and [[medical evacuation]]. This resulted in the [[Messerschmitt Bf 163]] and [[Siebel Si 201]] competing against the Fieseler firm's entry. Conceived by chief designer Reinhold Mewes and technical director [[Erich Bachem]], Fieseler's design had a far better short take off and landing (\"[[STOL]]\") performance. A fixed [[Leading-edge slats|slat]] ran along the entire length of the leading edge of the long wings, while a hinged and slotted set of control surfaces ran along the entire length of trailing edge. This was inspired by earlier 1930s Junkers ''Doppelfl\u00fcgel'', \"double-wing\" aircraft wing control surface design concepts. For the Fi 156, this setup along each wing panel's trailing edge was split nearly 50/50 between the inboard-located [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] and outboard-located [[aileron]]s, which, in turn, included [[trim tab]] devices over half of each aileron's trailing edge length.\n[[File:Fieseler Fi156.jpg|thumb|right|Fi 156 in flight]]\nA design feature rare for land-based aircraft enabled the wings on the ''Storch'' to be [[folding wing|folded back]] along the fuselage in a manner similar to the wings of the U.S. Navy's [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighter. This allowed the aircraft to be carried on a trailer or even towed slowly behind a vehicle. The primary hinge for the folding wing was located in the wing root, where the rear wing spar met the cabin. The long legs of the main landing gear contained oil-and-spring shock absorbers that had a travel of 40&nbsp;cm (15-3/4&nbsp;inches), allowing the aircraft to land on comparatively rough and uneven surfaces; this was combined with a \"pre-travel\" distance of 20&nbsp;cm, before the oleos began damping the landing gear shock.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sengfelder |first=G\u00fcnther |date=1993 |title=German Aircraft Landing Gear |url= |location=Atglen, PA USA |publisher=Schiffer Publishing |page=84 |isbn=0-88740-470-7 |quote=(Photo caption) The long shock absorber leg of the Fi 156 with its streamlined fairing. 200 mm of idle stroke was available in addition to the 400 mm stroke of the shock absorber.}}</ref> In flight, the main landing gear legs hung down, giving the aircraft the appearance of a long-legged, big-winged bird, hence its nickname, ''Storch''. With its very low landing speed, the ''Storch'' often appeared to land vertically, or even backwards in strong winds from directly ahead.\n\n===German production===\nAbout 2,900 Fi 156s, mostly Cs, were produced from 1937 to 1945 at the [[Fieseler]] Factory in [[Kassel]]. In 1942, production started in the [[Morane-Saulnier]] factory at [[Puteaux]] in [[France]]. Due to the demand for Fieseler as a subcontractor for building the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]] and the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]], Storch production was shifted to the Leichtbau Budweis in [[\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice|Budweis]] in 1943.\n\n===Soviet production===\nIn 1939, after the signing of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Germany provided several aircraft, including the Fi 156C, to the [[Soviet Union]].  [[Oleg Antonov (aircraft designer)|Oleg Antonov]] was made responsible for putting the aircraft into production to meet Soviet requirements, and given a choice between designing an equivalent aircraft or merely copying the German design, the latter was selected. Two versions were envisaged:  the SS three seat liaison aircraft, and the N-2 air ambulance capable of carrying two stretchers plus a medic.  A prototype was constructed in Kaunas, Lithuania, which flew before the end of 1940, and production was getting under way as the factory was lost to the German advance in 1941.  While Antonov's efforts had produced a heavier aircraft, which required as much as three times the field for landing and take off as the German Fi 156C, it also had much greater range and increased load capability.<ref name=gunston95>{{ref book osprey encyc of russian aircraft|20}}</ref> After the war Antonov went on to design the legendary [[Antonov An-2|An-2]] STOL biplane, which was similarly famous for its excellent STOL performance.\n\n===Czech production===\nIn 1944 production was moved from the Leichtbau Budweis to the [[Bene\u0161-Mr\u00e1z|Mr\u00e1z]] factory in [[Choce\u0148]] which produced 138 examples of the Fi 156, locally designated as \"K-65 \u010c\u00e1p\". Production ended in 1949.\n\n===French production===\n[[File:MORANE-SAULNIER MS.505 CRIQUET D-EGTY vl.jpg|thumb|Morane-Saulnier MS.505 Criquet]]\nImmediately after the liberation of France in 1944, the production of Fi&nbsp;156 at the [[Morane-Saulnier]] factory was continued at the request of the ''[[French Air Force|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'' and designated MS 500 for the batch of aircraft produced with the remaining stock of [[Argus As 10|Argus]] air-cooled inverted V8 engines. Further modifications and use of different engines (inline and radial) are known under different type numbers. The use of the aircraft in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] highlighted the weakness of the wood in the construction of the airframe; it was then decided to build the wings of metal. Among the modifications, the defensive weapon aiming through the back window was dropped, although some aircraft were modified in the field to take a [[MAC 1934|MAC 34T]] machine gun firing through one of the side windows. Some 141 aircraft were built before the end of World War II, and a total of 925 aircraft were built before the end of the production of all types of ''Criquet'' by Morane-Saulnier in 1965.\n\n===Romanian production===\nLicence production was also started in Romania in October 1943 at the [[\u00centreprinderea de Construc\u021bii Aeronautice Rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti|ICAR]] factory in [[Bucharest]]. Only 10 were built by the time the ICAR factory was bombed in May 1944. Production resumed later in 1944, but only six were completed before repair work halted production. From June 1945 until 1946, a further 64 aircraft were built.<ref name=\"Mark Axworthy, Cornel Scafes, Cristian Craciunoiu. 1995, pp249\u2013250\">Axworthy et al. 1995, pp. 249\u2013250.</ref>\n\n===Summary of production===\nProduction per factory and per type until 31 March 1945:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Even though the mountain was surrounded by Italian troops, German [[commando]] [[Otto Skorzeny]] and 90 [[paratrooper]]s used gliders to land on the peak and quickly captured it. However, the problem of how to get back off remained. A [[Focke-Achgelis Fa 223]] [[helicopter]] was sent, but it broke down en route. Instead, pilot Heinrich Gerlach flew in a ''Storch''. It landed in 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft), and after Mussolini and Skorzeny boarded, it took off in 80&nbsp;m (250&nbsp;ft), even though the aircraft was overloaded. The ''Storch'' involved in rescuing Mussolini bore the radio code letters, or ''Stammkennzeichen'', of \"SJ + LL\"<ref>[http://www.luftwaffe-experten.org/stam-s.html \"The LEMB Stammkennzeichen Database.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010074632/http://www.luftwaffe-experten.org/stam-s.html |date=October 10, 2014 }} ''The LEMB Stammkennzeichen Database Project.''

It was flown by the test pilot [[Hanna Reitsch]], who flew ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] from Munich to Berlin to answer a summons from Hitler.<ref>Beevor 2002, p. 322.</ref>\n[[File:Air Vice Marshal Broadhurst in his Fi 156 Italy c1943.jpg|thumb|right|Air Vice Marshal Harry Broadhurst and his ''Storch'', Italy, 1943]]\nA ''Storch'' was the victim of the last [[dogfight]] on the Western Front and another was downed by a direct Allied counterpart of the Storch, an L-4 Grasshopper, the military version of the well-known American [[Piper J-3 Cub]] civilian training and sport aircraft. The pilot and co-pilot of the L-4, lieutenants Duane Francis and Bill Martin, opened fire on the ''Storch'' with their .45 caliber pistols, forcing the German air crew to land and surrender.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAf0maieLjs</ref>\n\n[[Erwin Rommel|Field Marshal Rommel]] used ''Storch'' aircraft for transport and battlefield surveillance during the North African desert campaign of World War II.\n\nDuring the war a number of ''St\u00f6rche'' were captured by the Allies. One became the personal aircraft of [[Bernard Montgomery|Field Marshal Montgomery]]. Others were used as the personal aircraft of Air Vice Marshal [[Arthur Coningham (RAF officer)|Arthur Coningham]] and Air Vice Marshal [[Harry Broadhurst]], who acquired his ''Storch'' in North Africa, and flew it subsequently in Italy and North-West Europe.\n\nThe British captured 145, of which 64 were given to the French as war compensation from Germany.\n\n===Post World War II===\n[[File:Fieseler Fi-156 OE-ADS Sprayer STT 29.07.65 edited-3.jpg|thumb|right|An Austrian-registered ''Storch'' fitted with spraying equipment at [[Stuttgart Airport]] in 1965]]\nThe [[French Air Force]] (''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'') and the [[French Army Light Aviation]] (''Aviation L\u00e9g\u00e8re de l\u2019Arm\u00e9e de Terre'') used the ''Criquet'' from 1945 to 1958 throughout the [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]]. The [[Swiss Air Force]] and other mountainous European countries continued to use the ''Storch'' for rescues in terrain where STOL performance was necessary, as with the historically significant [[1946 C-53 Skytrooper crash on the Gauli Glacier|Gauli Glacier crash]] rescue in November 1946, as a pair of [[Swiss Air Force#History|''Flugwaffe'']]-flown Storches were the sole means to get its twelve survivors to safety. After [[World War II]], Storch aircraft were used in utility roles including agricultural spraying. Many Storches are still operational today and are commonly shown at air shows. In North America, both the [[Collings Foundation]] and the [[Fantasy of Flight]] museum have airworthy Fi 156 ''Storch'' aircraft in their collections.\n\n==Variants==\n* '''Fi 156 V1''': Prototype equipped with an adjustable metal propeller, registration D-IKVN (produced in 1935\u20131936)\n* '''Fi 156 V2''': Prototype equipped with a wooden propeller.
