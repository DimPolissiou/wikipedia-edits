The CPLP helped these two countries to take economic reforms (in the case of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9) and democratic ones (in the case of Guinea-Bissau).\n\nIn the early 21st century, the leaders of the CPLP believed that peace in [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], as well as East Timor's independence, favored the development of the CPLP and a strengthening of multilateral cooperation.\n\n=== Language ===\n[[File:Minist\u00e9rio da Cultura - VII Reuni\u00e3o de Ministros da Cultura da CPLP (1).jpg|thumb|right|260px|The 7th Meeting of Ministers of Culture at [[Sintra National Palace|Sintra Palace]]; [[Portuguese Riviera]], 2010.]]\nSince many children in rural areas of Lusophone Africa and East Timor are out-of-school youth, the education officials in these regions seek help from Portugal and Brazil to increase the education to spread Portuguese fluency (like establishing [[Instituto Cam\u00f5es]] language center branches in main cities and rural towns), as Portuguese is becoming one of the main languages in [[Southern Africa]], where it is also taught in [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]].\n\nAngola has not yet signed the [[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990|most recent accord on the orthography of the Portuguese language]], and has asked other [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] countries to support it in discussions on various points of that accord with Portugal.<ref name=\"Angop_2012-01-28_22-41\">{{cite news |url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/pt_pt/noticias/africa/2012/0/4/PALOP-reunem-margem-Cimeira-Conselho-Executivo,94ffc255-ebd6-4e59-85d4-15e1cb58405d.html |title=PALOP reunem-se \u00e0 margem da 20\u00aa Cimeira do Conselho Executivo |language=Portuguese |trans-title=PALOP countries meet at the 20th summit of the UA executive |publisher=Angop |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nIn many developing Portuguese-speaking nations, Portuguese is the language of government and commerce which means that Portuguese-speaking people from African nations can work and communicate with others in different parts of the world, especially in Portugal and Brazil, where the economies are stronger.

The CPLP helped these two countries to take economic reforms (in the case of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9) and democratic ones (in the case of Guinea-Bissau).\n\nIn the early 21st century, the leaders of the CPLP believed that peace in [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]], as well as East Timor's independence, favored the development of the CPLP and a strengthening of multilateral cooperation.\n\n=== Language ===\n[[File:Minist\u00e9rio da Cultura - VII Reuni\u00e3o de Ministros da Cultura da CPLP (1).jpg|thumb|right|260px|The 7th Meeting of Ministers of Culture at [[Sintra National Palace|Sintra Palace]]; [[Portuguese Riviera]], 2010.]]\nSince many children in rural areas of Lusophone Africa and East Timor are out-of-school youth, the education officials in these regions seek help from Portugal and Brazil to increase the education to spread Portuguese fluency (like establishing [[Instituto Cam\u00f5es]] language center branches in main cities and rural towns), as Portuguese is becoming one of the main languages in [[Southern Africa]], where it is also taught in [[Namibia]] and [[South Africa]].\n\nAngola has not yet signed the [[Portuguese Language Orthographic Agreement of 1990|most recent accord on the orthography of the Portuguese language]], and has asked other [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|PALOP]] countries to support it in discussions on various points of that accord with Portugal.<ref name=\"Angop_2012-01-28_22-41\">{{cite news |url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/pt_pt/noticias/africa/2012/0/4/PALOP-reunem-margem-Cimeira-Conselho-Executivo,94ffc255-ebd6-4e59-85d4-15e1cb58405d.html |title=PALOP reunem-se \u00e0 margem da 20\u00aa Cimeira do Conselho Executivo |language=Portuguese |trans-title=PALOP countries meet at the 20th summit of the UA executive |publisher=Angop |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\nIn many developing Portuguese-speaking nations, Portuguese is the language of government and commerce which means that Portuguese-speaking people from African nations can work and communicate with others in different parts of the world, especially in Portugal and Brazil, where the economies are stronger.

On this property, in 1880, he built a [[Victorian house|Victorian style home]] which replaced his parents' center-chimney [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] house. This new home, called \"Sunnyside,\" was designed by his beloved wife Sarah Gertrude; architectural plans were drawn for her by a Mr. Bruce of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]].  The house remained in the family until the 1960s.  Its unique presence in a town of mainly colonial styled architecture, its resemblance to [[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|''The Addams Family'']] house and the years between owners when it was vacant, have perhaps helped to make it the source of speculation by locals and newcomers alike.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nWarren Brown was born in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, the only child of John Berry and Sarah March Leavitt Brown.  He was educated in the North School, Hampton Falls, the old Rockingham Academy in Hampton and [[Phillips Academy|Phillips-Andover]] Academy, Andover, MA.<ref>Brown, Warren. ''History of Hampton Falls N.H. Vol. II''. 1918. Rumford Press. [[Concord, New Hampshire]]</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nBrown married [[Sarah Gertrude Norris]] on January 1, 1867. Sarah was a native of Raymond and Dover[[Dover, New Hampshire|,]] New Hampshire and a daughter of Daniel L. Norris and [[Sophia (Osgood) Norris]], born November 17, 1841.  She was raised by her aunt Lavinia Osgood Meserve (Mrs. Samuel) in Lowell, MA where she received her education.  She subsequently moved to Hampton, NH where she taught in the public schools until her marriage. Warren and Sarah had five children:\n\n*Unnamed male (August 4, 1868 \u2013 August 4, 1868)\n*Harry Benson (June 8, 1870 \u2013 June 18, 1903)\n*Arthur Warren (July 20, 1873 \u2013 1960) married Frances Wadleigh (1881\u20131966) on October 11, 1906.\n** '''Their children:'''     \n** Charles Warren Brown (July 16, 1909)      \n** Lois Wadleigh (May 2, 1911)      \n** Harold Arthur (July 31, 1913)      \n** Elinor Frances (December 12, 1915)      \n** Ernest Norris (January 13, 1918      \n** Winthrop Marshall (February 3, 1921)\n*[[Gertrude Brown|Gertrude Norris]] (May 17, 1878 \u2013 May 17, 1896)\n* Mildred Leavitt (April 3, 1880 \u2013 December 5, 1965) married Roscoe Franklin Swain (1881\u20131946) on June 11, 1908\n** '''Their children:'''       \n** [[Marjorie Swain|Marjorie Morrill]] (July 9, 1909 \u2013 July 16, 1909)       \n** [[Pearl Marston|Pearl Elizabeth]] (February 2, 1911 \u2013 November 23, 1986)       \n** [[Kenneth Swain|Kenneth Warren]] (August 9, 1913 \u2013 September 6, 2003)       \n** [[Dorothy Swain|Dorothy G]]ertrude (June 30, 1918- February 17, 2011) Sarah Brown died on January 24, 1917, after celebrating the couple's Golden Wedding anniversary on January 1 of that year. She was eulogized by her husband as being a \"person of great executive ability and force of character.\"\n\nBrown had a lifelong interest in agricultural matters. He managed and worked one of the largest and most productive farms in Rockingham County. His farm included orchards, salt marsh, dairy cattle, sheep and gardens sufficient to maintain his family and the employees for whom he provided room and board.\n\nBrown was president of the [[New Hampshire State Agricultural Society]] for eleven years, treasurer of the [[New England Agricultural Society]] for twenty-five years, trustee of the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] for twenty-four years, including 4 years served as Chairman of the Board.\n\nIn addition to agricultural interests, Brown was active in State politics. He was a State senator from 1872 to 1873, a member of the State [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|Executive Council]] from 1879 to 1881, he served on the staff of Governor Natt Head from 1879 to 1881.  He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention at  [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1884, a State representative in 1887, and a presidential elector in [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]].\nBrown was a stock holder and active promoter of the electric railways in southern New Hampshire and owned and operated a saw mill on his estate.\n\nBrown was a true native son, descended from many of the original settlers of the NH Seacoast, and very interested in his town's history. He wrote a two-volume history of Hampton Falls: ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume I'' and ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume II''. Volume I spans from 1640 to 1900, while Volume II spans from 1900 to 1917.\n\n===Death===\nBrown died September 19, 1919.  He was buried in the family lot in the Westview Cemetery, Hampton Falls, NH. He was predeceased by his wife Sarah, his daughter Gertrude and his son Harry.\n\n==Legends==\nFor many years, a false and unfounded rumor has circulated, stating that Brown made an unsuccessful run for Governor of New Hampshire and that his Victorian style house was built in anticipation of its being a Governor's mansion.

On this property, in 1880, he built a Victorian style home which replaced his parents center chimney colonial.  This new home, called \"Sunnyside,\" was designed by his beloved wife Sarah Gertrude; architectural plans were drawn for her by a \"Mr. Bruce\" of Newburyport, MA.  The house remained in the family until the 1960s.  Its unique presence in a town of mainly colonial styled architecture, its resemblance to \"The Addams Family\" house and the years between owners when it was vacant, have perhaps helped to make it the source of speculation by locals and newcomers alike.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nWarren Brown was born in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, the only child of John Berry and Sarah March Leavitt Brown.  He was educated in the North School, Hampton Falls, the old Rockingham Academy in Hampton and [[Phillips Academy|Phillips-Andover]] Academy, Andover, MA.<ref>Brown, Warren. ''History of Hampton Falls N.H. Vol. II''. 1918. Rumford Press. [[Concord, New Hampshire]]</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nBrown married [[Sarah Gertrude Norris]] on January 1, 1867. Sarah was a native of Raymond and Dover[[Dover, New Hampshire|,]] New Hampshire and a daughter of Daniel L. Norris and [[Sophia (Osgood) Norris]], born November 17, 1841.  She was raised by her aunt Lavinia Osgood Meserve (Mrs. Samuel) in Lowell, MA where she received her education.  She subsequently moved to Hampton, NH where she taught in the public schools until her marriage. Warren and Sarah had five children:\n\n*Unnamed male (August 4, 1868 \u2013 August 4, 1868)\n*Harry Benson (June 8, 1870 \u2013 June 18, 1903)\n*Arthur Warren (July 20, 1873 \u2013 1960) married Frances Wadleigh (1881\u20131966) on October 11, 1906.\n** '''Their children:'''     \n** Charles Warren Brown (July 16, 1909)      \n** Lois Wadleigh (May 2, 1911)      \n** Harold Arthur (July 31, 1913)      \n** Elinor Frances (December 12, 1915)      \n** Ernest Norris (January 13, 1918      \n** Winthrop Marshall (February 3, 1921)\n*[[Gertrude Brown|Gertrude Norris]] (May 17, 1878 \u2013 May 17, 1896)\n* Mildred Leavitt (April 3, 1880 \u2013 December 5, 1965) married Roscoe Franklin Swain (1881\u20131946) on June 11, 1908\n** '''Their children:'''       \n** [[Marjorie Swain|Marjorie Morrill]] (July 9, 1909 \u2013 July 16, 1909)       \n** [[Pearl Marston|Pearl Elizabeth]] (February 2, 1911 \u2013 November 23, 1986)       \n** [[Kenneth Swain|Kenneth Warren]] (August 9, 1913 \u2013 September 6, 2003)       \n** [[Dorothy Swain|Dorothy G]]ertrude (June 30, 1918- February 17, 2011) Sarah Brown died on January 24, 1917, after celebrating the couple's Golden Wedding anniversary on January 1 of that year. She was eulogized by her husband as being a \"person of great executive ability and force of character.\"\n\nBrown had a lifelong interest in agricultural matters. He managed and worked one of the largest and most productive farms in Rockingham County. His farm included orchards, salt marsh, dairy cattle, sheep and gardens sufficient to maintain his family and the employees for whom he provided room and board.\n\nBrown was president of the [[New Hampshire State Agricultural Society]] for eleven years, treasurer of the [[New England Agricultural Society]] for twenty-five years, trustee of the [[New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts]] for twenty-four years, including 4 years served as Chairman of the Board.\n\nIn addition to agricultural interests, Brown was active in State politics. He was a State senator from 1872 to 1873, a member of the State [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|Executive Council]] from 1879 to 1881, he served on the staff of Governor Natt Head from 1879 to 1881.  He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention at  [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1884, a State representative in 1887, and a presidential elector in [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]].\nBrown was a stock holder and active promoter of the electric railways in southern New Hampshire and owned and operated a saw mill on his estate.\n\nBrown was a true native son, descended from many of the original settlers of the NH Seacoast, and very interested in his town's history. He wrote a two-volume history of Hampton Falls: ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume I'' and ''History of Hampton Falls, N.H. Volume II''. Volume I spans from 1640 to 1900, while Volume II spans from 1900 to 1917.\n\n===Death===\nBrown died September 19, 1919.  He was buried in the family lot in the Westview Cemetery, Hampton Falls, NH. He was predeceased by his wife Sarah, his daughter Gertrude and his son Harry.\n\n==Legends==\nFor many years, a false and unfounded rumor has circulated, stating that Brown made an unsuccessful run for Governor of New Hampshire and that his Victorian style house was built in anticipation of its being a Governor's mansion.  In truth, his wife Sarah, a woman of innovation and industry, designed Sunnyside to be a practical and beautiful home where the couple could entertain in style and operate their large estate with efficiently.

However his technique is consolidated with the bases of two different schools, [[Ettore Campogalliani]] and [[Arturo Melocchi]].\n\nMonsalve was born in the Chilean city [[Valpara\u00edso]], where he later began his studies of fine arts at the School of \"Bellas Artes\". Monsalve started his musical studies the 2001 in [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]] at the Conservatory Izidor Handler with soprano Nora Lopez Von Vriessen and tenor Mario Barrientos.

In 2004 Monsalve moved to Italy and continued his studies learning the technique of [[Ettore Campogalliani]] in [[Modena]] with one of his students, the soprano [[Mirella Freni]]. [[Ettore Campogalliani]] was also teacher of [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Ferruccio Furlanetto]], [[Ruggero Raimondi]], and other big singers. The 2007 Monsalve had private lessons with the tenor [[Dano Raffanti]], former student of the famous musicologist, critic and voice teacher [[Rodolfo Celletti]]. 2008 Monsalve had private lessons with tenor [[Lando Bartolini]], former student of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Bass [[Nicola Moscona]]. In 2009 Monsalve had a [[master class]] with the soprano [[Montserrat Caball\u00e9]] in [[Zaragoza]] to learn the  breath support of this legendary singer, and returns to Italy to learn the technique or \"method\" of [[Arturo Melocchi]], teacher of [[Mario Del Monaco]], [[Franco Corelli]] and also [[Renata Tebaldi]], with the Bass Leodino Ferri\u2020 who was one of the few last living students of Melocchi.  Same year, always in Italy, Monsalve learned the \"Del Monaco-Melocchi\" technique with who is till now his teacher, the Italian tenor [[Nicola Martinucci]], student of Marcello del Monaco and in 2010/2011 had private lessons with tenors Gianfranco Cecchele in Italy and  Corneliu Murgu in Romania, both formed students of Mario Del Monaco.\n\nMonsalve has been scenically trained with actor and Chilean director Juan Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez del Valle\u2020, renowned Chilean Actor, theater director and one of the pioneers of the Chilean street theater in the 80's and later with Hollywood Stars coach Bernard Hiller.\n\n==Career==\nMonsalve made his professional debut in Italy, with the opera ''Paolo e Francesca'' by [[Luigi Mancinelli]] in the 2006 season of the [[Teatro Comunale di Bologna]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.unibo.it/calendario/2006/paolofrancesca/locandina|title=Poster for ''Paolo e Francesca'', October 2006|format=PDF|website=Magazine.unibo.it|date= |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teatro.it/spettacoli/comunale/paolo_e_francesca_1767_5811 |title=''Paolo e Francesca'' di Luigi Mancinelli regia Massimiliano Cossati a Bologna |publisher=Teatro.it |date= |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032954/http://www.teatro.it/spettacoli/comunale/paolo_e_francesca_1767_5811 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://consultasrl.net/notizia.php?id=7840 |title=Bologna: In scena ''Paolo e Francesca''|publisher=Consultasrl.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110652/http://consultasrl.net/notizia.php?id=7840 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/massimilianobriarava/docs/massimiliano_briarava._opere_1997-2_6f22f28fc24189 |title=ISSUU \u2013 ''Paolo e Francesca'' by Massimiliano Briarava |publisher=Issuu.com |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> where he returned in 2012 for the Opera ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]''.\n\nAfter his debut Monsalve's career has spanned to major global opera houses, [[Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/performance.aspx?performance=23582&row=38 |title=Royal Opera House Collections Online \u2013 ''Tosca'' \u2013 28 June 2011 Evening 7.30pm |publisher=Rohcollections.org.uk |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> [[Arena di Verona]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arena.it/en-US/PersonnelDetailen.html?idpersonnel=11058#.VLgmSHv0fa4 |title=Giancarlo Monsalve \u2013 Arena di Verona |publisher=Arena.it |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> [[Z\u00fcrich Opera House]], [[Lausanne Opera]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opera-lausanne.ch/en/calendar/season-12-13/detail-spectacles/tosca.html |title=Opera de Lausanne \u2013 ''Tosca''|publisher=Opera-lausanne.ch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035034/http://www.opera-lausanne.ch/en/calendar/season-12-13/detail-spectacles/tosca.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Royal Opera House Muscat]] [[Sultanate of Oman]], The [[Washington National Opera]] at The [[Kennedy Center]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=15038&source_type=a |title=Giancarlo Monsalve \u2013 Explore the Arts|publisher=The John F.

However his technique is consolidated with the bases of two different schools, [[Ettore Campogalliani]] and [[Arturo Melocchi]].\n\nMonsalve was born in the Chilean city [[Valpara\u00edso]], where he later began his studies of fine arts at the School of \"Bellas Artes\". Monsalve started his musical studies the 2001 in [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]] at the Conservatory Izidor Handler with soprano Nora Lopez Von Vriessen and tenor Mario Barrientos. Lopez Von Vriessen is a former student of the Legendary Sopranos [[Gina Cigna]] and [[Maria Caniglia]]. Barrientos is a former student of the Tenor Carlos Santelices. In 2004 Monsalve moved to Italy and continued his studies learning the technique of [[Ettore Campogalliani]] in [[Modena]] with one of his students, the soprano [[Mirella Freni]]. [[Ettore Campogalliani]] was also teacher of [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Ferruccio Furlanetto]], [[Ruggero Raimondi]], and other big singers. The 2007 Monsalve had private lessons with the tenor [[Dano Raffanti]], former student of the famous musicologist, critic and voice teacher [[Rodolfo Celletti]]. 2008 Monsalve had private lessons with tenor [[Lando Bartolini]], former student of the [[Metropolitan Opera]] Bass [[Nicola Moscona]]. In 2009 Monsalve had a [[master class]] with the soprano [[Montserrat Caball\u00e9]] in [[Zaragoza]] to learn the  breath support of this legendary singer, and returns to Italy to learn the technique or \"method\" of [[Arturo Melocchi]], teacher of [[Mario Del Monaco]], [[Franco Corelli]] and also [[Renata Tebaldi]], with the Bass Leodino Ferri\u2020 who was one of the few last living students of Melocchi.  Same year, always in Italy, Monsalve learned the \"Del Monaco-Melocchi\" technique with who is till now his teacher, the Italian tenor [[Nicola Martinucci]], student of Marcello del Monaco and in 2010/2011 had private lessons with tenors Gianfranco Cecchele in Italy and  Corneliu Murgu in Romania, both formed students of Mario Del Monaco.\n\nMonsalve has been scenically trained with actor and Chilean director Juan Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez del Valle\u2020, renowned Chilean Actor, theater director and one of the pioneers of the Chilean street theater in the 80's and later with Hollywood Stars coach Bernard Hiller.\n\n==Career==\nMonsalve made his professional debut in Italy, with the opera ''Paolo e Francesca'' by [[Luigi Mancinelli]] in the 2006 season of the [[Teatro Comunale di Bologna]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.unibo.it/calendario/2006/paolofrancesca/locandina|title=Poster for ''Paolo e Francesca'', October 2006|format=PDF|website=Magazine.unibo.it|date= |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teatro.it/spettacoli/comunale/paolo_e_francesca_1767_5811 |title=''Paolo e Francesca'' di Luigi Mancinelli regia Massimiliano Cossati a Bologna |publisher=Teatro.it |date= |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032954/http://www.teatro.it/spettacoli/comunale/paolo_e_francesca_1767_5811 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://consultasrl.net/notizia.php?id=7840 |title=Bologna: In scena ''Paolo e Francesca''|publisher=Consultasrl.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110652/http://consultasrl.net/notizia.php?id=7840 |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/massimilianobriarava/docs/massimiliano_briarava._opere_1997-2_6f22f28fc24189 |title=ISSUU \u2013 ''Paolo e Francesca'' by Massimiliano Briarava |publisher=Issuu.com |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> where he returned in 2012 for the Opera ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]''.\n\nAfter his debut Monsalve's career has spanned to major global opera houses, [[Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/performance.aspx?performance=23582&row=38 |title=Royal Opera House Collections Online \u2013 ''Tosca'' \u2013 28 June 2011 Evening 7.30pm |publisher=Rohcollections.org.uk |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> [[Arena di Verona]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arena.it/en-US/PersonnelDetailen.html?idpersonnel=11058#.VLgmSHv0fa4 |title=Giancarlo Monsalve \u2013 Arena di Verona |publisher=Arena.it |date= |accessdate= }}</ref> [[Z\u00fcrich Opera House]], [[Lausanne Opera]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opera-lausanne.ch/en/calendar/season-12-13/detail-spectacles/tosca.html |title=Opera de Lausanne \u2013 ''Tosca''|publisher=Opera-lausanne.ch |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035034/http://www.opera-lausanne.ch/en/calendar/season-12-13/detail-spectacles/tosca.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Royal Opera House Muscat]] [[Sultanate of Oman]], The [[Washington National Opera]] at The [[Kennedy Center]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=15038&source_type=a |title=Giancarlo Monsalve \u2013 Explore the Arts|publisher=The John F.
