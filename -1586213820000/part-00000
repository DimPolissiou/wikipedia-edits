The history of XIV Corps in [[World War II]] dates from December 1942. Then, under [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Alexander Patch]], the XIV Army Corps directed the American [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|23rd Infantry Division]] and [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]]s, the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]], and the [[147th Infantry Regiment (United States)|147th Infantry Regimental Combat Team]] in the final drive that expelled the Japanese from [[Guadalcanal]] early in February 1943. The [[562nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment|70th Coast Artillery Regiment (Anti-Aircraft)]] landed on 23 May 1943. From air fields guarded by the XIV Army Corps, Allied aircraft began the neutralization of the enemy's vital Munda airfields on [[New Georgia]].\n\nMajor General [[Oscar Griswold]] succeeded Patch as XIV Corps commander on 26 April 1943. In a lightning campaign, which began 30 June 1943 with the invasion of [[Rendova Islands]], General Griswold's forces, which included the [[43rd Infantry Division (United States)|43rd (New England)]] and the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th (Buckeye) Infantry Division]]s with elements of the 25th Division, seized New Georgia and the important Munda airfield on 6 August. Mopping up the adjacent islands was completed and the New Georgia campaign ended on 6 October 1943. American and New Zealand aircraft operating from the Munda field began the neutralization of Kahili and other enemy airfields in [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].\n\nXIV Corps defeated the once fine [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|Japanese 17th Army]] on Bougainville in March 1944. Part of this army was the [[6th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Sixth Infantry Division]], which was considered Japan's best division in the early Chinese campaigns and played a major part in the Rape of the Chinese city of [[Nanking]] in 1937.\n\nIn the [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)]], the 37th and Americal Divisions, and two battalions of the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Fiji military forces]], were the principal combat units of XIV Corps. Elements of the [[US 93rd Infantry Division|93rd (Negro) Infantry Division]] arrived after the peak of the battle and assisted in harassing retreating Japanese troops. There were 65,000 Japanese on Bougainville when the Americans landed, of whom some 8,200 died in combat and 16,600 from illness.<ref>Long, ''The Final Campaigns'', pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe three airfields in the Bougainville perimeter were used as bases for allied aircraft that reduced the once mighty Japanese air and naval base of [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]], to an impotent outpost of the enemy's island empire. The first raid on [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], a large Japanese air and naval base in the Central Pacific, was staged through Bougainville by [[B-24 Liberator|Liberators]] of the [[Thirteenth Air Force]].\n\nFrom the Solomons campaigns, XIV Army Corps gained the nickname \"Kings of the Solomons\".\n\n==Liberators of Manila==\n\nXIV Army Corps with its initial divisions, the 37th and the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th (Sunshine) Infantry Division]], landed on the shores of [[Lingayen Gulf]], [[Luzon]], [[Philippines]], on S-Day, which was 9 January 1945. The landing was made without ground opposition as the Japanese garrison, completely surprised, fled three days before S-Day at the start of an intensive naval and aerial bombardment.\n\nMeeting sporadic resistance, the corps drove rapidly south towards [[Manila]], capturing successively [[Binmaley]], [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos]], [[Malasiqui]] and [[Tarlac]]. At Bamban, the enemy was strongly entrenched in the 40th's sector in the foothills of the [[Zambales Mountains]]. Attacking abreast, the 37th and 40th sufficiently reduced the resistance to allow the 37th to continue on to Manila. The 40th was left to contain and exterminate the stubbornly resisting Japanese.\n\nThe [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] from Guimba began a drive to Manila overrunning the towns of [[Cabanatuan]], [[Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija|Santa Rosa]] and [[Garapan]], and by 1 February 1945, the 37th and the 1st Cavalry were poised north of Manila ready for the battle for the Philippines' capital city.\n\nOn 2 February, elements of the [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]] made an airborne and amphibious invasion of Nasugbu on the west coast of Batangas Province, 32 miles southwest of the former American naval base of [[Cavite]]. This move was to seal off the Japanese forces south of Manila. The 11th, passing to XIV Corps control, began a push toward a junction with columns of the 37th and 1st Cavalry and support them by [[Filipino]] ground troops under the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and recognized [[guerrilla]] groups.\n\nOn 3 February, the 1st Cavalry entered Manila liberating 3,700 American internees at Santo Tomas and the next day soldiers of the 37th marched into [[Bilibid Prison]] freeing 800 American civilians and soldiers captured on [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor]] in 1941.\n\nResistance was quickly reduced north of the [[Pasig River]], but the Japanese fought ferociously in Southern Manila. American Forces of the 37th, 1st Cavalry and 11th Airborne and Filipino forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units and local guerrilla fighters joined up in Manila on 13 February. Meanwhile, the [[6th Infantry Division (United States)|6th (Red Star) Infantry Division]] joined XIV Corps on 17 February and attacked well fortified enemy forces in the Shimbu Line east of Manila. In an amphibious, air, para-troop, ground assault, elements of the 11th Airborne Division aided by elements of XIV Corps Special Troops, freed 2,100 American internees from [[Los Banos Prison Camp]], 23 February.\n\nMain enemy resistance collapsed with the taking of the ancient walled city of [[Intramuros]] on 24 February by the U.S. 37th Division and aiding Philippine Commonwealth Army units and recognized guerrillas. Mopping up was completed in three public building that had been fortified by the Japanese and in [[Manila Bay]], where Japanese has set up defenses in the hulks of sunken ships.\n\nThe cleanup of Southern Luzon with the 1st Cavalry and the 11th Airborne comprising major corps units was begun 15 March, and by 20 May the area was declared free of Japanese organized resistance. Then on 1 July, the corps with the 6th, [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd (Red Arrow)]], 37th and [[38th Infantry Division (United States)|38th (Cyclone) Division]] began the cleanup of Northern Luzon.\n\n==Campaign credits and postwar service==\n\nXIV Corps is credited with service in the Guadalcanal, Northern Solomons, Bismarck Archipelago, and Luzon Campaigns. Subsequent to World War II, XIV Corps was active in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], from 1957 to 1968.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Wilson, John B., compiler (1999). \"Armies, Corps, Divisions, and Separate Brigades\".
