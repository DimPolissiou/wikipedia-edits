He became the first ever directly elected president of Yonsei University's student council. While he was the president of the student council, Song participated in the democratic movement with students from other universities. In 1985, Song was sent to prison for one-and-a-half years for violating the Law on Assembly and Demonstration.\nFollowing his release, Song worked as a laborer, including time as a welder for Daewoo Motor, and as a taxi driver for 7 years. At the age of 30, he took the National Bar Examination to challenge human rights violations and improve unfair treatment of the underprivileged.\nAfter passing the exam, he became an active human rights lawyer working alongside the weak and the poor. In 1999, in order to further help those in need, he ran in the 1999 by-elections, but lost. He was later elected as a National Assemblyman in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 general elections.\nAs a lawmaker, his activities include a member of Special Committees on the Historical Distortion of Japanese Textbooks, Against the Iraq War, the Korea-US FTA, and KIKO.\nHe was also a member of the Legislation & Judiciary Committee and the Finance & Economy Committee. When he was member of the National Assembly's Committee on Health, Welfare and Information and a Supreme Council Member of the Democratic Party, he ran in the Incheon mayoral election and was elected Mayor on June 2, 2010.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/06/116_66993.html|work=The Korea Times|title=Ruling camp leaders resign over local elections defeat|date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nSong, Young Gil was born in Goheung, South Jeolla Province, the fourth son of a poor civil servant. He grew up in a rural area and was inspired by nature. In May 1980 when he was a senior high school student, he witnessed the Gwangju Democratization Movement. Seeing the deaths of innocent citizens with his own eyes marked a turning point in his life. After entering Yonsei University to study business management in 1981, he joined the anti-dictatorship movement without any hesitation. In 1984, he succeeded in removing the government-controlled student body and reinstated the student council. He subsequently became the first ever directly elected president of the student council and thereafter led the student democratization movement. He was jailed as a result. In 1988, he was recognized for his contribution to democratization and had his rights reinstated.\n\n===Labor movement===\nAfter release from jail in 1985, Song moved to Incheon to start life as a laborer. He became a welder at the Daewoo Motor factory in Incheon. He also worked in watch, glove, and furniture factories for two years to experience the hardships of laborers. In 1987 with the support of Germany's human rights foundation \u2018Bread for the World\u2019 and Kim, Dae-joong, Kim, Young-sam and other politicians, Song established \u2018Christian Public Education Research Institutes\u2019 in Bupyeong, Incheon. Song conducted legal counseling for human rights violations, education on labor unions, and provided legal support. While working as a taxi driver, he democratized the Taxi Labor Union and became the first Secretary-General of the National Taxi Trade Union, Incheon Division in 1991. He dedicated himself in promoting the rights of transportation laborers.\n\n===Human rights lawyer===\nSong realized the reality that laborers were treated badly and that their human rights were violated, and he sought to help them. After passing the National Bar Examination in 1994, he went to Incheon to keep the promise he had made to his colleagues. He worked hard as a human rights lawyer. For the poor workers, he provided 500 free legal services. Song proved the innocence of workers who were falsely charged and won compensation for street vendors who had been unjustly killed. Although he was poor, he felt rewarded because he was able to help colleagues who were with him during those difficult times.\n\n===Political career===\nThe more Song became active as a human rights lawyer, the more he wanted to improve the legal systems and institutions for the underprivileged. After much thought, he ran in the 1999 by-election to help people in need but lost because the general public was disenchanted by politics at the time. A day after the defeat, Song climbed up a mountain early in the morning to absorb the defeat and reflect on the opinions of the voters. It is said that a period of wandering and defeat matures the soul, and Song acknowledges this was the case during this period of self-reflection. Shortly afterwards, Song began his career as a National Assemblyman in 2000 with a new determination to serve in the interests of the general public.\n\n====Human rights activities====\nBased on his experience as a lawyer, Song applied to work for the Legislation & Judiciary Committee to take care of bills that are closely related to the people's livelihood and human rights. Years of experience as a labor movement activist and human rights lawyer were the inspiration for his parliamentary activities and made him more interested in human rights and democracy. As a part of such efforts, Song led a National assembly delegation which attended a Human Rights and Parliamentary Conference for the five Northeast Asian nations which was held in Mongolia. At the conference, he made a speech about the human rights situation in Korea and proposed legislation on anti-humanitarian crimes. As a member of the Legislation & Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly, Song played a crucial role in creating a law on the National Human Rights Commission. Song also assumed the role of Chairman of the Democratic Party's Commission on the Yong-san Tragedy to negotiate with the government and Seoul City over much delayed compensation and funeral issues.\n\n====Correcting distorted history====\nEvents during the Japanese colonization of Korea have been thorny issues for decades, including the issue of compensation for Korean comfort women used by the Japanese army, the distorted history which appears in Japanese textbooks, and the name and territorial rights over the islet of Dokdo. Japan has distorted its history textbooks and made reckless remarks on Dokdo without an official apology to the Korean comfort women who suffered enormous physical and psychological pain. In response to this, Song proposed a resolution on the distortion of Japanese history books and the elimination of vestiges of the Japanese colonial period with other lawmakers, calling for immediate action by the Korean government. In 2001, through the activities of a special committee, Song sent CDs containing information on Japan's invasion, comfort women and the distortion of Japanese history books to 600 overseas institutions, demanding Japan's apology and asking for the support of other nations. In addition to calling for Japan's apology, Song attended the Joint Conference of the Korea-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Council and proposed a statement which sought ways for Korea and Japan to cooperate in diverse areas as new partners. As such, Song has underscored a more accurate perception of history and contributed to a future-oriented partnership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20051102000042|work=koreaherald|title=Korea concerned over japan's cabinet|date=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-Iraq War and peace====\nIn 2003, the Bush administration invaded Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction without legitimate reason. All people of conscience opposed the war and demanded peace. For Korea, which is faced with the nuclear weapons development of North Korea, the US invasion of Iraq was not something that they could ignore. Amid the government's lukewarm attitude due to the Korea-US alliance, Song and other lawmakers agreed that they needed to take action as lawmakers. Starting with an understanding on the Iraq situation, they drafted an anti-war statement and resolution urging others to join. After that, they formed an Iraq Fact Finding Team led by Song to visit Iraq in order to possibly find a peaceful resolution through the extension of UN weapons inspectors and promote Korean lawmakers\u2019 support for a peaceful resolution of the Iraq War to the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe lawmakers met the Iraq Congress President Hammadi and Chairman Kubaisai of the Diplomatic Commission of the Iraq Congress to express their opinion that Iraq could avoid the war by complying with UN regulations which would increase its credibility among international society. They held a press conference to announce their statement against the US attack on Iraq and their message supporting peace. Song also met NGO groups to offer unsparing encouragement and support for their activities.\nSince then, Song has continued his efforts for peace including sending messages of peace to the Pope and Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa. As the secretary of the Special Committee on the Korean Killed by Terrorists in Iraq, he visited Iraq again and urged the world to act to prevent war and bring peace where justice and freedom would prevail.\n\n====Support for Myanmar's democratization movement====\nSong has been well aware of the dismal situation in Myanmar where democracy has been dampened by military juntas and human rights have been violated. He had experienced a similar situation during the Gwangju Democratic Movement when he was a student, which allowed him to understand the activities of the Korean branch of the Myanmar Democratization Alliance. He thought that there should be keen interest in and support for Myanmar from the whole world as well as Korea, and has cooperated with it since 2003. In 2007, he and 13 lawmakers who were dedicated to the democratization of Korea during the dictatorship in the 1980s jointly proposed a resolution that supported the democratization of Myanmar and donated money that had been raised to the Korean branch of the Myanmar Democratization Alliance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/uden/entry/korea_marks_64th_birthday_of|work=time|title=Martin Uden|date=2009-06-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727141208/http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/uden/entry/korea_marks_64th_birthday_of|archive-date=2011-07-27|df=}}</ref> In October 2008, they announced a resolution which called for the release of Aungsan Suchi from house arrest and expressed support for the Myanmare people who continued to struggle against the junta. They also sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban, Ki-moon and Myanmar military regime to urge the democratization of Myanmar. In 2011 after Song became Incheon Mayor, he made a phone call to Aungsan Suchi after her release from long house arrest to pay his respects to her dedication and noble spirit toward democracy, and to request that she visit Incheon during the Asian Games Incheon 2014.\n\n====Inter-Korean exchanges====\nSong has said that to prepare for reunification and to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the South needs to increase similarities through economic, political and cultural exchanges with the North, which would help the North Korean economy increase its self-reliance. He believes that to bring lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula, new changes are much needed. In this context, Song went to Pyeongyang with young businessmen in 2003 and discussed the possibility of expanding economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two Koreas.\nSong has also visited Gaeseong Industrial Complex several times which has been playing a critical role in ensuring the self-reliance of North Korea and contributing to peace on the Korean Peninsula and in the world. Through these visits, he saw for himself the importance of Gaeseong Industrial Complex for Korean small enterprises as new sales channels. He held meetings with businessmen and government officials to encourage more companies to move to the North which might in turn induce the communist nation to introduce reform and openness.\nSong and the Democratic Party urged the government to carry out what had been agreed upon in the June 15 and October 4 Joint Declaration to improve relations between the two Koreas which had been strained by the tough stance of the current administration on North Korea. He also called on the government to enter dialogue with the North and to closely cooperate with neighboring countries to form 6-party talks which play such a vital role in the joint security of Northeast Asia.\nAfter becoming Incheon Mayor in 2010, Mayor Song declared Incheon to be the outpost of reconciliation, exchanges, peace and reunification of the two Koreas. Despite opposition from the government, he has insisted that there should be peace on the 5 islands near the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea for the economic development of Incheon. At the same time, Song has provided products to mothers and babies in North Korea through an agreement with the Korea Peace Foundation, which opened a door that was shut after the North's [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the ''Cheonan'']].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20101112000630|work=The Korea Herald|title=Pivotal role for Korea in N.E. Asia integration|date=November 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Stimulating the economy====\nBased on his experience as a laborer and a taxi driver, Song believes that a lawmaker should be a good listener who is in touch with the difficulties and opinions of the general public. Song has tried to minimize damage to the economy which would directly impact the lives of commoners. As such, he doesn't want to focus on a few large companies and would rather focus on helping the livelihoods of ordinary people. He proposed bills to exempt value added tax on rental fees for traditional market vendors in order to nurture traditional markets. He also submitted bills to prevent excessive increases in rental fees and protect the tenants of commercial buildings. He is dedicated to helping the underprivileged and middle classes.\n\n====Enhancing competitiveness for small and medium enterprises====\nWhile working for 6 years as a member of the Finance & Economy Committee in the National Assembly, Song felt that the main driver of Korea's economy came from the small companies which account for 80% of all companies and therefore that the most important thing is to lay down foundations for those firms to grow. In 2008, most small exporting firms bought currency option products called KIKO (Knock-in Knock-out) to avoid the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/04/123_31423.html|work=The Korea Times|title=banks Hit for transferring currency Loss to small firms|date=2008-09-22}}</ref> The companies were about to collapse again due to the inappropriate exchange rate policy of the current government but the government didn't take the proper measures to rescue small companies. Song urged the Democratic Party to pay keen interest in this issue and to find solutions. By forming a special committee, he held dozens of meetings with small enterprises and led hearings to narrow differences and find solutions. In due course, he got a promise from the government to provide speedy support for small enterprises which performed well.\n\n====Diplomatic activities====\nIn this globalized world, the problems of one nation are no longer limited to one nation. Song has long believed that the world needs to share diverse global issues through multi-channel dialogues to deal with its problems and through exchanges we need to understand and cooperate with each other. He has met with a lot of foreign leaders through many friendly activities after becoming a National Assemblyman. In particular, he became the Chairman of the Korean-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Council's 21st Century Committee in 2004, and consequently held discussions and conferences on the various issues concerning Korea and Japan. He was also the Chairman of the Korea-France Parliaments\u2019 Friendship Association and led active exchanges to promote knowledge about the EU and France. In 2007, he received L\u00e9gion d'Honneur Chevalier from France for his dedication in promoting relations between Korea and France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090302000059|work=The Korea Herald|title=386er knighted|date= 2010-03-30}}</ref>\nAfter his second term, Song realized the importance of diplomacy and visited and received other nations in order to increase exchanges and deepen the understanding of the US, Australia, China and other neighboring nations.\nWhen the Korea-US FTA negotiations began in 2006, Song became the Chairman of the Uri Party's Special Committee on the Korea-US FTA in order to reflect the opinions of stakeholders and to take measures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vop.co.kr/A00000049562.html|work=Minjung ui Sori|title=US should not exclude KIC in the KORUS FTA|date=2006-08-24}}</ref> As such, he was able to expand exchanges with US officials including negotiation delegates and US congressmen. As the recognition of products from Gaesong Industrial Complex as Korean products became a hot issue, Song exchanged opinions on Gaeseong Industrial Complex that could help North Korea's self-reliance and guarantee peace on the Korean Peninsula. In 2007, at the invitation of a US senator, he attended a reception marking the opening of the US Congress and discussed the Korea-US FTA, the North Korean nuclear program, and peace on the Korean Peninsula with then presidential nominee Obama, Senator Biden and other congressmen of the Democratic Party.\nIn 2008, the results of the US presidential election and the Democratic Party's regaining control after 8 years demanded new cooperation and close exchanges between Korea and the US. Song formed a Special Committee on Korea-US Relations Development and as chairman he endeavored to establish balanced diplomatic relations between Korea and the US, develop inter-Korean relations, enhance the Korea-US alliance, and promote economic cooperation including the Korea-US FTA.\n\n===Incheon mayoral election===\nWhen he declared his intention to run in the Incheon mayoral election, Song explained that he was running to win. At that time, the victory of the Democratic Party in the three metropolitan areas of Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Incheon was uncertain, but he made it clear that he would win in Incheon, triggering victories in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, which will lay the foundations for a change of administration.\nWith the announcement of his running, Song talked about his plans for nurturing small enterprises, balancing development between the old and new town, expanding welfare provision, enhancing educational competitiveness, and providing free eco-friendly meals to make Incheon the economic capital of Korea.\nlink\n<ref>http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=003&aid=0003182610</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100714000607|work=koreaherald|title=Development of incheon crucial for nation's future|date=2010-07-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Invitation of the UNGCF Secretariat ===\n\nThe challenges of climate change necessitate a transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathway. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is expected to promote such a transition by providing support to developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. Meaningful progress will be made through a combination of long-term commitments and immediate action based on international cooperation.\n\nKorea officially delivered is intention to host the GCF Secretariat in November 2011, and also selected Songdo of Incheon to be the host city of the office in March 2012.\n\nGreen Climate Fund\n\n-History\n\nAt the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Cancun, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December 2010, the Parties decided to establish the Green Climate Fund.\n\nBy the same decision, the COP decided that the Green Climate Fund would be designed by a Transitional Committee.\n\nThe Transitional Committee comprised 40 members (15 members from developed country Parties and 25 members from developing country Parties). It met four times in the course of 2011 and, in accordance with its terms of reference, submitted to the COP at its 17th session in Durban, South Africa, from 28 November to 9 December 2011, the report for its consideration and approval.\n\nSongdo was selected as the host city of the UNGCF Secretariat at the 2nd GCF Board Meeting on October 20, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=Korea aims to be leader in green growth  |url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/11/117_123611.html|publisher=The korea times |date=2012-10-31}}</ref>\n\n-Composition\n\nThe Fund has 24-board members, the Secretariat and 194 member nations.\n\n-Scale of the Secretariat\n\nThe Secretariat is expected to have 300 to 500 employees in the initial period, which will rise to over 8,000 once the fund gets up and running.\n\n-Rationale for the selection of Incheon as the host city\n\nIncheon is a hub city of economy, logistics and trade in Northeast Asia. There are 61 cities of more than 1 million people with access to 2 billion people within a 3-hour flight of the city.\n\nBy vigorously nurturing logistics, tourism, leisure, IT and BT industries, Incheon is developing into the leading hub city of Northeast Asia and the heart and business hub of Korea. Much of its development is centered on Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port.\n\n-The optimal location for the UNGCF Secretariat.\n\nSongdo International City boasts state-of-the-art working conditions. It has international schools, a Global University Campus and its own Central Park. As such, it is well equipped with education and medical services, accommodation provision, MICE, and parks. In addition, it has garnered attention from around the world as a low-carbon, eco-friendly city. Songdo International City at once embodies the goal of the Green Climate Fund, and provides foreigner-friendly living conditions as a compact, smart city.\n\n-A new growth engine for Incheon\n\nThe KDI (Korea Development Institute) has estimated that the economic benefit of the UNGCF Secretariat to be 380 billion won a year in the initial stage. The IDI (Incheon Development Institute) has forecasted that the direct economic effect to Incheon will reach 190 billion won a year.\nIn addition, hosting the GCF will create new businesses in green financing, green technology industries, and green products, increasing the direct and indirect economic effects.\n\nIn particular, it will increase Incheon's brand value as a low carbon green growth model city and contribute to boosting investment in Incheon Free Economic Zone. The decision to establish such a major international organization in the city will contribute to easing inter-Korean relations and develop Incheon's role as a bridge between developing and developed nations. The influence of Korea in international society is also expected to grow gradually as a result of the decision to locate the GCF Secretariat in Songdo.\n\n=== [[Tsinghua University]] ===\nSong ran for 6th local election (Incheon mayoral election) in 2014. After losing the election against Yoo, Jeong Bok by 1.75%, He decided to study abroad at Tsinghua University in China. While he was studying at Tsinghua University, his research foci were the issues of housing, jobs and welfare system. He returned to Korea in 2015. Following October, he launched \u2018eat and live\u2019 research lab to further develop his research at Tsinghua University into policies\n\n=== Member of the 20th National Assembly ===\nOn 1 March 2016, Song declared that he is running for the National Assembly as a Democrat in Incheon's Gyeyang (B) constituency, which he represented in previous years. He considered running in competitive constituency. However, he decided to run in Gyeyang (B) after assemblyman Choi, Won Sik leaves the Democratic Party despite Song's persuasion to stay. Song declared that he will run for the party leadership after the general election and he said that he takes the full responsibility of the entire elections in Incheon and will recover the Incheon politics. On 13 April 2016, he won the post by 12% against Yoon, Hyung-sun of Saenuri Party. He returned to the National Assembly after 6 years since he ran for the 5th General election in 2010\n\nOn 24 July 2016, He declared his running for the party leadership. He pledged to devote himself to make the Party into a \u2018strong\u2019 opposition and to replace the Saenuri government in the upcoming presidential election. He was considered to be the leading candidate who represented the wide mainstream democrats. However, he lost the primary election. Political commentators analyze Song's [[Election threshold|'cut-off']]  with two reasons, disparity of \u2018pro-Roh\u2019 (pro-[[Roh Moo-hyun|Roh, Moo-Hyun]]) voters and the very last minute leadership bid waged by Lee, Jong-kul, which gathered strong \u2018non-Roh\u2019 voters.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, Song joined [[Moon Jae-in|Moon, Jae-in's]] campaign for [[2017 South Korean presidential election|the 19th Presidential Election]] as chief campaign manager. It is later known that Moon persuaded Song several times to join his presidential campaign. Song commented that \u201cI also considered running for the presidential election, however, I decided to cooperate with Moon to replace the government and believe that helping Moon is answering the call of the people of Republic of Korea\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00006&news_seq_no=3136907|title=\ubb38 \uc804 \ub300\ud45c \uc0bc\uace0\ucd08\ub824\ub85c '\ucd1d\uad04\ubcf8\ubd80\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc1a1\uc601\uae38' \uc601\uc785|last=|first=|date=|website=mbn.mk.co.kr|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of Moon's presidency, Song has been designated as the special envoy of President Moon Jae-in to the Russian Federation in May 2017.

He became the first ever directly elected president of Yonsei University's student council. While he was the president of the student council, Song participated in the democratic movement with students from other universities. In 1985, Song was sent to prison for one-and-a-half years for violating the Law on Assembly and Demonstration.\nFollowing his release, Song worked as a laborer, including time as a welder for Daewoo Motor, and as a taxi driver for 7 years. At the age of 30, he took the National Bar Examination to challenge human rights violations and improve unfair treatment of the underprivileged.\nAfter passing the exam, he became an active human rights lawyer working alongside the weak and the poor. In 1999, in order to further help those in need, he ran in the 1999 by-elections, but lost. He was later elected as a National Assemblyman in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 general elections.\nAs a lawmaker, his activities include a member of Special Committees on the Historical Distortion of Japanese Textbooks, Against the Iraq War, the Korea-US FTA, and KIKO.\nHe was also a member of the Legislation & Judiciary Committee and the Finance & Economy Committee. When he was member of the National Assembly's Committee on Health, Welfare and Information and a Supreme Council Member of the Democratic Party, he ran in the Incheon mayoral election and was elected Mayor on June 2, 2010.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/06/116_66993.html|work=The Korea Times|title=Ruling camp leaders resign over local elections defeat|date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nSong, Young Gil was born in Goheung, South Jeolla Province, the fourth son of a poor civil servant. He grew up in a rural area and was inspired by nature. In May 1980 when he was a senior high school student, he witnessed the Gwangju Democratization Movement. Seeing the deaths of innocent citizens with his own eyes marked a turning point in his life. After entering Yonsei University to study business management in 1981, he joined the anti-dictatorship movement without any hesitation. In 1984, he succeeded in removing the government-controlled student body and reinstated the student council. He subsequently became the first ever directly elected president of the student council and thereafter led the student democratization movement. He was jailed as a result. In 1988, he was recognized for his contribution to democratization and had his rights reinstated.\n\n===Labor movement===\nAfter release from jail in 1985, Song moved to Incheon to start life as a laborer. He became a welder at the Daewoo Motor factory in Incheon. He also worked in watch, glove, and furniture factories for two years to experience the hardships of laborers. In 1987 with the support of Germany's human rights foundation \u2018Bread for the World\u2019 and Kim, Dae-joong, Kim, Young-sam and other politicians, Song established \u2018Christian Public Education Research Institutes\u2019 in Bupyeong, Incheon. Song conducted legal counseling for human rights violations, education on labor unions, and provided legal support. While working as a taxi driver, he democratized the Taxi Labor Union and became the first Secretary-General of the National Taxi Trade Union, Incheon Division in 1991. He dedicated himself in promoting the rights of transportation laborers.\n\n===Human rights lawyer===\nSong realized the reality that laborers were treated badly and that their human rights were violated, and he sought to help them. After passing the National Bar Examination in 1994, he went to Incheon to keep the promise he had made to his colleagues. He worked hard as a human rights lawyer. For the poor workers, he provided 500 free legal services. Song proved the innocence of workers who were falsely charged and won compensation for street vendors who had been unjustly killed. Although he was poor, he felt rewarded because he was able to help colleagues who were with him during those difficult times.\n\n===Political career===\nThe more Song became active as a human rights lawyer, the more he wanted to improve the legal systems and institutions for the underprivileged. After much thought, he ran in the 1999 by-election to help people in need but lost because the general public was disenchanted by politics at the time. A day after the defeat, Song climbed up a mountain early in the morning to absorb the defeat and reflect on the opinions of the voters. It is said that a period of wandering and defeat matures the soul, and Song acknowledges this was the case during this period of self-reflection. Shortly afterwards, Song began his career as a National Assemblyman in 2000 with a new determination to serve in the interests of the general public.\n\n====Human rights activities====\nBased on his experience as a lawyer, Song applied to work for the Legislation & Judiciary Committee to take care of bills that are closely related to the people's livelihood and human rights. Years of experience as a labor movement activist and human rights lawyer were the inspiration for his parliamentary activities and made him more interested in human rights and democracy. As a part of such efforts, Song led a National assembly delegation which attended a Human Rights and Parliamentary Conference for the five Northeast Asian nations which was held in Mongolia. At the conference, he made a speech about the human rights situation in Korea and proposed legislation on anti-humanitarian crimes. As a member of the Legislation & Judiciary Committee of the National Assembly, Song played a crucial role in creating a law on the National Human Rights Commission. Song also assumed the role of Chairman of the Democratic Party's Commission on the Yong-san Tragedy to negotiate with the government and Seoul City over much delayed compensation and funeral issues.\n\n====Correcting distorted history====\nEvents during the Japanese colonization of Korea have been thorny issues for decades, including the issue of compensation for Korean comfort women used by the Japanese army, the distorted history which appears in Japanese textbooks, and the name and territorial rights over the islet of Dokdo. Japan has distorted its history textbooks and made reckless remarks on Dokdo without an official apology to the Korean comfort women who suffered enormous physical and psychological pain. In response to this, Song proposed a resolution on the distortion of Japanese history books and the elimination of vestiges of the Japanese colonial period with other lawmakers, calling for immediate action by the Korean government. In 2001, through the activities of a special committee, Song sent CDs containing information on Japan's invasion, comfort women and the distortion of Japanese history books to 600 overseas institutions, demanding Japan's apology and asking for the support of other nations. In addition to calling for Japan's apology, Song attended the Joint Conference of the Korea-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Council and proposed a statement which sought ways for Korea and Japan to cooperate in diverse areas as new partners. As such, Song has underscored a more accurate perception of history and contributed to a future-oriented partnership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20051102000042|work=koreaherald|title=Korea concerned over japan's cabinet|date=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\n====Anti-Iraq War and peace====\nIn 2003, the Bush administration invaded Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction without legitimate reason. All people of conscience opposed the war and demanded peace. For Korea, which is faced with the nuclear weapons development of North Korea, the US invasion of Iraq was not something that they could ignore. Amid the government's lukewarm attitude due to the Korea-US alliance, Song and other lawmakers agreed that they needed to take action as lawmakers. Starting with an understanding on the Iraq situation, they drafted an anti-war statement and resolution urging others to join. After that, they formed an Iraq Fact Finding Team led by Song to visit Iraq in order to possibly find a peaceful resolution through the extension of UN weapons inspectors and promote Korean lawmakers\u2019 support for a peaceful resolution of the Iraq War to the world.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe lawmakers met the Iraq Congress President Hammadi and Chairman Kubaisai of the Diplomatic Commission of the Iraq Congress to express their opinion that Iraq could avoid the war by complying with UN regulations which would increase its credibility among international society. They held a press conference to announce their statement against the US attack on Iraq and their message supporting peace. Song also met NGO groups to offer unsparing encouragement and support for their activities.\nSince then, Song has continued his efforts for peace including sending messages of peace to the Pope and Nelson Mandela, the former President of South Africa. As the secretary of the Special Committee on the Korean Killed by Terrorists in Iraq, he visited Iraq again and urged the world to act to prevent war and bring peace where justice and freedom would prevail.\n\n====Support for Myanmar's democratization movement====\nSong has been well aware of the dismal situation in Myanmar where democracy has been dampened by military juntas and human rights have been violated. He had experienced a similar situation during the Gwangju Democratic Movement when he was a student, which allowed him to understand the activities of the Korean branch of the Myanmar Democratization Alliance. He thought that there should be keen interest in and support for Myanmar from the whole world as well as Korea, and has cooperated with it since 2003. In 2007, he and 13 lawmakers who were dedicated to the democratization of Korea during the dictatorship in the 1980s jointly proposed a resolution that supported the democratization of Myanmar and donated money that had been raised to the Korean branch of the Myanmar Democratization Alliance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/uden/entry/korea_marks_64th_birthday_of|work=time|title=Martin Uden|date=2009-06-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727141208/http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/roller/uden/entry/korea_marks_64th_birthday_of|archive-date=2011-07-27|df=}}</ref> In October 2008, they announced a resolution which called for the release of Aungsan Suchi from house arrest and expressed support for the Myanmare people who continued to struggle against the junta. They also sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban, Ki-moon and Myanmar military regime to urge the democratization of Myanmar. In 2011 after Song became Incheon Mayor, he made a phone call to Aungsan Suchi after her release from long house arrest to pay his respects to her dedication and noble spirit toward democracy, and to request that she visit Incheon during the Asian Games Incheon 2014.\n\n====Inter-Korean exchanges====\nSong has said that to prepare for reunification and to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the South needs to increase similarities through economic, political and cultural exchanges with the North, which would help the North Korean economy increase its self-reliance. He believes that to bring lasting peace to the Korean Peninsula, new changes are much needed. In this context, Song went to Pyeongyang with young businessmen in 2003 and discussed the possibility of expanding economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two Koreas.\nSong has also visited Gaeseong Industrial Complex several times which has been playing a critical role in ensuring the self-reliance of North Korea and contributing to peace on the Korean Peninsula and in the world. Through these visits, he saw for himself the importance of Gaeseong Industrial Complex for Korean small enterprises as new sales channels. He held meetings with businessmen and government officials to encourage more companies to move to the North which might in turn induce the communist nation to introduce reform and openness.\nSong and the Democratic Party urged the government to carry out what had been agreed upon in the June 15 and October 4 Joint Declaration to improve relations between the two Koreas which had been strained by the tough stance of the current administration on North Korea. He also called on the government to enter dialogue with the North and to closely cooperate with neighboring countries to form 6-party talks which play such a vital role in the joint security of Northeast Asia.\nAfter becoming Incheon Mayor in 2010, Mayor Song declared Incheon to be the outpost of reconciliation, exchanges, peace and reunification of the two Koreas. Despite opposition from the government, he has insisted that there should be peace on the 5 islands near the Northern Limit Line in the West Sea for the economic development of Incheon. At the same time, Song has provided products to mothers and babies in North Korea through an agreement with the Korea Peace Foundation, which opened a door that was shut after the North's [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|sinking of the ''Cheonan'']].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20101112000630|work=The Korea Herald|title=Pivotal role for Korea in N.E. Asia integration|date=November 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Stimulating the economy====\nBased on his experience as a laborer and a taxi driver, Song believes that a lawmaker should be a good listener who is in touch with the difficulties and opinions of the general public. Song has tried to minimize damage to the economy which would directly impact the lives of commoners. As such, he doesn't want to focus on a few large companies and would rather focus on helping the livelihoods of ordinary people. He proposed bills to exempt value added tax on rental fees for traditional market vendors in order to nurture traditional markets. He also submitted bills to prevent excessive increases in rental fees and protect the tenants of commercial buildings. He is dedicated to helping the underprivileged and middle classes.\n\n====Enhancing competitiveness for small and medium enterprises====\nWhile working for 6 years as a member of the Finance & Economy Committee in the National Assembly, Song felt that the main driver of Korea's economy came from the small companies which account for 80% of all companies and therefore that the most important thing is to lay down foundations for those firms to grow. In 2008, most small exporting firms bought currency option products called KIKO (Knock-in Knock-out) to avoid the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/04/123_31423.html|work=The Korea Times|title=banks Hit for transferring currency Loss to small firms|date=2008-09-22}}</ref> The companies were about to collapse again due to the inappropriate exchange rate policy of the current government but the government didn't take the proper measures to rescue small companies. Song urged the Democratic Party to pay keen interest in this issue and to find solutions. By forming a special committee, he held dozens of meetings with small enterprises and led hearings to narrow differences and find solutions. In due course, he got a promise from the government to provide speedy support for small enterprises which performed well.\n\n====Diplomatic activities====\nIn this globalized world, the problems of one nation are no longer limited to one nation. Song has long believed that the world needs to share diverse global issues through multi-channel dialogues to deal with its problems and through exchanges we need to understand and cooperate with each other. He has met with a lot of foreign leaders through many friendly activities after becoming a National Assemblyman. In particular, he became the Chairman of the Korean-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Council's 21st Century Committee in 2004, and consequently held discussions and conferences on the various issues concerning Korea and Japan. He was also the Chairman of the Korea-France Parliaments\u2019 Friendship Association and led active exchanges to promote knowledge about the EU and France. In 2007, he received L\u00e9gion d'Honneur Chevalier from France for his dedication in promoting relations between Korea and France.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090302000059|work=The Korea Herald|title=386er knighted|date= 2010-03-30}}</ref>\nAfter his second term, Song realized the importance of diplomacy and visited and received other nations in order to increase exchanges and deepen the understanding of the US, Australia, China and other neighboring nations.\nWhen the Korea-US FTA negotiations began in 2006, Song became the Chairman of the Uri Party's Special Committee on the Korea-US FTA in order to reflect the opinions of stakeholders and to take measures.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vop.co.kr/A00000049562.html|work=Minjung ui Sori|title=US should not exclude KIC in the KORUS FTA|date=2006-08-24}}</ref> As such, he was able to expand exchanges with US officials including negotiation delegates and US congressmen. As the recognition of products from Gaesong Industrial Complex as Korean products became a hot issue, Song exchanged opinions on Gaeseong Industrial Complex that could help North Korea's self-reliance and guarantee peace on the Korean Peninsula. In 2007, at the invitation of a US senator, he attended a reception marking the opening of the US Congress and discussed the Korea-US FTA, the North Korean nuclear program, and peace on the Korean Peninsula with then presidential nominee Obama, Senator Biden and other congressmen of the Democratic Party.\nIn 2008, the results of the US presidential election and the Democratic Party's regaining control after 8 years demanded new cooperation and close exchanges between Korea and the US. Song formed a Special Committee on Korea-US Relations Development and as chairman he endeavored to establish balanced diplomatic relations between Korea and the US, develop inter-Korean relations, enhance the Korea-US alliance, and promote economic cooperation including the Korea-US FTA.\n\n===Incheon mayoral election===\nWhen he declared his intention to run in the Incheon mayoral election, Song explained that he was running to win. At that time, the victory of the Democratic Party in the three metropolitan areas of Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Incheon was uncertain, but he made it clear that he would win in Incheon, triggering victories in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, which will lay the foundations for a change of administration.\nWith the announcement of his running, Song talked about his plans for nurturing small enterprises, balancing development between the old and new town, expanding welfare provision, enhancing educational competitiveness, and providing free eco-friendly meals to make Incheon the economic capital of Korea.\nlink\n<ref>http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&mid=sec&sid1=100&oid=003&aid=0003182610</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20100714000607|work=koreaherald|title=Development of incheon crucial for nation's future|date=2010-07-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Invitation of the UNGCF Secretariat ===\n\nThe challenges of climate change necessitate a transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient development pathway. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is expected to promote such a transition by providing support to developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change. Meaningful progress will be made through a combination of long-term commitments and immediate action based on international cooperation.\n\nKorea officially delivered is intention to host the GCF Secretariat in November 2011, and also selected Songdo of Incheon to be the host city of the office in March 2012.\n\nGreen Climate Fund\n\n-History\n\nAt the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), held in Cancun, Mexico, from 29 November to 10 December 2010, the Parties decided to establish the Green Climate Fund.\n\nBy the same decision, the COP decided that the Green Climate Fund would be designed by a Transitional Committee.\n\nThe Transitional Committee comprised 40 members (15 members from developed country Parties and 25 members from developing country Parties). It met four times in the course of 2011 and, in accordance with its terms of reference, submitted to the COP at its 17th session in Durban, South Africa, from 28 November to 9 December 2011, the report for its consideration and approval.\n\nSongdo was selected as the host city of the UNGCF Secretariat at the 2nd GCF Board Meeting on October 20, 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=Korea aims to be leader in green growth  |url= http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2012/11/117_123611.html|publisher=The korea times |date=2012-10-31}}</ref>\n\n-Composition\n\nThe Fund has 24-board members, the Secretariat and 194 member nations.\n\n-Scale of the Secretariat\n\nThe Secretariat is expected to have 300 to 500 employees in the initial period, which will rise to over 8,000 once the fund gets up and running.\n\n-Rationale for the selection of Incheon as the host city\n\nIncheon is a hub city of economy, logistics and trade in Northeast Asia. There are 61 cities of more than 1 million people with access to 2 billion people within a 3-hour flight of the city.\n\nBy vigorously nurturing logistics, tourism, leisure, IT and BT industries, Incheon is developing into the leading hub city of Northeast Asia and the heart and business hub of Korea. Much of its development is centered on Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port.\n\n-The optimal location for the UNGCF Secretariat.\n\nSongdo International City boasts state-of-the-art working conditions. It has international schools, a Global University Campus and its own Central Park. As such, it is well equipped with education and medical services, accommodation provision, MICE, and parks. In addition, it has garnered attention from around the world as a low-carbon, eco-friendly city. Songdo International City at once embodies the goal of the Green Climate Fund, and provides foreigner-friendly living conditions as a compact, smart city.\n\n-A new growth engine for Incheon\n\nThe KDI (Korea Development Institute) has estimated that the economic benefit of the UNGCF Secretariat to be 380 billion won a year in the initial stage. The IDI (Incheon Development Institute) has forecasted that the direct economic effect to Incheon will reach 190 billion won a year.\nIn addition, hosting the GCF will create new businesses in green financing, green technology industries, and green products, increasing the direct and indirect economic effects.\n\nIn particular, it will increase Incheon's brand value as a low carbon green growth model city and contribute to boosting investment in Incheon Free Economic Zone. The decision to establish such a major international organization in the city will contribute to easing inter-Korean relations and develop Incheon's role as a bridge between developing and developed nations. The influence of Korea in international society is also expected to grow gradually as a result of the decision to locate the GCF Secretariat in Songdo.\n\n=== [[Tsinghua University]] ===\nSong ran for 6th local election (Incheon mayoral election) in 2014. After losing the election against Yoo, Jeong Bok by 1.75%, He decided to study abroad at Tsinghua University in China. While he was studying at Tsinghua University, his research foci were the issues of housing, jobs and welfare system. He returned to Korea in 2015. Following October, he launched \u2018eat and live\u2019 research lab to further develop his research at Tsinghua University into policies\n\n=== Member of the 20th National Assembly ===\nOn 1 March 2016, Song declared that he is running for the National Assembly as a Democrat in Incheon's Gyeyang (B) constituency, which he represented in previous years. He considered running in competitive constituency. However, he decided to run in Gyeyang (B) after assemblyman Choi, Won Sik leaves the Democratic Party despite Song's persuasion to stay. Song declared that he will run for the party leadership after the general election and he said that he takes the full responsibility of the entire elections in Incheon and will recover the Incheon politics. On 13 April 2016, he won the post by 12% against Yoon, Hyung-sun of Saenuri Party. He returned to the National Assembly after 6 years since he ran for the 5th General election in 2010\n\nOn 24 July 2016, He declared his running for the party leadership. He pledged to devote himself to make the Party into a \u2018strong\u2019 opposition and to replace the Saenuri government in the upcoming presidential election. He was considered to be the leading candidate who represented the wide mainstream democrats. However, he lost the primary election. Political commentators analyze Song's [[Election threshold|'cut-off']]  with two reasons, disparity of \u2018pro-Roh\u2019 (pro-[[Roh Moo-hyun|Roh, Moo-Hyun]]) voters and the very last minute leadership bid waged by Lee, Jong-kul, which gathered strong \u2018non-Roh\u2019 voters.\n\nOn 8 February 2017, Song joined [[Moon Jae-in|Moon, Jae-in's]] campaign for [[2017 South Korean presidential election|the 19th Presidential Election]] as chief campaign manager. It is later known that Moon persuaded Song several times to join his presidential campaign. Song commented that \u201cI also considered running for the presidential election, however, I decided to cooperate with Moon to replace the government and believe that helping Moon is answering the call of the people of Republic of Korea\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00006&news_seq_no=3136907|title=\ubb38 \uc804 \ub300\ud45c \uc0bc\uace0\ucd08\ub824\ub85c '\ucd1d\uad04\ubcf8\ubd80\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc1a1\uc601\uae38' \uc601\uc785|last=|first=|date=|website=mbn.mk.co.kr|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of Moon's presidency, Song has been designated as the special envoy of President Moon Jae-in to the Russian Federation in May 2017.

Although fossils from other areas have been assigned to the genus, the only certain remains of ''Megalosaurus'' come from [[Oxfordshire]] and date to the late [[Middle Jurassic]].\n\n''Megalosaurus'' was, in 1824, the first genus of non-avian dinosaur to be validly named. The [[type species]] is ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'', named in 1827. In 1842, ''Megalosaurus'' was one of three genera on which [[Richard Owen]] based his [[Dinosauria]]. On Owen's directions a model was made as one of the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]], which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles. Subsequently, over fifty other species would be classified under the genus, originally because dinosaurs were not well known, but even during the 20th century after many dinosaurs had been discovered. Today it is understood these additional species were not directly related to ''M. bucklandii'', which is the only true ''Megalosaurus'' species. Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build.\n\nThe first naturalists who investigated ''Megalosaurus'' mistook it for a gigantic lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded that it was no longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing ''Megalosaurus'' with its direct relatives in the [[Megalosauridae]], were able to obtain a more accurate picture. ''Megalosaurus'' was about six metres long, weighing about seven hundred kilogrammes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. ''Megalosaurus'' had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n\n===\"Scrotum humanum\"===\n[[File:Scrotum humanum.jpg|thumb|The cover of [[Robert Plot]]'s ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'', 1677 (right). Plot's illustration of the lower extremity of the femur dubbed \"Scrotum humanum\" (left)]]\n''Megalosaurus'' may have been the first [[dinosaur]], apart from modern birds, to be described in the scientific literature. The earliest possible fossil of the genus, from the [[Taynton Limestone Formation]], was the lower part of a [[femur]], discovered in the 17th century. It was originally described by Robert Plot as a thighbone of a [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[war elephant]], and then as a biblical giant.

Plot's engraving of the Cornwell bone was again used in a book by [[Richard Brookes]] in 1763. Brookes, in a caption, called it \"[[Scrotum]] humanum,\" apparently comparing its appearance to a pair of \"human [[testicle]]s\".<ref name=\"brookes1763\">{{cite journal |last=Brookes |first=R. |year=1763 |title=A New and Accurate System of Natural History: The Natural History of Waters, Earths, Stones, Fossils, and Minerals with their Virtues, Properties and Medicinal Uses, to which is added, the Method in which Linnaeus has treated these subjects |journal=J.

[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], had in the eighteenth century not merely devised a system for naming living creatures, but also for classifying geological objects. The book by Brookes was all about applying this latter system to curious stones found in England. According to Halstead, Brookes thus had deliberately used [[binomial nomenclature]], and had in fact indicated the possible [[type specimen]] of a new biological genus. According to the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), the name ''Scrotum humanum'' in principle had priority over ''Megalosaurus'' because it was published first. That Brookes understood that the stone did not actually represent a pair of petrified testicles was irrelevant. Merely the fact that the name had not been used in subsequent literature meant that it could be removed from competition for priority, because the ICZN states that if a name has never been considered valid after 1899, it can be made a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'', an invalid \"forgotten name\".<ref name=\"halstead1970\">{{cite journal |last=Halstead |first=L.

Sarjeant submitted a petition to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] to formally suppress the name ''Scrotum'' in favour of ''Megalosaurus''. He wrote that the supposed junior synonym ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' should be made a [[conserved name]] to ensure its priority. However, the Executive Secretary of the ICZN at the time, Philip K. Tubbs, did not consider the petition to be admissible, concluding that the term \"Scrotum humanum\", published merely as a label for an illustration, did not constitute the valid creation of a new name, and stated that there was no evidence it was ever intended as such.

Buckland further studied the remains with his friend [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] who in 1821 referred to them as the \"Huge Lizard\". In 1822 Buckland and Conybeare, in a joint article to be included in Cuvier's ''Ossemens'', intended to provide scientific names for both gigantic lizard-like creatures known at the time: the remains found near [[Maastricht]] would be named ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' \u2013 then seen as a land-dwelling animal \u2013 while for the British lizard Conybeare had devised the name ''Megalosaurus'', from the Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2, ''megas'', \"large\".

He considered ''Megalosaurus'' to be a quadruped. He thought it was an \"amphibian\", i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind ''Megalosaurus'' resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier's size estimate that ''Megalosaurus'' would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that just described. Today, this is known to have belonged to ''[[Iguanodon]]'', or at least some [[Iguanodontidae|iguanodontid]], but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to ''Megalosaurus'' also. Even taking into account the effects of [[allometry]], heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of ''Megalosaurus'' at sixty to seventy feet.<ref name=\"buckland1824\"/> The existence of ''Megalosaurus'' posed some problems for Christian [[orthodoxy]], which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through [[Original Sin]], which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a [[pre-Adamism|pre-Adamitic]] phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'' that ''Megalosaurus'' had played a beneficial r\u00f4le in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, \"to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering\".<ref name=\"buckland1836\">{{cite journal|author=Buckland, W.|year=1836|title=Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology|journal=W.

In reaction, on 2 August 1841 [[Richard Owen]] during a lecture to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] claimed that certain prehistoric reptilian groups had already attained the organisational level of present mammals, implying there had been no progress. Owen presented three examples of such higher level reptiles: ''Iguanodon'', ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'' and ''Megalosaurus''. For these, the \"lizard model\" was entirely abandoned: they would have had an upright stance and a high metabolism. This also meant that earlier size estimates had been exaggerated. By simply adding the known length of the vertebrae, instead of extrapolating from a lizard, Owen arrived at a total body length for ''Megalosaurus'' of thirty feet. In the printed version of the lecture published in 1842, Owen united the three reptiles into a separate group: the Dinosauria. ''Megalosaurus'' was thus one of the three original dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Owen1842\">{{cite journal|author=Owen, R.|year=1842|title=Report on British fossil reptiles, part II|journal=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science|volume=11|pages=32\u201337|url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_108440_1842reportonbritishfossilrepti9999}}</ref>\n[[File:Humped Megalosaurus.jpg|thumb|Von Meyer's restoration of ''Megalosaurus'' from before 1897; showing it bipedal with long neural spines]] \nIn 1852, [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] was commissioned to build a life-sized concrete model of ''Megalosaurus'' for the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park]] in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked under the direction of Owen and the statue reflected Owen's ideas that ''Megalosaurus'' would have been a mammal-like quadruped.

In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'' was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal.

Anderson \u2014 which method, optimised for mammals, tends to underestimate theropod masses by at least a third. Furthermore, thighbone specimen OUM J13561 has a length of about eighty-six centimetres.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===General build===\n[[File:Megalosaurus fragments.JPG|thumb|Hip, femur and sacrum]]\nIn general, ''Megalosaurus'' had the typical build of a large theropod. It was bipedal, the horizontal torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a [[carnivore]], its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey.<ref name=\"Benton, Michael J, Prehistoric Life\">{{cite book |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |year=2012 |title=Prehistoric Life |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |isbn=978-0-7566-9910-9 |page=259}}</ref> The skeleton of ''Megalosaurus'' is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of ''Torvosaurus'', a close relative.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Skull and lower jaws===\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi tooth 2.jpg|thumb|left|Referred tooth of ''M. bucklandii''.]]\nThe skull of ''Megalosaurus'' is poorly known. The discovered skull elements are generally rather large in relation to the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that ''Megalosaurus'' had an uncommonly large head. The [[praemaxilla]] is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the [[maxilla]] was short. In the depression around the [[antorbital fenestra]] to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the ''fenestra maxillaris''. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty ''denticula'' per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13\u201314/13\u201314. The [[jugal bone]] is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an [[Air sacs|air sac]] in the [[nasal bone]]. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate [[autapomorphy]].<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi.jpg|thumb|Cast of the lower jaw]] \nThe lower jaw is rather robust. It is also straight in top view, without much expansion at the jaw tip, suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the [[mandibula]], were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired to have been the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with ''Torvosaurus''), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same combination is shown by ''[[Piatnitzkysaurus]]''. The [[surangular]] has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a ''foramen surangulare posterior'', but a second ''foramen surangulare anterior'' to the front of it is lacking.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Vertebral column===\n[[File:Megalosaurus sacrum (39971421271).jpg|left|thumb|OUM J13576, an articulated sacrum]] \nAlthough the exact numbers are unknown, the [[vertebral column]] of ''Megalosaurus'' was probably divided into ten neck vertebrae, thirteen dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae, as is common for basal [[Tetanurae]].<ref name=weishampel04/>\n\nThe Stonesfield Slate material contains no neck vertebrae; but a single broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large [[Vertebral column#Dinosaurs|pleurocoels]], pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly [[Vertebral column#Classification|opisthocoelous]], with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the [[diapophysis]], the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a [[hyposphene]]\u2013[[hypantrum]] complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests the presence of a crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing more than half of the total vertebral height.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Appendicular skeleton===\n[[File:Megalosaurus femur.jpg|thumb|upright|Lithograph of the femur, from a posterior (left) and medial view (right). Work by J. Erxleben in the 1800s]]\nThe [[shoulderblade]] or [[scapula]] is short and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves slightly to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes about half of the shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The [[coracoid]] is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a [[scapulocoracoid]], lacking a visible [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]]. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval [[foramen]] but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\nThe [[humerus]] is very robust with strongly expanded upper and lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals about half of the total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular [[deltopectoral crest]] is present, the attachment for the ''[[Musculus pectoralis major]]'' and the ''[[Musculus deltoideus]]''. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The [[ulna]] is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large [[olecranon]], the attachment process for the ''[[Musculus triceps brachii]]''. [[Radius (bone)|Radius]], wrist and hand are unknown.<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus pelvis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lithograph of the Ilium. Work from the 1800s drawn by J. Erxleben]]\nIn the pelvis, the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] is long and low, with a convex upper profile. Its front blade is triangular and rather short; at the front end there is a small drooping point, separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle. The rear blade is roughly rectangular. The outer side of the ilium is concave, serving as an attachment surface for the ''[[Musculus iliofemoralis]]'', the main thigh muscle. Above the hip joint, on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves. The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the ''[[Musculus caudofemoralis brevis]]''. The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side, which thus can be seen as a separate \"medial blade\" that in side view is visible in two places: in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade. The pubic bone is straight. The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft. The ischium is S-shaped in side view, showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side. On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge, at its top separated from the shaft by a notch. To below, this ridge continues into an exceptionally thick bony skirt at the inner rear side of the shaft, covering over half of its length. Towards the end of the shaft, this skirt gradually merges with it. The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable \"foot\" with a convex lower profile.<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus right tibia (& left metatarsals).jpg|thumb|Tibia and metatarsals]]\nThe thighbone is straight in front view. Seen from the same direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20\u00b0 to the front. The [[greater trochanter]] is relatively wide and separated from the robust [[lesser trochanter]] in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At the lower end of the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the [[condyle]]s. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The [[shinbone]], or ''tibia'', is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the [[Talus bone|astragalus]]. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth [[metatarsals]] are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Diagnosis===\n[[File:Megalosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|Modern restoration of ''Megalosaurus'', with mostly hypothetical head.]]\nFor decades after its discovery, ''Megalosaurus'' was seen by researchers as the definitive or typical large carnivorous dinosaur. As a result, it began to function as a \"wastebasket taxon\", and many large or small carnivorous dinosaurs from Europe and elsewhere were assigned to the genus. This slowly changed during the 20th century, when it became common to restrict the genus to fossils found in the middle Jurassic of England. Further restriction occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, researchers such as [[Ronan Allain]] and [[Dan Chure]] suggesting that the Stonesfield Slate fossils perhaps belonged to several, possibly not directly related, species of theropod dinosaur. Subsequent research seemed to confirm this hypothesis, and the genus ''Megalosaurus'' and species ''M. bucklandii'' became generally regarded as limited to the taxon having produced the lectotype, the dentary of the lower jaw. Furthermore, several researchers failed to find any characteristics in that jaw that could be used to distinguish ''Megalosaurus'' from its relatives, which would mean the genus were a ''nomen dubium''.<ref name=bensonetal2008>{{cite journal|year=2008|title=The taxonomic status of ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Middle Jurassic of Oxfordshire, UK|journal=Palaeontology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=419\u2013424|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2008.00751.x|author1=Benson, R.B.J. |author2=Barrett, P.M. |author3=Powell, H.P. |author4=Norman, D.B. |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref> However, a comprehensive study by Roger Benson and colleagues in 2008, and several related analyses published in subsequent years, overturned the previous consensus by identifying several [[autapomorphies]], or unique distinguishing characteristics, in the lower jaw that could be used to separate ''Megalosaurus'' from other megalosaurids.<ref name=bensonetal2008/>\n\nVarious distinguishing traits of the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, of the lower jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most [[parsimonious]] to assume that the Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed in other parts of the skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.<ref>Carrano (2012) p. 236</ref>\n\n==Phylogeny==\n[[File:Megalosaurus tibia.jpg|thumb|upright|Referred tibia, lateral view (left), posterior view (right).

Although fossils from other areas have been assigned to the genus, the only certain remains of ''Megalosaurus'' come from [[Oxfordshire]] and date to the late [[Middle Jurassic]].\n\n''Megalosaurus'' was, in 1824, the first genus of non-avian dinosaur to be validly named. The [[type species]] is ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'', named in 1827. In 1842, ''Megalosaurus'' was one of three genera on which [[Richard Owen]] based his [[Dinosauria]]. On Owen's directions a model was made as one of the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]], which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles. Subsequently, over fifty other species would be classified under the genus, originally because dinosaurs were not well known, but even during the 20th century after many dinosaurs had been discovered. Today it is understood these additional species were not directly related to ''M. bucklandii'', which is the only true ''Megalosaurus'' species. Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build.\n\nThe first naturalists who investigated ''Megalosaurus'' mistook it for a gigantic lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded that it was no longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing ''Megalosaurus'' with its direct relatives in the [[Megalosauridae]], were able to obtain a more accurate picture. ''Megalosaurus'' was about six metres long, weighing about seven hundred kilogrammes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. ''Megalosaurus'' had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n\n===\"Scrotum humanum\"===\n[[File:Scrotum humanum.jpg|thumb|The cover of [[Robert Plot]]'s ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'', 1677 (right). Plot's illustration of the lower extremity of the femur dubbed \"Scrotum humanum\" (left)]]\n''Megalosaurus'' may have been the first [[dinosaur]], apart from modern birds, to be described in the scientific literature. The earliest possible fossil of the genus, from the [[Taynton Limestone Formation]], was the lower part of a [[femur]], discovered in the 17th century. It was originally described by Robert Plot as a thighbone of a [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[war elephant]], and then as a biblical giant.  Part of a bone was recovered from the [[Taynton Limestone Formation]] of [[Stonesfield]] limestone quarry, [[Oxfordshire]] in 1676.

Plot's engraving of the Cornwell bone was again used in a book by [[Richard Brookes]] in 1763.

[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], had in the eighteenth century not merely devised a system for naming living creatures, but also for classifying geological objects. The book by Brookes was all about applying this latter system to curious stones found in England. According to Halstead, Brookes thus had deliberately used [[binomial nomenclature]], and had in fact indicated the possible [[type specimen]] of a new biological genus. According to the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), the name ''Scrotum humanum'' in principle had priority over ''Megalosaurus'' because it was published first. That Brookes understood that the stone did not actually represent a pair of petrified testicles was irrelevant. Merely the fact that the name had not been used in subsequent literature meant that it could be removed from competition for priority, because the ICZN states that if a name has never been considered valid after 1899, it can be made a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'', an invalid \"forgotten name\".<ref name=\"halstead1970\">{{cite journal |last=Halstead |first=L.

Sarjeant submitted a petition to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] to formally suppress the name ''Scrotum'' in favour of ''Megalosaurus''. He wrote that the supposed junior synonym ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' should be made a [[conserved name]] to ensure its priority. However, the Executive Secretary of the ICZN at the time, Philip K. Tubbs, did not consider the petition to be admissible, concluding that the term \"Scrotum humanum\", published merely as a label for an illustration, did not constitute the valid creation of a new name, and stated that there was no evidence it was ever intended as such.

Buckland further studied the remains with his friend [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] who in 1821 referred to them as the \"Huge Lizard\". In 1822 Buckland and Conybeare, in a joint article to be included in Cuvier's ''Ossemens'', intended to provide scientific names for both gigantic lizard-like creatures known at the time: the remains found near [[Maastricht]] would be named ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' \u2013 then seen as a land-dwelling animal \u2013 while for the British lizard Conybeare had devised the name ''Megalosaurus'', from the Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2, ''megas'', \"large\".

He considered ''Megalosaurus'' to be a quadruped. He thought it was an \"amphibian\", i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind ''Megalosaurus'' resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier's size estimate that ''Megalosaurus'' would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that just described. Today, this is known to have belonged to ''[[Iguanodon]]'', or at least some [[Iguanodontidae|iguanodontid]], but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to ''Megalosaurus'' also. Even taking into account the effects of [[allometry]], heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of ''Megalosaurus'' at sixty to seventy feet.<ref name=\"buckland1824\"/> The existence of ''Megalosaurus'' posed some problems for Christian [[orthodoxy]], which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through [[Original Sin]], which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a [[pre-Adamism|pre-Adamitic]] phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'' that ''Megalosaurus'' had played a beneficial r\u00f4le in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, \"to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering\".<ref name=\"buckland1836\">{{cite journal|author=Buckland, W.|year=1836|title=Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology|journal=W.

In reaction, on 2 August 1841 [[Richard Owen]] during a lecture to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] claimed that certain prehistoric reptilian groups had already attained the organisational level of present mammals, implying there had been no progress. Owen presented three examples of such higher level reptiles: ''Iguanodon'', ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'' and ''Megalosaurus''. For these, the \"lizard model\" was entirely abandoned: they would have had an upright stance and a high metabolism. This also meant that earlier size estimates had been exaggerated. By simply adding the known length of the vertebrae, instead of extrapolating from a lizard, Owen arrived at a total body length for ''Megalosaurus'' of thirty feet. In the printed version of the lecture published in 1842, Owen united the three reptiles into a separate group: the Dinosauria. ''Megalosaurus'' was thus one of the three original dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Owen1842\">{{cite journal|author=Owen, R.|year=1842|title=Report on British fossil reptiles, part II|journal=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science|volume=11|pages=32\u201337|url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_108440_1842reportonbritishfossilrepti9999}}</ref>\n[[File:Humped Megalosaurus.jpg|thumb|Von Meyer's restoration of ''Megalosaurus'' from before 1897; showing it bipedal with long neural spines]] \nIn 1852, [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] was commissioned to build a life-sized concrete model of ''Megalosaurus'' for the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park]] in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked under the direction of Owen and the statue reflected Owen's ideas that ''Megalosaurus'' would have been a mammal-like quadruped.

In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'' was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal.

Specimen BMNH 31806, a thighbone 803 millimetres long, would indicate a body weight of 943 kilogrammes, using the extrapolation method of J.F. Anderson \u2014 which method, optimised for mammals, tends to underestimate theropod masses by at least a third. Furthermore, thighbone specimen OUM J13561 has a length of about eighty-six centimetres.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===General build===\n[[File:Megalosaurus fragments.JPG|thumb|Hip, femur and sacrum]]\nIn general, ''Megalosaurus'' had the typical build of a large theropod. It was bipedal, the horizontal torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a [[carnivore]], its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey.<ref name=\"Benton, Michael J, Prehistoric Life\">{{cite book |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |year=2012 |title=Prehistoric Life |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |isbn=978-0-7566-9910-9 |page=259}}</ref> The skeleton of ''Megalosaurus'' is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of ''Torvosaurus'', a close relative.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Skull and lower jaws===\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi tooth 2.jpg|thumb|left|Referred tooth of ''M. bucklandii''.]]\nThe skull of ''Megalosaurus'' is poorly known. The discovered skull elements are generally rather large in relation to the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that ''Megalosaurus'' had an uncommonly large head. The [[praemaxilla]] is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the [[maxilla]] was short. In the depression around the [[antorbital fenestra]] to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the ''fenestra maxillaris''. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty ''denticula'' per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13\u201314/13\u201314. The [[jugal bone]] is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an [[Air sacs|air sac]] in the [[nasal bone]]. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate [[autapomorphy]].<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi.jpg|thumb|Cast of the lower jaw]] \nThe lower jaw is rather robust. It is also straight in top view, without much expansion at the jaw tip, suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the [[mandibula]], were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired to have been the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with ''Torvosaurus''), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same combination is shown by ''[[Piatnitzkysaurus]]''. The [[surangular]] has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a ''foramen surangulare posterior'', but a second ''foramen surangulare anterior'' to the front of it is lacking.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Vertebral column===\n[[File:Megalosaurus sacrum (39971421271).jpg|left|thumb|OUM J13576, an articulated sacrum]] \nAlthough the exact numbers are unknown, the [[vertebral column]] of ''Megalosaurus'' was probably divided into ten neck vertebrae, thirteen dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae, as is common for basal [[Tetanurae]].<ref name=weishampel04/>\n\nThe Stonesfield Slate material contains no neck vertebrae; but a single broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large [[Vertebral column#Dinosaurs|pleurocoels]], pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly [[Vertebral column#Classification|opisthocoelous]], with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the [[diapophysis]], the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a [[hyposphene]]\u2013[[hypantrum]] complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests the presence of a crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing more than half of the total vertebral height.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Appendicular skeleton===\n[[File:Megalosaurus femur.jpg|thumb|upright|Lithograph of the femur, from a posterior (left) and medial view (right). Work by J. Erxleben in the 1800s]]\nThe [[shoulderblade]] or [[scapula]] is short and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves slightly to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes about half of the shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The [[coracoid]] is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a [[scapulocoracoid]], lacking a visible [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]]. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval [[foramen]] but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\nThe [[humerus]] is very robust with strongly expanded upper and lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals about half of the total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular [[deltopectoral crest]] is present, the attachment for the ''[[Musculus pectoralis major]]'' and the ''[[Musculus deltoideus]]''. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The [[ulna]] is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large [[olecranon]], the attachment process for the ''[[Musculus triceps brachii]]''. [[Radius (bone)|Radius]], wrist and hand are unknown.<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus pelvis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lithograph of the Ilium. Work from the 1800s drawn by J. Erxleben]]\nIn the pelvis, the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] is long and low, with a convex upper profile. Its front blade is triangular and rather short; at the front end there is a small drooping point, separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle. The rear blade is roughly rectangular. The outer side of the ilium is concave, serving as an attachment surface for the ''[[Musculus iliofemoralis]]'', the main thigh muscle. Above the hip joint, on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves. The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the ''[[Musculus caudofemoralis brevis]]''. The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side, which thus can be seen as a separate \"medial blade\" that in side view is visible in two places: in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade. The pubic bone is straight. The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft. The ischium is S-shaped in side view, showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side. On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge, at its top separated from the shaft by a notch. To below, this ridge continues into an exceptionally thick bony skirt at the inner rear side of the shaft, covering over half of its length. Towards the end of the shaft, this skirt gradually merges with it. The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable \"foot\" with a convex lower profile.<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus right tibia (& left metatarsals).jpg|thumb|Tibia and metatarsals]]\nThe thighbone is straight in front view. Seen from the same direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20\u00b0 to the front. The [[greater trochanter]] is relatively wide and separated from the robust [[lesser trochanter]] in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At the lower end of the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the [[condyle]]s. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The [[shinbone]], or ''tibia'', is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the [[Talus bone|astragalus]]. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth [[metatarsals]] are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Diagnosis===\n[[File:Megalosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|Modern restoration of ''Megalosaurus'', with mostly hypothetical head.]]\nFor decades after its discovery, ''Megalosaurus'' was seen by researchers as the definitive or typical large carnivorous dinosaur. As a result, it began to function as a \"wastebasket taxon\", and many large or small carnivorous dinosaurs from Europe and elsewhere were assigned to the genus. This slowly changed during the 20th century, when it became common to restrict the genus to fossils found in the middle Jurassic of England. Further restriction occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, researchers such as [[Ronan Allain]] and [[Dan Chure]] suggesting that the Stonesfield Slate fossils perhaps belonged to several, possibly not directly related, species of theropod dinosaur. Subsequent research seemed to confirm this hypothesis, and the genus ''Megalosaurus'' and species ''M. bucklandii'' became generally regarded as limited to the taxon having produced the lectotype, the dentary of the lower jaw. Furthermore, several researchers failed to find any characteristics in that jaw that could be used to distinguish ''Megalosaurus'' from its relatives, which would mean the genus were a ''nomen dubium''.<ref name=bensonetal2008>{{cite journal|year=2008|title=The taxonomic status of ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Middle Jurassic of Oxfordshire, UK|journal=Palaeontology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=419\u2013424|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2008.00751.x|author1=Benson, R.B.J. |author2=Barrett, P.M. |author3=Powell, H.P. |author4=Norman, D.B. |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref> However, a comprehensive study by Roger Benson and colleagues in 2008, and several related analyses published in subsequent years, overturned the previous consensus by identifying several [[autapomorphies]], or unique distinguishing characteristics, in the lower jaw that could be used to separate ''Megalosaurus'' from other megalosaurids.<ref name=bensonetal2008/>\n\nVarious distinguishing traits of the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, of the lower jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most [[parsimonious]] to assume that the Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed in other parts of the skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.<ref>Carrano (2012) p. 236</ref>\n\n==Phylogeny==\n[[File:Megalosaurus tibia.jpg|thumb|upright|Referred tibia, lateral view (left), posterior view (right).

The distinction between these terms is considered to be important. Race may be regarded as a \u201csocially constructed mechanism for self identification and group membership\u201d and so biologically meaningless, whereas ancestry is a \u201cscientifically derived descriptor of the biological component of population variation\u201d (Konigsberg et al. 2009: 77\u201378). So, why do the rather politically sensitive terms Caucasoid, Mongoloid, or Negroid still appear in published literature (Ousley et al. 2009)? There are considered to be four basic ancestry groups into which an individual can be placed by physical appearance, not accounting for admixture: the sub-Saharan African group (\u201cNegroid\u201d), the European group (\u201cCaucasoid\u201d), the Central Asian group (\u201cMongoloid\u201d), and the Australasian group (\u201cAustraloid\u201d). The rather outdated names of all but one of these groups were originally derived from geography: The Caucasoid group traversed the Caucasus Mountains as they spread into Europe and eastern Asia. Since the majority of native peoples from the Indian subcontinent, northern and northeastern Africa and the Near East fall into this group, to say that the group is of \u201cEuropean\u201d ancestry does not really suffice. Plus, the terms Caucasoid or Caucasian do not have the same oppressive, persecutory connotations as the other terms and so are less likely to cause offense.}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Robert B.

Some might protest that it is \"only a label.\" But language is one of the most systematic, subtle, and significant vehicles for transmitting racial ideology. Terms that describe imagined groups, such as Caucasian, encapsulate those beliefs. Every time we use them and uncritically expose students to them, we are reinforcing rather than dismantling the old racialized worldview.

What is clear is that the two editions of Meiners's Outline were published between the second edition of Blumenbach's On the Natural Variety of Mankind and the third edition, where Blumenbach first used the term Caucasian. Blumenbach cited Meiners once in 1795, but only to include Meiners's 1793 division of humanity into \"handsome and white\" and \"ugly and dark\" peoples among several alternative \"divisions of the varieties of mankind.\" Yet Blumenbach must have been aware of Meiners's earlier designation of Caucasian and Mongolian branches of humanity, as the two men knew each other as colleagues at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. The way that Blumenbach embraced the term Caucasian suggests that he worked to distance his own anthropological thinking from that of Meiners while recovering the term Caucasian for his own more refined racial classification: he made no mention of Meiners's 1785 usage and gave the term a new meaning.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Meiners, however, Blumenbach was a monogenist \u2013 he considered all humans to have a shared origin and to be a single species. Blumenbach, like Meiners, did rank his Caucasian grouping higher than other groups in terms of mental faculties or potential for achievement.<ref name=Bhopal/>\n\nAlongside the anthropologist [[Georges Cuvier]], Blumenbach classified the Caucasian race by cranial measurements and bone morphology in addition to skin pigmentation.<ref>''On the Natural Variety of Mankind'', 3rd ed. (1795) in Bendyshe: 264\u201365; \"racial face,\" 229.</ref>\n\nFollowing Meiners, Blumenbach described the Caucasian race as consisting of the native inhabitants of Europe, West Asia, the Indian peninsula, and North Africa, including toward the south the Moors, Abyssinians and adjacent groups.\n\n===Carleton Coon===\n{{Further|White people|Brown people}}\n[[File:Carleton Coon races after Pleistocene.PNG|thumb|300px|Distribution of the races after the [[Pleistocene]] according to [[Carleton S.

[[Carleton S. Coon]] (1939) included the populations native to all of [[Central Asia|Central]] and Northern Asia, including the [[Ainu people]], under the Caucasoid label. However, many scientists maintained the racial categorizations of color established by Meiners' and Blumenbach's works, along with many other early steps of anthropology, well into the late 19th and mid-to-late 20th centuries, increasingly used to justify political policies, such as segregation and immigration restrictions, and other opinions based in prejudice. For example, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] (1870) classified all populations of Asian nations as Mongoloid. [[Lothrop Stoddard]] (1920) in turn classified as \"brown\" most of the populations of the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Central Asia and South Asia. He counted as \"white\" only European peoples and their descendants, as well as a few populations in areas adjacent to or opposite southern Europe, in parts of Anatolia and parts of the Rif and Atlas mountains.\n\nIn 1939 Coon argued that the Caucasian race had originated through admixture between ''Homo neanderthalensis'' and ''Homo sapiens'' of the \"Mediterranean type\" which he considered to be distinct from Caucasians, rather than a subtype of it as others had done.<ref name=racesofeurope>{{cite book |last=Coon |first=Carleton |author-link=Carleton S.

The distinction between these terms is considered to be important. Race may be regarded as a \u201csocially constructed mechanism for self identification and group membership\u201d and so biologically meaningless, whereas ancestry is a \u201cscientifically derived descriptor of the biological component of population variation\u201d (Konigsberg et al. 2009: 77\u201378). So, why do the rather politically sensitive terms Caucasoid, Mongoloid, or Negroid still appear in published literature (Ousley et al. 2009)? There are considered to be four basic ancestry groups into which an individual can be placed by physical appearance, not accounting for admixture: the sub-Saharan African group (\u201cNegroid\u201d), the European group (\u201cCaucasoid\u201d), the Central Asian group (\u201cMongoloid\u201d), and the Australasian group (\u201cAustraloid\u201d). The rather outdated names of all but one of these groups were originally derived from geography: The Caucasoid group traversed the Caucasus Mountains as they spread into Europe and eastern Asia. Since the majority of native peoples from the Indian subcontinent, northern and northeastern Africa and the Near East fall into this group, to say that the group is of \u201cEuropean\u201d ancestry does not really suffice. Plus, the terms Caucasoid or Caucasian do not have the same oppressive, persecutory connotations as the other terms and so are less likely to cause offense.}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Robert B.

What is clear is that the two editions of Meiners's Outline were published between the second edition of Blumenbach's On the Natural Variety of Mankind and the third edition, where Blumenbach first used the term Caucasian. Blumenbach cited Meiners once in 1795, but only to include Meiners's 1793 division of humanity into \"handsome and white\" and \"ugly and dark\" peoples among several alternative \"divisions of the varieties of mankind.\" Yet Blumenbach must have been aware of Meiners's earlier designation of Caucasian and Mongolian branches of humanity, as the two men knew each other as colleagues at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. The way that Blumenbach embraced the term Caucasian suggests that he worked to distance his own anthropological thinking from that of Meiners while recovering the term Caucasian for his own more refined racial classification: he made no mention of Meiners's 1785 usage and gave the term a new meaning.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to Meiners, however, Blumenbach was a monogenist \u2013 he considered all humans to have a shared origin and to be a single species.

[[Carleton S. Coon]] (1939) included the populations native to all of [[Central Asia|Central]] and Northern Asia, including the [[Ainu people]], under the Caucasoid label. However, many scientists maintained the racial categorizations of color established by Meiners' and Blumenbach's works, along with many other early steps of anthropology, well into the late 19th and mid-to-late 20th centuries, increasingly used to justify political policies, such as segregation and immigration restrictions, and other opinions based in prejudice.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' (1923) decided that Asian Indians were ineligible for citizenship because, though deemed \"Caucasian\" anthropologically, they were not ''white'' like European descendants since most laypeople did not consider them to be \"white\" people. This represented a change from the Supreme Court's earlier opinion in ''[[Ozawa v. United States]]'', in which it had expressly approved of two lower court cases holding \"high caste Hindus\" to be \"free white persons\" within the meaning of the naturalization act. Government lawyers later recognized that the Supreme Court had \"withdrawn\" this approval in ''Thind''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Coulson|first1=Doug|title=British Imperialism, the Indian Independence Movement, and the Racial Eligibility Provisions of the Naturalization Act: United States v.

Major changes to immigration law, however, only later came in 1965, when many earlier racial restrictions on immigration were lifted.<ref>[http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5076/ \"Not All Caucasians Are White: The Supreme Court Rejects Citizenship for Asian Indians\"], ''History Matters''</ref> This resulted in confusion about whether American Hispanics are included as \"white\", as the term ''[[Hispanic]]'' originally applied to Spanish heritage but has since expanded to include all people with origins in [[Spanish speaking countries]]. In other countries, the term ''Hispanic'' is not nearly as associated with race, but with the Spanish language and cultural affiliation.\n\nThe [[United States National Library of Medicine]] often used the term \"Caucasian\" as a race in the past. However, it later discontinued such usage in favor of the more narrow geographical term ''European'', which traditionally only applied to a subset of Caucasoids.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Other Notable MeSH Changes and Related Impact on Searching: Ethnic Groups and Geographic Origins |journal=NLM Technical Bulletin |volume=335 |issue=Nov\u2013Dec |pages= |year=2003 |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/nd03/nd03_med_data_changes.html |quote=The MeSH term Racial Stocks and its four children (Australoid Race, Caucasoid Race, Mongoloid Race, and Negroid Race) have been deleted from MeSH in 2004.
