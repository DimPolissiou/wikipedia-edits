Alongwith print media, there has been a shift with print media becoming digital or having a digital attachment swell. \n\nDigital media has had a significantly broad and complex impact on society and culture.

Babbage imagined that these codes would give him instructions for his Motor of Difference and Analytical Engine, machines that Babbage had designed to solve the problem of error in calculations.\nBetween 1822 and 1823, [[Ada Lovelace]], mathematics, wrote the first instructions for calculating numbers on Babbage engines. Lovelace's instructions are now believed to be the first computer program.\nAlthough the machines were designed to perform analysis tasks, Lovelace anticipated the possible social impact of computers and programming, writing. \"For in the distribution and combination of truths and formulas of analysis, which may become easier and more quickly subjected to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relationships and the nature of many subjects in which science necessarily relates in new subjects, and more deeply researched [\u2026] there are in all extensions of human power or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, in addition to the primary and primary object reached.\" Other old machine readable media include instructions for pianolas and [[weaving]] machines.\n[[File:Cabac1binar.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cabac1binar.png|thumb|Binary Code shown here which can used to represent the whole alphabet]]\nOver the past century communication scholarship has focused on the power of one- \u00a0way mass communication to persuade and inform.

He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes, building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables of physical constants.

Over the last decade the concept of fair use has been applied to many online medias.\n\nCopyright challenges have gotten to all parts of digital media. Even as a personal content creator on YouTube must follow the guidelines set by copyright and IP laws. Often times we see digital creators loose monetization in their content, get their contend deleted, or get criticized for their content. Most times this has to do with accidnelty using a copyrighted audio track or background scenes that are copyright by another company.\n\nTo resolve some of these issues, content creators can voluntarily adopt [[Open license|open]] or [[copyleft]] licenses, giving up some of their legal rights, or they can release their work to the [[public domain]]. Among the most common open licenses are [[Creative Commons]] licenses and the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], both of which are in use on [[Wikipedia]]. Open licenses are part of a broader [[open content]] movement that pushes for the reduction or removal of copyright restrictions from software, data and other digital media.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Andrew|title=The open-content movement|url=http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2008/10/20/02wiki.h02.html|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Digital Directions|date=17 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nAdditional software has been developed in order to protect digital media. [[digital rights management]] (DRM) is used to digitally copyright material and allows users to use that media for specific cases. For example, DRM allows a movie producer to rent a movie at a lower price than selling the movie, restricting the movie rental license length, rather than only selling the movie at full price. Additionally, DRM can prevent unauthorized sharing or modification of media.\n\nDigital Media is numerical, networked and interactive system of links and databases that allows us to navigate from one bit of content or webpage to another.\n\nOne form of digital media that is becoming a phenomenon is in the form of an [[online magazine]] or digital magazine. What exactly is a digital magazine? Due to the economic importance of digital magazines, the Audit Bureau of Circulations integrated the definition of this medium in its latest report (March 2011): a digital magazine involves the distribution of a magazine content by electronic means; it may be a replica.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite conference|last1=Santos Silva|first1=Dora|conference=ELPUB - 16th International Conference on Electronic Publishing|booktitle=Social Shaping of Digital Publishing: Exploring the Interplay Between Culture and Technology|editor-last=Baptista|editor-first=A.A.|date=June 14{{ndash}}15, 2012|location=Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal|url=http://elpub.scix.net/data/works/att/109_elpub2012.content.pdf|title=The Future of Digital Magazine Publishing|accessdate=21 November 2014|display-editors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123133735/http://elpub.scix.net/data/works/att/109_elpub2012.content.pdf|archive-date=23 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> This is an outdated definition of what a digital magazine is.

Combined with the [[Internet]] and [[personal computing]], digital media has caused [[disruptive innovation]] in publishing, journalism, public relations, entertainment, education, commerce and politics. Digital media has also posed new challenges to [[copyright]] and intellectual property laws, fostering an [[open content]] movement in which [[Content creation|content creators]] voluntarily give up some or all of their legal rights to their work. The ubiquity of digital media and its effects on society suggest that we are at the start of a new era in industrial history, called the [[Information Age]], perhaps leading to a [[paperless society]] in which all media are produced and consumed on computers.<ref name=infoage>{{cite web|last=Dewar|first=James A.|title=The information age and the printing press: looking backward to see ahead|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8014/index2.html#fn0|publisher=RAND Corporation|accessdate=29 March 2014|date=1998}}</ref> However, challenges to a digital transition remain, including outdated copyright laws, [[censorship]], the [[digital divide]], and the spectre of a [[digital dark age]], in which older media becomes inaccessible to new or upgraded information systems.<ref name=darkage>{{cite news|last=Koehl|first=Sean|title=We need to act now to prevent a digital 'dark age'|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/05/we-need-to-act-to-prevent-a-digital-dark-age/|accessdate=29 March 2014|newspaper=Wired|date=15 May 2013}}</ref> Digital media has a significant, wide-ranging and complex impact on society and culture.<ref name=infoage />\n\n==History==\nCodes and information by machines were first conceptualized by [[Charles Babbage]] in the early 1800s. Babbage imagined that these codes would give him instructions for his Motor of Difference and Analytical Engine, machines that Babbage had designed to solve the problem of error in calculations.\nBetween 1822 and 1823, [[Ada Lovelace]], mathematics, wrote the first instructions for calculating numbers on Babbage engines. Lovelace's instructions are now believed to be the first computer program.\nAlthough the machines were designed to perform analysis tasks, Lovelace anticipated the possible social impact of computers and programming, writing. \"For in the distribution and combination of truths and formulas of analysis, which may become easier and more quickly subjected to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relationships and the nature of many subjects in which science necessarily relates in new subjects, and more deeply researched [\u2026] there are in all extensions of human power or additions to human knowledge, various collateral influences, in addition to the primary and primary object reached.\" Other old machine readable media include instructions for pianolas and [[weaving]] machines.\n[[File:Cabac1binar.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cabac1binar.png|thumb|Binary Code shown here which can used to represent the whole alphabet]]\nOver the past century communication scholarship has focused on the power of one- \u00a0way mass communication to persuade and inform.

Over the last decade the concept of fair use has been applied to many online medias.\n\nTo resolve some of these issues, content creators can voluntarily adopt [[Open license|open]] or [[copyleft]] licenses, giving up some of their legal rights, or they can release their work to the [[public domain]]. Among the most common open licenses are [[Creative Commons]] licenses and the [[GNU Free Documentation License]], both of which are in use on [[Wikipedia]]. Open licenses are part of a broader [[open content]] movement that pushes for the reduction or removal of copyright restrictions from software, data and other digital media.<ref>{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=Andrew|title=The open-content movement|url=http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2008/10/20/02wiki.h02.html|accessdate=30 March 2014|newspaper=Digital Directions|date=17 October 2008}}</ref>\n\nAdditional software has been developed in order to protect digital media. [[digital rights management]] (DRM) is used to digitally copyright material and allows users to use that media for specific cases. For example, DRM allows a movie producer to rent a movie at a lower price than selling the movie, restricting the movie rental license length, rather than only selling the movie at full price. Additionally, DRM can prevent unauthorized sharing or modification of media.\n\nDigital Media is numerical, networked and interactive system of links and databases that allows us to navigate from one bit of content or webpage to another.\n\nOne form of digital media that is becoming a phenomenon is in the form of an [[online magazine]] or digital magazine. What exactly is a digital magazine? Due to the economic importance of digital magazines, the Audit Bureau of Circulations integrated the definition of this medium in its latest report (March 2011): a digital magazine involves the distribution of a magazine content by electronic means; it may be a replica.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite conference|last1=Santos Silva|first1=Dora|conference=ELPUB - 16th International Conference on Electronic Publishing|booktitle=Social Shaping of Digital Publishing: Exploring the Interplay Between Culture and Technology|editor-last=Baptista|editor-first=A.A.|date=June 14{{ndash}}15, 2012|location=Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal|url=http://elpub.scix.net/data/works/att/109_elpub2012.content.pdf|title=The Future of Digital Magazine Publishing|accessdate=21 November 2014|display-editors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123133735/http://elpub.scix.net/data/works/att/109_elpub2012.content.pdf|archive-date=23 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> This is an outdated definition of what a digital magazine is. A digital magazine should not be, in fact, a replica of the print magazine in PDF, as was common practice in recent years. It should, rather, be a magazine that is, in essence, interactive and created from scratch to a digital platform (Internet, mobile phones, private networks, iPad or other device).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The barriers for digital magazine distribution are thus decreasing.

Throughout most of the 1950s, the magazine published the following three charts to measure a song's popularity:\n\n*''Best Sellers in Stores'' \u2013 ranked the biggest selling singles in retail stores, as reported by merchants surveyed throughout the country.\n*''Most Played by Jockeys'' \u2013 ranked the most played songs on United States radio stations, as reported by radio disc jockeys and radio stations.\n*''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' \u2013 ranked the most played songs in [[jukebox]]es across the United States. At that time, this chart used to be one of the most important channels for measuring the popularity of a song among the younger generation of listeners, as many US radio stations resisted adding [[rock and roll]] music to their playlists for many years.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe chart shown in this article comes from the ''Best Sellers in Stores'' chart only.\n\n== Number ones ==\n;Key\n:{{Color box|#FFFF99|\u266a&nbsp;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; [[List of Billboard Year-End number-one singles and albums|Number-one single of the year]]\n\n{|id=toc class=toc summary=Contents\n!{{MediaWiki:Toc}}\n|-\n|align=center|[[List of Billboard number-one singles of the 1940s|\u2190 1940s]]{{\u2022}}[[#1950|1950]]{{\u2022}}[[#1951|1951]] [[#1952|1952]]{{\u2022}}[[#1953|1953]]{{\u2022}}[[#1954|1954]]{{\u2022}}[[#1955|1955]]{{\u2022}}[[#1956|1956]]{{\u2022}}[[#1957|1957]]{{\u2022}}[[#1958|1958]]{{\u2022}}[[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles from 1958 to 1969|1958 to 1969 \u2192]]\n|}\n\n[[File:Elvis Presley promoting Jailhouse Rock.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Elvis Presley]] had the highest number of hits at the top of the Billboard number-one singles chart between January 1950 until August 1958 (10 songs) in addition, Presley remained the longest at the top of the Billboard number-one singles chart between January 1950 until August 1958 (57 weeks).]]\n[[File:Patti Page.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Patti Page]] was the artist with second-longest most cumulative run at number one (22 weeks) between January 1950 until August 1958.]]\n[[File:Perry Como NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Perry Como]] remained at the top of the Billboard number-one singles chart for 20 weeks between January 1950 until August 1958.]]\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-class=\"unsortable\"\n! <span id=\"1950\"></span>Reached number one\n!Artist(s)\n!Single\n!Record label\n!Weeks at<br />number one\n!Ref\n|-\n!colspan=6|{{anchor|10}}[[List of number-one singles of 1950 (U.S.)|1950]]\n|-\n| January 7, 1950 || [[Gene Autry]] || \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph, The Red-nosed Reindeer]]\" || <div align=\"center\">Columbia</div> || <div align=\"center\">1</div> || \n|-\n| January 14, 1950 || [[The Andrews Sisters]] || \"[[I Can Dream, Can't I]]\" || <div align=\"center\">Decca</div> || <div align=\"center\">4</div> || \n|-\n| February 11, 1950 || The [[Ames Brothers]] || \"[[Rag Mop]]\" || <div align=\"center\">Coral</div> || <div align=\"center\">1</div> || \n|-\n| February 18, 1950 || [[Red Foley]] || \"[[Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy]]\" || <div align=\"center\">Decca</div> || <div align=\"center\">4</div> || \n|-\n| March 18, 1950 || [[Teresa Brewer]] || \"[[Music!

Throughout most of the 1950s, the magazine published the following three charts to measure a song's popularity:\n\n*''Best Sellers in Stores'' \u2013 ranked the biggest selling singles in retail stores, as reported by merchants surveyed throughout the country.\n*''Most Played by Jockeys'' \u2013 ranked the most played songs on United States radio stations, as reported by radio disc jockeys and radio stations.\n*''Most Played in Jukeboxes'' \u2013 ranked the most played songs in [[jukebox]]es across the United States. At that time, this chart used to be one of the most important channels for measuring the popularity of a song among the younger generation of listeners, as many US radio stations resisted adding [[rock and roll]] music to their playlists for many years.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe chart shown in this article comes from the ''Best Sellers in Stores'' chart only.\n\n== Number ones ==\n;Key\n:{{Color box|#FFFF99|\u266a&nbsp;|border=darkgray}} &ndash; [[List of Billboard Year-End number-one singles and albums|Number-one single of the year]]\n\n{|id=toc class=toc summary=Contents\n!{{MediaWiki:Toc}}\n|-\n|align=center|[[List of Billboard number-one singles of the 1940s|\u2190 1940s]]{{\u2022}}[[#1950|1950]]{{\u2022}}[[#1951|1951]] [[#1952|1952]]{{\u2022}}[[#1953|1953]]{{\u2022}}[[#1954|1954]]{{\u2022}}[[#1955|1955]]{{\u2022}}[[#1956|1956]]{{\u2022}}[[#1957|1957]]{{\u2022}}[[#1958|1958]]{{\u2022}}[[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles from 1958 to 1969|1958 to 1969 \u2192]]\n|}\n\n[[File:Elvis Presley promoting Jailhouse Rock.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Elvis Presley]] had the highest number of hits at the top of the Billboard number-one singles chart between January 1950 until August 1958 (10 songs) in addition, Presley remained the longest at the top of the Billboard number-one singles chart between January 1950 until August 1958 (57 weeks).]]\n[[File:Patti Page.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Patti Page]] was the artist with second-longest most cumulative run at number one (22 weeks) between January 1950 until August 1958.]]\n[[File:Perry Como NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Perry Como]] remained at the top of the Billboard number-one singles chart for 20 weeks between January 1950 until August 1958.]]\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-class=\"unsortable\"\n! <span id=\"1950\"></span>Reached number one\n!Artist(s)\n!Single\n!Record label\n!Weeks at<br />number one\n!Ref\n|-\n!colspan=6|{{anchor|10}}[[List of number-one singles of 1950 (U.S.)|1950]]\n|-\n| January 7, 1950 || [[Gene Autry]] || \"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph, The Red-nosed Reindeer]]\" || <div align=\"center\">Columbia</div> || <div align=\"center\">1</div> || \n|-\n| January 14, 1950 || [[The Andrews Sisters]] || \"[[I Can Dream, Can't I]]\" || <div align=\"center\">Decca</div> || <div align=\"center\">4</div> || \n|-\n| February 11, 1950 || The [[Ames Brothers]] || \"[[Rag Mop]]\" || <div align=\"center\">Coral</div> || <div align=\"center\">1</div> || \n|-\n| February 18, 1950 || [[Red Foley]] || \"[[Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy]]\" || <div align=\"center\">Decca</div> || <div align=\"center\">4</div> || \n|-\n| March 18, 1950 || [[Teresa Brewer]] || \"[[Music!

Under the umbrella of [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s, the old policy stated that laboratory-developed tests \"should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA's approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration\".

It is bordered by [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, and [[Croatia]] surrounding north and southwest. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and the northeast predominantly flatland. The inland, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, [[Herzegovina]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and mostly mountainous topography.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina traces its permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich but complex history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878\u20131918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], it was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence of the Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995 with the Dayton Agreement]].\n\n[[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has grown at double digit rates in recent years. Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural environment and [[Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cultural heritage]] inherited from six historical civilizations, its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine|cuisine]], [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina#Winter sports|winter sports]], its eclectic and unique [[Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina|music]], [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|architecture]], and its [[Sarajevo#Festivals|festivals]], some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sff.ba/content.php/en/festival?set_culture=en |title=About the Sarajevo Film Festival|publisher=Sarajevo Film Festival Official Website|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104133828/http://www.sff.ba/content.php/en/festival?set_culture=en|archivedate=4 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidefilm.com/europe.html|title=Inside Film's Guide to Film Festivals|publisher=Inside Film|accessdate=12 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115154359/http://www.insidefilm.com/europe.html|archive-date=15 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nThe country is home to three main ethnic groups or, officially, [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]], as specified in the constitution. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest group of the three, with [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] second, and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] third. A native of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, is usually identified in English as a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]]. Minorities, defined [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|under the constitutional nomenclature \"Others\"]], include [[Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jews]], [[Romani people in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]], [[National minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Poles, Ukrainians, and Turks]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]], with a third unit, the [[Br\u010dko District]], governed under local government.

According to philologist Anton Mayer the name ''Bosna'' could derive from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] *\"Bass-an-as\"), which would derive from the Proto-Indo-European root \"bos\" or \"bogh\"\u2014meaning \"the running water\".{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} According to English medievalist [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]] the Slavic settlers in Bosnia \"adapted the Latin designation [...] Basante, to their own idiom by calling the stream Bosna and themselves ''Bosniaks'' [...]\".<ref>{{cite book|author= [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]]|title=Essays on the Latin Orient|volume=|page=464|location= Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wpEBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA464|date=1921}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Herzegovina'' (\"herzog's [land]\", from German word for \"duke\"){{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} originates from Bosnian magnate [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]]'s title, \"Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast\" (1448).{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=578}} Hum, formerly [[Zahumlje]], was an early medieval principality that was conquered by the Bosnian Banate in the first half of the 14th century. The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (''Hersek'') within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] up until the formation of the short-lived [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] in the 1830s, which remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOn initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the official name was changed to Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>''The World Factbook'' (Washington DC: National Foreign Assessment Center, Central Intelligence Agency, 2013), 90-93. {{ISBN|0160921953}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe entire history of Bosnia and Herzegovina is rich, but very complex and somewhat conflicting. Due to its somewhat strained relations between its neighboring countries both historically and currently, as well as conflicting sources of academic papers regarding the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it has had rather a tumultuous upbringing during its existence; from a small kingdom, to an Ottoman sanjak, to an Austrian condominium, and through two unions with its neighbors all with the name of Yugoslavia, and now to the current day.\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Mogorjelo Villa Rustica.jpg|thumb|[[Mogorjelo]], ancient Roman suburban Villa Rustica from the 4th century, near [[\u010capljina]]]]\n{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\nBosnia has been inhabited by humans since at least the [[Paleolithic]], as one of the oldest paint caving was found in [[Badanj Cave|Badanj cave]]. Major Neolithic cultures such as the [[Butmir culture|Butmir]] and [[Kakanj culture|Kakanj]] were present along the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] dated from c. 6230 BC \u2013 c. 4900 BC.\n\n=== Ancient Illyrians ===\nThe bronze culture of the [[Illyrians]], an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and parts of northern [[Greece]].\n[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from the 2nd century]]\n\nFrom 8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in [[Illyria]] (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC. The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom. The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.\n\nFrom the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Hallstatt]] cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different. Parts of Central Bosnia were inhabited by [[Daesitiates]] tribe most commonly associated with [[Central Bosnian cultural group]]. Iron Age [[Glasinac culture]] is associated with [[Autariatae]] tribe.\n\nA very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high. ''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).\n\nIn the 4th century BC, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to [[Greece]], so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.\n\nIn the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic]] influence of the Illyrian [[Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in O\u0161ani\u0107i near [[Stolac]]. Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze [[coins]] and sculptures.\n\nConflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&nbsp;BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].<ref>[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17</ref> This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as ''[[Bellum Batonianum]]''.<ref>Miller, Norma. Tacitus: Annals I, 2002, {{ISBN|1-85399-358-1}}.

The region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.

It has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton Accords]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996, the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves.\n\nThe [[Br\u010dko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000, out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Br\u010dko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Br\u010dko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.<ref name=\"OHR\">OHR Bulletin 66 (3 February 1998).

They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. Each has a cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws to ensure the equality of all constituent people.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipality. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska into 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nBesides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four \"official\" cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Isto\u010dno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).\n\nAs a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state. The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.\n\nThe Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.\n\nThe Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.\n\nThe [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of [[proportional representation]] (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nHowever, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country and is selected by the [[European Union]]. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |title='The Contradictions of \"Democracy\" without Consent', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517144513/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |archivedate=17 May 2013}}</ref> International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.\n\n===Military===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (OSBiH) were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] was founded in 2004.\n\nThe Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 14,725 active and 7,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces have 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPADS]] hand-held missiles, [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. The Army has recently adopted remodeled [[MARPAT]] uniforms, used by Bosnian soldiers serving with [[ISAF]] in [[Afghanistan]]. A domestic production program is now underway to ensure that army units are equipped with the correct ammunition.\n\nBeginning in 2007, the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] undertook the army's first ever international assistance mission, enlisting the military to serve with ISAF peace missions to Afghanistan, [[Iraq]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2007. Five officers, acting as officers/advisors, served in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 45 soldiers, mostly acting as base security and medical assistants, served in Afghanistan. 85 Bosnian soldiers served as base security in Iraq, occasionally conducting infantry patrols there as well. All three deployed groups have been commended by their respective international forces as well as the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international assistance operations are still ongoing.\n\nThe Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] were merged in 2006. The Air Force has seen improvements in the last few years with added funds for aircraft repairs and improved cooperation with the [[Ground Forces]] as well as to the citizens of the country.

Each period made its influence felt and contributed to a greater diversity of cultures and architectural language in this region.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|Media of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n[[File:Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BHRT) building, Sarajevo.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|left|The [[Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] headquarter in [[Sarajevo]].]]\n\nSome television, magazines, and newspapers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are state-owned, and some are for-profit corporations funded by [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues.

The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was the dramatist [[Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107]].\nMagazines such as ''[[Novi Plamen]]'' or ''[http://sveske.ba/en Sarajevske sveske]'' are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.\n\n===Art===\n{{main|Art of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n\n[[File:Bosniangraves bosniska gravar februari 2007 stecak stecci5.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|Ste\u0107ci from Radimlja, near [[Stolac]] (13th century)]]\n\nThe art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Ste\u0107ci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromani\u0107|Kotromani\u0107]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurki\u0107]], [[Petar \u0160ain]], [[Roman Petrovi\u0107]] and [[Lazar Drlja\u010da]].\n\nAfter World War II artists like [[Mersad Berber]] and [[Safet Zec]] rose in popularity.\n\nIn 2007, [[Ars Aevi]], a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{see also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}\n\nTypical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zoni\u0107]], [[Goran Bregovi\u0107]], [[Davorin Popovi\u0107]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko \u010coli\u0107]], [[Elvir Lakovi\u0107]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Hari Mata Hari]] and [[Dino Merlin]]. Other composers such as [[\u0110or\u0111e Novkovi\u0107]], [[Al' Dino]], [[Haris D\u017einovi\u0107]], [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]], and many pop and [[Rock bands|rock band]]s, for example, [[Bijelo dugme|Bijelo Dugme]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Divlje Jagode]], [[Indexi]], [[Plavi orkestar|Plavi Orkestar]], [[Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje]], [[Ambasadori]], [[Dubioza kolektiv]], who were among the leading ones in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia is home to the composer [[Du\u0161an \u0160esti\u0107]], the creator of the [[national anthem]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer [[Marija \u0160esti\u0107]], to the world known jazz musician, educator and Bosnian jazz ambassador [[Sinan Alimanovi\u0107]], composer [[Sa\u0161a Lo\u0161i\u0107]] and pianist [[Sa\u0161a Toperi\u0107]]. In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient ''[[Gusle]]''. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.\n\nProbably the most distinctive and identifiably \"Bosnian\" of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[saz (musical instrument)|saz]], a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.\n\n{{main|Bosnian root music}}\nRural folk traditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina include the shouted, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[ganga (music)|ganga]] and \"ravne pjesme\" (''flat song'') styles, as well as instruments like a droneless [[bagpipe]], wooden [[flute]] and [[\u0161argija]]. The [[gusle]], an instrument found throughout the [[Balkans]], is also used to accompany ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[epic poetry|epic]] [[poems]]. There are also Bosnian folk songs in the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, derived from the area's Jewish population.\n[[File:43. TKB - Seljo z Sarajewa (Bo\u015bnia i Hercegowina) 10.JPG|thumb|Bosnians dancing a traditional [[Kolo (dance)|Kolo]]]]\n\n''Bosnian roots music'' came from [[Central Bosnia Canton|Middle Bosnia]], [[Posavina]], the [[Drina]] valley and [[Kalesija]]. It is usually performed by singers with two violinists and a [[sargija|\u0161argija]] player. These bands first appeared around [[World War I]] and became popular in the 1960s. This is the third oldest music following after the [[sevdalinka]] and ilahija. Self-taught people, mostly in two or three members of the different choices of old instruments, mostly in the violin, sacking, [[Ba\u011flama|saz]], drums, flutes (zurle) or wooden flute, as others have already called, the original performers of Bosnian music that can not be written notes, transmitted by ear from generation to generation, family is usually hereditary. It is thought to be brought from Persia-Kalesi tribe that settled in the area of present Sprecanski valleys and hence probably the name Kalesija. In this part of Bosnia it is the most common. Again, it became the leader of First World War onwards, as well as 60 years in the field Sprecanski doline. This kind of music was enjoyed by all three peoples in Bosnia, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and it contributed a lot to reconcile people socializing, entertainment and other organizations through festivala. In Kalesija it's maintained each year with the Bosnian Festival Original music.\n\nStudio Kemix firm Dzemal Dzihanovic from [[\u017divinice]] together with his artists brought this kind of music to perfection at the end 20th century. With its entirely new form of modernity, it is most common in the [[Tuzla Canton]] and the cradle of this music city [[\u017divinice]] was named Bosnian town of original music. Songs are performed preferably in a [[diphthong]], the first and second voice which is a special secret performance of this music and some performers sing in troglasju as they do Kalesijski triple that was recorded in 1968, as the first written record of the tone on the album, along with Higurashi no naku.\n\n===Cinema and theatre===\n{{main|List of Bosnia-Herzegovina films}}\n\nSarajevo is internationally renowned for its eclectic and diverse selection of festivals. The [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] was established in 1995, during the Bosnian War and has become the premier and largest film festival in the Balkans and South-East Europe.\n\nBosnia has a rich cinematic and film heritage, dating back to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]; many Bosnian filmmakers have achieved international prominence and some have won international awards ranging from the [[Academy Awards]] to multiple [[Palme d'Or]]s and [[Golden Bear]]s. Some notable Bosnian screenwriters, directors and producers are [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]] (known for the Academy Award\u2013 and [[Golden Globe Award]]\u2013winning 2001 film ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'' and [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize]]\u2013winning 2016 film ''[[Death in Sarajevo]]''),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Home Festival Awards & Juries: International Jury \"Prizes Of The International Jury |website=www.berlinale.de/en |date=2016 |accessdate=23 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816162458/http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |archive-date=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Emir Kusturica]] (won two [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes), [[Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107]] (won Golden Bear), [[Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107]], [[Ademir Kenovi\u0107]], Dino Mustafi\u0107, [[Ahmed Imamovi\u0107]], [[Pjer \u017dalica]], [[Aida Begi\u0107]], Adis Bakra\u010d, etc.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}\n[[File:Bosnian meat platter.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Bosnian meat platter]]\nBosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. Some local specialties are [[\u0106evap\u010di\u0107i|\u0107evapi]], [[burek]], [[dolma]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[pilav]], [[goulash]], [[ajvar]] and a whole range of Eastern sweets. \u0106evapi is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of [[kebab]], popular in former Yugoslavia and considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2009|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=27 July 2009|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/700826/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503211212/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/700826/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina|archive-date=3 May 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Serbia]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoVUAAAAMAAJ&q=cevapcici&hl=en|title=Encyclopedia britannica|first=Encyclopedia|last=Britannica|date=11 August 2002|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pssZAQAAIAAJ&q=cevapcici|title=Countries and Their Cultures: Saint Kitts and Nevis to Zimbabwe|page=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=TravelSerbia.Info&nbsp;\u2013 Your travel guide for Serbia|accessdate=9 August 2010|url=http://www.travelserbia.info/serbian-cuisine.php|title=Serbian cuisine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330135429/http://www.travelserbia.info/serbian-cuisine.php|archive-date=30 March 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Local wines come from [[Herzegovina]] where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Herzegovinian ''loza'' (similar to Italian [[Grappa]] but less sweet) is very popular. Plum (''rakija'') or apple (''jabukova\u010da'') alcohol beverages are produced in the north. In the south, distilleries used to produce vast quantities of [[brandy]] and supply all of ex-Yugoslav alcohol factories (brandy is the base of most [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]]).\n\n===Leisure activities===\nCoffeehouses, where [[Bosnian coffee]] is served in [[cezve|d\u017eezva]] with [[Turkish Delight|rahat lokum]] and sugar cubes, proliferate [[Sarajevo]] and every city in the country.

It is bordered by [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, and [[Croatia]] surrounding north and southwest. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and the northeast predominantly flatland. The inland, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, [[Herzegovina]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and mostly mountainous topography.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina traces permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878\u20131918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], it was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence of the Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995]].\n\n[[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has grown at double digit rates in recent years.

According to philologist Anton Mayer the name ''Bosna'' could derive from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] *\"Bass-an-as\"), which would derive from the Proto-Indo-European root \"bos\" or \"bogh\"\u2014meaning \"the running water\".{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} According to English medievalist [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]] the Slavic settlers in Bosnia \"adapted the Latin designation [...] Basante, to their own idiom by calling the stream Bosna and themselves ''Bosniaks'' [...]\".<ref>{{cite book|author= [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]]|title=Essays on the Latin Orient|volume=|page=464|location= Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wpEBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA464|date=1921}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Herzegovina'' (\"herzog's [land]\", from German word for \"duke\"){{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} originates from Bosnian magnate [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]]'s title, \"Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast\" (1448).{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=578}} Hum, formerly [[Zahumlje]], was an early medieval principality that was conquered by the Bosnian Banate in the first half of the 14th century. The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (''Hersek'') within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] up until the formation of the short-lived [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] in the 1830s, which remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nOn initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the official name was changed to Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>''The World Factbook'' (Washington DC: National Foreign Assessment Center, Central Intelligence Agency, 2013), 90-93. {{ISBN|0160921953}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Mogorjelo Villa Rustica.jpg|thumb|[[Mogorjelo]], ancient Roman suburban Villa Rustica from the 4th century, near [[\u010capljina]]]]\n{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\nBosnia has been inhabited by humans since at least the [[Paleolithic]], as one of the oldest paint caving was found in [[Badanj Cave|Badanj cave]]. Major Neolithic cultures such as the [[Butmir culture|Butmir]] and [[Kakanj culture|Kakanj]] were present along the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] dated from c. 6230 BC \u2013 c. 4900 BC.\n\n=== Ancient Illyrians ===\nThe bronze culture of the [[Illyrians]], an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form, started to organize itself in today's [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]] and parts of northern [[Greece]].\n[[Image:Roman glass 2nd cent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman glass]] found in [[Bosanski Novi]] from the 2nd century]]\n\nFrom 8th century BC, Illyrian tribes evolved into kingdoms. The earliest recorded kingdom in [[Illyria]] (a region in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula inhabited by the Illyrians, as recorded in classical antiquity) was the Enchele in the 8th century BC. The era in which we observe other Illyrian kingdoms begins approximately at 400 BC and ends at 167 BC. The Autariatae under Pleurias (337 BC) were considered to have been a kingdom. The Kingdom of the [[Ardiaei]] (originally a tribe from the Neretva valley region) began at 230 BC and ended at 167 BC. The most notable Illyrian kingdoms and dynasties were those of Bardyllis of the Dardani and of Agron of the Ardiaei who created the last and best-known Illyrian kingdom. Agron ruled over the Ardiaei and had extended his rule to other tribes as well.\n\nFrom the 7th century BC, bronze was replaced by iron, after which only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. Illyrian tribes, under the influence of [[Hallstatt]] cultures to the north, formed regional centers that were slightly different. Parts of Central Bosnia were inhabited by [[Daesitiates]] tribe most commonly associated with [[Central Bosnian cultural group]]. Iron Age [[Glasinac culture]] is associated with [[Autariatae]] tribe.\n\nA very important role in their life was the cult of the dead, which is seen in their careful burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of their burial sites. In northern parts, there was a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the south the dead were buried in large stone or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in Herzegovina were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 m wide and 5 m high. ''Japodian tribes'' had an affinity to decoration (heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze foil).\n\nIn the 4th century BC, the first invasion of [[Celts]] is recorded. They brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts. They only passed on their way to [[Greece]], so their influence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is negligible. Celtic migrations displaced many Illyrian tribes from their former lands, but some Celtic and Illyrian tribes mixed. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages.\n\nIn the [[Neretva Delta]] in the south, there were important [[Hellenistic]] influence of the Illyrian [[Daors]] tribe. Their capital was ''Daorson'' in O\u0161ani\u0107i near [[Stolac]]. Daorson in the 4th century BC was surrounded by [[megalithic]], 5 m high stonewalls (as large as those of [[Mycenae]] in Greece), composed of large trapezoid stone blocks. Daors made unique bronze [[coins]] and sculptures.\n\nConflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&nbsp;BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].<ref>[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17</ref> This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as ''[[Bellum Batonianum]]''.<ref>Miller, Norma. Tacitus: Annals I, 2002, {{ISBN|1-85399-358-1}}.

The region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Slavs overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.

It has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton Accords]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996, the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves.\n\nThe [[Br\u010dko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000, out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Br\u010dko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Br\u010dko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.<ref name=\"OHR\">OHR Bulletin 66 (3 February 1998).

They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. Each has a cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws to ensure the equality of all constituent people.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipality. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska into 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nBesides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four \"official\" cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Isto\u010dno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).\n\nAs a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state. The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.\n\nThe Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.\n\nThe Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.\n\nThe [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of [[proportional representation]] (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nHowever, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country and is selected by the [[European Union]]. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |title='The Contradictions of \"Democracy\" without Consent', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517144513/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |archivedate=17 May 2013}}</ref> International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.\n\n===Military===\n{{one source|section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (OSBiH) were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] was founded in 2004.\n\nThe Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 14,725 active and 7,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces have 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPADS]] hand-held missiles, [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. The Army has recently adopted remodeled [[MARPAT]] uniforms, used by Bosnian soldiers serving with [[ISAF]] in [[Afghanistan]]. A domestic production program is now underway to ensure that army units are equipped with the correct ammunition.\n\nBeginning in 2007, the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] undertook the army's first ever international assistance mission, enlisting the military to serve with ISAF peace missions to Afghanistan, [[Iraq]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2007. Five officers, acting as officers/advisors, served in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 45 soldiers, mostly acting as base security and medical assistants, served in Afghanistan. 85 Bosnian soldiers served as base security in Iraq, occasionally conducting infantry patrols there as well. All three deployed groups have been commended by their respective international forces as well as the Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The international assistance operations are still ongoing.\n\nThe Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] were merged in 2006. The Air Force has seen improvements in the last few years with added funds for aircraft repairs and improved cooperation with the [[Ground Forces]] as well as to the citizens of the country.

However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurki\u0107]], [[Petar \u0160ain]], [[Roman Petrovi\u0107]] and [[Lazar Drlja\u010da]].\n\nAfter World War II artists like [[Mersad Berber]] and [[Safet Zec]] rose in popularity.\n\nIn 2007, [[Ars Aevi]], a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{see also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}\n\nTypical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zoni\u0107]], [[Goran Bregovi\u0107]], [[Davorin Popovi\u0107]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko \u010coli\u0107]], [[Elvir Lakovi\u0107]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Hari Mata Hari]] and [[Dino Merlin]].

In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient ''[[Gusle]]''. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.\n\nProbably the most distinctive and identifiably \"Bosnian\" of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[saz (musical instrument)|saz]], a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.\n\n{{main|Bosnian root music}}\nRural folk traditions in Bosnia and Herzegovina include the shouted, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[ganga (music)|ganga]] and \"ravne pjesme\" (''flat song'') styles, as well as instruments like a droneless [[bagpipe]], wooden [[flute]] and [[\u0161argija]]. The [[gusle]], an instrument found throughout the [[Balkans]], is also used to accompany ancient [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[epic poetry|epic]] [[poems]]. There are also Bosnian folk songs in the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, derived from the area's Jewish population.\n[[File:43. TKB - Seljo z Sarajewa (Bo\u015bnia i Hercegowina) 10.JPG|thumb|Bosnians dancing a traditional [[Kolo (dance)|Kolo]]]]\n\n''Bosnian roots music'' came from [[Central Bosnia Canton|Middle Bosnia]], [[Posavina]], the [[Drina]] valley and [[Kalesija]]. It is usually performed by singers with two violinists and a [[sargija|\u0161argija]] player. These bands first appeared around [[World War I]] and became popular in the 1960s. This is the third oldest music following after the [[sevdalinka]] and ilahija. Self-taught people, mostly in two or three members of the different choices of old instruments, mostly in the violin, sacking, [[Ba\u011flama|saz]], drums, flutes (zurle) or wooden flute, as others have already called, the original performers of Bosnian music that can not be written notes, transmitted by ear from generation to generation, family is usually hereditary. It is thought to be brought from Persia-Kalesi tribe that settled in the area of present Sprecanski valleys and hence probably the name Kalesija. In this part of Bosnia it is the most common. Again, it became the leader of First World War onwards, as well as 60 years in the field Sprecanski doline. This kind of music was enjoyed by all three peoples in Bosnia, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs, and it contributed a lot to reconcile people socializing, entertainment and other organizations through festivala.

Some notable Bosnian screenwriters, directors and producers are [[Danis Tanovi\u0107]] (known for the Academy Award\u2013 and [[Golden Globe Award]]\u2013winning 2001 film ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'' and [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize]]\u2013winning 2016 film ''[[Death in Sarajevo]]''),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Home Festival Awards & Juries: International Jury \"Prizes Of The International Jury |website=www.berlinale.de/en |date=2016 |accessdate=23 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816162458/http://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |archive-date=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Emir Kusturica]] (won two [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes), [[Jasmila \u017dbani\u0107]] (won Golden Bear), [[Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107]], [[Ademir Kenovi\u0107]], Dino Mustafi\u0107, [[Ahmed Imamovi\u0107]], [[Pjer \u017dalica]], [[Aida Begi\u0107]], Adis Bakra\u010d, etc.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}\n[[File:Bosnian meat platter.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Bosnian meat platter]]\nBosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. Some local specialties are [[\u0106evap\u010di\u0107i|\u0107evapi]], [[burek]], [[dolma]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[pilav]], [[goulash]], [[ajvar]] and a whole range of Eastern sweets. \u0106evapi is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of [[kebab]], popular in former Yugoslavia and considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|date=2009|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=27 July 2009|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/700826/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503211212/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/700826/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina|archive-date=3 May 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Serbia]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoVUAAAAMAAJ&q=cevapcici&hl=en|title=Encyclopedia britannica|first=Encyclopedia|last=Britannica|date=11 August 2002|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pssZAQAAIAAJ&q=cevapcici|title=Countries and Their Cultures: Saint Kitts and Nevis to Zimbabwe|page=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=TravelSerbia.Info&nbsp;\u2013 Your travel guide for Serbia|accessdate=9 August 2010|url=http://www.travelserbia.info/serbian-cuisine.php|title=Serbian cuisine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330135429/http://www.travelserbia.info/serbian-cuisine.php|archive-date=30 March 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Local wines come from [[Herzegovina]] where the climate is suitable for growing grapes.

Loaded with supplies, the ''Eagle'' set off on the 600 mile crossing, but hit a blizzard and a gale approaching Deception Island (South Shetland Islands). During one particularly hard and sudden lurch of the vessel in the storm, Sheppard fell off the bridge onto the deck, breaking 3 ribs and was temporarily knocked unconscious.  Despite constant pain that curtailed his movement, he managed to steer the vessel for several trips between Deception Island and Hope Bay (Antarctic Peninsula), dodging calving icebergs, and working with the crews of the ''William Scoresby'' and ''Fitzroy'' to establish Base D at Hope Bay on February 12, 1945. They delivered the shore party, huskies, construction materials and all manner of cargo needed for research and survival.\n\nOn March 17, 1945, another hurricane raged over Hope Bay, with a force that snapped the ''Eagle''\u2019s anchor and drove the vessel into a massive iceberg, then into a second iceberg, and came close to colliding with a third. Due to the damaged stern and bow, the blinding snow and gale force winds, Sheppard was preparing the men to beach the ship and swim to shore. However, the clouds lifted, the wind abated, good sight lines were restored, and he steered the ''Eagle'' for Port Stanley. The ship was repaired sufficiently to reach Uruguay for a substantial overhaul.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sheppard |first=Robert |date=2006 |title=PADDY'S POT.

Sheppard steered from St. John's on November 20, 1945, with his wife Sadie and son, seaman Robert Austin Sheppard, on board.<ref name=DickinsonMari /> Due to wretched conditions on board, including rotting whale meat, Sadie stayed in Montevideo when the crew headed south. Again working with the local ''Fitzroy'' and the ''William Scoresby'', Sheppard relieved the men and re-equipped the bases at Hope Bay, Deception Island and Port Lockroy aided by a [[nautical chart]] drawn from a [[hydrographic survey]]. Conducted at his request, data were obtained the previous winter by taking depth soundings through holes cut in the ice.<ref name=DickinsonMari /> Then they established Base C at Cape Geddes on Laurie Island, South Orkneys in January 1946, restocked Base A at Port Lockroy and deposited emergency supplies at the closed Base C at Sandefjord Bay and at an abandoned hut on Winter Island, Argentine Islands.  The ''Trepassey'' was the lone ship used to to set up Base E, so they packed up as much supplies as the vessel could haul, 46 Labrador huskies, and the research personnel and steered further south to Marguerite Bay, Stonington Island, where offloading continued from February into March of 1946. After this, the ship and crew made ten trips to jettison 1000 tons of surplus war bombs, anti-aircraft shells, depth charges and small arms ammunition into the sea. While returning to St. John's, Sheppard was informed by radio that he was a recipient of the  [[1946 Birthday Honours/|Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) award]].

Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!
