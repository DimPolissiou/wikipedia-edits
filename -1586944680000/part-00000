These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, ''Poor Love'' (1999), ''From The Week of Hell '94'' (1995) and ''Ripped Up'' (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in ''Fuck You Eddy'' (1995) and ''Sad Shower in New York'' (1995) which are both part of the Tate's collection of Emin's art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tracey-emin-2590|title=Tracey Emin |work=Tate Etc.}}</ref>\n\nOften they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with [[Lynn Barber]], Emin said, \"It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkettart.com/qwr/set_library.php3?directory=63|title=PARKETT Books|publisher=parkettart.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text ''Something's Wrong''<ref>Terrebly Wrong (1997)</ref> or ''There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me''<ref>''Something'' (1997)</ref> {{sic}} written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside \"forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page.

''Hate And Power Can Be A Terrible Thing'' (2004), part of the Tate's collection of Emin's work, is a large-scale blanket inspired in part by [[Margaret Thatcher]] due to her involvement in \"an attack on 800 boys and men in the Argentinian navy\" and other women for example women who steals their friends' boyfriends, Emin says of this work \"about the kind of women I hate, the kind of women I have no respect for, women who betray and destroy the hearts of other women\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.tate.org.uk/btseries/bb/traceyemin|title=BT Series \u2013 Tracey Emin|website=Tate Etc.|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin's use of fabric is diverse, one of her most famous works came from sewing letters onto her grandmother's armchair in ''There's A Lot of Money in Chairs'' (1994).

Behind the chair back, the first page of ''Exploration of the Soul'', handwritten onto fabric, is appliqu\u00e9d together with other dictums such as, \u2018''It\u2019s not what you inherit. It\u2019s what you do with your inheritance''\u2019\".<ref name=\"MV\"/>\n\nEmin used the chair on a trip Emin made to the United States in 1994.

Feminist writers have reviewed Emin's pieces as containing, \"\u2026no element of eroticism or titillation\u2026unlike in Botticelli, Renoir or Klimt.

These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, ''Poor Love'' (1999), ''From The Week of Hell '94'' (1995) and ''Ripped Up'' (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in ''Fuck You Eddy'' (1995) and ''Sad Shower in New York'' (1995) which are both part of the Tate's collection of Emin's art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tracey-emin-2590|title=Tracey Emin |work=Tate Etc.}}</ref>\n\nOften they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with [[Lynn Barber]], Emin said, \"It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkettart.com/qwr/set_library.php3?directory=63|title=PARKETT Books|publisher=parkettart.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text ''Something's Wrong''<ref>Terrebly Wrong (1997)</ref> or ''There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me''<ref>''Something'' (1997)</ref> {{sic}} written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside \"forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page.

In The Livingroom'' (1994). Emin further produced a set of monoprints detailing her memories of [[Margate]]'s iconic buildings such as ''Margate Harbour 16/5/95'' (1995), ''The Lido 16/5/95'' (1995) and ''Light House 15/5/95'' (1995).

The [[Christchurch earthquake]]s caused significant damage in the area.\n\nNew Brighton is one of eastern Christchurch's main entertainment and tourist centres, with its architecturally unique pier and scenic coastline.\n\n==Naming==\nThe naming of New Brighton was apparently done on a 'spur of moment' decision by William Fee, an early settler of the area. When [[Guise Brittan]], the Waste Lands Commissioner, visited the area in December 1860, he was recognised and Fee chalked 'New Brighton' on a wooden plank, supposedly in reference to his fellow settler Stephen Brooker, who had come from [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]] in England.<ref name=\"Christchurch Place Names\">{{cite web|last= Harper|first= Margaret|title= Christchurch Place Names|url= http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchPlaceNames.pdf |publisher=Christchurch City Libraries|accessdate=1 October 2011|date=July 2011|pages = 131f}}</ref> The [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] name for the area is Kaiuau (''kai'' means food and ''aua'' is [[Yellow-eye mullet]])<ref name=\"Reed\">{{cite book\n |last=Reed\n |first=A.

A {{convert|300|m|ft}} [[pier]] was built here in the 1990s, and opened on 1 November 1997.\n\nNew Brighton was originally a distinct coastal village, separated from the then outer suburbs of Christchurch by the swampy areas adjoining the [[Avon River (Canterbury)|Avon River]]. However, urban expansion, land reclamation and drainage have led to Brighton being swallowed by Christchurch city.\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:New Brighton and the Port Hills, Christchurch, New Zealand, 12 June 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Aerial view of New Brighton beach and the Port Hills]]\n[[File:New Brighton, Christchurch.jpg|thumb|200px|The beach]]\nThe current attractions of the area include:\n* A sandy beach, suitable for surfing, stretching 18&nbsp;km from the [[Waimakariri River]] mouth in the north, to the spit in the south\n* New Brighton's Seaside Market \u2013 held weekly in the pedestrian part of the New Brighton Mall\n* Pier and Council library on the foreshore, in Central New Brighton\n* The New Brighton and Districts Museum, located on Hardy Street\n* Home of the first surf life saving club in New Zealand established in 1910,<ref>{{cite web|title=Centenary|url=http://newbrightonslsc.org.nz/?page_id=16|publisher=New Brighton Surf Bathing & Life Saving Club Incorporated 1910|accessdate=1 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312103442/http://newbrightonslsc.org.nz/?page_id=16|archivedate=12 March 2012}}</ref> also North Beach Surf Club to the north and South New Brighton Surf Club to the south\n* Rawhiti Domain \u2013 with a [[Christchurch City Council]]-run golf links, tennis courts, dog park, rugby fields, cricket ovals, netball courts, community carden, archery club and children's play area\n\n[[Image:NewBrightonPier gobeirne.JPG|left|thumb|400px|New Brighton Pier, library, and clock tower]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Events==\nNew Brighton host a variety of free public events:\n\n===Coast to Coast===\n\nStaged every February, the annual Coast to Coast race finishes at New Brighton.

These feelings of neglect by the Christchurch City Council would continue to persist. Groups such as the Peoples independent Republic of New Brighton was formed by Paul Zaaman, The New Brighton Businesses and landowners association spokesperson, in order to protest lack of investment by the Christchurch City Council into New Brighton.\n\nNew Brighton was also named to be the host the finish of the annual Speight's Coast to Coast multisport race in February 2015.
