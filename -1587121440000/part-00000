The series aired on [[TV Tokyo]] from October 4, 2003 to September 25, 2004, with a total of 51 half-hour episodes. This series is the first of [[Toho]]'s \"[[Chouseishin Series|Seishin (Star God)]]\" series.\n\nThe premise of this series is similar to both the [[Super Sentai|''Super Sentai'' series]] and the [[manga]]/[[anime]] series ''[[Saint Seiya]]'': there are 12 heroes, divided into four ''tribes'', and each tribe has a giant transforming robot.\nThe events and characters are described below, using in-universe tone.\n\n==Plot==\n\nSome 400,000,000 years after an advanced human civilization was destroyed by aliens, 12 direct descendants of the civilization's warriors (called \"Sazers\") have their powers awakened and form four tribes: Flame, Wind, Earth and Water. Each Sazer is based on a Zodiac sign represented in an animal totem or spirit representation. At first, they wage war on each other, but after learning the truth of their ancestry and their reason for awakening, the Gransazer tribes unite to protect Earth from the Warp Monarch, an alliance of various alien species, from once again extinguishing all life on the planet.<ref>''Gransazers'' Episode 27.</ref>\n\n===1st Arc: Karin Saeki and the three tribes (1-12)===\n\nThe archaeologist Ichiro Horiguchi has indeed discovered a crystal tablet that revealed the existence of this ancient civilization and Gransazers. As luck would have it, his assistant Mika (Mithras) happened to be a Gransazer belonging to the Flames Tribe, and they soon met the second member of this Tribe, the impetuous Tenma (Tarious) and also the third one Ken (Lion), who was also Mika's younger brother. Together, they go in search of the other three Tribes and the corresponding Chouseishins.\n\nUnfortunately for them, a scientist named Karin Saeki has meanwhile gathered the members of the Wind Tribe and convinced them that the Flames represents a threat to the Earth. Then start a race against the clock between the two camps to gather the members of the Tribe of the Earth and locate the Chouseishins, even destroying them to prevent the other camp from seizing them.\n\nThe Earth Tribe quickly ranks side by side with the Flames, while Wind's members begin to have doubts about Karin's sincerity except for their leader, Remls, who is in love with her. And the result prove them right: Karin is actually an extraterrestrial planet Akelon sent to Earth by a mysterious sponsor to destroy the Gransazers. Her true nature revealed, Karin is transformed into a giant monster that is destroyed by Chouseishins three tribes finally reconciled.\n\n===2nd Arc: The Impactors and the Water Tribe (13-24)===\n\nAfter Karin's defeat, the Impacters, a trio of extraterrestrial fighters uniting Logia, Lucia and Radia, are sent to Earth to destroy Leviathan, the Chouseishin of the Water Tribe, before the Gransazers find him. Unfortunately, all their attempts are turned against them. They first send an asteroid crashing on the island where it is hidden but Cloud Dragon (the ship carrying Chouseishins) destroys it and the debris free Leviathan from his hiding place. Radia then turns into a giant to destroy him but he is killed after the Water Tribe has appeared and taken control of Leviathan.\n\nFor his part, Horiguchi discovered the existence of a fifth Chouseishin, Guntras, and tried to repair the apparatus to control it with the help of Professor Masaki Wakui and his assistant Sh\u00fbichi Hoshiyama. Unfortunately, once the device is repaired, it is stolen by Shuichi who was in fact Logia disguised, who uses it to take control of Guntras he intends to explode inside the sun to destroy our solar system. The Gransazers happily fail his project and the control system is destroyed, making Guntras autonomous.\n\nSubsequently, the Gransazers discover that the other Chouseishins can combine with Guntras to form a giant dragon named Daisazer. Thanks to him, they manage to triumph over Lucia turned into an uncontrollable giant, then Dailogian, a giant robot driven by Logia. Vanquished, the latter commits suicide (apparently) using a device of self-destruction.\n\n===3rd Arc: Various aliens (25-41)===\n\nUnlike the other parts which are characterized by a main plot spanning several episodes and by one or more main opponents, the third prefers to focus on independent stories in one or two episodes using the classic formula of \"one episode = an opponent\", with the exception of episodes 33, 34, 40 and 41<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gransazers/|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u6771\u4eac\u30fb\u3042\u306b\u3066\u308c \u8d85\u661f\u795e \u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc \u3053\u308c\u307e\u3067\u306e\u304a\u8a71|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tv-tokyo.co.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>, in which the Gransazers are once again confronted with a living Logia and drunk with revenge.\n\nThe different episodes, however, have good suspense and carefully avoid the trap of repetitiveness. In addition, the fact that most of the episodes of this third part give the spotlight to only one Gransazer at a time makes it possible to flesh out characters that the series had difficulty to develop in the other episodes which privileged the team with the detriment of his members.\n\nThis third part also introduces a last giant robot designed by the JSDF, Yuhi, and the Gran Vehicles, individual vessels that the Gransazers fly when they do not command their Chouseishins. Unfortunately, after the rise that marked the second part, it all seems a little light.\n\n===Final Arc: Bosquito and Wolf Manafu (42-51)===\n\nThe fourth and final part begins when an alien named Luka frees Bosquito, a particularly powerful and dangerous creature with the same powers as the Gransazers. Bosquito is finally defeated after four episodes, many civilian casualties and the sacrifice of Luka, while one of the Gransazers, Ran (Visuel), discovers a great affinity with the crystal tablet that reveals to him that the first Gransazers had been created to fight the Bosquitos who are the real ones responsible for the destruction of the ancient earth civilization, while the famous extraterrestrial fleet had actually intervened at the request of the space union Wof Manaf to help Earth fight them after they took control of Chouseishins.\n\nUnfortunately, convinced that the current earthlings are descendants of Bosquitos, Wolf Manafu decides to launch a new attack on our planet, which is an opportunity to discover that their ships have hardly changed in 400 million years. As the fleet gets closer, the Japanese army and the Gransazers are contacted by Brighton, a \"peaceful\" envoy of Wolf Manafu, who tells them that Ran is actually a Bosquito. Horrified, she is ready to let Wolf Manafu execute it, unaware that it is a trick to eliminate it because she is the only one able to use the crystal tablet to communicate with the leader of Wolf Manafu.\n\nFor the home run, writers set the bar in terms of threats, starting with Bosquito, a formidable predator whose new abilities are constantly being discovered and which will cause the death of many civilians (whereas in previous episodes the collateral victims of the battles of our heroes were generally ignored), before continuing with the threat of a fleet ready to exterminate the human race. It is also in this last part that the writers finally solve the questions asked at the beginning of the series by revealing the reasons for the battle that had opposed the Earth to Wof Manaf while going against the expectations of the viewer, since unlike To the appearance, the squadron of Wolf Manafu did not fight Earthlings but Bosquitos.\n\n==The GranSazers==\nDescendants of the warriors from the ancient human civilization, they later learn that the GranSazers were created to protect Earth from the Bosquito. Each GranSazer is marked by a glowing symbol, corresponding to their astrological sign, on the back of their left hand. This symbol can turn into a ''Knuckle-Riser''. By setting the Knuckle-Riser to \"Transformation Mode\", they can equip high-powered suits that transform them into GranSazers. Their transformation call is {{nihongo|\"Equip!\"|\u88c5\u7740|S\u014dchaku!}}\n\nGranSazer is composed by 12 members split amongst four elements. When three members of the same element have been awakened and gathered, a Tribe is formed. When three members gather and set their Knuckle-Risers to ChouSeiShin Mode, they can summon a machine of incredible power called an {{nihongo|Ultra Star God|\u8d85\u661f\u795e|Ch\u014dseishin}}. Once a Tribe's respective ChouSeiShin has been summoned, one member can set their Knuckle-Riser to \"Boarding Mode\" in order to \"Dive-In\" and board their ChouSeiShin. The one who is on their ChouSeiShin can change into a giant folding robot. The other two GranSazers would later pilot jetfighters called Gran Vehicles.\n\nEach GranSazer also has their own unique weapon, which can be summoned by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Arms Mode\". When piloting their respective ChouSeiShin, they can equip the ChouSeiShin with a large version of their personal weapon by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer-Gear Mode\". They can also communicate with other Sazers by setting the Knuckle-Riser to \"Communication Mode\".\n\nThe GranSazers can also perform a combination attack called \"Formation Zero\". The attack involves Sazer-Tarious, Sazer-Mithras, Sazer-Lion, Sazer-Dail, Sazer-Tragos and Sazer-Pisces all performing a sandwich jump kick on the enemy.\n\n===Flame Tribe===\nThe {{nihongo|Flame Tribe or Fire Tribe|\u708e\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6|Hon\u014d no Toraibu}} are the first tribe to recognize the alien threat and the second to be fully assembled. From the very beginning, they were assisted by Professor Horiguchi, who helped them realize their duty as Gransazers. The Flame Tribe armoured suits are all bird-shaped with red-based colour and they pilot the Flame-Driver Grand Vehicles. This tribe is also the one and only tribe which two of their members (Tarious and Lion) can equip Garuda with a large version of their personal weapon by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer Gear Mode\" rather than other tribes which only their leader (Remls, Tawlon and Gorbion) can use this mode on their ChouSeiShin.\n\n====Sazer-Tarious====\n{{nihongo|Tenma Kudou|\u5f13\u9053 \u5929\u99ac|Kud\u014d Tenma}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gransazers/character/001.html|title=\u5f13\u9053\u5929\u99ac|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tv-tokyo.co.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> is a rash postman, usually going in head first. He stumbled into being a Sazer after he was harassed by Sazer-Velsou; his temper and the powers within him made him transform. Immediately afterwards, he defeated Velsou. Often locking horns with Mika and the others, he doesn't quite like being made the leader, but he accepts the role. Tenma cares a lot about his comrades as well as about the world he lives. Despite frequently bickering with Mika, Tenma developed a serious crush on her as the show progresses.\n \nWith his Knuckle Riser, Tenma transforms into {{nihongo|'''Sazer Tarious'''|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9 |Seiz\u0101 Tariasu}}, the Flame warrior under the sign of [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], his armour is shaped after a [[falcon]] in red colour. Sazer Tarious is the leader of Flame Tribe and also the leader of all 12 Gransazers.\n\nSazer-Tarious' main weapon is the '''Falcon Bow''', a [[bow and arrow]] set situated on the left wrist (in place of the Knuckle Riser). It can fire Flame-powered shots and even a continuous stream of fiery arrows. Its finishing attack called \"'''Burning Falcon'''\", which involves the shooting of a giant fiery arrow from the Falcon Bow. His second attack is the \"'''Cosmo Punch'''\", in which Sazer-Tarious jumps up, then spins towards his adversary before striking with a flaming outstretched fist.\n\n====Sazer-Mithras====\n{{nihongo|Mika Shidou |\u7345\u5802 \u672a\u52a0|Shid\u014d Mika}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gransazers/character/002.html|title=\u7345\u7ae5\u672a\u52a0|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tv-tokyo.co.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>is the tomboyish elder sister of Ken and the wise member of the Flame Tribe. Having helped Professor Horiguchi with his research, she was the first Sazer to be awakened. Her cool and reserved attitude often clashes with the bright personality of Tenma, but when push comes to shove she proves to be a true friend and is fond of him as well.\n\nWith her Knuckle Riser, Mika transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer Mithras|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30df\u30c8\u30e9\u30b9|Seiz\u0101 Mitorasu)}}, the flame warrior under the sign of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], with a white and red armour shaped after a [[swan]]. Her main weapons are the \nSwan Sector, a pair of [[Japanese war fan|fans]]. Its finishing attack, known as the \"Brand Tornado\", resembles a blast from a flamethrower tornado.\n\nMika later makes a cameo appearance in ''Justirisers'' Episode 35, when she injured Shouta because she thought that he was a stalker. When asked by Yuka, she said that she had such skills because she used them in what she used to do, being a 'friend of justice'.\n\n====Sazer-Lion====\n{{nihongo|Ken Shidou|\u7345\u5802 \u5263|Shid\u014d Ken}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gransazers/character/003.html|title=\u7345\u7ae5\u5263|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tv-tokyo.co.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>is the younger brother of Mika by three years and last member of the Flame Tribe to be awakened; this happened when the Wind Tribe attacked the activated Garuda with Dolcross. He is the calm-and-collected pole of the tribe, a shy but caring and compassionate person who deeply loves his sister. After meeting Ran, he developed a crush on her, but he would never admit it.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Ken transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer Lion|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Seiz\u0101 Rion}}, the flame warrior under the sign of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], his [[dark red]] armour is shaped after a [[swallow]] with [[black]] colour on his arm. His main weapons are the Double Crescent, a pair of [[sword]]s. Its finishing attack, called \"Hien Zan\" (Flying Swallow Slash), resembles a large wave of fire.\n\n===Wind Tribe===\nThe {{nihongo|Wind Tribe|\u98a8\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6|Kaze no Toraibu}} are the first tribe that is fully assembled, deceived by Akelon who disguised as Saeki Karin to attack the other GranSazers, especially Flame Tribe. After they realized they were being deceived, they turned against Karin and allied with the other GranSazers to defeat her. The Wind Tribe armoured suits are all insect-shaped with purple-based colours and pilot the Wind-Driver Grand Vehicles.\n\n====Sazer-Remls====\nBack when he first met Karin, {{nihongo|Akira Dentsuin|\u4f1d\u901a\u9662 \u6d38|Dentsuin Akira}} was awakened as Sazer Remls, tricked by the Akelon into fighting the Flame Tribe. Akira was the one who stood by Karin's side the longest, attacking his friends while still believing in and feeling for her. He may seem distant and cold but he is actually loyal and compassionate and if required, he can be a fierce fighter. He is the oldest GranSazer. He is also a doctor.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Akira transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Remls|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30ec\u30e0\u30eb\u30ba|Seiz\u0101 Remuruzu}}, the wind warrior under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], with armour shaped after a [[Japanese rhinoceros beetle]] in the colour of indigo (bluish purple). Sazer-Remls is also the leader of the Wind Tribe. Sazer-Remls' main weapon is the Iron Gale, a rifle cannon. Its finishing attack is called \"Final Judgement\", which is a concentrated ball of air. His second attack is the \"Remls Tornado\", a strong tornado blast from Remls' palm.\n\nDentsuin later makes a cameo appearance in ''Justirisers'' Episode 30, as the doctor who assessed Mio's condition.\n\n====Sazer-Velsou====\nRecruited and recited by Karin as well, {{nihongo|Ryouko Amemiya|\u96e8\u5bae \u6dbc\u5b50|Amemiya Ry\u014dko}} is the ambitious sports instructor of the Wind Tribe, aware of her unknown skills and with a dislike towards weaklings. Along with that, she is also rather calculating and intelligent. It was she who first doubted the motivations of Karin and became the first to leave the evil scientist, to be joined by Jin soon after. Under her personal training, Tappei has now become a freedom fighter. She fell in love with Naoto (Sazer-Tawlon). In the end of series, her marriage is shown with him.\n\nWith her Knuckle Riser, Ryouko transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Velsou|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30bd\u30fc|Seiz\u0101 Verus\u014d}}, the wind warrior under the sign of [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]; her [[magenta]]-coloured armour is shaped after a [[butterfly]]. Sazer-Velsou's main weapons are the Sel Cross, a pair of [[buckler]]s. Its finishing attack is called \"Full Moon Slash\", which is a vertical slash of magenta-tinted air that charges to the target. Sazer-Velsou's second attack is the \"Velsou Illusion\", a [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] attack that disables her enemies.\n\n====Sazer-Dail====\nThe final member of the Wind Tribe, {{nihongo|Jin Hakariya|\u79e4\u8c37 \u4ec1|Hakariya Jin}}, was bad books by Karin and joined them looking for fun rather than being devoted to his mission. He enjoys having his powers and playing around with them, always up for a challenge. Despite that, he enjoys teamwork and thus was soon convinced by Ryoko that the Sazers have to work as one big team. He often shows up just in time to level the odds.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Jin transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Dail|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30eb|Seiz\u0101 Dairu}}, the wind warrior under the sign of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]; his purple armour is shaped after a [[stag beetle]]. Sazer-Dail's main weapons are the Axe Tagger, [[axe]]-like [[tonfa]]s.

This tribe is the most divided one because each of the three members has a personality that conflicts with the others sometimes. This tribe is also a different one which the last member to be awakened is a woman, instead of man in other tribes. Karin tried to enlist the Earth Tribe into her group, but failed, causing the Earth Tribe to fight together with the Flame Tribe. Their armoured suits are shaped after four-legged mammals with yellow and orange-based colours, piloting the Earth-Driver Grand Vehicles.\n\n====Sazer-Tawlon====\n{{nihongo|Naoto Matsuzaka|\u677e\u5742 \u76f4\u4eba|Matsuzaka Naoto}} was once a famous and highly prized fighter who is now mostly retired from the spotlight, going back to teaching young talents the ways of self-defense. Often he is not to be found, for Naoto constantly seeks to become stronger and better, not just independently but in total isolation, despite the fact that he already is a powerhouse. He is also dedicated and tough. He would never give up, no matter how bad the odds are for him. In Justiriser episode 43, Naoto founded a gym where he meets Shouta, who reminds him of Tenma (Sazer-Tarious). When Shouta loses his Justi Powers, Naoto helps him regain his composure. He later sees Shouta become Riser Glen as he joins the other Justirisers and Demon Knight fighting their enemies, personally holding the Zokoals off before taking his leave. He fell in love with Ryoko (Sazer-Velsou) and they finally married on the last episode.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Naoto transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Tawlon|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30bf\u30a6\u30ed\u30f3|Seiz\u0101 Tauron}}, the ground warrior under the sign of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], whose armour is shaped after a [[bull]] in yellow colour. Sazer-Tawlon is the leader of the Earth Tribe. Sazer-Tawlon's main weapon is the Bull Cannon, a pair of shoulder [[cannon]]s. Its finishing attack is called \"Matador Burst\", which is a charged shot.\n\n====Sazer-Tragos====\nThe second and most reliable member of Earth Tribe, {{nihongo|Gou Kamiya|\u795e\u8c37 \u8c6a|Kamiya G\u014d}} is a serious, dedicated and faithful policeman with a strong sense of justice. Without his control, Gou transformed for the first time when he was attacked by Akaki Junya, a guy that believed to be most wanted suspect in a robbery case, who was also Ran's childhood friend. After Gou realized that he is awakened as an Earth warrior, he immediately aligned with the Flame Tribe and fought some duels with Jin (Sazer-Dail). Within him, there is also a kind and honest side which came out when he was debating with Naoto on duty and priorities. He fell in love with the genius 18-year old scientist, Professor Aya Stacy.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Gou transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Tragos|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30c8\u30e9\u30b4\u30b9|Seiz\u0101 Toragosu}}, the ground warrior under the sign of [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] where his armour is shaped after a [[goat]] with colour of light [[orange]]. Sazer-Tragos' main weapon is the Spiral Horn (derived from the shape of goat's horn), a [[drill]] arm. Its finishing attack is called \"Penetrate Thunder\", which is a thunder-like drill attack that requires him to jump at a height and dive immediately to attack the enemy.\n\n====Sazer-Visuel====\nThe last member of Earth Tribe to be awakened, {{nihongo|Ran Saotome|\u65e9\u4e59\u5973 \u862d|Saotome Ran}} is a quirky and college-going young woman who met the Sazers when her childhood friend was accused of a crime which Gou and his policeman partner, Nanami were investigating. At first, she was abducted by Karin and the Wind Tribe to be their ally, but she eventually fled. In order to protect Gou (Sazer-Tragos) from a trigger-happy criminal named Ryuji Naito, she transformed into Sazer-Visuel for the first time. Despite her seemingly carefree nature, she can be very serious and devoted and can tap into the Crystal Slab, eventually revealing the full story behind the Ancient War. When Warp Monarch begins its final assault, Ran originally fell for the deception that she was a descendant of the Bosquito, but it was later found out that she is the Communicator and thus can communicate Warp Monarch itself for Earth's sake.\n\nWith her Knuckle Riser, Ran transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Visuel|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30f4\u30a3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a8\u30eb|Seiz\u0101 Visjueru}}, the ground warrior under the sign of [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]; her armour is shaped after a female [[leopard]] in [[orange (colour)|orange]] colour. Sazer-Visuel's main weapons are the Lady Claw, a pair of long and sharp [[claws]]. Its finishing attack is called \"Night Scratch\", which is a powerful claw slash.\n\n===Water Tribe===\nThe {{nihongo|Water Tribe|\u6c34\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6|Mizu no Toraibu}} appeared after the Akelon incident and was the last tribe to be fully assembled. Led by the strict and mistrusting war photographer Makoto, this tribe fought a while on their own. After they being fully assembled and awakened their ChouSeiShin, Leviathan, they joined the other Sazers. The armoured suits of Water Tribe are all shaped with sea animals with blue-based colours, piloting the Aqua-Driver Grand Vehicles.\n\n====Sazer-Gorbion====\n{{nihongo|Makoto Sorimachi|\u53cd\u753a \u8aa0|Sorimachi Makoto}} as Sazer-Gorbion is the leader of the Water Tribe. His past as a war photographer made him grow cautious and mistrusting, and initially he only trust his tribe members and not other tribes. He makes his debut as a Sazer when Leviathan becomes endangered due to Radia's presence and motives and promptly saves Tarious from impending death. He refused to work in the big team for a while longer, and his generally high dedication to what he thinks is right is often, but not always, a blessing to the other Sazers.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Makoto transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Gorbion|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30b4\u30eb\u30d3\u30aa\u30f3|Seiz\u0101 Gorubion}}, the water warrior under the sign of [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]; his armour is shaped after a [[shark]] in [[royal blue]] colour. Sazer-Gorbion's main weapon is the Blast Saw, a serrated [[broadsword]]. Its finishing attack is called \"Death Storm\", which calls forth a small tsunami.

Right after their first encounter, Ai fell in love with him. Later that day, she and her long-time friend Tappei were attacked by Lucia, and Ai had to transform to protect herself. Just in time, she was saved by Akira (Sazer-Remls). Eventually she found out that Professor Wakui, a man she had known for years was her biological father, and this man was kidnapped by Logia.

The surviving child began to feed when Makoto and Jin arrive and were attacked as Tauron arrives to support them before the Bosquito multiplies itself as the Flame Tribe arrive to counter the second Bosquito until Yuuhi blasts it. Absorbing its clone, the Bosquito takes the controls for Yuuhi and uses it against the Gransazers, stealing Garuda when the Flame Tribe summons it. Levithan and Gunceasar are summoned to weaken Garuda so eject the Bosquito, who starts to absorb the floral life energy to regain its strength and create two clones of itself. After the others destroy the clones, the orbs they left behind are reabsorbed into the original Bosquito as it evolves into a giant monster. After Tarius uses one of Lion's Crescents to take the ruby on its chest, the source of its power, the Bosquito is destroyed by DaiSazer.\n\nHowever, as revealed in the Seishin crossover (''[[Sazer-X the Movie|Chousei Kantai Sazer-X: The Movie]]''), another Bosquito existed within the monster Bulgario, released when the monster was destroyed at sea, absorbing the JustiPower in Sazer Island, so it can duplicate itself and can disguise themselves as impostor Justirisers. They are all destroyed by Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X but quickly absorbed into the phantom ship so that it would form into Mammoth-Bosquito dragon. The Mammoth-Bosquito is destroyed by Great-Lio (piloted by Lio-Sazer) using the final move, Howling Crush, which the power of Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X combined into the finishing attack to destroy the monster.\n\n==ChouSeiShin==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2019}}\n''The ChouSeiShin'' ''(Ultra Star Gods'' or ''Super Star Gods)'' are the most powerful weapons of the ancient Earth Civilization. They remained dormant on Earth until the GranSazers were awakened, and reactivated the long-lost relics.\n\nEach Tribe possesses one of the four ChouSeiShin, which can be summoned by setting all of their Knuckle-Risers to \"ChouSeiShin Mode\". One member of the Tribe can then \"Dive In\" and board the machine by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Boarding Mode\". Furthermore, by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer Gear Mode\" the pilot can equip their ChouSeiShin with a large version of their personal weapon.\n\nEach ChouSeiShin has two modes, which can be switched between with a simple transformation. In \"Live Mode\", they resemble animals and possess incredible maneuverability. In Warrior Mode, they resemble [[bipedal]] [[mecha]], losing most of their speed, but gaining immense attacking power.\n\n===ChouSeiShin Garuda===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin Garuda|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30ac\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0 |Ch\u014dseishin Gar\u016bda}} is the Flame Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the second to be awaken from its slumber in Houhou [[Mountain]]. \nIn Live Mode, Garuda is shaped after a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and attacks with his guns located under its wings where its legs are, firing lasers and energy beams. Garuda can also tackle enemies after engulfing himself in flames. \nIn Warrior Mode, Garuda mostly relies on the 'Garu Claw', which are his talons on the back of his fists, for close-range combat. He performs his finishing move \"Fire Bird Slash\" with them. Garuda can also summon a sword called Burning Saber for armed melee combat. Tarious' Sazer Gear equips Garuda with a giant version of the Falcon Bow, and Lion's Sazer Gear equips Garuda with giant versions of the Double Crescents.\n\n===ChouSeiShin Dorcrus===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin Dorcrus|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30c9\u30eb\u30af\u30eb\u30b9|Ch\u014dseishin Dorukurusu}} also known as Dorcrus or Dorcrus is the Wind Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the first to be awakened from its slumber in Kabuto [[Mountain]]. \nIn Live Mode, Dorcrus is shaped after a [[European rhinoceros beetle]] and attacks with his multitude of cannons as well as with full tackles. \nIn Warrior Mode, Dorcrus uses his large array of cannons and blasters to perform various attacks. His finishing move, \"Herakles Hurricane\", fires his entire arsenal of cannons and blasters simultaneously. Remls' Sazer Gear equips Dorcrus with a giant version of the Iron Gale on his head, since Dolcruz does not have proper hands to hold objects (in theory).\n\n===ChouSeiShin GunCaesar===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin GunCaesar|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30ac\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc |Ch\u014dseishin Gansh\u012bs\u0101}} is the Earth Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the third to be awaken from its slumber in the Shishioh [[Desert]]. \nIn Live Mode, GunCaesar is shaped after a [[liger]] and attacks with his cannons as well as with his claws. \nIn Warrior Mode, GunCaesar uses his cannons, the Liger Riots, as hand blasters. He performs his finishing move, \"Gravity Burst\", with them. Tawlon's Sazer Gear equips GunCaesar with a giant version of the Bull Cannon.\n\n===ChouSeiShin Leviathan===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin Leviathan|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30ea\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30b5\u30f3|Ch\u014dseishin Rivaiasan}} is the Water Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the last to be awaken from its slumber in Shinkujira [[Island]] when the Impactors arrive on Earth. \nIn Live Mode, Leviathan has a [[whale]]-like shape and uses his fins for ramming attacks, as well as firing his two cannons at the fins. \nIn Warrior Mode, Leviathan is armed with the Maelstrom Blades which can be used for his finishing move \"High Tide Break\". Furthermore, he is equipped with the Ocean Shield which can be used for his another move \"Mirage Shield\" which can multiply for defence purposes. Gorbion's Sazer Gear equips Leviathan with a giant version of the Blast Saw.\n\n===ChouSeiShin Guntras===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin Guntras|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30b9|Ch\u014dseishin Gantorasu}} is controlled by an advanced AI, superior to the other ChouSeiShin to have a will of his own. Initially hidden away in the Andes, referred as the \"Great Shadow\" in Peruvian legend, Guntras resurfaced when his Guntroller is repaired and Logia controls him, planning to use Guntras' oxygen fuel supply to collide with the [[Sun]] and trigger a [[nova]] strong enough to evaporate Earth, after killing the GranSazers first. Tenma eventually got the Guntroller and freed Guntras, who joined up with Cloud Dragon as an ally to the Sazers. Later Guntras is revealed to be created in order to combine the four ChouSeiShin into one giant super robot (DaiSazer). Guntras is armed with an array of deadly weapons, among them a laser battery on his chest, a cannon on his forehead and missile launchers on his body. He can fire and immediately replace his fists in his ''Twin Crusher'' attack, and his powerful feet can create devastating shockwaves in his Land Shake attack.\n\n===Fusion Beast-King DaiSazer===\n{{nihongo|Fusion Beast-King DaiSazer|\u5408\u795e\u7363\u738b\u30c0\u30a4\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Gasshinj\u016b\u014d Daiseiz\u0101}} is the assembled form of the four Tribes' ChouSeishin, along with ChouSeishin Guntras. Guntras forms the main body, head and feet; Garuda for chest, cranium, and back; Dorcrus for the legs; GunCaesar for the right arm and the shoulder cannons; and Leviathan for the left arm and the tail. Combined, DaiSazer has a very aggressive and archaic mind of its own. All four pilots have to focus in order to control DaiSazer. DaiSazer is a very deadly creature and it is armed with a deflector as well as a laser array on its chest, but DaiSazer mostly relies on brute force to deal with its opponents.\n\nIts attacks include: 'Rapid Sazer', which fires the shoulder cannons on its back; 'Blast Pressure', unleashing a blast of fire from Guncaesar's mouth on its right arm; 'God Sphere', firing energy beams from its eyes. Its finishing move is 'Hyper Burst', which unleashes the full power of Guntras and the 4 ChouSeiShin combined through the laser array on its chest.\n\n===ChouSeiJuuren Cloud Dragon===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiJuuren Cloud Dragon|\u8d85\u661f\u7363\u9023\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Ch\u00f4seij\u00fbren Kuraudo Doragon}},translated into English as ''Ultra Star Beast Carrier Cloud Dragon'', is as old as the ChouSeiShin, another remnant of the ancient civilization and residing within the ozone layer of the Earth to protect it from alien invaders, implanted with a DNA of humanity\nto start back up the human race and an AI modeled after a woman from ancient civilization. She only descends from the ozone layer if the ChouSeiShin are summoned or are in need of her help for repairs. The Cloud Dragon is designed for combat support and repairs the ChouSeishin after they suffered battle damage and rendered immobile as a result, in which a sky whirlpool is created to collect the damaged ChouSeiShin and loads them onto one of the 4 storage pads (for the ChouSeiShin of each Tribe in the order of Flame(Garuda), Wind(Dorcrus), Earth(GunCaesar) and Water(Leviathan) respectively) on its body for repairs and restoration in outer space (the first such repairs is done onto the Flame ChouSeiShin Garuda by restoring its damaged left wing), upon which they can be launched straight from the colossal Dragon's storage pads once fully repaired and when the Gransazers summon them. Prior to the final battle, Cloud Dragon formally introduces herself to the GranSazers before telling them they have the answer to stop the attack on Earth. The Cloud Dragon's attack is the Galactica Prominence Cannon, a devastating blaster capable of blowing an entire asteroid into pieces. Inside cloud dragon there are Granvehicle which is one for each tribe's member. granvehicle of flame tribe is flame driver, wind tribe's vehicle is wind driver,earth tribe's is earth driver, and the water tribe's is aqua driver, which is one for each gransazer. With gransazers nuckle riser there is granvehicle mode. The sazers Who dives in they on's their granvehicle mode and says granvehicle launch and dives in. on the cloud dragon the place where these granvehicles launch is where guntrass stands in front is place where granvehicles launch which is one for everyone. Cloud Dragon's Zodiac sign is unofficial 13th sign, [[Ophiuchus]].\n\n==Other mecha==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2019}}\n===DaiLogian===\nDailogian is Logia's personal [[mecha]]. It is a black humanoid robot patterned after a [[wolf]] and its power is almost equal to Daisazer's. Unlike his subordinates, Lucia and Radia, Logia cannot grow into a giant; instead, he summons his mecha, which is always on standby in outer space, and which Logia alone can summon. It can absorb beam attacks through its chest and redirect them back to the opponents. It first fought with Daisazer and was defeated when Daisazer ripped off its arm. The second time was when Logia and Tenma fought one on one in their respective mechas with Tenma barely securing the victory. After DaiLogian was defeated, it was taken by the Japan Self-Defense Force for study. It reactivated, then busted out of the Japan Self-Defense Force holding area, when Logia returned to Earth to seek vengeance against the Sazers. Afterwards, Logia used it as a mode of transport.\n\n===Yuuhi===\nThe {{nihongo|Type-05 GS Assist Robot Yuuhi|\u4e94\u5f0f\u652f\u63f4\u6a5f\u58eb\u30e6\u30a6\u30d2|Goshiki Shienkishi Y\u00fbhi|28-48}} was the result of the JSDF reverse engineering DaiLogian so they can support the Gransazers' Chouseishin. Remote controlled by a voice-command headgear, the Yuuhi is launched from an underground bunker. It can access numerous weapons, a 120-mm dual cannon as well as two arrays of six missile launchers each. Prior to the final battle, Yuuhi was broken into pieces after fighting Troius.\n\n===Type-05 GS Assist Tank \"Asahi\"===\nAsahi is Yuuhi's support [[mecha]]. It vaguely resembles an [[M4 Sherman]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# {{nihongo|Awaken! The Warrior of the Stars|\u76ee\u899a\u3081\u3088!\u661f\u306e\u6226\u58eb|Mezame yo!

GranSazers'' or ''Super Star Gods and the GranSazers'' or also known as only ''GranSazers'', is a [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] TV series, produced by [[Toho|Toho Company Ltd.]], and [[Konami]]. The series aired on [[TV Tokyo]] from October 4, 2003 to September 25, 2004, with a total of 51 half-hour episodes. This series is the first of [[Toho]]'s \"[[Chouseishin Series|Seishin (Star God)]]\" series.\n\nThe premise of this series is similar to both the [[Super Sentai|''Super Sentai'' series]] and the [[manga]]/[[anime]] series ''[[Saint Seiya]]'': there are 12 heroes, divided into four ''tribes'', and each tribe has a giant transforming robot.\nThe events and characters are described below, using in-universe tone.\n\n==Plot==\n\nSome 400,000,000 years after an advanced human civilization was destroyed by aliens, 12 direct descendants of the civilization's warriors (called \"Sazers\") have their powers awakened and form four tribes: Flame, Wind, Earth and Water. Each Sazer is based on a Zodiac sign represented in an animal totem or spirit representation. At first, they wage war on each other, but after learning the truth of their ancestry and their reason for awakening, the Gransazer tribes unite to protect Earth from the Warp Monarch, an alliance of various alien species, from once again extinguishing all life on the planet.<ref>''Gransazers'' Episode 27.</ref>\n\n===1st Arc: Karin Saeki and the three tribes (1-12)===\n\nThe archaeologist Ichiro Horiguchi has indeed discovered a crystal tablet that revealed the existence of this ancient civilization and Gransazers. As luck would have it, his assistant Mika (Mithras) happened to be a Gransazer belonging to the Flames Tribe, and they soon met the second member of this Tribe, the impetuous Tenma (Tarious) and also the third one Ken (Lion), who was also Mika's younger brother. Together, they go in search of the other three Tribes and the corresponding Chouseishins.\n\nUnfortunately for them, a scientist named Karin Saeki has meanwhile gathered the members of the Wind Tribe and convinced them that the Flames represents a threat to the Earth. Then start a race against the clock between the two camps to gather the members of the Tribe of the Earth and locate the Chouseishins, even destroying them to prevent the other camp from seizing them.\n\nThe Earth Tribe quickly ranks side by side with the Flames, while Wind's members begin to have doubts about Karin's sincerity except for their leader, Remls, who is in love with her. And the result prove them right: Karin is actually an extraterrestrial planet Akelon sent to Earth by a mysterious sponsor to destroy the Gransazers. Her true nature revealed, Karin is transformed into a giant monster that is destroyed by Chouseishins three tribes finally reconciled.\n\n===2nd Arc: The Impactors and the Water Tribe (13-24)===\n\nAfter Karin's defeat, the Impacters, a trio of extraterrestrial fighters uniting Logia, Lucia and Radia, are sent to Earth to destroy Leviathan, the Chouseishin of the Water Tribe, before the Gransazers find him. Unfortunately, all their attempts are turned against them. They first send an asteroid crashing on the island where it is hidden but Cloud Dragon (the ship carrying Chouseishins) destroys it and the debris free Leviathan from his hiding place. Radia then turns into a giant to destroy him but he is killed after the Water Tribe has appeared and taken control of Leviathan.\n\nFor his part, Horiguchi discovered the existence of a fifth Chouseishin, Guntras, and tried to repair the apparatus to control it with the help of Professor Masaki Wakui and his assistant Sh\u00fbichi Hoshiyama. Unfortunately, once the device is repaired, it is stolen by Shuichi who was in fact Logia disguised, who uses it to take control of Guntras he intends to explode inside the sun to destroy our solar system. The Gransazers happily fail his project and the control system is destroyed, making Guntras autonomous.\n\nSubsequently, the Gransazers discover that the other Chouseishins can combine with Guntras to form a giant dragon named Daisazer. Thanks to him, they manage to triumph over Lucia turned into an uncontrollable giant, then Dailogian, a giant robot driven by Logia. Vanquished, the latter commits suicide (apparently) using a device of self-destruction.\n\n===3rd Arc: Various aliens (25-41)===\n\nUnlike the other parts which are characterized by a main plot spanning several episodes and by one or more main opponents, the third prefers to focus on independent stories in one or two episodes using the classic formula of \"one episode = an opponent\", with the exception of episodes 33, 34, 40 and 41<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gransazers/|title=\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u6771\u4eac\u30fb\u3042\u306b\u3066\u308c \u8d85\u661f\u795e \u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc \u3053\u308c\u307e\u3067\u306e\u304a\u8a71|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tv-tokyo.co.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>, in which the Gransazers are once again confronted with a living Logia and drunk with revenge.\n\nThe different episodes, however, have good suspense and carefully avoid the trap of repetitiveness. In addition, the fact that most of the episodes of this third part give the spotlight to only one Gransazer at a time makes it possible to flesh out characters that the series had difficulty to develop in the other episodes which privileged the team with the detriment of his members.\n\nThis third part also introduces a last giant robot designed by the JSDF, Yuhi, and the Gran Vehicles, individual vessels that the Gransazers fly when they do not command their Chouseishins. Unfortunately, after the rise that marked the second part, it all seems a little light.\n\n===Final Arc: Bosquito and Wolf Manafu (42-51)===\n\nThe fourth and final part begins when an alien named Luka frees Bosquito, a particularly powerful and dangerous creature with the same powers as the Gransazers. Bosquito is finally defeated after four episodes, many civilian casualties and the sacrifice of Luka, while one of the Gransazers, Ran (Visuel), discovers a great affinity with the crystal tablet that reveals to him that the first Gransazers had been created to fight the Bosquitos who are the real ones responsible for the destruction of the ancient earth civilization, while the famous extraterrestrial fleet had actually intervened at the request of the space union Wof Manaf to help Earth fight them after they took control of Chouseishins.\n\nUnfortunately, convinced that the current earthlings are descendants of Bosquitos, Wolf Manafu decides to launch a new attack on our planet, which is an opportunity to discover that their ships have hardly changed in 400 million years. As the fleet gets closer, the Japanese army and the Gransazers are contacted by Brighton, a \"peaceful\" envoy of Wolf Manafu, who tells them that Ran is actually a Bosquito. Horrified, she is ready to let Wolf Manafu execute it, unaware that it is a trick to eliminate it because she is the only one able to use the crystal tablet to communicate with the leader of Wolf Manafu.\n\nFor the home run, writers set the bar in terms of threats, starting with Bosquito, a formidable predator whose new abilities are constantly being discovered and which will cause the death of many civilians (whereas in previous episodes the collateral victims of the battles of our heroes were generally ignored), before continuing with the threat of a fleet ready to exterminate the human race. It is also in this last part that the writers finally solve the questions asked at the beginning of the series by revealing the reasons for the battle that had opposed the Earth to Wof Manaf while going against the expectations of the viewer, since unlike To the appearance, the squadron of Wolf Manafu did not fight Earthlings but Bosquitos.\n\n==The GranSazers==\nDescendants of the warriors from the ancient human civilization, they later learn that the GranSazers were created to protect Earth from the Bosquito. Each GranSazer is marked by a glowing symbol, corresponding to their astrological sign, on the back of their left hand. This symbol can turn into a ''Knuckle-Riser''. By setting the Knuckle-Riser to \"Transformation Mode\", they can equip high-powered suits that transform them into GranSazers. Their transformation call is {{nihongo|\"Equip!\"|\u88c5\u7740|S\u014dchaku!}}\n\nGranSazer is composed by 12 members split amongst four elements. When three members of the same element have been awakened and gathered, a Tribe is formed. When three members gather and set their Knuckle-Risers to ChouSeiShin Mode, they can summon a machine of incredible power called an {{nihongo|Ultra Star God|\u8d85\u661f\u795e|Ch\u014dseishin}}. Once a Tribe's respective ChouSeiShin has been summoned, one member can set their Knuckle-Riser to \"Boarding Mode\" in order to \"Dive-In\" and board their ChouSeiShin. The one who is on their ChouSeiShin can change into a giant folding robot. The other two GranSazers would later pilot jetfighters called Gran Vehicles.\n\nEach GranSazer also has their own unique weapon, which can be summoned by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Arms Mode\". When piloting their respective ChouSeiShin, they can equip the ChouSeiShin with a large version of their personal weapon by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer-Gear Mode\". They can also communicate with other Sazers by setting the Knuckle-Riser to \"Communication Mode\".\n\nThe GranSazers can also perform a combination attack called \"Formation Zero\". The attack involves Sazer-Tarious, Sazer-Mithras, Sazer-Lion, Sazer-Dail, Sazer-Tragos and Sazer-Pisces all performing a sandwich jump kick on the enemy.\n\n===Flame Tribe===\nThe {{nihongo|Flame Tribe or Fire Tribe|\u708e\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6|Hon\u014d no Toraibu}} are the first tribe to recognize the alien threat and the second to be fully assembled. From the very beginning, they were assisted by Professor Horiguchi, who helped them realize their duty as Gransazers. The Flame Tribe armoured suits are all bird-shaped with red-based colour and they pilot the Flame-Driver Grand Vehicles. This tribe is also the one and only tribe which two of their members (Tarious and Lion) can equip Garuda with a large version of their personal weapon by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer Gear Mode\" rather than other tribes which only their leader (Remls, Tawlon and Gorbion) can use this mode on their ChouSeiShin.\n\n====Sazer-Tarious====\n{{nihongo|Tenma Kudou|\u5f13\u9053 \u5929\u99ac|Kud\u014d Tenma}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gransazers/character/001.html|title=\u5f13\u9053\u5929\u99ac|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tv-tokyo.co.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> is a rash postman, usually going in head first. He stumbled into being a Sazer after he was harassed by Sazer-Velsou; his temper and the powers within him made him transform. Immediately afterwards, he defeated Velsou. Often locking horns with Mika and the others, he doesn't quite like being made the leader, but he accepts the role. Tenma cares a lot about his comrades as well as about the world he lives. Despite frequently bickering with Mika, Tenma developed a serious crush on her as the show progresses.\n \nWith his Knuckle Riser, Tenma transforms into {{nihongo|'''Sazer Tarious'''|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30bf\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9 |Seiz\u0101 Tariasu}}, the Flame warrior under the sign of [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], his armour is shaped after a [[falcon]] in red colour. Sazer Tarious is the leader of Flame Tribe and also the leader of all 12 Gransazers.\n\nSazer-Tarious' main weapon is the '''Falcon Bow''', a [[bow and arrow]] set situated on the left wrist (in place of the Knuckle Riser). It can fire Flame-powered shots and even a continuous stream of fiery arrows. Its finishing attack called \"'''Burning Falcon'''\", which involves the shooting of a giant fiery arrow from the Falcon Bow. His second attack is the \"'''Cosmo Punch'''\", in which Sazer-Tarious jumps up, then spins towards his adversary before striking with a flaming outstretched fist.\n\n====Sazer-Mithras====\n{{nihongo|Mika Shidou |\u7345\u5802 \u672a\u52a0|Shid\u014d Mika}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gransazers/character/002.html|title=\u7345\u7ae5\u672a\u52a0|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tv-tokyo.co.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>is the tomboyish elder sister of Ken and the wise member of the Flame Tribe. Having helped Professor Horiguchi with his research, she was the first Sazer to be awakened. Her cool and reserved attitude often clashes with the bright personality of Tenma, but when push comes to shove she proves to be a true friend and is fond of him as well.\n\nWith her Knuckle Riser, Mika transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer Mithras|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30df\u30c8\u30e9\u30b9|Seiz\u0101 Mitorasu)}}, the flame warrior under the sign of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], with a white and red armour shaped after a [[swan]]. Her main weapons are the \nSwan Sector, a pair of [[Japanese war fan|fans]]. Its finishing attack, known as the \"Brand Tornado\", resembles a blast from a flamethrower tornado.\n\nMika later makes a cameo appearance in ''Justirisers'' Episode 35, when she injured Shouta because she thought that he was a stalker. When asked by Yuka, she said that she had such skills because she used them in what she used to do, being a 'friend of justice'.\n\n====Sazer-Lion====\n{{nihongo|Ken Shidou|\u7345\u5802 \u5263|Shid\u014d Ken}} <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/gransazers/character/003.html|title=\u7345\u7ae5\u5263|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tv-tokyo.co.jp|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>is the younger brother of Mika by three years and last member of the Flame Tribe to be awakened; this happened when the Wind Tribe attacked the activated Garuda with Dolcross. He is the calm-and-collected pole of the tribe, a shy but caring and compassionate person who deeply loves his sister. After meeting Ran, he developed a crush on her, but he would never admit it.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Ken transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer Lion|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Seiz\u0101 Rion}}, the flame warrior under the sign of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], his [[dark red]] armour is shaped after a [[swallow]] with [[black]] colour on his arm. His main weapons are the Double Crescent, a pair of [[sword]]s. Its finishing attack, called \"Hien Zan\" (Flying Swallow Slash), resembles a large wave of fire.\n\n===Wind Tribe===\nThe {{nihongo|Wind Tribe|\u98a8\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6|Kaze no Toraibu}} are the first tribe that is fully assembled, deceived by Akelon who disguised as Saeki Karin to attack the other GranSazers, especially Flame Tribe. After they realized they were being deceived, they turned against Karin and allied with the other GranSazers to defeat her. The Wind Tribe armoured suits are all insect-shaped with purple-based colours and pilot the Wind-Driver Grand Vehicles.\n\n====Sazer-Remls====\nBack when he first met Karin, {{nihongo|Akira Dentsuin|\u4f1d\u901a\u9662 \u6d38|Dentsuin Akira}} was awakened as Sazer Remls, tricked by the Akelon into fighting the Flame Tribe. Akira was the one who stood by Karin's side the longest, attacking his friends while still believing in and feeling for her. He may seem distant and cold but he is actually loyal and compassionate and if required, he can be a fierce fighter. He is the oldest GranSazer. He is also a doctor.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Akira transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Remls|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30ec\u30e0\u30eb\u30ba|Seiz\u0101 Remuruzu}}, the wind warrior under the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], with armour shaped after a [[Japanese rhinoceros beetle]] in the colour of indigo (bluish purple). Sazer-Remls is also the leader of the Wind Tribe. Sazer-Remls' main weapon is the Iron Gale, a rifle cannon. Its finishing attack is called \"Final Judgement\", which is a concentrated ball of air. His second attack is the \"Remls Tornado\", a strong tornado blast from Remls' palm.\n\nDentsuin later makes a cameo appearance in ''Justirisers'' Episode 30, as the doctor who assessed Mio's condition.\n\n====Sazer-Velsou====\nRecruited and recited by Karin as well, {{nihongo|Ryouko Amemiya|\u96e8\u5bae \u6dbc\u5b50|Amemiya Ry\u014dko}} is the ambitious sports instructor of the Wind Tribe, aware of her unknown skills and with a dislike towards weaklings. Along with that, she is also rather calculating and intelligent. It was she who first doubted the motivations of Karin and became the first to leave the evil scientist, to be joined by Jin soon after. Under her personal training, Tappei has now become a freedom fighter. She fell in love with Naoto (Sazer-Tawlon). In the end of series, her marriage is shown with him.\n\nWith her Knuckle Riser, Ryouko transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Velsou|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30bd\u30fc|Seiz\u0101 Verus\u014d}}, the wind warrior under the sign of [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]; her [[magenta]]-coloured armour is shaped after a [[butterfly]]. Sazer-Velsou's main weapons are the Sel Cross, a pair of [[buckler]]s. Its finishing attack is called \"Full Moon Slash\", which is a vertical slash of magenta-tinted air that charges to the target. Sazer-Velsou's second attack is the \"Velsou Illusion\", a [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] attack that disables her enemies.\n\n====Sazer-Dail====\nThe final member of the Wind Tribe, {{nihongo|Jin Hakariya|\u79e4\u8c37 \u4ec1|Hakariya Jin}}, was bad books by Karin and joined them looking for fun rather than being devoted to his mission. He enjoys having his powers and playing around with them, always up for a challenge. Despite that, he enjoys teamwork and thus was soon convinced by Ryoko that the Sazers have to work as one big team. He often shows up just in time to level the odds.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Jin transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Dail|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30eb|Seiz\u0101 Dairu}}, the wind warrior under the sign of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]; his purple armour is shaped after a [[stag beetle]]. Sazer-Dail's main weapons are the Axe Tagger, [[axe]]-like [[tonfa]]s. Its finishing attack is called \"Dai Senpuu Haa\" (Great Whirlwind Slash), which is a horizontal tornado blast.\n\n===Earth Tribe===\nThe {{nihongo|Earth Tribe|\u5927\u5730\u306e\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6|Daichi no Toraibu}} are the third tribe to fully awaken. This tribe is the most divided one because each of the three members has a personality that conflicts with the others sometimes. This tribe is also a different one which the last member to be awakened is a woman, instead of man in other tribes. Karin tried to enlist the Earth Tribe into her group, but failed, causing the Earth Tribe to fight together with the Flame Tribe. Their armoured suits are shaped after four-legged mammals with yellow and orange-based colours, piloting the Earth-Driver Grand Vehicles.\n\n====Sazer-Tawlon====\n{{nihongo|Naoto Matsuzaka|\u677e\u5742 \u76f4\u4eba|Matsuzaka Naoto}} was once a famous and highly prized fighter who is now mostly retired from the spotlight, going back to teaching young talents the ways of self-defense. Often he is not to be found, for Naoto constantly seeks to become stronger and better, not just independently but in total isolation, despite the fact that he already is a powerhouse. He is also dedicated and tough. He would never give up, no matter how bad the odds are for him. In Justiriser episode 43, Naoto founded a gym where he meets Shouta, who reminds him of Tenma (Sazer-Tarious). When Shouta loses his Justi Powers, Naoto helps him regain his composure. He later sees Shouta become Riser Glen as he joins the other Justirisers and Demon Knight fighting their enemies, personally holding the Zokoals off before taking his leave. He fell in love with Ryoko (Sazer-Velsou) and they finally married on the last episode.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Naoto transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Tawlon|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30bf\u30a6\u30ed\u30f3|Seiz\u0101 Tauron}}, the ground warrior under the sign of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], whose armour is shaped after a [[bull]] in yellow colour. Sazer-Tawlon is the leader of the Earth Tribe. Sazer-Tawlon's main weapon is the Bull Cannon, a pair of shoulder [[cannon]]s. Its finishing attack is called \"Matador Burst\", which is a charged shot.\n\n====Sazer-Tragos====\nThe second and most reliable member of Earth Tribe, {{nihongo|Gou Kamiya|\u795e\u8c37 \u8c6a|Kamiya G\u014d}} is a serious, dedicated and faithful policeman with a strong sense of justice. Without his control, Gou transformed for the first time when he was attacked by Akaki Junya, a guy that believed to be most wanted suspect in a robbery case, who was also Ran's childhood friend. After Gou realized that he is awakened as an Earth warrior, he immediately aligned with the Flame Tribe and fought some duels with Jin (Sazer-Dail). Within him, there is also a kind and honest side which came out when he was debating with Naoto on duty and priorities. He fell in love with the genius 18-year old scientist, Professor Aya Stacy.\n\nWith his Knuckle Riser, Gou transforms into {{nihongo|Sazer-Tragos|\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc\u30c8\u30e9\u30b4\u30b9|Seiz\u0101 Toragosu}}, the ground warrior under the sign of [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] where his armour is shaped after a [[goat]] with colour of light [[orange]]. Sazer-Tragos' main weapon is the Spiral Horn (derived from the shape of goat's horn), a [[drill]] arm. Its finishing attack is called \"Penetrate Thunder\", which is a thunder-like drill attack that requires him to jump at a height and dive immediately to attack the enemy.\n\n====Sazer-Visuel====\nThe last member of Earth Tribe to be awakened, {{nihongo|Ran Saotome|\u65e9\u4e59\u5973 \u862d|Saotome Ran}} is a quirky and college-going young woman who met the Sazers when her childhood friend was accused of a crime which Gou and his policeman partner, Nanami were investigating. At first, she was abducted by Karin and the Wind Tribe to be their ally, but she eventually fled.

But Ran's friends are freed from the Gadaruian's control as Tarious battles the alien and kills him with Visuel's aid.\n* {{nihongo|Kriminel|\u30af\u30ea\u30df\u30ca\u30eb|Kurimuineru|36}}: An alien felon with no relation to Warp Monarch, he escaped to Earth to feed on the energy there. Armed with a pistol he stole from Freedo's partner, Kriminel can absorb any heat-based energy source to heal himself and increase his power, firing stored energy from the orbs on his chest. After losing to Dail, Kriminel attracts the Fire Tribe's attention as Tenma and Mika fight him and worsen the matter. But once Dail breaks Kriminel's barrier, Freedo delivers the death-shot.\n* {{nihongo|Gorfinian|\u30b4\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3\u661f\u4eba|Gorufin Seijin|37}}: A Warp Monarch agent from planet Gorfin, he enters the body of Mick the dolphin at the Sea Paradise aquarium to influence the other dolphins with his hyper frequency to attack humans with sound waves. But thanks to Mayu, Mick exorcises the Gorfinian as Gans fights before Tarious and Gorbion arrive and the dolphins use their own hyper frequency to weaken the alien as Gans finishes him off.\n* {{nihongo|Troius|\u30c8\u30ed\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9|Toroiasu|47-48}}: A giant alien monster sent from the Fleet to attack the Earth once the ceasefire ended. Dolcruz and Leviathan battle the beast with aid of the GranVehicles and Yuuhi. But the fight ends with Dolcruz heavily damaged, Yuuhi dismantled, and Tappei wounded. After Garuda got damaged as well, Guntras and Cloud Dragon intervene and destroy Troius.\n* {{nihongo|Cabyron|\u30ad\u30e3\u30d6\u30ec\u30aa\u30f3|Kyabureon|50-51}}: Arriving in a fireball, Cabryon is used by Gorgion to attack the JSDF to draw the Gransazers out into the open to complete his mission. Carbion succeeds in damaging Guntras to keep the Gransazers from forming DaiSazer and wrecks the other Chouseishin while appearing to kill Tenma. But once Warp Monarch acknowledges the truth about Earth, the Chouseishin are restored and form DaiSazer to kill Cabyron.\n\n==Bosquito==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2019}}\nThe {{nihongo|Bosquito|\u30dc\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc\u30c8|Bosuk\u00eeto|42-45}} is an alien construct that absorbs any lifeform in its grasp, for nourishment, into order to reproduce [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]]ly, and able to assimilate the energy of its clone spawn when they die. It is feared across the universe, as Warp Monarch couldn't control the Bosqutio when it came to Earth, resulting in the birth of the Gransazers to counter it and the War that destroyed ancient human civilization along with the propaganda set up to link the Bosquito to Earth's people. Though nearly wiped out, the Bosquito was sealed away, within the Kabuto Mountain, until Luka revived it on Belzeus' order, with no idea who she was reviving, until it was too late. Being able to use any attack used by the Gransazers, the Bosquito overpowers the Flame Tribe and later attacks a village, feeding on the people there, before using the TV to find ideal locations to feed on next. After evading the Wind Tribe, the Bosquito reproduces a child before fighting the Gransazers and is killed by them. The surviving child began to feed when Makoto and Jin arrive and were attacked as Tauron arrives to support them before the Bosquito multiplies itself as the Flame Tribe arrive to counter the second Bosquito until Yuuhi blasts it. Absorbing its clone, the Bosquito takes the controls for Yuuhi and uses it against the Gransazers, stealing Garuda when the Flame Tribe summons it. Levithan and Gunceasar are summoned to weaken Garuda so eject the Bosquito, who starts to absorb the floral life energy to regain its strength and create two clones of itself. After the others destroy the clones, the orbs they left behind are reabsorbed into the original Bosquito as it evolves into a giant monster. After Tarius uses one of Lion's Crescents to take the ruby on its chest, the source of its power, the Bosquito is destroyed by DaiSazer.\n\nHowever, as revealed in the Seishin crossover (''[[Sazer-X the Movie|Chousei Kantai Sazer-X: The Movie]]''), another Bosquito existed within the monster Bulgario, released when the monster was destroyed at sea, absorbing the JustiPower in Sazer Island, so it can duplicate itself and can disguise themselves as impostor Justirisers. They are all destroyed by Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X but quickly absorbed into the phantom ship so that it would form into Mammoth-Bosquito dragon. The Mammoth-Bosquito is destroyed by Great-Lio (piloted by Lio-Sazer) using the final move, Howling Crush, which the power of Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X combined into the finishing attack to destroy the monster.\n\n==ChouSeiShin==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2019}}\n''The ChouSeiShin'' ''(Ultra Star Gods'' or ''Super Star Gods)'' are the most powerful weapons of the ancient Earth Civilization. They remained dormant on Earth until the GranSazers were awakened, and reactivated the long-lost relics.\n\nEach Tribe possesses one of the four ChouSeiShin, which can be summoned by setting all of their Knuckle-Risers to \"ChouSeiShin Mode\". One member of the Tribe can then \"Dive In\" and board the machine by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Boarding Mode\". Furthermore, by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \"Sazer Gear Mode\" the pilot can equip their ChouSeiShin with a large version of their personal weapon.\n\nEach ChouSeiShin has two modes, which can be switched between with a simple transformation. In \"Live Mode\", they resemble animals and possess incredible maneuverability. In Warrior Mode, they resemble [[bipedal]] [[mecha]], losing most of their speed, but gaining immense attacking power.\n\n===ChouSeiShin Garuda===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin Garuda|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30ac\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0 |Ch\u014dseishin Gar\u016bda}} is the Flame Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the second to be awaken from its slumber in Houhou [[Mountain]]. \nIn Live Mode, Garuda is shaped after a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and attacks with his guns located under its wings where its legs are, firing lasers and energy beams. Garuda can also tackle enemies after engulfing himself in flames. \nIn Warrior Mode, Garuda mostly relies on the 'Garu Claw', which are his talons on the back of his fists, for close-range combat. He performs his finishing move \"Fire Bird Slash\" with them. Garuda can also summon a sword called Burning Saber for armed melee combat. Tarious' Sazer Gear equips Garuda with a giant version of the Falcon Bow, and Lion's Sazer Gear equips Garuda with giant versions of the Double Crescents.\n\n===ChouSeiShin Dorcrus===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin Dorcrus|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30c9\u30eb\u30af\u30eb\u30b9|Ch\u014dseishin Dorukurusu}} also known as Dorcrus or Dorcrus is the Wind Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the first to be awakened from its slumber in Kabuto [[Mountain]]. \nIn Live Mode, Dorcrus is shaped after an [[European rhinoceros beetle]] and attacks with his multitude of cannons as well as with full tackles. \nIn Warrior Mode, Dorcrus uses his large array of cannons and blasters to perform various attacks. His finishing move, \"Herakles Hurricane\", fires his entire arsenal of cannons and blasters simultaneously. Remls' Sazer Gear equips Dorcrus with a giant version of the Iron Gale on his head, since Dolcruz does not have proper hands to hold objects (in theory).\n\n===ChouSeiShin GunCaesar===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin GunCaesar|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30ac\u30f3\u30b7\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc |Ch\u014dseishin Gansh\u012bs\u0101}} is the Earth Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the third to be awaken from its slumber in the Shishioh [[Desert]]. \nIn Live Mode, GunCaesar is shaped after a [[liger]] and attacks with his cannons as well as with his claws. \nIn Warrior Mode, GunCaesar uses his cannons, the Liger Riots, as hand blasters. He performs his finishing move, \"Gravity Burst\", with them. Tawlon's Sazer Gear equips GunCaesar with a giant version of the Bull Cannon.\n\n===ChouSeiShin Leviathan===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin Leviathan|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30ea\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30b5\u30f3|Ch\u014dseishin Rivaiasan}} is the Water Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the last to be awaken from its slumber in Shinkujira [[Island]] when the Impactors arrive on Earth. \nIn Live Mode, Leviathan has a [[whale]]-like shape and uses his fins for ramming attacks, as well as firing his two cannons at the fins. \nIn Warrior Mode, Leviathan is armed with the Maelstrom Blades which can be used for his finishing move \"High Tide Break\". Furthermore, he is equipped with the Ocean Shield which can be used for his another move \"Mirage Shield\" which can multiply for defence purposes. Gorbion's Sazer Gear equips Leviathan with a giant version of the Blast Saw.\n\n===ChouSeiShin Guntras===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiShin Guntras|\u8d85\u661f\u795e\u30ac\u30f3\u30c8\u30e9\u30b9|Ch\u014dseishin Gantorasu}} is controlled by an advanced AI, superior to the other ChouSeiShin to have a will of his own. Initially hidden away in the Andes, referred as the \"Great Shadow\" in Peruvian legend, Guntras resurfaced when his Guntroller is repaired and Logia controls him, planning to use Guntras' oxygen fuel supply to collide with the [[Sun]] and trigger a [[nova]] strong enough to evaporate Earth, after killing the GranSazers first. Tenma eventually got the Guntroller and freed Guntras, who joined up with Cloud Dragon as an ally to the Sazers. Later Guntras is revealed to be created in order to combine the four ChouSeiShin into one giant super robot (DaiSazer). Guntras is armed with an array of deadly weapons, among them a laser battery on his chest, a cannon on his forehead and missile launchers on his body. He can fire and immediately replace his fists in his ''Twin Crusher'' attack, and his powerful feet can create devastating shockwaves in his Land Shake attack.\n\n===Fusion Beast-King DaiSazer===\n{{nihongo|Fusion Beast-King DaiSazer|\u5408\u795e\u7363\u738b\u30c0\u30a4\u30bb\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc|Gasshinj\u016b\u014d Daiseiz\u0101}} is the assembled form of the four Tribes' ChouSeishin, along with ChouSeishin Guntras. Guntras forms the main body, head and feet; Garuda for chest, cranium, and back; Dorcrus for the legs; GunCaesar for the right arm and the shoulder cannons; and Leviathan for the left arm and the tail. Combined, DaiSazer has a very aggressive and archaic mind of its own. All four pilots have to focus in order to control DaiSazer. DaiSazer is a very deadly creature and it is armed with a deflector as well as a laser array on its chest, but DaiSazer mostly relies on brute force to deal with its opponents.\n\nIts attacks include: 'Rapid Sazer', which fires the shoulder cannons on its back; 'Blast Pressure', unleashing a blast of fire from Guncaesar's mouth on its right arm; 'God Sphere', firing energy beams from its eyes. Its finishing move is 'Hyper Burst', which unleashes the full power of Guntras and the 4 ChouSeiShin combined through the laser array on its chest.\n\n===ChouSeiJuuren Cloud Dragon===\n{{nihongo|ChouSeiJuuren Cloud Dragon|\u8d85\u661f\u7363\u9023\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30c9\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3|Ch\u00f4seij\u00fbren Kuraudo Doragon}},translated into English as ''Ultra Star Beast Carrier Cloud Dragon'', is as old as the ChouSeiShin, another remnant of the ancient civilization and residing within the ozone layer of the Earth to protect it from alien invaders, implanted with a DNA of humanity\nto start back up the human race and an AI modeled after a woman from ancient civilization. She only descends from the ozone layer if the ChouSeiShin are summoned or are in need of her help for repairs. The Cloud Dragon is designed for combat support and repairs the ChouSeishin after they suffered battle damage and rendered immobile as a result, in which a sky whirlpool is created to collect the damaged ChouSeiShin and loads them onto one of the 4 storage pads (for the ChouSeiShin of each Tribe in the order of Flame(Garuda), Wind(Dorcrus), Earth(GunCaesar) and Water(Leviathan) respectively) on its body for repairs and restoration in outer space (the first such repairs is done onto the Flame ChouSeiShin Garuda by restoring its damaged left wing), upon which they can be launched straight from the colossal Dragon's storage pads once fully repaired and when the Gransazers summon them. Prior to the final battle, Cloud Dragon formally introduces herself to the GranSazers before telling them they have the answer to stop the attack on Earth. The Cloud Dragon's attack is the Galactica Prominence Cannon, a devastating blaster capable of blowing an entire asteroid into pieces. Inside cloud dragon there are Granvehicle which is one for each tribe's member. granvehicle of flame tribe is flame driver, wind tribe's vehicle is wind driver,earth tribe's is earth driver, and the water tribe's is aqua driver, which is one for each gransazer. With gransazers nuckle riser there is granvehicle mode. The sazers Who dives in they on's their granvehicle mode and says granvehicle launch and dives in. on the cloud dragon the place where these granvehicles launch is where guntrass stands in front is place where granvehicles launch which is one for everyone. Cloud Dragon's Zodiac sign is unofficial 13th sign, [[Ophiuchus]].\n\n==Other mecha==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2019}}\n===DaiLogian===\nDailogian is Logia's personal [[mecha]]. It is a black humanoid robot patterned after a [[wolf]] and its power is almost equal to Daisazer's. Unlike his subordinates, Lucia and Radia, Logia cannot grow into a giant; instead, he summons his mecha, which is always on standby in outer space, and which Logia alone can summon. It can absorb beam attacks through its chest and redirect them back to the opponents. It first fought with Daisazer and was defeated when Daisazer ripped off its arm. The second time was when Logia and Tenma fought one on one in their respective mechas with Tenma barely securing the victory. After DaiLogian was defeated, it was taken by the Japan Self-Defense Force for study. It reactivated, then busted out of the Japan Self-Defense Force holding area, when Logia returned to Earth to seek vengeance against the Sazers. Afterwards, Logia used it as a mode of transport.\n\n===Yuuhi===\nThe {{nihongo|Type-05 GS Assist Robot Yuuhi|\u4e94\u5f0f\u652f\u63f4\u6a5f\u58eb\u30e6\u30a6\u30d2|Goshiki Shienkishi Y\u00fbhi|28-48}} was the result of the JSDF reverse engineering DaiLogian so they can support the Gransazers' Chouseishin. Remote controlled by a voice-command headgear, the Yuuhi is launched from an underground bunker. It can access numerous weapons, a 120-mm dual cannon as well as two arrays of six missile launchers each. Prior to the final battle, Yuuhi was broken into pieces after fighting Troius.\n\n===Type-05 GS Assist Tank \"Asahi\"===\nAsahi is Yuuhi's support [[mecha]]. It vaguely resembles an [[M4 Sherman]].\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n# {{nihongo|Awaken! The Warrior of the Stars|\u76ee\u899a\u3081\u3088!\u661f\u306e\u6226\u58eb|Mezame yo!

Graham had been appointed just after the end of the previous season as successor to [[Don Howe]] who had resigned in late March. He had been a member of Arsenal's double winning team in 1971, but Arsenal had gone since 1979 without winning a major trophy, finishing seventh in the two seasons leading up to Graham's arrival and finishing as low as 10th in 1983.\n\nArsenal started the season well and were top of the league by Christmas, but a 10-match winless run went against their title hopes in the second half of the season and they eventually finished fourth, with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] finishing champions for the second time in three seasons. Compensation for the failed title bid came in the form of the club's first ever [[Football League Cup]] victory, which came with a 2-1 win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] final. [[Charlie Nicholas]] scored both of Arsenal's goals.\n\n[[Tony Adams]], the 20-year-old centre-half who played in every single game for Arsenal this season, was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]]. Striker [[Niall Quinn]] and wingers [[David Rocastle]] and [[Martin Hayes (footballer)|Martin Hayes]] both became regular members of the first team this season, with Hayes finishing as Arsenal's top scorer with 24 goals.\n\n==Squad==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=[[John Lukic]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=[[Viv Anderson]]}}\n{{Fs

He had been a member of Arsenal's double winning team in 1971, but Arsenal had gone since 1979 without winning a major trophy, finishing seventh in the two seasons leading up to Graham's arrival and finishing as low as 10th in 1983.\n\nArsenal started the season well and were top of the league by Christmas, but a 10-match winless run went against their title hopes in the second half of the season and they eventually finished fourth, with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] finishing champions for the second time in three seasons. Compensation for the failed title bid came in the form of the club's first ever [[Football League Cup]] victory, which came with a 2-1 win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] final. [[Charlie Nicholas]] scored both of Arsenal's goals.\n\n[[Tony Adams]], the 20-year-old centre-half who played in every single game for Arsenal this season, was voted [[PFA Young Player of the Year]]. Striker [[Niall Quinn]] and wingers [[David Rocastle]] and [[Martin Hayes (footballer)|Martin Hayes]] both became regular members of the first team this season, with Hayes finishing as Arsenal's top scorer with 24 goals.\n\n==Squad==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=[[John Lukic]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=DF|name=[[Viv Anderson]]}}\n{{Fs
