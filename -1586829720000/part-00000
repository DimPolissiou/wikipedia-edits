However, Nissan continued to build the D22 as a cheaper alternative to the D40 in many markets. \nOriginally planned to follow the D21 Hard Body in being designed by Nissan Design International in La Jolla, CA, design of the D22 was reluctantly given to Japan during the 1994\u20131995 period. This was due to NDI being busy with many design projects of for concepts and models, such as the Quest (VX54 II), Altima (L30), and Maxima (A32.5). Design of an updated D22 was eventually given to NDI in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wheels.ca/1999-nissan-frontier-king-cab/ |title=1999 Nissan Frontier King Cab |work=WHEELS.ca |accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== North America ===\n\nIn North America, it was built in Tennessee from 1997 to 2000 as the Nissan Frontier.

The D22 Frontier was completely redone after the 2004 model year, which later resulted in the discontinuation of the regular cab model.<ref>http://amarillo.com/stories/2000/10/28/whe_nissan.shtml</ref> Sales and production started in North America, with Crew Cab and King Cab versions and new grille, bumper, headlights, taillights. Other body changes included built in fender flares and tailgates.\n\nThe D22s badged as \"Frontier\" had different grille, tailgate details and interior in contrast to the D22s badged as \"Navara\".\n\nThe D22 was no longer sold in Japan after 2002. Due to incompatible taxation rules and plummeting popularity of pickup trucks in Japan, Nissan discontinued it in their home market with no replacement afterwards, a fate shared by many of its competitors there.\n\nThe Egyptian plant exports to the Middle East, and a South African plant to African countries. Mexican production started in 2008: D22 truck Single Cab Chassis and Long Bed (2WD or 4WD, 2.4-liter petrol or diesel), Crew Cab (2WD and petrol) called the D22 Pick up.\n\nIn 2009 the D22 was updated with redesigned exterior door handles.\n\nIn June 2017, Peugeot announced to produce the ''Peugeot Pick-Up'' for Northern African states.

The ZD30 powered D22's were exceptionally reliable unlike the Patrol counterparts, but were replaced in 2008 with an upgraded Common Rail 2.5L Diesel engine. The D22 Navara was run in parallel with the larger D40 until 2015.

In Australia the D22 had the KA24E till 1999, then changed to KA24DE option that year. A 3.0-liter V6 was introduced in June 2000. In February 2003, 4x4 models received a larger 3.3-liter V6 (available only with a 5-speed manual), while 4x2 models continued with the 3.0 (with manual or automatic transmissions). The V6 was dropped in 2005, leaving the 2.5-liter turbo diesel as the only available engine.\n\nThe first series of D22s had larger (QD32) 3.2-litre normally aspirated Diesel engines producing 75&nbsp;kW. It also had a (NA20S) 2.0 litre petrol sohc 8 valve engine producing 75&nbsp;kW.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Engine\n!Displacement\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Info\n|-\n| [[SOHC]] [[Inline-four engine|4-Cylinder]] ([[Nissan NA engine#NA20S|NA20S]]) || 2.0&nbsp;L (121&nbsp;CID) || {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}||\n|-\n| SOHC 4-Cylinder ([[Nissan KA engine#KA24E|KA24E]]) || 2.4&nbsp;L (146&nbsp;CID) ||  || ||1997-1999 (Australia)\n|-\n\n| [[DOHC]] 4-Cylinder ([[Nissan KA engine#KA24DE|KA24DE]]) || 2.4&nbsp;L (146&nbsp;CID) || {{convert|143|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|154|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}||\n|-\n| DOHC 4-Cylinder ([[Nissan YD engine|YD25DDTi (133 PS)]]) || 2.5&nbsp;L (153&nbsp;CID) || {{convert|131|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|304|Nm|kgm lbft|0|abbr=on}}||Turbo diesel intercooler\n|-\n| DOHC 4-Cylinder ([[Nissan ZD engine|ZD30DDT]]) || 3.0&nbsp;L (183&nbsp;CID) || 148 hp (110 kW) ||{{convert|314|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}||Turbo diesel (non-intercooler)\n|-\n| DOHC 4-Cylinder ([[Nissan QD engine#QD323|QD323]]) || 3.2&nbsp;L (195&nbsp;CID) ||156\n  || ||Diesel\n\n|-\n| SOHC [[V6]] ([[Nissan VG engine#VG33E|VG33E]]) || 3.3&nbsp;L (201&nbsp;CID) || {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}|| {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|202|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for MY2003-2004\n|-\n| SOHC ''[[Supercharged|SC]]'' [[V6]] ([[Nissan VG engine#VG33ER|VG33ER]]) || 3.3&nbsp;L (201&nbsp;CID) || {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} || {{convert|246|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}|| {{convert|231|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for Automatic\n|}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nFile:01-04 Nissan Frontier extended cab.jpg|2001\u20132004 Facelift Nissan D22 Frontier extended/king cab\nFile:2010-2011 Nissan Navara (D22 MY2010) DX 2-door cab chassis (2011-04-22).jpg|2010-2011 Facelift Nissan D22 Navara DX regular cab (Australia).

It uses the new [[Nissan F-Alpha platform]] and exterior body styling resembles that of the company's full-size [[Nissan Titan]] truck. In 2012 production was shifted from Smyrna, Tennessee to Canton, Mississippi.\n\nThe new truck has a fully boxed [[ladder frame]]. The wheelbase is 125.9&nbsp;in (3.20 m) with a 205.5&nbsp;in (5.22 m) overall length. Towing capacity is 6500&nbsp;lb (2,950&nbsp;kg). A 4.0&nbsp;Liter [[Nissan VQ engine|VQ-family]] [[V6]], the [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ40DE|VQ40DE]], is the standard engine in North America, and it produces {{Convert|261|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|281|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Also available is the [[QR25DE]] four-cylinder engine, which is also found in the [[Nissan Altima]]. It produces {{Convert|152|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|171|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A six-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] is standard with a five-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] optional.

It has four trim levels, the S, SE, Outlaw and Aventura. The Aventura trim package is equipped with leather upholstery, dual zone climate control, six-stacker CD/MP3 changer and satellite navigation as standard.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, the D40 Navara has a few differences from the UK versions. There are two engines available, 2.5-liter turbocharged diesel engine and the V6 petrol. The 2.5 diesel engine Mid Power version (2WD and 4WD base models) produces {{convert|106|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm and {{convert|356|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2000 rpm, High Power version (4WD upgrade models) produces {{convert|128|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm and {{convert|403|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2000 rpm. The V6 produces {{convert|198|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm of power and {{convert|385|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm. Both engines come with a standard five-speed automatic, with a six-speed manual available for the diesel. These models do not have leather, climate control or satellite navigation system like their UK versions.\n\nThe 2008 model of the Navara was launched on 2 July. Changes included a new style of alloy wheels, [[bluetooth]] as standard, side work lights and indicators on the [[wing mirror]]s.\n\nThe 2008 Single Cab became available in Thailand 6 March. The 2.5-liter engine reduces the torque output from {{convert|356|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} to {{convert|294|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 2,000 rpm. This model has 15-inch wheels. Power steering is standard. Also available are electric mirrors and central power locking as optional extra. Nissan planned to sell the single cab and began to export worldwide at the same month. Nissan also continues to sell the D22 pickups with minor updates for a lower price (now called as Frontier LCV).\n\nThe Nissan Navara Double Cab became available in Malaysia on 5 November 2008. It is available with a 2.5-liter diesel engine producing {{convert|128|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|403|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}}, only with a five-speed automatic. A year later the six-speed manual version became available. The D22 series Nissan Frontier remains on sale in Malaysia with a manual transmission.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tan |first=Paul |url=http://paultan.org/archives/2008/11/05/nissan-navara-with-174-ps-launched-in-malaysia/ |title=Nissan Navara with 174 PS launched in Malaysia |publisher=Paultan.org |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=8 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2008 Nissan Thailand Released the all new Nissan Navara Calibre with a 144 PS (106&nbsp;kW) at 4000 rpm 36.3&nbsp;kg\u00b7m (356 N\u00b7m; 263&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf) at 2000 rpm available with a five-speed automatic or a six-speed manual transmission.\n\n=== Facelift ===\n[[File:2011 Nissan Frontier -- 12-31-2010.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X (US)]]\n\nFor North American Frontiers model year 2009, and European Navaras model year 2010, Nissan updated the shape of some minor components.\n\nThe 2010 Nissan Navara facelift are now powered by a new 3.0-litre [[V9X Engine|V9X]] V6 turbodiesel engine producing 240&nbsp;hp (175&nbsp;kW) and 369&nbsp;lb-ft (500 Nm) at 2,500 rpm and a revised 2.5-litre dCi unit ([[Nissan YD engine#YD25DDTi|YD25DDTi High Power]])  which produces {{convert|190|PS|0||abbr=on}} and {{convert|450|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The 2011 Nissan Navara and Pathfinder facelift V6 develop 170&nbsp;kW (231 PS) and {{convert|550|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque between 1,700 rpm and 2,500 rpm{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} and the [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ40DE|VQ40DE]] remains the same with the {{convert|261|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm; {{convert|281|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm.\n\nThere are subtle changes to the headlights and the bonnet. The V-shaped grille shell is less pronounced and the bumper is rounder and projects 80&nbsp;mm further forward, but the six-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels or optional 18-inch alloy wheels are the biggest change.\n\nInside the new Navara (top of the line model), Nissan designers have specified softer materials of a better quality for the dash, seats and interior moulds. The centre console and fascia designs have been revised, as have the instrument binnacle layout and door trims. Additional bright/gloss finish surfacing is used throughout the cabin. The six-stack CD audio system or the TV Navigation entertainment console is upgraded with speed-sensing volume, MP3 compatibility and Bluetooth connectivity for the (six disc CD audio system). Other new or revised features include dual-zone climate control, remote audio/Bluetooth/trip computer controls on the steering wheel, trip computer, external temperature gauge, speed-sensitive variable windscreen wipers and 'follow me home' lighting. The electric mirrors now fold in fully for car washes or parking in narrow spaces.\n\nImportantly, the upgraded Navara (diesel only) gains stability control, which Nissan calls [[Vehicle Dynamics Control]] and all petrol V6 and diesel variants gain side-impact and side-curtain airbags to complement the dual front airbags.\n\nNissan updated the Frontier for the 2020 model year with a new 3.8-liter V6 and a nine-speed automatic, with the manual transmission being discontinued. The engine replaces both the outgoing 4.0L V6 and the 2.5L I4, and produces {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, although torque remains the same.<ref name=\"2020d40_1\">{{cite web|url=https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/2020-nissan-frontier-press-kit|title=2020 Nissan Frontier Press Kit}}</ref> The lineup has also been revised: the Frontier King Cab model will offer both rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive configurations on the S and SV models; the Crew Cab model, meanwhile, extends rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive to the SV standard bed and SV long bed trims, while the Pro-4X gets all-wheel drive exclusively.

However, Nissan continued to build the D22 as a cheaper alternative to the D40 in many markets. \nOriginally planned to follow the D21 Hard Body in being designed by Nissan Design International in La Jolla, CA, design of the D22 was reluctantly given to Japan during the 1994\u20131995 period. This was due to NDI being busy with many design projects of for concepts and models, such as the Quest (VX54 II), Altima (L30), and Maxima (A32.5). Design of an updated D22 was eventually given to NDI in 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wheels.ca/1999-nissan-frontier-king-cab/ |title=1999 Nissan Frontier King Cab |work=WHEELS.ca |accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== North America ===\n\nIn North America, it was built in Tennessee from 1997 to 2000 as the Nissan Frontier. The body types on offer were a single cab, King Cab, and lastly a Crew Cab which was introduced in 1999.

The D22 Frontier was completely redone after the 2004 model year, which later resulted in the discontinuation of the regular cab model.<ref>http://amarillo.com/stories/2000/10/28/whe_nissan.shtml</ref> Sales and production started in North America, with Crew Cab and King Cab versions and new grille, bumper, headlights, taillights. Other body changes included built in fender flares and tailgates.\n\nThe D22s badged as \"Frontier\" had different grille, tailgate details and interior in contrast to the D22s badged as \"Navara\".\n\nThe D22 was no longer sold in Japan after 2002. Due to incompatible taxation rules and plummeting popularity of pickup trucks in Japan, Nissan discontinued it in their home market with no replacement afterwards, a fate shared by many of its competitors there.\n\nThe Egyptian plant exports to the Middle East, and a South African plant to African countries. Mexican production started in 2008: D22 truck Single Cab Chassis and Long Bed (2WD or 4WD, 2.4-liter petrol or diesel), Crew Cab (2WD and petrol) called the D22 Pick up.\n\nIn 2009 the D22 was updated with redesigned exterior door handles.\n\nIn June 2017, Peugeot announced to produce the ''Peugeot Pick-Up'' for Northern African states. It is equipped with a 2.5-litre inline-four turbodiesel, producing {{Convert|115|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}, manual 5-speed transmission, rear wheel drive or all-wheel drive, with optional gear reduction.

Market introduction started in September 2017.\n\n==== Australia ====\nFor the Australian market, the D22 Navara ran as a series 1 from the end of the D21 until 2001, when a series 2 was released with a new ZD30 Diesel engine and updated front end. The ZD30 powered D22's were exceptionally reliable unlike the Patrol counterparts, but were replaced in 2008 with an upgraded Common Rail 2.5L Diesel engine. The D22 Navara was run in parallel with the larger D40 until 2015. Both were replaced by the D23 Navara - locally known as the NP300 Navara as of 2015.\n\n==== Brazil ====\nThe Brazilian Nissan plant started production around 2002 (Crew Cab Diesel 2WD or 4WD, five-speed manual, or single cab 2WD diesel. Only for Mexican market: petrol 2.4-liter manufactured in Mexico) and it was exported to Argentina (all Brazilian versions) and Mexico (Crew Cab, petrol 2.4-liter, 2WD, five-speed manual).\n\n==== Bolivia ====\nNissan Bolivia imported from Japan the Nissan Frontier D22 Crew Cab, 2.4-liter petrol or diesel, 4WD. Imported from Mexico, the D22 Crew Cab and single cab long bed, petrol 2WD. Some Frontiers were gray imported from the USA. These were V6 with automatic transmission for private importers.\n\n==== Chile ====\nIn Chile, the D22 was marketed as the \"Nissan Terrano\" (a name previously used in the [[Nissan Pathfinder|WD21 SUV]]) due to KIA Motors already using the \"Frontier\" moniker in its [[Kia Bongo|Bongo minivan series]]. It was sold from 1998 to 2014 and according to the National Automobile Association of Chile it was the most sold automobile in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasegunda.com/Noticias/Economia/2011/01/614990/Nissan-Terrano-es-el-auto-mas-vendido-del-ano-2010-segun-Anac |title=Nissan Terrano es el auto m\u00e1s vendido del a\u00f1o 2010, seg\u00fan Anac |work=La Segunda |accessdate=23 May 2018}}</ref> The facelifted \"Navara\" version arrived in 2003, in 2.4L petrol, 2.5L turbo diesel, 3.0L turbo diesel and 3.2L diesel.

In Australia the D22 had the KA24E till 1999, then changed to KA24DE option that year. A 3.0-liter V6 was introduced in June 2000. In February 2003, 4x4 models received a larger 3.3-liter V6 (available only with a 5-speed manual), while 4x2 models continued with the 3.0 (with manual or automatic transmissions). The V6 was dropped in 2005, leaving the 2.5-liter turbo diesel as the only available engine.\n\nThe first series of D22s had larger (QD32) 3.2-litre normally aspirated Diesel engines producing 75&nbsp;kW.

A 4.0&nbsp;Liter [[Nissan VQ engine|VQ-family]] [[V6]], the [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ40DE|VQ40DE]], is the standard engine in North America, and it produces {{Convert|261|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|281|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Also available is the [[QR25DE]] four-cylinder engine, which is also found in the [[Nissan Altima]]. It produces {{Convert|152|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|171|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. A six-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] is standard with a five-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] optional.

It has four trim levels, the S, SE, Outlaw and Aventura. The Aventura trim package is equipped with leather upholstery, dual zone climate control, six-stacker CD/MP3 changer and satellite navigation as standard.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and South America, the D40 Navara has a few differences from the UK versions. There are two engines available, 2.5-liter turbocharged diesel engine and the V6 petrol. The 2.5 diesel engine Mid Power version (2WD and 4WD base models) produces {{convert|106|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm and {{convert|356|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2000 rpm, High Power version (4WD upgrade models) produces {{convert|128|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm and {{convert|403|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2000 rpm. The V6 produces {{convert|198|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm of power and {{convert|385|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm. Both engines come with a standard five-speed automatic, with a six-speed manual available for the diesel. These models do not have leather, climate control or satellite navigation system like their UK versions.\n\nThe 2008 model of the Navara was launched on 2 July. Changes included a new style of alloy wheels, [[bluetooth]] as standard, side work lights and indicators on the [[wing mirror]]s.\n\nThe 2008 Single Cab became available in Thailand 6 March. The 2.5-liter engine reduces the torque output from {{convert|356|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} to {{convert|294|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}} at 2,000 rpm. This model has 15-inch wheels. Power steering is standard. Also available are electric mirrors and central power locking as optional extra. Nissan planned to sell the single cab and began to export worldwide at the same month. Nissan also continues to sell the D22 pickups with minor updates for a lower price (now called as Frontier LCV).\n\nThe Nissan Navara Double Cab became available in Malaysia on 5 November 2008. It is available with a 2.5-liter diesel engine producing {{convert|128|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|403|Nm|ftlbf|abbr=on}}, only with a five-speed automatic. A year later the six-speed manual version became available. The D22 series Nissan Frontier remains on sale in Malaysia with a manual transmission.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tan |first=Paul |url=http://paultan.org/archives/2008/11/05/nissan-navara-with-174-ps-launched-in-malaysia/ |title=Nissan Navara with 174 PS launched in Malaysia |publisher=Paultan.org |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=8 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2008 Nissan Thailand Released the all new Nissan Navara Calibre with a 144 PS (106&nbsp;kW) at 4000 rpm 36.3&nbsp;kg\u00b7m (356 N\u00b7m; 263&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf) at 2000 rpm available with a five-speed automatic or a six-speed manual transmission.\n\n=== Facelift ===\n[[File:2011 Nissan Frontier -- 12-31-2010.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Nissan Frontier Pro-4X (US)]]\n\nFor North American Frontiers model year 2009, and European Navaras model year 2010, Nissan updated the shape of some minor components.\n\nThe 2010 Nissan Navara facelift are now powered by a new 3.0-litre [[V9X Engine|V9X]] V6 turbodiesel engine producing 240&nbsp;hp (175&nbsp;kW) and 369&nbsp;lb-ft (500 Nm) at 2,500 rpm and a revised 2.5-litre dCi unit ([[Nissan YD engine#YD25DDTi|YD25DDTi High Power]])  which produces {{convert|190|PS|0||abbr=on}} and {{convert|450|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. The 2011 Nissan Navara and Pathfinder facelift V6 develop 170&nbsp;kW (231 PS) and {{convert|550|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque between 1,700 rpm and 2,500 rpm{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} and the [[Nissan VQ engine#VQ40DE|VQ40DE]] remains the same with the {{convert|261|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 5600 rpm; {{convert|281|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm.\n\nThere are subtle changes to the headlights and the bonnet. The V-shaped grille shell is less pronounced and the bumper is rounder and projects 80&nbsp;mm further forward, but the six-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels or optional 18-inch alloy wheels are the biggest change.\n\nInside the new Navara (top of the line model), Nissan designers have specified softer materials of a better quality for the dash, seats and interior moulds. The centre console and fascia designs have been revised, as have the instrument binnacle layout and door trims. Additional bright/gloss finish surfacing is used throughout the cabin. The six-stack CD audio system or the TV Navigation entertainment console is upgraded with speed-sensing volume, MP3 compatibility and Bluetooth connectivity for the (six disc CD audio system). Other new or revised features include dual-zone climate control, remote audio/Bluetooth/trip computer controls on the steering wheel, trip computer, external temperature gauge, speed-sensitive variable windscreen wipers and 'follow me home' lighting. The electric mirrors now fold in fully for car washes or parking in narrow spaces.\n\nImportantly, the upgraded Navara (diesel only) gains stability control, which Nissan calls [[Vehicle Dynamics Control]] and all petrol V6 and diesel variants gain side-impact and side-curtain airbags to complement the dual front airbags.\n\nNissan updated the Frontier for the 2020 model year with a new 3.8-liter V6 and a nine-speed automatic, with the manual transmission being discontinued. The engine replaces both the outgoing 4.0L V6 and the 2.5L I4, and produces {{convert|310|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, although torque remains the same.<ref name=\"2020d40_1\">{{cite web|url=https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/2020-nissan-frontier-press-kit|title=2020 Nissan Frontier Press Kit}}</ref> The lineup has also been revised: the Frontier King Cab model will offer both rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive configurations on the S and SV models; the Crew Cab model, meanwhile, extends rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive to the SV standard bed and SV long bed trims, while the Pro-4X gets all-wheel drive exclusively.

The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates 5\u201310&nbsp;cm across. The crown is narrow conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees. The shoots are buff-brown to orange-brown, usually densely pubescent, and with prominent [[pulvini]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, 15\u201330&nbsp;mm long, rhombic in cross-section, glaucous blue-green above with several thin lines of [[stomata]], and blue-white below with two broad bands of stomata.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, slender cylindrical, 4\u20138&nbsp;cm long and 1.5&nbsp;cm broad when closed, opening to 3&nbsp;cm broad. They have thin, flexible scales 15\u201320&nbsp;mm long, with a wavy margin. They are reddish to dark purple, maturing pale brown 4\u20137 months after pollination.

{"title_page": "Toffoli gate", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|Universal reversible logic gate, applied in quantum computing\n}}\n[[File:Toffoli gate.svg|150px|thumb|Circuit representation of Toffoli gate]]\n\nIn [[logic circuits]], the '''Toffoli gate''' (also '''CCNOT gate'''), invented by [[Tommaso Toffoli]], is a universal [[Reversible computing|reversible]] [[logic gate]], which means that any reversible circuit can be constructed from Toffoli gates. It is also known as the \"controlled-controlled-not\" gate, which describes its action. It has 3-bit inputs and outputs; if the first two bits are both set to 1, it inverts the third bit, otherwise all bits stay the same.\n\n== Background ==\n\nAn input-consuming [[logic gate]] ''L'' is reversible if, for any output ''y'', there is a unique input ''x'' such that applying ''L''(''x'') = ''y''. If a gate ''L'' is reversible, there is an inverse gate ''L''&prime;, which maps ''y'' to ''x'' for which ''L''&prime;(''y'') = ''x''. From common logic gates, NOT is reversible, as can be seen from its truth table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! INPUT !! OUTPUT\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 0 || 1\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || 0\n|}\n\nThe common AND gate is not reversible, however. The inputs 00, 01 and 10 are all mapped to the output 0.\n\nReversible gates have been studied since the 1960s. The original motivation was that reversible gates dissipate less heat (or, in principle, no heat).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Landauer|first=R.|date=July 1961|title=Irreversibility and Heat Generation in the Computing Process|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=5|issue=3|pages=183\u2013191|doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183|issn=0018-8646}}</ref> If we think of a logic gate as consuming its input, information is lost since less information is present in the output than was present at the input. This loss of information loses energy to the surrounding area as heat, because of [[entropy|thermodynamic entropy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Another way to understand this is that charges on a circuit are grounded and thus flow away, taking a small quantity of energy with them when they change state. A reversible gate only moves the states around, and since no information is lost, energy is conserved.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nMore recent motivation comes from [[quantum computing]]. [[Quantum mechanics]] requires the transformations to be reversible{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and allows more general states of the computation than classical computers ([[Superposition principle|superposition]]s).\n\n==Universality and Toffoli gate==\n\nAny reversible gate that consumes its inputs and allows all input computations must have no more input bits than output bits, by the [[pigeonhole principle]].  For one input bit, there are two possible [[Reversible computing|reversible]] gates. One of them is NOT. The other is the identity gate, which maps its input to the output unchanged. For two input bits, the only non-trivial gate is the [[controlled NOT gate]], which [[XOR gate|XOR]]s the first bit to the second bit and leaves the first bit unchanged.\n\n{|\n! Truth table !!

In other words, the set consisting of NOT and XOR gates is not [[functional completeness|universal]]. If we want to compute an arbitrary function using reversible gates, we need another gate. One possibility is the '''Toffoli gate''', proposed in 1980 by Toffoli.<ref>Technical Report MIT/LCS/TM-151 (1980) and an adapted and condensed version: {{cite conference\n |url         = http://pm1.bu.edu/~tt/publ/revcomp-rep.pdf\n |title       = Reversible computing\n |first       = Tommaso\n |last        = Toffoli\n |authorlink  = Tommaso Toffoli\n |year        = 1980\n |conference  = Automata, Languages and Programming, Seventh Colloquium\n |editor      = J.

Essentially, this means that one can use Toffoli gates to build systems that will perform any desired Boolean function computation in a reversible manner.\n\n== Related logic gates ==\n[[Image:Qcircuit ToffolifromCNOT.svg|thumb|400px|The Toffoli gate can be constructed from single qubit gates and a minimum of six [[Controlled NOT gate|CNOT]]s.]]\n* The [[Fredkin gate]] is a universal reversible 3-bit gate that swaps the last two bits if the first bit is 1; a controlled-swap operation.\n* The ''n''-bit Toffoli gate is a generalization of Toffoli gate.

It is also known as the \"controlled-controlled-not\" gate, which describes its action. It has 3-bit inputs and outputs; if the first two bits are both set to 1, it inverts the third bit, otherwise all bits stay the same.\n\n== Background ==\n\nAn input-consuming [[logic gate]] ''L'' is reversible if, for any output ''y'', there is a unique input ''x'' such that applying ''L''(''x'') = ''y''. If a gate ''L'' is reversible, there is an inverse gate ''L''&prime;, which maps ''y'' to ''x'' for which ''L''&prime;(''y'') = ''x''. From common logic gates, NOT is reversible, as can be seen from its truth table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! INPUT !! OUTPUT\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 0 || 1\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 1 || 0\n|}\n\nThe common AND gate is not reversible, however. The inputs 00, 01 and 10 are all mapped to the output 0.\n\nReversible gates have been studied since the 1960s. The original motivation was that reversible gates dissipate less heat (or, in principle, no heat).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Landauer|first=R.|date=July 1961|title=Irreversibility and Heat Generation in the Computing Process|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=5|issue=3|pages=183\u2013191|doi=10.1147/rd.53.0183|issn=0018-8646}}</ref> If we think of a logic gate as consuming its input, information is lost since less information is present in the output than was present at the input. This loss of information loses energy to the surrounding area as heat, because of [[entropy|thermodynamic entropy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Another way to understand this is that charges on a circuit are grounded and thus flow away, taking a small quantity of energy with them when they change state. A reversible gate only moves the states around, and since no information is lost, energy is conserved.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nMore recent motivation comes from [[quantum computing]]. [[Quantum mechanics]] requires the transformations to be reversible{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and allows more general states of the computation than classical computers ([[Superposition principle|superposition]]s).\n\n==Universality and Toffoli gate==\n\nAny reversible gate that consumes its inputs and allows all input computations must have no more input bits than output bits, by the [[pigeonhole principle]].  For one input bit, there are two possible [[Reversible computing|reversible]] gates. One of them is NOT. The other is the identity gate, which maps its input to the output unchanged. For two input bits, the only non-trivial gate is the [[controlled NOT gate]], which [[XOR gate|XOR]]s the first bit to the second bit and leaves the first bit unchanged.\n\n{|\n! Truth table !!

In other words, the set consisting of NOT and XOR gates is not [[functional completeness|universal]]. If we want to compute an arbitrary function using reversible gates, we need another gate. One possibility is the '''Toffoli gate''', proposed in 1980 by Toffoli.<ref>Technical Report MIT/LCS/TM-151 (1980) and an adapted and condensed version: {{cite conference\n |url         = http://pm1.bu.edu/~tt/publ/revcomp-rep.pdf\n |title       = Reversible computing\n |first       = Tommaso\n |last        = Toffoli\n |authorlink  = Tommaso Toffoli\n |year        = 1980\n |conference  = Automata, Languages and Programming, Seventh Colloquium\n |editor      = J.
