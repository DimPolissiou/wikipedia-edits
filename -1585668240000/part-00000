The agricultural surpluses and increased population enabled [[Shaka]] to raise a standing army of Zulus. By the end of the 18th century, the Zulus occupied much of their [[arable land]]. Declining rainfall and a ten-year drought in the early 19th century set off a competition for land and water resources among the peoples of the area. Another possible cause is the increased trade of ivory with the Portuguese in the [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]]. This led to deepening inequality within African societies which led people being even more vulnerable in an region that was already being hit by multiple droughts.<ref name=\":1\" />   \n\nIt is worth noting that there were three major ethnic groups which occupied the areas now known as [[Nquthu]], [[Babanango]], [[Empangeni]], [[Mtubatuba]], [[Hlabisa]], [[Nongoma]], [[Pongola, KwaZulu-Natal|Pongola]], [[Vryheid]], [[Melmoth, KwaZulu-Natal|Melmoth]] and [[Mahlabathini]] \u2013 those ethnic groups were the [[Swazi people|Ngwane]], the [[Ndwandwe]] and the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]]. They were respectively led by kings [[Sobhuza I|Sobhuza]] of [[Swaziland|Ngwane]], [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]], and [[Dingiswayo]] and were the most powerful ethnic groups. The language now known as Zulu was spoken by the Ndwandwes. At that time the Zulus were a very weak ethnic group under the leadership of [[Senzangakhona]]. They spoke a [[thsefuya language]] in which \"l\" is pronounced as \"y\", so that 'suka lapha', meaning 'go from here', would be expressed as 'suya yapha'. These three ethnic groups are to this day found in the same areas. The Zulus were a weak minority occupying a small piece of land in the area now known as [[Makhosini]] near [[Babanango]]. The Ikhoshlo side of [[Buthelezi]] led by [[Mvulane]] became instrumental in the defeat of Phungashe by Shaka. Mvulane's son Ngqengelele became Shaka's induna and chief advisor. Ngqengele's son, [[Mbangambi]] led his section of [[Buthelezi]]s against Hhamu of Ngenetsheni.<ref group=note>Kamhlaza Hlathwayo who was married to Josiah of Gibisizungu, of Mbangambi of Ngengelele</ref>\n\nOral history says that after the death of [[Mvulane]], the younger brother of Phungashe, Mvulane's sons [[Khoboyela]] and [[Ngqengelele]] escaped being killed by Phungashe over their father Mvulane's estate and went to live with Senzangakhona and Ngqengelele. Most of the members of the Buthelezi ethnic group had left with Khoboyela and Ngqengelele. When Shaka attacked the Ngwane, Sobhuza's men were outnumbered by the combination of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwas]], the Buthelezis under Ngqengelele and the Zulus.  In summary, the causes of mfecane are; the need for land, population growth in Natal, Shaka's military and expansionist strategy. In addition, the profitable slave trade through Delagoa Bay (modern day Maputo Bay) is another cause.\n\n==Rise of the Zulu==\nIn about 1817, Chief [[Dingiswayo]] of the [[Mtetwa Empire|Mthethwa]] group in the south near the [[Tugela River]], entered into an alliance with the [[Vatsonga people|Tsongas]], who controlled the trade routes to [[Delagoa Bay]] (now [[Maputo]]). This alliance encroached on the routes used by the [[Ndwandwe]] alliance, who occupied the region in the north, near the [[Pongola River]]. Battles between the allied forces of Chief Dingiswayo and of Chief [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]], and the Ndwandwe probably mark the start of what became the Mfecane.\n\nZwide defeated the Mthethwa and executed Chief Dingiswayo. Dingiswayo was a mentor to King Shaka. He took him in together with his mother Queen Nandi and gave them refuge.  Many of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] leaders formed a confederation with the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] clan, under the leadership of [[Shaka]]. The Zulus conquered and assimilated smaller clans in the area. Zwide attacked King [[Shaka]] and was defeated at the [[Battle of Gqokli Hill]] which marked the start of Shaka's conquest of the [[Ndwandwe]]. The Zulu practice was to absorb only the women and young men of a clan or village. They killed the elderly and men of fighting age; the lucky ones escaped. Having learned Zulu tactics, the escapees in turn descended upon more distant clans unfamiliar with the new order.\n\n==Consequences for the Nguni==\n[[File:Shaka's Empire map.svg|thumb|400px|This map illustrates the rise of the Zulu Empire under Shaka (1816\u20131828) in present-day [[South Africa]]. The rise of the Zulu Empire {{color box|#aa4400}} under Shaka forced other chiefdoms and clans to flee across a wide area of southern Africa.  Clans fleeing the Zulu war zone {{color box|#ffb380}} included the [[Soshangane]], [[Zwangendaba]], [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], [[Hlubi people|Hlubi]], [[Swazi people|Ngwane]], and the [[Mfengu]].  A number of clans were caught between the Zulu Empire and advancing [[Voortrekkers]] and [[British Empire]] {{color box|#F08080}} such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] {{color box|#008000}}.]]\nAround 1821, the Zulu general [[Mzilikazi]] of the [[Khumalo clan]] defied Zulu king Shaka, and set up his own kingdom. He quickly made many enemies, not only with the Zulu king, but also with the [[Boer]]s, [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]]. Defeats in several clashes convinced Mzilikazi to move north towards Swaziland. Going north and then inland westward along the watershed between the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers, Mzilikazi and his followers, the AmaNdebele, (called Matebele in English) established an [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] state northwest of the city of [[Pretoria]].\n\nDuring this period, the Matebele left a trail of destruction in their wake.<ref name=\"Becker1979\">{{cite book|author=Becker, Peter |year=1979 |title=Path of Blood: The Rise and Conquests of Mzilikazi, Founder of the Matebele ethnic group of Southern Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h6KPwAACAAJ |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-004978-7}}</ref> From 1837 to 1838, the arrival of Boer settlers and the subsequent battles of Vegtkop and Mosega, drove the Matebele north of the Limpopo.  They settled in the area now known as [[Matabeleland]], in present-day southern [[Zimbabwe]]. Mzilikazi set up his new capital in [[Bulawayo]].<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\">''Cambridge History of Africa,'' Vol. 5</ref> The AmaNdebele drove the AmaShona of the region northward and forced them to pay tribute. This caused resentment that continued to the current day in modern Zimbabwe.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Mhlatuze River]] in 1818, the Ndwandwe were defeated by the Zulu led by Shaka. [[Soshangane]], one of Zwide's generals, fled to [[Mozambique]] with the remainder of the Ndwandwe. There they established the [[Gaza Empire|Gaza kingdom]]. They oppressed the [[Shangaan|Tsonga]] people living there, some of whom fled over the [[Lebombo Mountains]] into the Northern Transvaal. In 1833, Soshangane invaded various Portuguese settlements, and was initially successful. But a combination of internal disputes and war against the [[Swazi people|Swazi]] caused the downfall of the Gaza kingdom.<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nThe [[Swazi people|Ngwane]] people lived in present-day [[Swaziland]], where they had settled in the southwest. They warred periodically with the Ndwandwe.\n\n[[Zwangendaba]], a commander of the Ndwandwe army, fled north with Soshangane after his defeat in 1819. Zwangendaba's followers were henceforth called [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]]. Continuing north of the [[Zambezi River]], they formed a state in the region between lakes [[Lake Malawi|Malawi]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]]. [[Maseko]], who led another part of the Ngoni people, founded another state to the east of Zwangendaba's kingdom.<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nTo the east, refugees from the Mfecane were assimilated into the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]-speaking groups in present-day [[Eastern Cape Province]], becoming the [[Mfengu]]. Subjected to successive waves of attack by other ethnic groups, they were also pressed from the West by the British colonists.\n\n==Consequences for the Sotho-Tswana peoples==\n[[Moshoeshoe I]] gathered the mountain clans together in an alliance against the Zulus. Fortifying the easily defended hills and expanding his reach with cavalry raids, he fought against his enemies with some success, despite not adopting the Zulu tactics, as many other clans had done. The territory of Moshoeshoe I became the kingdom of [[Lesotho]].<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nThe Tswana were pillaged by two large invasionary forces set on the move by the Mfecane. [[Sebitwane]] gathered the [[Makololo|Kololo]] ethnic groups near modern Lesotho and wandered north across what is now [[Botswana]], plundering and killing many of the Tswana people in the way. They also took large numbers of captives north with them,<ref name=\"Segolodi\">{{Cite journal|author=Segolodi, Moanaphuti  |year=1940 |title=Ditso Tsa Batawana  |url=https://www.academia.edu/12170767 }}</ref> finally settling north of the Zambezi River in [[Barotseland]], where they conquered the [[Lozi people]].<ref name=\"Tlou1985\">{{cite book|author=Tlou, Thomas |year=1985 |title=A History of Ngamiland, 1750 to 1906: The Formation of an African State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-d3pXwAACAAJ |publisher=Macmillan Botswana|isbn=9780333396353 }}</ref> The next force was the [[Mzilikazi]] and the Matebele who moved across Tswana territory in 1837.

According to Cobbing, apartheid historians had mischaracterised the Mfecane as a period of internally induced black-on-black destruction. Instead, Cobbing argued that the roots of the conflicts could be found exclusively in the labour needs of the Portuguese slave traders operating out of [[Delagoa Bay]], in modern-day [[Mozambique]], and of the British colonists in the Cape. The resulting pressures led to massive displacement, famine, and war in the interior, allowing later [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] settlers to seize control of most land.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cobbing|first=Julian|title=The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1988|volume=29|issue=3|pages=487\u2013519|doi=10.1017/s0021853700030590}}</ref> Among those involved were European adventurers such as [[Nathaniel Isaacs]] (who was later accused of [[slave traders|slave trading]]).<ref name=Natalia>{{cite journal\n|url = http://www.natalia.org.za/Files/4/Natalia%20v04%20article%20p19-21%20C.pdf\n|title = Nathaniel Isaacs\n|author = Herrman, Louis \n|journal = Natalia\n|publisher = The Natal Society Foundation\n|location = Pietermartizburg\n|pages = 19\u201322\n|issue = 4\n|date=December 1974\n|accessdate = 2010-08-10}}</ref>\n\nCobbing's hypothesis caused an immense amount of polemics among historians and the discussion about it was called the \"Cobbing Controversy\". While historians had already  started to create new approaches to studying the Mfecane in the 1970's and 1980's, Cobbing's paper was the first major source that overtly defied the hegemonic \"Zulu-centric\" explanation at the time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Wright|first=John|title=The Cambridge History of South Africa, Vol. 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9781139056083|location=|pages=211, 212}}</ref> This was followed by fierce discourse in the early 1990's over Cobbing's hypothesis.

Moreover, Eldredge argues that [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and other groups allied with British Colonists, rather Missionaries, were primarily responsible for the slave raids coming from the Cape. Eldredge also asserts that Cobbing downplays the importance of the [[ivory trade]] in Delagoa Bay, and the extent to which African groups and leaders sought to establish more centralised and complex state formations to control ivory routes and the wealth associated with the trade. She suggests these pressures created internal movements, as well as reactions against European activity, that drove the state formations and concomitant violence and displacement.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|author=Eldredge, Elizabeth |year= 1995|chapter=Sources of Conflict in Southern Africa c. 1800\u20131830: the 'Mfecane' Reconsidered |pages=122\u2013161 |editor=Hamilton, Carolyn |title=The Mfecane Aftermath: Reconstructive Debates in Southern African History |location= Pietermaritzburg |publisher=University of Natal Press |isbn=978-1-86814-252-1}}</ref> She still agreed with Cobbing's overall sentiment in that the Zulu-centric explanation for the Mfecane is not reliable.<ref name=\":2\" /> By the early 2000s, a new consensus had emerged.<ref name=\":0\" />  Most historians recognize that the Mfecane wasn't just a series of events caused by the founding of the Zulu kingdom but rather a multitude of factors caused before and after [[Shaka|Shaka Zulu]] came into power.<ref name=\"Etherington2004\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Creation of the Zulu Kingdom, 1815\u20131828|last=Eldredge|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n{{refbegin}}\n*J.D.

Ngqengele's son, [[Mbangambi]] led his section of [[Buthelezi]]s against Hhamu of Ngenetsheni.<ref group=note>Kamhlaza Hlathwayo who was married to Josiah of Gibisizungu, of Mbangambi of Ngengelele</ref>\n\nOral history says that after the death of [[Mvulane]], the younger brother of Phungashe, Mvulane's sons [[Khoboyela]] and [[Ngqengelele]] escaped being killed by Phungashe over their father Mvulane's estate and went to live with Senzangakhona and Ngqengelele. Most of the members of the Buthelezi ethnic group had left with Khoboyela and Ngqengelele. When Shaka attacked the Ngwane, Sobhuza's men were outnumbered by the combination of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwas]], the Buthelezis under Ngqengelele and the Zulus.  In summary, the causes of mfecane are; the need for land, population growth in Natal, Shaka's military and expansionist strategy. In addition, the profitable slave trade through Delagoa Bay (modern day Maputo Bay) is another cause.\n\n==Rise of the Zulu==\nIn about 1817, Chief [[Dingiswayo]] of the [[Mtetwa Empire|Mthethwa]] group in the south near the [[Tugela River]], entered into an alliance with the [[Vatsonga people|Tsongas]], who controlled the trade routes to [[Delagoa Bay]] (now [[Maputo]]). This alliance encroached on the routes used by the [[Ndwandwe]] alliance, who occupied the region in the north, near the [[Pongola River]]. Battles between the allied forces of Chief Dingiswayo and of Chief [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]], and the Ndwandwe probably mark the start of what became the Mfecane.\n\nZwide defeated the Mthethwa and executed Chief Dingiswayo. Dingiswayo was a mentor to King Shaka. He took him in together with his mother Queen Nandi and gave them refuge.  Many of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] leaders formed a confederation with the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] clan, under the leadership of [[Shaka]]. The Zulus conquered and assimilated smaller clans in the area. Zwide attacked King [[Shaka]] and was defeated at the [[Battle of Gqokli Hill]] which marked the start of Shaka's conquest of the [[Ndwandwe]]. The Zulu practice was to absorb only the women and young men of a clan or village. They killed the elderly and men of fighting age; the lucky ones escaped. Having learned Zulu tactics, the escapees in turn descended upon more distant clans unfamiliar with the new order.\n\n==Consequences for the Nguni==\n[[File:Shaka's Empire map.svg|thumb|400px|This map illustrates the rise of the Zulu Empire under Shaka (1816\u20131828) in present-day [[South Africa]]. The rise of the Zulu Empire {{color box|#aa4400}} under Shaka forced other chiefdoms and clans to flee across a wide area of southern Africa.  Clans fleeing the Zulu war zone {{color box|#ffb380}} included the [[Soshangane]], [[Zwangendaba]], [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]], [[Hlubi people|Hlubi]], [[Swazi people|Ngwane]], and the [[Mfengu]].  A number of clans were caught between the Zulu Empire and advancing [[Voortrekkers]] and [[British Empire]] {{color box|#F08080}} such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] {{color box|#008000}}.]]\nAround 1821, the Zulu general [[Mzilikazi]] of the [[Khumalo clan]] defied Zulu king Shaka, and set up his own kingdom. He quickly made many enemies, not only with the Zulu king, but also with the [[Boer]]s, [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and [[Tswana people|Tswana]]. Defeats in several clashes convinced Mzilikazi to move north towards Swaziland. Going north and then inland westward along the watershed between the [[Vaal River|Vaal]] and the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] rivers, Mzilikazi and his followers, the AmaNdebele, (called Matebele in English) established an [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]] state northwest of the city of [[Pretoria]].\n\nDuring this period, the Matebele left a trail of destruction in their wake.<ref name=\"Becker1979\">{{cite book|author=Becker, Peter |year=1979 |title=Path of Blood: The Rise and Conquests of Mzilikazi, Founder of the Matebele ethnic group of Southern Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8h6KPwAACAAJ |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-004978-7}}</ref> From 1837 to 1838, the arrival of Boer settlers and the subsequent battles of Vegtkop and Mosega, drove the Matebele north of the Limpopo.  They settled in the area now known as [[Matabeleland]], in present-day southern [[Zimbabwe]]. Mzilikazi set up his new capital in [[Bulawayo]].<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\">''Cambridge History of Africa,'' Vol. 5</ref> The AmaNdebele drove the AmaShona of the region northward and forced them to pay tribute. This caused resentment that continued to the current day in modern Zimbabwe.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Mhlatuze River]] in 1818, the Ndwandwe were defeated by the Zulu led by Shaka. [[Soshangane]], one of Zwide's generals, fled to [[Mozambique]] with the remainder of the Ndwandwe. There they established the [[Gaza Empire|Gaza kingdom]]. They oppressed the [[Shangaan|Tsonga]] people living there, some of whom fled over the [[Lebombo Mountains]] into the Northern Transvaal. In 1833, Soshangane invaded various Portuguese settlements, and was initially successful. But a combination of internal disputes and war against the [[Swazi people|Swazi]] caused the downfall of the Gaza kingdom.<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nThe [[Swazi people|Ngwane]] people lived in present-day [[Swaziland]], where they had settled in the southwest. They warred periodically with the Ndwandwe.\n\n[[Zwangendaba]], a commander of the Ndwandwe army, fled north with Soshangane after his defeat in 1819. Zwangendaba's followers were henceforth called [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]]. Continuing north of the [[Zambezi River]], they formed a state in the region between lakes [[Lake Malawi|Malawi]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]]. [[Maseko]], who led another part of the Ngoni people, founded another state to the east of Zwangendaba's kingdom.<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nTo the east, refugees from the Mfecane were assimilated into the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]-speaking groups in present-day [[Eastern Cape Province]], becoming the [[Mfengu]]. Subjected to successive waves of attack by other ethnic groups, they were also pressed from the West by the British colonists.\n\n==Consequences for the Sotho-Tswana peoples==\n[[Moshoeshoe I]] gathered the mountain clans together in an alliance against the Zulus. Fortifying the easily defended hills and expanding his reach with cavalry raids, he fought against his enemies with some success, despite not adopting the Zulu tactics, as many other clans had done. The territory of Moshoeshoe I became the kingdom of [[Lesotho]].<ref name=\"Cambridge History of Africa, vol. 5\"/>\n\nThe Tswana were pillaged by two large invasionary forces set on the move by the Mfecane. [[Sebitwane]] gathered the [[Makololo|Kololo]] ethnic groups near modern Lesotho and wandered north across what is now [[Botswana]], plundering and killing many of the Tswana people in the way. They also took large numbers of captives north with them,<ref name=\"Segolodi\">{{Cite journal|author=Segolodi, Moanaphuti  |year=1940 |title=Ditso Tsa Batawana  |url=https://www.academia.edu/12170767 }}</ref> finally settling north of the Zambezi River in [[Barotseland]], where they conquered the [[Lozi people]].<ref name=\"Tlou1985\">{{cite book|author=Tlou, Thomas |year=1985 |title=A History of Ngamiland, 1750 to 1906: The Formation of an African State |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-d3pXwAACAAJ |publisher=Macmillan Botswana|isbn=9780333396353 }}</ref> The next force was the [[Mzilikazi]] and the Matebele who moved across Tswana territory in 1837.

According to Cobbing, apartheid historians had mischaracterised the Mfecane as a period of internally induced black-on-black destruction. Instead, Cobbing argued that the roots of the conflicts could be found exclusively in the labour needs of the Portuguese slave traders operating out of [[Delagoa Bay]], in modern-day [[Mozambique]], and of the British colonists in the Cape. The resulting pressures led to massive displacement, famine, and war in the interior, allowing later [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] settlers to seize control of most land.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cobbing|first=Julian|title=The Mfecane as Alibi: Thoughts on Dithakong and Mbolompo|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1988|volume=29|issue=3|pages=487\u2013519|doi=10.1017/s0021853700030590}}</ref> Among those involved were European adventurers such as [[Nathaniel Isaacs]] (who was later accused of [[slave traders|slave trading]]).<ref name=Natalia>{{cite journal\n|url = http://www.natalia.org.za/Files/4/Natalia%20v04%20article%20p19-21%20C.pdf\n|title = Nathaniel Isaacs\n|author = Herrman, Louis \n|journal = Natalia\n|publisher = The Natal Society Foundation\n|location = Pietermartizburg\n|pages = 19\u201322\n|issue = 4\n|date=December 1974\n|accessdate = 2010-08-10}}</ref>\n\nCobbing's hypothesis caused an immense amount of polemics among historians and the discussion about it was called the \"Cobbing Controversy\". While historians had already  started to create new approaches to studying the Mfecane in the 1970's and 1980's, Cobbing's paper was the first major source that overtly defied the hegemonic \"Zulu-centric\" explanation at the time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Wright|first=John|title=The Cambridge History of South Africa, Vol. 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2009|isbn=9781139056083|location=|pages=211, 212}}</ref> This was followed by fierce discourse in the early 1990's over Cobbing's hypothesis.

Moreover, Eldredge argues that [[Griqua people|Griqua]] and other groups allied with British Colonists, rather Missionaries, were primarily responsible for the slave raids coming from the Cape. Eldredge also asserts that Cobbing downplays the importance of the [[ivory trade]] in Delagoa Bay, and the extent to which African groups and leaders sought to establish more centralised and complex state formations to control ivory routes and the wealth associated with the trade. She suggests these pressures created internal movements, as well as reactions against European activity, that drove the state formations and concomitant violence and displacement.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|author=Eldredge, Elizabeth |year= 1995|chapter=Sources of Conflict in Southern Africa c. 1800\u20131830: the 'Mfecane' Reconsidered |pages=122\u2013161 |editor=Hamilton, Carolyn |title=The Mfecane Aftermath: Reconstructive Debates in Southern African History |location= Pietermaritzburg |publisher=University of Natal Press |isbn=978-1-86814-252-1}}</ref> She still agreed with Cobbing's overall sentiment in that the Zulu-centric explanation for the Mfecane is not reliable.<ref name=\":2\" /> By the early 2000's, a new consensus had emerged.<ref name=\":0\" />  Most historians recognize that the Mfecane wasn't just a series of events caused by the founding of the Zulu kingdom but rather a multitude of factors caused before and after [[Shaka|Shaka Zulu]] came into power.<ref name=\"Etherington2004\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Creation of the Zulu Kingdom, 1815\u20131828|last=Eldredge|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n{{refbegin}}\n*J.D.

Written sources prove that Jewish communities lived in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary and it is even assumed that several sections of the heterogeneous [[Magyar tribes|Hungarian tribes]] practiced Judaism. Jewish officials served the king during the early 13th century reign of [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]]. From the second part of the 13th century, the general religious tolerance decreased and Hungary's policies became similar to the treatment of the Jewish population in Western Europe.\n\nThe Jews of Hungary were fairly well integrated into Hungarian society by the time of the [[First World War]]. By the early [[20th century]], the community had grown to constitute 5% of Hungary's total population and 23% of the population of the capital, [[Budapest]]. Jews became prominent in science, the arts and business. By 1941, over 17% of Budapest's Jews were [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] ''[[converso]]s''.{{efn|\"By 1941, over 17 percent of Budapest's Jews (as defined by law) belonged to Christian denominations. The number of converts was so great and the influence of some of them so weighty that the Catholic episcopate created an association for their legal and social protection --- the Holy Cross Society -- in October 1938.

About the same time Ibrahim ibn Jacob says that Jews went from Hungary to [[Prague]] for business purposes. Nothing is known concerning the Jews during the period of the [[Grand Prince of the Hungarians|grand princes]], except that they lived in the country and engaged in commerce there.<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nIn 1061, King [[B\u00e9la I of Hungary|B\u00e9la I]] ordered that markets should take place on Saturdays instead of the traditional Sundays (Hungarian language has preserved the previous custom, Sunday = {{Interlanguage link multi|vas\u00e1rnap|hu}} = Market Day). In the reign of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. Ladislaus]] (1077\u20131095), the [[Synod of Szabolcs]] decreed (May 20, 1092) that Jews should not be permitted to have [[Christians|Christian]] wives or to keep Christian [[slaves]]. This decree had been promulgated in the Christian countries of [[Europe]] since the 5th century, and St. Ladislaus merely introduced it into Hungary.<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nThe Jews of Hungary at first formed small settlements, and had no learned [[rabbi]]s; but they were strictly observant of all the [[Halakha|Jewish law]]s and customs. One tradition relates the story of Jews from Ratisbon ([[Regensburg]]) coming into Hungary with merchandise from [[Russia]], on a Friday; the wheel of their wagon broke near [[Buda]] (Ofen) or [[Esztergom]] (Gran) and by the time they had repaired it and had entered the town, the Jews were just leaving the [[synagogue]]. The unintentional [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]-breakers were heavily fined.

He also restricted the Jews to cities with [[episcopal see]]s \u2013 probably to have them under the continuous supervision of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. Soon after the promulgation of this decree, [[Crusade]]rs came to Hungary; but the [[Hungarians]] did not sympathize with them, and Coloman even opposed them. The infuriated Crusaders attacked some cities, and if [[Gedaliah ibn Ya\u1e25ya]] is to be believed, the Jews suffered a fate similar to that of their coreligionists in [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Bohemia]].<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nThe cruelties inflicted upon the Jews of Bohemia induced many of them to seek refuge in Hungary. It was probably the immigration of the rich Bohemian Jews that induced Coloman soon afterward to regulate commercial and banking transactions between Jews and Christians. He decreed, among other regulations, that if a Christian borrowed from a Jew, or a Jew from a Christian, both Christian and Jewish witnesses must be present at the transaction.<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of King [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] (1205\u20131235) there were Jewish [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlains]] and mint-, salt-, and tax-officials. The [[nobles]] of the country, however, induced the king, in his [[Golden Bull of 1222|Golden Bull]] (1222), to deprive the Jews of these high offices. When Andrew needed money in 1226, he [[Farm (revenue leasing)|farmed the royal revenues]] to Jews, which gave ground for much complaint. The [[pope]] ([[Pope Honorius III]]) thereupon excommunicated him, until, in 1233, he promised the papal ambassadors on oath that he would enforce the decrees of the Golden Bull directed against the Jews and the [[Saracens]] (by this time, the papacy had changed, and the Pope was now [[Pope Gregory IX]]; he would cause both peoples to be distinguished from Christians by means of badges; and would forbid both Jews and Saracens to buy or to keep Christian slaves.<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nThe year 1240 was the closing one of the fifth millennium of the Jewish era. At that time the Jews were expecting the advent of their [[Messiah]]. The [[Mongol invasion]] in 1241 seemed to conform to expectation, as Jewish imagination expected the happy Messianic period to be ushered in by the war of [[Gog and Magog]]. [[B\u00e9la IV]] (1235\u20131270) appointed a Jewish man named [[Henul]] to the office of court chamberlain (the Jewish [[Teka]] had filled this office under Andrew II); and [[W\u00f6lfel]] and his sons [[Altmann (Hungarian)|Altmann]] and [[Nickel (Hungarian)|Nickel]] held the castle at [[Kom\u00e1rom]] with its domains in pawn. B\u00e9la also entrusted the Jews with the mint; and Hebrew coins of this period are still found in Hungary. In 1251 a ''privilegium'' was granted by B\u00e9la to his Jewish subjects which was essentially the same as that granted by Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria|Frederick II the Quarrelsome]] to the [[Austria]]n Jews in 1244, but which B\u00e9la modified to suit the conditions of Hungary. This ''privilegium'' remained in force down to the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1526).<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nAt the [[Synod of Buda]] (1279), held in the reign of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] (1272\u20131290), it was decreed, in the presence of the papal ambassador, that every Jew appearing in public should wear on the left side of his upper garment a piece of red cloth; that any Christian transacting business with a Jew not so marked, or living in a house or on land together with any Jew, should be refused admittance to the Church services; and that a Christian entrusting any office to a Jew should be [[excommunicated]]. [[Andrew III of Hungary|Andrew III]] (1291\u20131301), the last king of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]], declared, in the ''privilegium'' granted by him to the community of Posonium ([[Bratislava]]), that the Jews in that city should enjoy all the liberties of citizens.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=494\u2013495}}\n\n== Expulsion, recall and persecution (1349\u20131526) ==\n[[File:Synagogue Sopron Hungary.jpg|thumb|The Orthodox Synagogue of Sopron, Hungary, dates from the 1890s.]]\n[[File:Pottery artifacts Synagogue Sopron Hungary.jpg|thumb|Medieval pottery artifacts inside the Sopron Synagogue Museum.]]\nUnder the foreign kings who occupied the throne of Hungary on the extinction of the house of Arpad, the Hungarian Jews suffered many persecutions. During the time of the [[Black Death]] (1349), they were expelled from the country. Although the Jews were immediately readmitted, they were again persecuted, and were once again expelled in 1360 by King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great of Anjou]] (1342\u20131382).<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=495}}.</ref> Although King Louis had initially shown tolerance to the Jews during the early years of his reign, following his conquest of [[Bosnia]], during which he tried to force the local population to convert from the \"heretic\" Bogomil Christianity to Catholicism, King Louis attempted to impose conversion on Hungarian Jews as well. However, he failed in his attempt to convert them to [[Catholicism]], and expelled them.{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=56}} They were received by [[Alexandru cel Bun|Alexander the Good of Moldavia]] and [[Dano I of Wallachia]], the latter who afforded them special commercial privileges.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nSome years later, when Hungary was in financial distress, the Jews were recalled. They found that during their absence the king had introduced the custom of ''T\u00f6dtbriefe'', i.e., cancelling by a stroke of his pen, on the request of a subject or a city, the notes and [[Mortgage law|mortgage]]-deeds of the Jews. An important office created by Louis was that of \"judge of all the Jews living in Hungary,\" who was chosen from among the dignitaries of the country, the [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]]s, and [[treasurer]]s, and had a deputy to aid him. It was his duty to collect the [[taxes]] of the Jews, to protect their privileges, and to listen to their complaints, which last-named had become more frequent since the reign of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund Luxembourg]] (1387\u20131437).<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nThe successors of Sigismund: [[Albert II of Germany|Albert]] (1437\u20131439), [[Ladislaus Posthumus]] (1453\u20131457), and [[Matthias Corvinus]] (1458\u20131490) all likewise confirmed the ''privilegium'' of B\u00e9la IV. Matthias created the office of Jewish [[prefect]] in Hungary. The period following the death of Matthias was a sad one for the Hungarian Jews. He was hardly buried, when the people fell upon them, confiscated their property, refused to pay debts owing to them, and persecuted them generally. The pretender [[John Corvinus]], Matthias' illegitimate son, expelled them from [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]], and King [[Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus II]] (1490\u20131516), always in need of money, laid heavy taxes upon them. During his reign, Jews were for the first time burned at the stake, many being executed at [[Nagyszombat]] ([[Trnava]]) in 1494, on suspicion of [[blood libel|ritual murder]].<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nThe Hungarian Jews finally applied to the German Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] for protection. On the occasion of the marriage of [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|Louis II]] and the [[Mary of Austria (1505-1558)|archduchess Maria]] (1512), the emperor, with the consent of Ladislaus, took the prefect, [[Jacob Mendel of Buda]], together with his family and all the other Hungarian Jews, under his protection, according to them all the rights enjoyed by his other subjects. Under Ladislaus' successor, Louis II (1516\u20131526), persecution of the Jews was a common occurrence. The bitter feeling against them was in part augmented by the fact that the baptized [[Emeric Szerencs\u00e9s]], the deputy treasurer, embezzled the public funds.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\n== War against the Ottomans (1526\u20131686) ==\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] vanquished the [[Hungarians]] at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (August 29, 1526), on which occasion Louis II lost his life on the battlefield. When the news of his death reached the capital, [[Buda]], the court and the nobles fled together with some wealthy Jews, among them the prefect. When the grand [[vizier]], [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha|Ibrahim Pasha]], preceding Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]], arrived with his army at Buda, the representatives of the Jews who had remained in the city appeared garbed in mourning before him, and, begging for grace, handed him the keys of the deserted and unprotected castle in token of submission. The sultan himself entered Buda on September 11; and on September 22 he decreed that all the Jews seized at Buda, [[Esztergom]], and elsewhere, more than 2,000 in number, should be distributed among the cities of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/> They were sent to [[Constantinople]], Plevna ([[Pleven]]) and [[Sofia]], where they maintained their separate community for several decades. In [[Sofia]], there existed four Jewish communities in the second half of the 16th century: Romaniote, Ashkenazi, Sephardi and \"Ungarus\". The overflow of Hungarian Jews from Sofia also settled in [[Kavala]] later.\n\nAlthough the Ottoman Army turned back after the battle, in 1541 it again invaded Hungary to help repel an Austrian attempt to take Buda. By the time the Ottoman Army arrived, the Austrians were defeated, but the Ottomans seized Buda by ruse.\n\nWhile some of the Jews of Hungary were deported to [[Anatolia]], others, who had fled at the approach of the [[sultan]], sought refuge beyond the frontier or in the [[free royal town]]s of western Hungary. The widow of Louis II, the queen regent Maria, favored the enemies of the Jews. The citizens of [[Sopron]] (\u00d6denburg) began hostilities by expelling the Jews of that city, confiscating their property, and pillaging the vacated houses and the [[synagogue]]. The city of Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) also received permission from the queen (October 9, 1526) to expel the Jews living within its territory, because they had expressed their intention of fleeing before the Turks. The Jews left Pressburg on November 9.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nOn that same day the [[diet (assembly)|diet]] at [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] was opened, at which [[J\u00e1nos Szapolyai]] (1526\u20131540) was elected and crowned king in opposition to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. During this session it was decreed that the Jews should immediately be expelled from every part of the country. Z\u00e1polya, however, did not ratify these laws; and the Diet held at Pressburg in December 1526, at which Ferdinand of Habsburg was chosen king (1526\u20131564), annulled all the decrees of that of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, including Z\u00e1polya's election as king.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nAs the lord of B\u00f6sing ([[Pezinok]]) was in debt to the Jews, a [[blood libel|blood accusation]] was brought against these inconvenient creditors in 1529. Although Mendel, the prefect, and the Jews throughout Hungary protested, the accused were burned at the stake. For centuries afterward Jews were forbidden to live at B\u00f6sing. The Jews of Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) soon shared a similar fate, being first punished for alleged ritual murder and then expelled from the city (February 19, 1539).<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nThe Jews living in the parts of Hungary occupied by the Ottoman Empire were treated far better than those living under the [[Habsburgs]]. During the periods of 1546-1590 and 1620\u20131680, the community of Ofen ([[Buda]]) flourished.\n\nThe following table shows the number of Jewish [[jizya]]-tax paying heads of household in Buda during the Ottomans rule:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-align=center\n! 1546\n! 1559\n! 1562\n! 1590\n! 1627\n! 1633\n! 1660\n|-align=center\n| 50\n| 44\n| 49\n| 109\n| 11\n| 20\n| 80\n|}\n\nAt the end of the Ottoman era, the approximately one thousand Jews living in Buda worshipped in three synagogues: an Ashkenazi, a Sephardi and a Syrian one.\n\nWhile the Ottomans held sway in Hungary, the Jews of [[Transylvania]] (at that time an independent principality) also fared well. At the instance of [[Abraham Sassa]], a Jewish physician of [[Constantinople]], Prince [[Gabriel Bethlen]] of Transylvania granted a letter of privileges (June 18, 1623) to the [[Spain|Spanish]] Jews from Anatolia.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=496}}.</ref> But the community of Judaizing [[Szekler Sabbatarians]], which had existed in Transylvania since 1588, was persecuted and driven underground in 1638.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fogelman |first=Shay |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/discovering-europe-s-non-jews-who-kept-the-faith-1.387208 |title=From the second half of the 19th century the surviving Szekler Sabbatarians intermarried with Jews |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2013-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210221216/http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/discovering-europe-s-non-jews-who-kept-the-faith-1.387208 |archive-date=2013-02-10 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 1572, King [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] (1563\u20131576) intended to expel the Jews of Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), stating that his edict would be recalled only in case they accepted [[Christianity]]. The Jews, however, remained in the city, without abandoning their religion. They were in constant conflict with the citizens. On June 1, 1582 the [[municipal]] council decreed that no one should harbor Jews, or even transact business with them. The feeling against the Jews in that part of the country not under Turkish rule is shown by the decree of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of 1578, to the effect that Jews were to be taxed double the amount which was imposed upon other citizens.<ref name=\"The Jewish Encyclopedia \u2026\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=496}}.</ref>\n\nBy article XV of the law promulgated by the Diet of 1630, Jews were forbidden to take charge of the [[customs]]; and this [[decree]] was confirmed by the Diet of 1646 on the ground that the Jews were excluded from the privileges of the country, that they were unbelievers, and had no conscience (''veluti jurium regni incapaces, infideles, et nulla conscientia praediti'').<ref name=\"The Jewish Encyclopedia \u2026\"/> The Jews had to pay a special war-tax when the imperial troops set out toward the end of the 16th century to recapture Buda from the Ottomans. The [[Buda]] community suffered much during this siege, as did also that of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r when the imperial troops took that city in September 1601; many of its members were either slain or taken prisoner and sold into slavery, their redemption being subsequently effected by the German, Italian, and Ottoman Jews. After the conclusion of peace, which the Jews helped to bring about, the communities were in part reconstructed; but further development in the territory of the Habsburgs was arrested when [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] (1657\u20131705) expelled the Jews (April 24, 1671). He, however, revoked his decree a few months later (August 20). During the siege of [[Vienna]], in 1683, the Jews that had returned to that city were again maltreated. The Ottomans plundered some communities in western Hungary, and deported the members as slaves.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\n== Habsburg rule ==\n=== Further persecution and expulsions (1686\u20131740) ===\nThe imperial troops recaptured [[Buda]] on September 2, 1686, most Jewish residents were massacred, some captured and later released for ransom. In the following years the whole of Hungary now came under the rule of the [[House of Habsburg]]. As the devastated country had to be repopulated, Bishop Count [[Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch]], subsequently Archbishop of [[Esztergom]] and [[primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Hungary, advised the king to give the preference to the German Catholics in order that the country might in time become German and Catholic. He held that the Jews could not be exterminated at once, but they must be weeded out by degrees, as bad coin is gradually withdrawn from circulation. The decree passed by the Diet of Pressburg (1687\u20131688), imposing double taxation upon the Jews. Jews were not be permitted to engage in [[agriculture]], nor to own any [[real estate]], nor to keep Christian servants.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\nThis advice soon bore fruit and was in part acted upon. In August 1690, the government at [[Vienna]] ordered [[Sopron]] to expel its Jews, who had immigrated from the Austrian provinces. The government, desiring to enforce the edict of the last Diet, decreed soon afterward that Jews should be removed from the office of collector. The order proved ineffective, however; and the employment of Jewish customs officials was continued. Even the treasurer of the realm set the example in transgressing the law by appointing (1692) [[Simon Hirsch]] as [[customs farmer]] at Leopoldstadt ([[Leopoldov]]); and at Hirsch's death he transferred the office to Hirsch's son-in-law.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\nThe revolt of the [[Kuruc]], under [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]], caused much suffering to Hungary's Jews. The [[Kuruc]] imprisoned and slew the Jews, who had incurred their anger by siding with the king's party. The Jews of [[Eisenstadt]], accompanied by those of the community of [[Mattersburg|Mattersdorf]], sought refuge at Vienna, [[Wiener-Neustadt]], and [[Forchtenstein]]; those of Holics ([[Hol\u00ed\u010d]]) and Sasv\u00e1r ([[\u0160a\u0161t\u00edn-Str\u00e1\u017ee|\u0160a\u0161t\u00edn]]) dispersed to G\u00f6ding ([[Hodon\u00edn]]); while others, who could not leave their business in this time of distress, sent their families to safe places, and themselves braved the danger. While not many Jews lost their lives during this revolt, it made great havoc in their wealth, especially in [[Sopron (county)|Sopron County]], where a number of rich Jews were living. The king granted letters of protection to those that had been ruined by the revolt, and demanded satisfaction for those that had been injured; but in return for these favors he commanded the Jews to furnish the sums necessary for suppressing the revolt.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\nAfter the restoration of peace the Jews were expelled from many cities that feared their competition; thus [[Esztergom]] expelled them in 1712, on the ground that the city which had given birth to [[St. Stephen]] must not be desecrated by them. But the Jews living in the country, on the estates of their landlords, were generally left alone.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\nThe lot of the Jews was not improved under the reign of Leopold's son, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles III]] (1711\u20131740). He informed the government (June 28, 1725) that he intended to decrease the number of Jews in his domains, and the government thereupon directed the counties to furnish statistics of the [[Jew|Hebrew]] inhabitants. In 1726 the king decreed that in the Austrian provinces, from the day of publication of the decree, only one male member in each Jewish family be allowed to marry. This decree, restricting the natural increase of the Jews, materially affected the Jewish communities of Hungary. All the Jews in the Austrian provinces who could not marry there went to Hungary to found families; thus the overflow of Austrian Jews peopled Hungary. These immigrants settled chiefly in the northwestern counties, in Nyitra ([[Nitra]]), Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), and Trencs\u00e9n ([[Tren\u010d\u00edn]]).{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=496\u2013497}}\n\nThe [[Moravia]]n Jews continued to live in Hungary as Moravian subjects; even those that went there for the purpose of marrying and settling promised on oath before leaving that they would pay the same taxes as those living in Moravia. In 1734 the Jews of Trencs\u00e9n bound themselves by a secret oath that in all their communal affairs they would submit to the Jewish court at Ungarisch-Brod ([[Uhersk\u00fd Brod]]) only. In the course of time the immigrants refused to pay taxes to the Austrian provinces. The Moravian Jews, who had suffered by the heavy emigration, then brought complaint; and [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered that all Jewish and Christian subjects that had emigrated after 1740 should be [[extradited]], while those who had emigrated before that date were to be released from their Moravian allegiance.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=497}}.</ref>\n\nThe government could not, however, check the large immigration; for although strict laws were drafted in 1727, they could not be enforced owing to the good-will of the magnates toward the Jews. The counties either did not answer at all, or sent reports bespeaking mercy rather than persecution.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the king endeavored to free the [[mining]]-towns from the Jews \u2013 a work which Leopold I had already begun in 1693. The Jews, however, continued to settle near these towns; they displayed their wares at the fairs; and, with the permission of the court, they even erected a foundry at S\u00e1g ([[Sasinkovo]]). When King Charles ordered them to leave (March 1727), the royal mandate was in some places ignored; in others the Jews obeyed so slowly that he had to repeat his edict three months later.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\"/>\n\n=== Maria Theresa (1740\u20131780) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nIn 1735, another [[census]] of the Jews of the country was taken with the view of reducing their numbers. There were at that time 11,621 Jews living in Hungary, of which 2,474 were male heads of families, and fifty-seven were female heads. Of these heads of families 35.31 per cent declared themselves to be Hungarians; the rest had immigrated. Of the immigrants 38.35 per cent came from Moravia, 11.05 per cent from Poland, and 3.07 per cent from [[Bohemia]]. The largest Jewish community, numbering 770 persons, was that of Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]). Most of the Jews were engaged in [[commerce]] or [[industry|industries]], most being [[merchants]], traders, or shopkeepers; only a few pursued agriculture.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of Queen [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] (1740\u20131780), daughter of Charles III, the Jews were expelled from [[Buda]] (1746), and the \"[[Toleration tax|toleration-tax]]\" was imposed upon the Hungarian Jews. On September 1, 1749, the delegates of the Hungarian Jews, except those from [[Szatm\u00e1r]] County, assembled at Pressburg and met a royal commission, which informed them that they would be expelled from the country if they did not pay this tax. The frightened Jews at once agreed to do so; and the commission then demanded a yearly tax of 50,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]. This sum being excessive, the delegates protested; and although the queen had fixed 30,000 gulden as the minimum tax, they were finally able to compromise on the payment of 20,000 gulden a year for a period of eight years. The delegates were to apportion this amount among the districts; the districts, their respective sums among the communities; and the communities, theirs among the individual members.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\"/>\n\nThe queen confirmed this agreement of the commission, except the eight-year clause, changing the period to three years, which she subsequently made five. The agreement, thus ratified by the queen, was brought on November 26 before the courts, which were powerless to relieve the Jews from the payment of this ''Malkegeld'' (queen's money), as they called it.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=497\u2013498}}\n\nThe Jews, thus burdened by new taxes, thought the time ripe for taking steps to remove their oppressive [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]]. While still at Presburg the delegates had brought their grievances before the mixed commission that was called ''delegata in puncto tolerantialis taxae et gravaminum Judeorum commissio mixta''. These complaints pictured the distress of the Jews of that time. They were not allowed to live in [[Croatia]] and [[Slavonia]], in [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]] and [[Heves County (former)|Heves]] Counties, or in several free royal towns and localities; nor might they visit the markets there. At Stuhlweissenburg ([[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]) they had to pay a poll-tax of 1 gulden, 30 [[kreuzer]] if they entered the city during the day, if only for an hour. In many places they might not even stay overnight. They therefore begged permission to settle, or at least to visit the fairs, in Croatia and Slavonia and in those places from which they had been driven in consequence of the jealousy of the [[Greeks]] and the merchants.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=498}}.</ref>\n\nThe Jews also had to pay heavier bridge-and ferry-tolls than the Christians; at Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) they had to pay three times the ordinary sum, namely, for the driver, for the vehicle, and for the animal drawing the same; and in three villages belonging to the same district they had to pay [[Toll road|toll]], although there was no toll-gate. Jews living on the estates of the nobles had to give their wives and children as [[Security interest#Pledge|pledge]]s for [[arrears]] of taxes. In Upper Hungary they asked for the revocation of the toleration-tax imposed by the chamber of Zips County ([[Szepes]], [[Spi\u0161]]), on the ground that otherwise the Jews living there would have to pay two such taxes; and they asked also to be relieved from a similar tax paid to the Diet. Finally, they requested that Jewish [[artisan]]s might be allowed to follow their trades in their homes undisturbed.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nThe commission laid these complaints before the Queen, indicating the manner in which they could be relieved; and their suggestions were subsequently willed by the queen and made into law. The queen relieved the Jews from the tax of toleration in Upper Hungary only. In regard to the other complaints she ordered that the Jews should specify them in detail, and that the government should remedy them insofar as they came under its jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nThe toleration-tax had hardly been instituted when [[Michael Hirsch]] petitioned the government to be appointed primate of the Hungarian Jews in order to be able to settle difficulties that might arise among them, and to collect the tax. The government did not recommend Hirsch, but decided that in case the Jews should refuse to pay, it might be advisable to appoint a primate to adjust the matter.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nBefore the end of the period of five years the delegates of the Jews again met the commission at Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) and offered to increase the amount of their tax to 25,000 gulden a year if the queen would promise that it should remain at that sum for the next ten years. The queen had other plans, however; not only did she dismiss the renewed ''gravamina'' of the Jews, but rather imposed stiffer regulations upon them. Their tax of 20,000 gulden was increased to 30,000 gulden in 1760; to 50,000 in 1772; to 80,000 in 1778; and to 160,000 in 1813.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\n=== Joseph II (1780\u20131790) ===\n[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (1780\u20131790), son and successor of Maria Theresa, showed immediately on his accession that he intended to alleviate the condition of the Jews, communicating this intention to the Hungarian chancellor, Count Franz [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|Esterh\u00e1zy]] as early as May 13, 1781. In consequence the Hungarian government issued (March 31, 1783) a decree known as the ''Systematica gentis Judaicae regulatio'', which wiped out at one stroke the decrees that had oppressed the Jews for centuries. The royal free towns, except the mining-towns, were opened to the Jews, who were allowed to settle at leisure throughout the country. The ''regulatio'' decreed that the legal documents of the Jews should no longer be composed in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], or in [[Yiddish]], but in [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the languages used in the country at the time, and which the young Jews were required to learn within two years.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nDocuments written in Hebrew or in Yiddish were not legal; Hebrew books were to be used at worship only; the Jews were to organize [[elementary school]]s; the commands of the emperor, issued in the interests of the Jews, were to be announced in the [[synagogue]]s; and the rabbis were to explain to the people the salutary effects of these decrees. The subjects to be taught in the Jewish schools were to be the same as those taught in the national schools; the same text-books were to be used in all the elementary schools; and everything that might offend the religious sentiment of non-conformists was to be omitted.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\n[[File:Josef II medal.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A medal minted during the reign of Josef II, commemorating his grant of religious liberty to Jews and [[Protestants]].]]\nDuring the early years Christian teachers were to be employed in the Jewish schools, but they were to have nothing to do with the religious affairs of such institutions. After the lapse of ten years a Jew might establish a business, or engage in trade, only if he could prove that he had attended a school. The usual school-inspectors were to supervise the Jewish schools and to report to the government. The Jews were to create a fund for organizing and maintaining their schools. Jewish youth might enter the academies, and might study any subject at the universities except [[theology]]. Jews might rent farms only if they could cultivate the same without the aid of Christians.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nJews were allowed to [[peddler|peddle]] and to engage in various [[industry|industrial]] occupations, and to be admitted into the [[guild]]s. They were also permitted to engrave [[seal (device)|seal]]s, and to sell [[gunpowder]] and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]]; but their exclusion from the mining-towns remained in force. Christian masters were allowed to have Jewish [[apprentice]]s. All distinctive marks hitherto worn by the Jews were to be abolished, and they might even carry swords. On the other hand, they were required to discard the distinctive marks prescribed by their religion and to shave their beards. Emperor Joseph regarded this decree so seriously that he allowed no one to violate it.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nThe Jews, in a petition dated April 22, 1783, expressed their gratitude to the emperor for his favors, and, reminding him of his principle that religion should not be interfered with, asked permission to wear beards. The emperor granted the prayer of the petitioners, but reaffirmed the other parts of the decree (April 24, 1783). The Jews organized schools in various places, at Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), [[\u00d3buda]], V\u00e1g\u00fajhely ([[Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom]]), and Nagyv\u00e1rad ([[Oradea]]). A decree was issued by the emperor (July 23, 1787) to the effect that every Jew should choose a German surname; and a further edict (1789) ordered, to the consternation of the Jews, that they should henceforth perform [[Conscription|military service]].{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=498\u2013499}}\n\nAfter the death of Joseph II the royal free cities showed a very hostile attitude toward the Jews. The citizens of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] petitioned the municipal council that after May 1, 1790, the Jews should no longer be allowed to live in the city. The government interfered; and the Jews were merely forbidden to engage in peddling in the city. Seven days previously a decree of expulsion had been issued at Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]), May 1 being fixed as the date of the Jews' departure. The Jews appealed to the government; and in the following December the city authorities of Nagyszombat were informed that the Diet had confirmed the former rights of the Jews, and that the latter could not be expelled.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=499}}.</ref>\n\n== Toleration and oppression (1790\u20131847) ==\n[[File:Ullmann M\u00f3ric.jpg|thumb|[[M\u00f3ric Ullmann]] (1782\u20131847), Hungarian Jewish banker, trader, founder of the Pesti Magyar Kereskedelmi Bank (Pesti Hungarian Commercial Bank).]]\n[[File:Old neoclassic Synagogue Szeged Hungary.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neoclassical architecture]] was used for this Synagogue in [[Szeged]].]]\nThe Jews of Hungary handed a petition, in which they boldly presented their claims to equality with other citizens, to King [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] (1790\u20131792) at Vienna on November 29, 1790. He sent it the following day to the chancelleries of Hungary and Moravia for their opinions. The question was brought before the estates of the country on December 2, and the Diet drafted a bill showing that it intended to protect the Jews. This decision created consternation among the enemies of the latter. Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) addressed a further memorandum to the estates (December 4) in which it demanded that the Diet should protect the city's privileges. The Diet decided in favor of the Jews, and its decision was laid before the king.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\"/>\n\nThe Jews, confidently anticipating the king's decision in their favor, organized a splendid celebration on November 15, 1790, the day of his [[coronation]]; on January 10, 1791, the king approved the bill of the Diet; and the following law, drafted in conformity with the royal decision, was read by Judge [[Stephen Atzel]] in the session of February 5:\n[[File:Jewish cemetery tombs Timisoara Romania.jpg|thumb|The Jewish Cemetery in the city of [[Timisoara]], now part of Romania.]]\n\"In order that the condition of the Jews may be regulated pending such time as may elapse until their affairs and the privileges of various royal free towns relating to them shall have been determined by a commission to report to the next ensuing Diet, when his Majesty and the estates will decide on the condition of the Jews, the estates have determined, with the approval of his Majesty, that the Jews within the boundaries of Hungary and the countries belonging to it shall, in all the royal free cities and in other localities (except the royal mining-towns), remain under the same conditions in which they were on Jan. 1, 1790; and in case they have been expelled anywhere, they shall be recalled.\"<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\"/>\n\nThus came into force the famous law entitled ''De Judaeis'', which forms the thirty-eighth article of the laws of the Diet of 1790\u20131791. The ''De Judaeis'' law was gratefully received by the Jews; for it not only afforded them protection, but also gave them the assurance that their affairs would soon be regulated. Still, although the Diet appointed on February 7, 1791, a commission to study the question, the amelioration of the condition of the Hungarian Jews was not effected till half a century later, under [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand V]] (r. 1835\u20131848), during the session of the Diet of 1839\u20131840.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\"/> It is estimated that the Jewish population in Hungary grew by about 80% between 1815-1840,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jews of Hungary |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/hungary |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |access-date=2018-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729111919/https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/hungary |archive-date=2018-07-29 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> bolstered by immigration due to the perception of royal tolerance.\n\nIn consequence of the petition of the Jews of Pest, the mover of which was [[Philip Jacobovics]], superintendent of the Jewish hospital, the general assembly of the county of Pest drafted instructions for the delegates on June 10, 1839, to the effect that if the Jews would be willing to adopt the [[Hungarian language|Magyar]] language they should be given equal rights with other Hungarian citizens.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\"/> From now on much attention was paid to the teaching of Hungarian in the schools; [[Moritz Bloch]] (Ballagi) translated the [[Pentateuch]] into Hungarian, and [[Moritz Rosenthal]] the [[Psalms]] and the ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]''. Various communities founded Hungarian reading-circles; and the Hungarian dress and language were more and more adopted. Many communities began to use Hungarian on their seals and in their documents, and some liberal rabbis even began to preach in that language.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=500}}.</ref>\n\nAt the sessions of the Diet subsequent to that of 1839\u20131840, as well as in various cities, a decided antipathy\u2014at times active and at times merely passive\u2014toward the Jews became manifest. In sharp contrast to this attitude was that of Baron [[J\u00f3zsef E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], who published in 1840 in the ''Budapesti Szemle'', the most prominent Hungarian review, a strong appeal for the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] of the Jews. This cause also found a friend in Count Charles Zay, the chief ecclesiastical inspector of the Hungarian [[Lutherans]], who warmly advocated Jewish interests in 1846.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\"/>\n\nAlthough the session of the Diet convened on November 7, 1847, was unfavorable to the Jews, the latter not only continued to cultivate the Hungarian language, but were also willing to sacrifice their lives and property in the hour of danger. During the [[Revolution of 1848]] they displayed their patriotism, even though attacked by the populace in several places at the beginning of the uprising. On March 19 the populace of Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), encouraged by the antipathies of the citizens\u2014who were aroused by the fact that the Jews, leaving their [[ghetto]] around Pressburg Castle ([[Bratislava Castle]]), were settling in the city itself\u2014began hostilities that were continued after some days, and were renewed more fiercely in April.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\"/>\n\nAt this time the expulsion of the Jews from [[Sopron]], [[P\u00e9cs]], [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], and [[Szombathely]] was demanded; in the last two cities there were [[pogroms]]. At Szombathely, the mob advanced upon the synagogue, cut up the [[Torah]] scrolls, and threw them into a well. Nor did the Jews of Pest escape, while those at V\u00e1g\u00fajhely ([[Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom]]) especially suffered from the brutality of the mob. Bitter words against the Jews were also heard in the Diet. Some Jews advised [[History of the Jews in the United States#Jewish immigration|emigration to America]] as a means of escape; and a society was founded at Pest, with a branch at Pressburg, for that purpose. A few left Hungary, seeking a new home across the sea, but the majority remained.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\"/>\n\n== Revolution and emancipation (1848\u20131849) ==\n===Jews and the Hungarian Revolution=== <!-- polite note: Redirect [[Hungarian Jews in the Revolution]] links here -->\nJews entered the national guard as early as March 1848; although they were excluded from certain cities, they reentered as soon as the danger to the country seemed greater than the hatred of the citizens. At [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] the Jewish national guard formed a separate division. When the national guards of [[P\u00e1pa]] were mobilized against the [[Croatians]], [[Leopold L\u00f6w]], rabbi of P\u00e1pa, joined the Hungarian ranks, inspiring his companions by his words of encouragement. Jews were also to be found in the volunteer corps, and among the ''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|honv\u00e9d]]'' and ''[[landsturm]]''; and they constituted one-third of the volunteer division of Pest that marched along the [[Drava]] against the Croatians, being blessed by Rabbi Schwab on June 22, 1848.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\"/>\n\nMany Jews throughout the country joined the army to fight for their fatherland; among them, [[Adolf H\u00fcbsch]], subsequently rabbi at [[New York City]]; [[Solomon Marcus Schiller-Szinessy]], afterward lecturer at the [[University of Cambridge]]; and [[Ignatz Einhorn]], who, under the name of \"Eduard Horn,\" subsequently became state secretary of the [[Hungarian Ministry of Commerce]]. The rebellious [[Serbs|Serbians]] slew the Jews at [[Senta|Zenta]] who sympathized with Hungary; among them, Rabbi [[Israel Ullmann]] and [[Jacob M\u00fcnz]], son of [[Moses M\u00fcnz]] of [[\u00d3buda]] The conduct of the Jewish soldiers in the Hungarian army was highly commended by Generals [[Gy\u00f6rgy Klapka|Klapka]] and [[G\u00f6rgey]]. Einhorn estimated the number of Jewish soldiers who took part in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolution]] to be 20,000; but this is most likely exaggerated, as [[B\u00e9la Bernstein]] enumerates only 755 combatants by name in his work, ''Az 1848-49-iki Magyar Szabads\u00e1gharcz \u00e9s a Zsid\u00f3k'' (Budapest, 1898).{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=500\u2013501}}\n\nThe Hungarian Jews served their country not only with the sword, but also with funds. Communities and individuals, [[Chevra Kadisha]], and other Jewish societies, freely contributed silver and gold, armor and provisions, clothed and fed the soldiers, and furnished lint and other medical supplies to the Hungarian camps. Meanwhile, they did not forget to take steps to obtain their rights as citizens. When the Diet of 1847\u20131848 (in which, according to ancient law, only the [[nobles]] and those having the rights of nobles might take part) was dissolved (April 11), and the new Parliament \u2014 at which under the new laws the delegates elected by the commons also appeared \u2014 was convened at Pest (July 2, 1848), the Jews hopefully looked forward to the deliberations of the new body.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 501\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=501}}.</ref>\n\n===Brief emancipation and aftermath, 1849===\nMany Jews thought to pave the way for emancipation by a radical reform of their religious life. They thought this might ease their way, as legislators in the Diets and articles printed in the press suggested that the Jews should not receive equal civic rights until they reformed their religious practices. This reform had been first demanded in the session of 1839\u20131840. From this session onward, the press and general assemblies pushed for religious reform. Several counties instructed their representatives not to vote for the emancipation of the Jews until they desisted from practising the externals of their religion.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 501\"/>\n\nFor the purpose of urging [[Jewish emancipation]], all the Jews of Hungary sent delegates to a conference at Pest on July 5, 1848. It chose a commission of ten members to lobby with the Diet for emancipation. The commission delegates were instructed not to make any concessions related to practicing the Jewish faith. The commission soon after addressed a petition to the Parliament for emancipation, but it proved ineffective.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 501\"/>\n\nThe national assembly at [[Szeged]] granted emancipation of Jews on Saturday, the eve of the [[Ninth of Av]] (July 28, 1849). The bill, which was quickly debated and immediately became a law, fulfilled the hopes of the Reform party. The Jews obtained full citizenship. The Ministry of the Interior was ordered to call a convention of Jewish [[minister of religion|ministers]] and [[laymen]] for the purpose of drafting a [[confession of faith]], and of inducing the Jews to organize their religious life in conformity with the demands of the time, for instance, business hours on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. The bill included the clause referring to marriages between Jews and Christians, which clause both [[Lajos Kossuth]] and the Reform party advocated.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 501\"/>\n\nThe Jews' civic liberty lasted for just two weeks. After the Hungarian army's [[surrender at Vil\u00e1gos]] to [[Russia]]n troops, which had come to aid the Austrians in suppressing the Hungarian struggle for liberty, the Jews were severely punished by new authorities for having taken part in the uprising. Field Marshal [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], the new governor of Hungary, imposed heavy war-taxes upon them, especially upon the communities of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[\u00d3buda]], which had already been heavily taxed by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]], commander-in-chief of the Austrian army, on his triumphant entry into the Hungarian capital at the beginning of 1849. Haynau punished the communities of [[Kecskem\u00e9t]], [[Nagyk\u0151r\u00f6s]], [[Cegl\u00e9d]], [[Albertirsa]], Szeged, and Szabadka (now [[Subotica]], Serbia) with equal severity. Numerous Jews were imprisoned and executed; others sought refuge in [[emigration]].{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=501\u2013502}}\n\nSeveral communities petitioned to be relieved of the war taxes. The ministry of war, however, increased the hurden, requiring that the communities of Pest, \u00d3buda, Kecskem\u00e9t, Czegl\u00e9d, Nagyk\u0151r\u00f6s, and Irsa should pay this tax not in kind, but in currency to the amount of 2,300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]. As the communities were unable to collect such monies, they petitioned the government to remit it. The Jewish communities of the entire country were ordered to share in raising the sum, on the grounds that most of the Jews of Hungary had supported the Revolution. Only the communities of Temesv\u00e1r (now [[Timi\u0219oara]], Romania) and Pressburg (now [[Bratislava]], Slovakia) were exempted from this order, as they remained loyal to the existing Austrian government. The military commission added a clause to tax requirements, to the effect that individuals or communities might be exempted from the punishment, if they could prove by documents or witnesses, before a commission to be appointed, that they had not taken part in the Revolution, either by word or deed, morally or materially. The Jews refused this means of clearing themselves. They declared to be willing to redeem the tax by collecting a certain sum for a national school fund. Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] remitted the war-tax (September 20, 1850), but ordered that the Jews of Hungary without distinction should contribute toward a Jewish school fund of 1,000,000 gulden; they raised this sum within a few years.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=502}}\n\n== Struggles for a second emancipation (1859\u20131867) ==\n[[File:Falk Miksa.JPG|thumb|Prominent newspaper editor and journalist [[Miksa Falk|Miksa (Maxmilian) Falk]] returned to Hungary from Vienna following the emancipation in 1867. He was a national-level politician from 1875 to 1905.]]\nWhile the House of Habsburg controlled Hungary, emancipation of Jews was postponed. When the Austrian troops were defeated in [[Italy]] in 1859, activists pressed for liberty. In that year the cabinet, with Emperor Franz Joseph in the chair, decreed that the status of the Jews should be regulated in agreement with the times, but with due regard for the conditions obtaining in the several localities and provinces. When the emperor convened the Diet on April 2, 1861, Jews pushed for emancipation but the early dissolution of that body prevented it from taking action in the matter.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 502\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=502}}.</ref>\n\nThe decade of absolutism in Hungary (1849\u20131859) resulted in Jews establishing schools, most of which were in charge of trained teachers. Based on the Jewish school fund, the government organized model schools at [[S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely]], Temesv\u00e1r ([[Timi\u0219oara]]), [[P\u00e9cs]], and [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. In Pest the [[Israelite State Teachers' Seminary]] was founded in 1859, the principals of which have included [[Abraham Lederer]], [[Heinrich Deutsch]], and [[J\u00f3zsef B\u00e1n\u00f3czi]].<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 502\"/>\n\nWhen the Parliament dissolved in 1861, the emancipation of the Jews was deferred to the coronation of Franz Joseph. On December 22, 1867, the question came before the lower house, and on the favorable report of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] and [[Zsigmond Bern\u00e1th]], a bill in favor of emancipation was adopted; it was passed by the upper house on the following day.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 502\"/> Although the Antisemitic Party was represented in the Parliament, it was not taken seriously by the political elite of the country. Its agitation against Jews was not successful (see [[Tiszaeszl\u00e1r affair]]).\n\nOn October 4, 1877, the [[Budapest University of Jewish Studies]] opened in [[Budapest]]. The university is still operating, celebrating its 130th anniversary on October 4, 2007. Since its opening, it has been the only Jewish institute in all of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].\n\nIn the 1890 Hungarian census, 64.0% of the Jewish population were counted as ethnic Hungarian by mother tongue, 33.1% as German (these were chiefly Yiddish speakers),<ref>http://www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/porta/szint/tarsad/szocio/studia/studia.htm</ref> 1.9% as Slovak, 0.8% as Romanian, and 0.2% as Ruthenian.\n\n== Austria-Hungary (1867\u20131918) ==\n[[File:02 Pecs, Hungary - Great Synagogue.jpg|thumb|Romantic style Great Synagogue in P\u00e9cs, built by [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] community in 1869.]]\n[[File:Szeged synagogue SF.jpg|thumb|[[Szeged Synagogue]]]]\n\n=== Family names ===\nMost Jews did not have family names before 1783. Some family names were recorded for Jewish families:\n\n* 1050: J\u00e1szkonti\n* 1263: Farkas\n* 1350: Hossz\u00fa\n* 16th century: Cseh, Jakab, Gazdag, Fekete, Nagy, Kis\n* 1780: B\u00e1r\u00e1ny, Csonka, Horp\u00e1cs, J\u00f3nap, Koh\u00e1nyi, Kossuth, Kosztol\u00e1nyi, Lengyel, L\u0151rincz, Luk\u00e1cs, Szarvas, Szab\u00f3, Varga.\n\nEmperor Joseph II believed that Germanization could facilitate the centralization of his empire. Beginning in 1783, he ordered Jews to either choose or be given German family names by local committees. The actions were dependent on local conditions.\n\nWith the rise of Hungarian nationalism, the first wave of Magyarization of family names occurred between 1840 and 1849. After the Hungarian revolution, this process was stopped until 1867. After the [[Ausgleich]], many Jews changed their family names from German to Hungarian.\n\nIn 1942 during World War II, when Hungary became allied with Germany, the Hungarian Defense Ministry was tasked with \"race validation.\" Its officials complained that no Hungarian or German names were \"safe,\" as Jews might have any name. They deemed Slavic names to be \"safer\", but the decree listed 58 Slavic-sounding names regularly held by Jews.<ref>Decree to quicken the process of race validation, May 16, 1942 \u2013 quoted in ''Fegyvertelen \u00e1lltak az aknamez\u0151k\u00f6n'', 1962, edited by Elek Karsai, volume 2, p. 8</ref>\n\n=== Population statistics ===\n==== 1890 / 1900 / 1910 census summaries ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! 1890\n! 1900\n! 1910\n|-\n| Total population of Hungary, without Croatia\n| 15,162,988\n| 16,838,255\n| 18,264,533\n|-\n| Emigration to the US in the previous decade, '00-'09\n| 164,119\n| 261,444\n| 1,162,271\n|-\n| Jewish population, again without Croatia\n| 707,961\n| 831,162\n| 911,227\n|-\n| Increase of the total population in the previous decade\n| 10.28%\n| 11.05%\n| 8.47%\n|-\n| (Emigration to the US in the previous decade, '00-'09) / population at previous census\n| 1.19%\n| 1.72%\n| 6.90%\n|-\n| Increase of the Jewish population in the previous decade\n| 13.31%\n| 17.40%\n| 9.62%\n|-\n| Jewish/Total\n| 4.67%\n| 4.94%\n| 4.99%\n|}\n\nAlmost a quarter (22.35%) of the Jews of Hungary lived in Budapest in 1910.

This was a 28.7% increase in absolute terms since the 1890 census, and a 0.3% increase (from 4.7%) in the overall population of Hungary. At the time, the Jewish natural growth rate was higher than the Christian (although the difference had been narrowing), but so was the emigration rate, mainly to the United States. (The total emigration from Austria-Hungary to the U.S. in 1881-1912 was 3,688,000 people, including 324,000 Jews (8.78%). In the 1880-1913 period, a total of 2,019,000 people emigrated from Hungary to the US. Thus, an estimated 177,000 Jews emigrated from Hungary to the US during this total period.){{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe net loss for Judaism due to conversions was relatively low before the end of the Great War: 240 people/year between 1896-1900, 404 between 1901-1910, and 435 people/year between 1911-1917.

The Yiddish speakers were counted as ethnically German. According to this classification, 6.94% of the ethnic Hungarians and 11.63% of the Germans of Hungary were Jewish. In total, Hungarian speakers made up a 54.45% majority in Hungary; German speakers (including those who spoke Yiddish), made up 10.42% of the population.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nPopulation of the capital, Budapest, was 23% Jewish (about the same ratio as in New York City). This community had established numerous religious and educational institutions. Pest was more Jewish than Buda. The prosperity, cultural, and financial prominence of Budapest's large Jewish community attested to its successful integration. Indeed, commentators opined in 1911 that Hungary had \u201cabsorbed\u201d their Jews and \u201cit has come to pass that there is no anti-Semitism in Budapest, although the Hebrew element is proportionately much larger (21% as compared to 9%) than it is in Vienna, the Mecca of the Jew-baiter\u201d<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1911, Budapest article</ref> At that time [[Karl Lueger]], mayor of [[Vienna]] referred to the capital as [[Judapest]], alluding to the high proportion of Jews.

While popular at first among Budapest's progressive elite and proletariat, the so-called Hungarian Soviet Republic fared poorly in almost all of its aims, particularly its efforts to regain territories occupied by [[Slovakia]] (although achieving some transitional success here) and [[Romania]]. All the less palatable excesses of Communist uprisings were in evidence during these months, particularly the formation of squads of brutal young men practicing what they called \"[[revolutionary terror]]\" to intimidate and suppress dissident views. All but the one [[S\u00e1ndor Garbai]], the revolution's leaders, including [[B\u00e9la Kun]], [[Tibor Szamuely]], and [[Jen\u0151 Landler]] \u2013 were of Jewish ancestry.

This minority had managed to achieve great commercial success, and Jews were disproportionately represented in the professions, relative to their numbers. In 1921 [[Budapest]], 88% of the members of the stock exchange and 91% of the currency brokers were Jews, many of them ennobled.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} In interwar Hungary, more than half and perhaps as much as 90 percent of Hungarian industry was owned or operated by a few closely related Jewish banking families.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Jewish Hungarian country girl in 1928.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Jewish Hungarian country girl around 1930.]]\n[[File:In front of the Gr\u00fcnbaum grocery shop.jpg|thumb|Local customers in front of a Jewish grocery in [[Berzence]], around 1930.]]\n\nJews represented one-fourth of all university students and 43% percent at [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest Technological University]]. In 1920, 60 percent of Hungarian doctors, 51 percent of lawyers, 39 percent of all privately employed engineers and chemists, 34 percent of editors and journalists, and 29 percent of musicians identified themselves as Jews by religion.<ref>All these figures are from [[Yuri Slezkine|Slezkine, Yuri]].

Princeton, 2004. {{ISBN|0-691-11995-3}}</ref>\n\nResentment of this Jewish trend of success was widespread: Admiral Horthy himself declared that he was \"an anti-Semite\", and remarked in a letter to one of his prime ministers, \"I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theater, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad.\"{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=546}}\n\nUnfortunately for Jews they had also become, by a quirk of history, the most visible minority remaining in Hungary (besides ethnic Germans and Gypsies); the other large \"non-Hungarian\" populations (including Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, and Romanians, among others) had been abruptly excised from the Hungarian population by the territorial losses at Trianon. That and the highly visible role of Jews in the economy, the media and the professions, as well as in the leadership of the 1919 Communist dictatorship left Hungary's Jews as an ethnically separate group which could serve as a scapegoat for the nation's ills.<ref name=\"Mason, John W 2000\"/> The scapegoating began quickly. In 1920, Horthy's government passed a \"Numerus Clausus\" law that placed limits on the number of minority students in proportion of their size of the population, thus restricting the Jewish enrollment at universities to five percent or less.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAnti-Jewish policies grew more repressive in the interwar period as Hungary's leaders, who remained committed to regaining territories lost in WW1, chose to align themselves (albeit warily) with the fascist governments of Germany and Italy \u2013 the international actors most likely to stand behind Hungary's claims.<ref name=\"Mason, John W 2000\"/> The inter-war years also saw the emergence of flourishing fascist groups, such as the [[Hungarian National Socialist Party]] and the [[Arrow Cross Party]].\n\n== Anti-Jewish measures ==\n=== Anti-Jewish Laws (1938\u20131941) ===\nStarting in 1938, Hungary under [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] passed a series of anti-Jewish measures in emulation of Germany's [[Nuremberg Laws]].\n\n# The \"'''First Jewish Law'''\" (May 29, 1938) restricted the number of Jews in each commercial enterprise, in the press, among physicians, engineers and lawyers to twenty percent.\n# The \"'''Second Jewish Law'''\" (May 5, 1939), for the first time, defined Jews racially: individuals with two, three or four Jewish-born grandparents were declared Jewish.\n# The \"'''Third Jewish Law'''\" (August 8, 1941) prohibited intermarriage and penalized sexual intercourse between Jews and non-Jews.\n\nTheir employment in government at any level was forbidden, they could not be editors at newspapers, their numbers were restricted to six per cent among theater and movie actors, physicians, lawyers and engineers. Private companies were forbidden to employ more than 12% Jews. 250,000 Hungarian Jews lost their income. Most of them lost their right to vote as well: before the second Jewish law, about 31% of the Jewish population of Borsod county (Miskolc excluded), 2496 people had this right.

In the reign of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|St. Ladislaus]] (1077\u20131095), the [[Synod of Szabolcs]] decreed (May 20, 1092) that Jews should not be permitted to have [[Christians|Christian]] wives or to keep Christian [[slaves]]. This decree had been promulgated in the Christian countries of [[Europe]] since the 5th century, and St. Ladislaus merely introduced it into Hungary.<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nThe Jews of Hungary at first formed small settlements, and had no learned [[rabbi]]s; but they were strictly observant of all the [[Halakha|Jewish law]]s and customs. One tradition relates the story of Jews from Ratisbon ([[Regensburg]]) coming into Hungary with merchandise from [[Russia]], on a Friday; the wheel of their wagon broke near [[Buda]] (Ofen) or [[Esztergom]] (Gran) and by the time they had repaired it and had entered the town, the Jews were just leaving the [[synagogue]]. The unintentional [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]-breakers were heavily fined. The ritual of the Hungarian Jews faithfully reflected contemporary [[German peoples|German]] customs.<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\n=== 1095\u20131349 ===\n[[File:Part of the store-owners family.jpg|thumb|left|A Hungarian Jewish family standing in front of a country grocery shop, 1930s.]]\n[[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman]] (1095\u20131116), the successor of St. Ladislaus, renewed the Szabolcs decree of 1092, adding further prohibitions against the employment of Christian slaves and domestics. He also restricted the Jews to cities with [[episcopal see]]s \u2013 probably to have them under the continuous supervision of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]. Soon after the promulgation of this decree, [[Crusade]]rs came to Hungary; but the [[Hungarians]] did not sympathize with them, and Coloman even opposed them. The infuriated Crusaders attacked some cities, and if [[Gedaliah ibn Ya\u1e25ya]] is to be believed, the Jews suffered a fate similar to that of their coreligionists in [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Bohemia]].<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nThe cruelties inflicted upon the Jews of Bohemia induced many of them to seek refuge in Hungary. It was probably the immigration of the rich Bohemian Jews that induced Coloman soon afterward to regulate commercial and banking transactions between Jews and Christians. He decreed, among other regulations, that if a Christian borrowed from a Jew, or a Jew from a Christian, both Christian and Jewish witnesses must be present at the transaction.<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of King [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] (1205\u20131235) there were Jewish [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlains]] and mint-, salt-, and tax-officials. The [[nobles]] of the country, however, induced the king, in his [[Golden Bull of 1222|Golden Bull]] (1222), to deprive the Jews of these high offices. When Andrew needed money in 1226, he [[Farm (revenue leasing)|farmed the royal revenues]] to Jews, which gave ground for much complaint. The [[pope]] ([[Pope Honorius III]]) thereupon excommunicated him, until, in 1233, he promised the papal ambassadors on oath that he would enforce the decrees of the Golden Bull directed against the Jews and the [[Saracens]] (by this time, the papacy had changed, and the Pope was now [[Pope Gregory IX]]; he would cause both peoples to be distinguished from Christians by means of badges; and would forbid both Jews and Saracens to buy or to keep Christian slaves.<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nThe year 1240 was the closing one of the fifth millennium of the Jewish era. At that time the Jews were expecting the advent of their [[Messiah]]. The [[Mongol invasion]] in 1241 seemed to conform to expectation, as Jewish imagination expected the happy Messianic period to be ushered in by the war of [[Gog and Magog]]. [[B\u00e9la IV]] (1235\u20131270) appointed a Jewish man named [[Henul]] to the office of court chamberlain (the Jewish [[Teka]] had filled this office under Andrew II); and [[W\u00f6lfel]] and his sons [[Altmann (Hungarian)|Altmann]] and [[Nickel (Hungarian)|Nickel]] held the castle at [[Kom\u00e1rom]] with its domains in pawn. B\u00e9la also entrusted the Jews with the mint; and Hebrew coins of this period are still found in Hungary. In 1251 a ''privilegium'' was granted by B\u00e9la to his Jewish subjects which was essentially the same as that granted by Duke [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria|Frederick II the Quarrelsome]] to the [[Austria]]n Jews in 1244, but which B\u00e9la modified to suit the conditions of Hungary. This ''privilegium'' remained in force down to the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (1526).<ref name=\"Singer et al. 1906, p. 494\"/>\n\nAt the [[Synod of Buda]] (1279), held in the reign of King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] (1272\u20131290), it was decreed, in the presence of the papal ambassador, that every Jew appearing in public should wear on the left side of his upper garment a piece of red cloth; that any Christian transacting business with a Jew not so marked, or living in a house or on land together with any Jew, should be refused admittance to the Church services; and that a Christian entrusting any office to a Jew should be [[excommunicated]]. [[Andrew III of Hungary|Andrew III]] (1291\u20131301), the last king of the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty]], declared, in the ''privilegium'' granted by him to the community of Posonium ([[Bratislava]]), that the Jews in that city should enjoy all the liberties of citizens.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=494\u2013495}}\n\n== Expulsion, recall and persecution (1349\u20131526) ==\n[[File:Synagogue Sopron Hungary.jpg|thumb|The Orthodox Synagogue of Sopron, Hungary, dates from the 1890s.]]\n[[File:Pottery artifacts Synagogue Sopron Hungary.jpg|thumb|Medieval pottery artifacts inside the Sopron Synagogue Museum.]]\nUnder the foreign kings who occupied the throne of Hungary on the extinction of the house of Arpad, the Hungarian Jews suffered many persecutions. During the time of the [[Black Death]] (1349), they were expelled from the country. Although the Jews were immediately readmitted, they were again persecuted, and were once again expelled in 1360 by King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great of Anjou]] (1342\u20131382).<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=495}}.</ref> Although King Louis had initially shown tolerance to the Jews during the early years of his reign, following his conquest of [[Bosnia]], during which he tried to force the local population to convert from the \"heretic\" Bogomil Christianity to Catholicism, King Louis attempted to impose conversion on Hungarian Jews as well. However, he failed in his attempt to convert them to [[Catholicism]], and expelled them.{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=56}} They were received by [[Alexandru cel Bun|Alexander the Good of Moldavia]] and [[Dano I of Wallachia]], the latter who afforded them special commercial privileges.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nSome years later, when Hungary was in financial distress, the Jews were recalled. They found that during their absence the king had introduced the custom of ''T\u00f6dtbriefe'', i.e., cancelling by a stroke of his pen, on the request of a subject or a city, the notes and [[Mortgage law|mortgage]]-deeds of the Jews. An important office created by Louis was that of \"judge of all the Jews living in Hungary,\" who was chosen from among the dignitaries of the country, the [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]]s, and [[treasurer]]s, and had a deputy to aid him. It was his duty to collect the [[taxes]] of the Jews, to protect their privileges, and to listen to their complaints, which last-named had become more frequent since the reign of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund Luxembourg]] (1387\u20131437).<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nThe successors of Sigismund: [[Albert II of Germany|Albert]] (1437\u20131439), [[Ladislaus Posthumus]] (1453\u20131457), and [[Matthias Corvinus]] (1458\u20131490) all likewise confirmed the ''privilegium'' of B\u00e9la IV. Matthias created the office of Jewish [[prefect]] in Hungary. The period following the death of Matthias was a sad one for the Hungarian Jews. He was hardly buried, when the people fell upon them, confiscated their property, refused to pay debts owing to them, and persecuted them generally. The pretender [[John Corvinus]], Matthias' illegitimate son, expelled them from [[Tata, Hungary|Tata]], and King [[Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Ladislaus II]] (1490\u20131516), always in need of money, laid heavy taxes upon them. During his reign, Jews were for the first time burned at the stake, many being executed at [[Nagyszombat]] ([[Trnava]]) in 1494, on suspicion of [[blood libel|ritual murder]].<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nThe Hungarian Jews finally applied to the German Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]] for protection. On the occasion of the marriage of [[Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia|Louis II]] and the [[Mary of Austria (1505-1558)|archduchess Maria]] (1512), the emperor, with the consent of Ladislaus, took the prefect, [[Jacob Mendel of Buda]], together with his family and all the other Hungarian Jews, under his protection, according to them all the rights enjoyed by his other subjects. Under Ladislaus' successor, Louis II (1516\u20131526), persecution of the Jews was a common occurrence. The bitter feeling against them was in part augmented by the fact that the baptized [[Emeric Szerencs\u00e9s]], the deputy treasurer, embezzled the public funds.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\n== War against the Ottomans (1526\u20131686) ==\n{{See also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] vanquished the [[Hungarians]] at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] (August 29, 1526), on which occasion Louis II lost his life on the battlefield. When the news of his death reached the capital, [[Buda]], the court and the nobles fled together with some wealthy Jews, among them the prefect. When the grand [[vizier]], [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha|Ibrahim Pasha]], preceding Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]], arrived with his army at Buda, the representatives of the Jews who had remained in the city appeared garbed in mourning before him, and, begging for grace, handed him the keys of the deserted and unprotected castle in token of submission. The sultan himself entered Buda on September 11; and on September 22 he decreed that all the Jews seized at Buda, [[Esztergom]], and elsewhere, more than 2,000 in number, should be distributed among the cities of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/> They were sent to [[Constantinople]], Plevna ([[Pleven]]) and [[Sofia]], where they maintained their separate community for several decades. In [[Sofia]], there existed four Jewish communities in the second half of the 16th century: Romaniote, Ashkenazi, Sephardi and \"Ungarus\". The overflow of Hungarian Jews from Sofia also settled in [[Kavala]] later.\n\nAlthough the Ottoman Army turned back after the battle, in 1541 it again invaded Hungary to help repel an Austrian attempt to take Buda. By the time the Ottoman Army arrived, the Austrians were defeated, but the Ottomans seized Buda by ruse.\n\nWhile some of the Jews of Hungary were deported to [[Anatolia]], others, who had fled at the approach of the [[sultan]], sought refuge beyond the frontier or in the [[free royal town]]s of western Hungary. The widow of Louis II, the queen regent Maria, favored the enemies of the Jews. The citizens of [[Sopron]] (\u00d6denburg) began hostilities by expelling the Jews of that city, confiscating their property, and pillaging the vacated houses and the [[synagogue]]. The city of Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) also received permission from the queen (October 9, 1526) to expel the Jews living within its territory, because they had expressed their intention of fleeing before the Turks. The Jews left Pressburg on November 9.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nOn that same day the [[diet (assembly)|diet]] at [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] was opened, at which [[J\u00e1nos Szapolyai]] (1526\u20131540) was elected and crowned king in opposition to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]]. During this session it was decreed that the Jews should immediately be expelled from every part of the country. Z\u00e1polya, however, did not ratify these laws; and the Diet held at Pressburg in December 1526, at which Ferdinand of Habsburg was chosen king (1526\u20131564), annulled all the decrees of that of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, including Z\u00e1polya's election as king.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nAs the lord of B\u00f6sing ([[Pezinok]]) was in debt to the Jews, a [[blood libel|blood accusation]] was brought against these inconvenient creditors in 1529. Although Mendel, the prefect, and the Jews throughout Hungary protested, the accused were burned at the stake. For centuries afterward Jews were forbidden to live at B\u00f6sing. The Jews of Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) soon shared a similar fate, being first punished for alleged ritual murder and then expelled from the city (February 19, 1539).<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 495\"/>\n\nThe Jews living in the parts of Hungary occupied by the Ottoman Empire were treated far better than those living under the [[Habsburgs]]. During the periods of 1546-1590 and 1620\u20131680, the community of Ofen ([[Buda]]) flourished.\n\nThe following table shows the number of Jewish [[jizya]]-tax paying heads of household in Buda during the Ottomans rule:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-align=center\n! 1546\n! 1559\n! 1562\n! 1590\n! 1627\n! 1633\n! 1660\n|-align=center\n| 50\n| 44\n| 49\n| 109\n| 11\n| 20\n| 80\n|}\n\nAt the end of the Ottoman era, the approximately one thousand Jews living in Buda worshipped in three synagogues: an Ashkenazi, a Sephardi and a Syrian one.\n\nWhile the Ottomans held sway in Hungary, the Jews of [[Transylvania]] (at that time an independent principality) also fared well. At the instance of [[Abraham Sassa]], a Jewish physician of [[Constantinople]], Prince [[Gabriel Bethlen]] of Transylvania granted a letter of privileges (June 18, 1623) to the [[Spain|Spanish]] Jews from Anatolia.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=496}}.</ref> But the community of Judaizing [[Szekler Sabbatarians]], which had existed in Transylvania since 1588, was persecuted and driven underground in 1638.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fogelman |first=Shay |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/discovering-europe-s-non-jews-who-kept-the-faith-1.387208 |title=From the second half of the 19th century the surviving Szekler Sabbatarians intermarried with Jews |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2011-09-28 |accessdate=2013-02-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210221216/http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/discovering-europe-s-non-jews-who-kept-the-faith-1.387208 |archive-date=2013-02-10 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 1572, King [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] (1563\u20131576) intended to expel the Jews of Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), stating that his edict would be recalled only in case they accepted [[Christianity]]. The Jews, however, remained in the city, without abandoning their religion. They were in constant conflict with the citizens. On June 1, 1582 the [[municipal]] council decreed that no one should harbor Jews, or even transact business with them. The feeling against the Jews in that part of the country not under Turkish rule is shown by the decree of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of 1578, to the effect that Jews were to be taxed double the amount which was imposed upon other citizens.<ref name=\"The Jewish Encyclopedia \u2026\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=496}}.</ref>\n\nBy article XV of the law promulgated by the Diet of 1630, Jews were forbidden to take charge of the [[customs]]; and this [[decree]] was confirmed by the Diet of 1646 on the ground that the Jews were excluded from the privileges of the country, that they were unbelievers, and had no conscience (''veluti jurium regni incapaces, infideles, et nulla conscientia praediti'').<ref name=\"The Jewish Encyclopedia \u2026\"/> The Jews had to pay a special war-tax when the imperial troops set out toward the end of the 16th century to recapture Buda from the Ottomans. The [[Buda]] community suffered much during this siege, as did also that of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r when the imperial troops took that city in September 1601; many of its members were either slain or taken prisoner and sold into slavery, their redemption being subsequently effected by the German, Italian, and Ottoman Jews. After the conclusion of peace, which the Jews helped to bring about, the communities were in part reconstructed; but further development in the territory of the Habsburgs was arrested when [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] (1657\u20131705) expelled the Jews (April 24, 1671). He, however, revoked his decree a few months later (August 20). During the siege of [[Vienna]], in 1683, the Jews that had returned to that city were again maltreated. The Ottomans plundered some communities in western Hungary, and deported the members as slaves.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\n== Habsburg rule ==\n=== Further persecution and expulsions (1686\u20131740) ===\nThe imperial troops recaptured [[Buda]] on September 2, 1686, most Jewish residents were massacred, some captured and later released for ransom. In the following years the whole of Hungary now came under the rule of the [[House of Habsburg]]. As the devastated country had to be repopulated, Bishop Count [[Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch]], subsequently Archbishop of [[Esztergom]] and [[primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Hungary, advised the king to give the preference to the German Catholics in order that the country might in time become German and Catholic. He held that the Jews could not be exterminated at once, but they must be weeded out by degrees, as bad coin is gradually withdrawn from circulation. The decree passed by the Diet of Pressburg (1687\u20131688), imposing double taxation upon the Jews. Jews were not be permitted to engage in [[agriculture]], nor to own any [[real estate]], nor to keep Christian servants.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\nThis advice soon bore fruit and was in part acted upon. In August 1690, the government at [[Vienna]] ordered [[Sopron]] to expel its Jews, who had immigrated from the Austrian provinces. The government, desiring to enforce the edict of the last Diet, decreed soon afterward that Jews should be removed from the office of collector. The order proved ineffective, however; and the employment of Jewish customs officials was continued. Even the treasurer of the realm set the example in transgressing the law by appointing (1692) [[Simon Hirsch]] as [[customs farmer]] at Leopoldstadt ([[Leopoldov]]); and at Hirsch's death he transferred the office to Hirsch's son-in-law.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\nThe revolt of the [[Kuruc]], under [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]], caused much suffering to Hungary's Jews. The [[Kuruc]] imprisoned and slew the Jews, who had incurred their anger by siding with the king's party. The Jews of [[Eisenstadt]], accompanied by those of the community of [[Mattersburg|Mattersdorf]], sought refuge at Vienna, [[Wiener-Neustadt]], and [[Forchtenstein]]; those of Holics ([[Hol\u00ed\u010d]]) and Sasv\u00e1r ([[\u0160a\u0161t\u00edn-Str\u00e1\u017ee|\u0160a\u0161t\u00edn]]) dispersed to G\u00f6ding ([[Hodon\u00edn]]); while others, who could not leave their business in this time of distress, sent their families to safe places, and themselves braved the danger. While not many Jews lost their lives during this revolt, it made great havoc in their wealth, especially in [[Sopron (county)|Sopron County]], where a number of rich Jews were living. The king granted letters of protection to those that had been ruined by the revolt, and demanded satisfaction for those that had been injured; but in return for these favors he commanded the Jews to furnish the sums necessary for suppressing the revolt.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\nAfter the restoration of peace the Jews were expelled from many cities that feared their competition; thus [[Esztergom]] expelled them in 1712, on the ground that the city which had given birth to [[St. Stephen]] must not be desecrated by them. But the Jews living in the country, on the estates of their landlords, were generally left alone.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 496\"/>\n\nThe lot of the Jews was not improved under the reign of Leopold's son, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles III]] (1711\u20131740). He informed the government (June 28, 1725) that he intended to decrease the number of Jews in his domains, and the government thereupon directed the counties to furnish statistics of the [[Jew|Hebrew]] inhabitants. In 1726 the king decreed that in the Austrian provinces, from the day of publication of the decree, only one male member in each Jewish family be allowed to marry. This decree, restricting the natural increase of the Jews, materially affected the Jewish communities of Hungary. All the Jews in the Austrian provinces who could not marry there went to Hungary to found families; thus the overflow of Austrian Jews peopled Hungary. These immigrants settled chiefly in the northwestern counties, in Nyitra ([[Nitra]]), Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), and Trencs\u00e9n ([[Tren\u010d\u00edn]]).{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=496\u2013497}}\n\nThe [[Moravia]]n Jews continued to live in Hungary as Moravian subjects; even those that went there for the purpose of marrying and settling promised on oath before leaving that they would pay the same taxes as those living in Moravia. In 1734 the Jews of Trencs\u00e9n bound themselves by a secret oath that in all their communal affairs they would submit to the Jewish court at Ungarisch-Brod ([[Uhersk\u00fd Brod]]) only. In the course of time the immigrants refused to pay taxes to the Austrian provinces. The Moravian Jews, who had suffered by the heavy emigration, then brought complaint; and [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered that all Jewish and Christian subjects that had emigrated after 1740 should be [[extradited]], while those who had emigrated before that date were to be released from their Moravian allegiance.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=497}}.</ref>\n\nThe government could not, however, check the large immigration; for although strict laws were drafted in 1727, they could not be enforced owing to the good-will of the magnates toward the Jews. The counties either did not answer at all, or sent reports bespeaking mercy rather than persecution.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the king endeavored to free the [[mining]]-towns from the Jews \u2013 a work which Leopold I had already begun in 1693. The Jews, however, continued to settle near these towns; they displayed their wares at the fairs; and, with the permission of the court, they even erected a foundry at S\u00e1g ([[Sasinkovo]]). When King Charles ordered them to leave (March 1727), the royal mandate was in some places ignored; in others the Jews obeyed so slowly that he had to repeat his edict three months later.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\"/>\n\n=== Maria Theresa (1740\u20131780) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nIn 1735, another [[census]] of the Jews of the country was taken with the view of reducing their numbers. There were at that time 11,621 Jews living in Hungary, of which 2,474 were male heads of families, and fifty-seven were female heads. Of these heads of families 35.31 per cent declared themselves to be Hungarians; the rest had immigrated. Of the immigrants 38.35 per cent came from Moravia, 11.05 per cent from Poland, and 3.07 per cent from [[Bohemia]]. The largest Jewish community, numbering 770 persons, was that of Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]). Most of the Jews were engaged in [[commerce]] or [[industry|industries]], most being [[merchants]], traders, or shopkeepers; only a few pursued agriculture.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\"/>\n\nDuring the reign of Queen [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] (1740\u20131780), daughter of Charles III, the Jews were expelled from [[Buda]] (1746), and the \"[[Toleration tax|toleration-tax]]\" was imposed upon the Hungarian Jews. On September 1, 1749, the delegates of the Hungarian Jews, except those from [[Szatm\u00e1r]] County, assembled at Pressburg and met a royal commission, which informed them that they would be expelled from the country if they did not pay this tax. The frightened Jews at once agreed to do so; and the commission then demanded a yearly tax of 50,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]. This sum being excessive, the delegates protested; and although the queen had fixed 30,000 gulden as the minimum tax, they were finally able to compromise on the payment of 20,000 gulden a year for a period of eight years. The delegates were to apportion this amount among the districts; the districts, their respective sums among the communities; and the communities, theirs among the individual members.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 497\"/>\n\nThe queen confirmed this agreement of the commission, except the eight-year clause, changing the period to three years, which she subsequently made five. The agreement, thus ratified by the queen, was brought on November 26 before the courts, which were powerless to relieve the Jews from the payment of this ''Malkegeld'' (queen's money), as they called it.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=497\u2013498}}\n\nThe Jews, thus burdened by new taxes, thought the time ripe for taking steps to remove their oppressive [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]]. While still at Presburg the delegates had brought their grievances before the mixed commission that was called ''delegata in puncto tolerantialis taxae et gravaminum Judeorum commissio mixta''. These complaints pictured the distress of the Jews of that time. They were not allowed to live in [[Croatia]] and [[Slavonia]], in [[Baranya (county)|Baranya]] and [[Heves County (former)|Heves]] Counties, or in several free royal towns and localities; nor might they visit the markets there. At Stuhlweissenburg ([[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]) they had to pay a poll-tax of 1 gulden, 30 [[kreuzer]] if they entered the city during the day, if only for an hour. In many places they might not even stay overnight. They therefore begged permission to settle, or at least to visit the fairs, in Croatia and Slavonia and in those places from which they had been driven in consequence of the jealousy of the [[Greeks]] and the merchants.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=498}}.</ref>\n\nThe Jews also had to pay heavier bridge-and ferry-tolls than the Christians; at Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) they had to pay three times the ordinary sum, namely, for the driver, for the vehicle, and for the animal drawing the same; and in three villages belonging to the same district they had to pay [[Toll road|toll]], although there was no toll-gate. Jews living on the estates of the nobles had to give their wives and children as [[Security interest#Pledge|pledge]]s for [[arrears]] of taxes. In Upper Hungary they asked for the revocation of the toleration-tax imposed by the chamber of Zips County ([[Szepes]], [[Spi\u0161]]), on the ground that otherwise the Jews living there would have to pay two such taxes; and they asked also to be relieved from a similar tax paid to the Diet. Finally, they requested that Jewish [[artisan]]s might be allowed to follow their trades in their homes undisturbed.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nThe commission laid these complaints before the Queen, indicating the manner in which they could be relieved; and their suggestions were subsequently willed by the queen and made into law. The queen relieved the Jews from the tax of toleration in Upper Hungary only. In regard to the other complaints she ordered that the Jews should specify them in detail, and that the government should remedy them insofar as they came under its jurisdiction.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nThe toleration-tax had hardly been instituted when [[Michael Hirsch]] petitioned the government to be appointed primate of the Hungarian Jews in order to be able to settle difficulties that might arise among them, and to collect the tax. The government did not recommend Hirsch, but decided that in case the Jews should refuse to pay, it might be advisable to appoint a primate to adjust the matter.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nBefore the end of the period of five years the delegates of the Jews again met the commission at Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]) and offered to increase the amount of their tax to 25,000 gulden a year if the queen would promise that it should remain at that sum for the next ten years. The queen had other plans, however; not only did she dismiss the renewed ''gravamina'' of the Jews, but rather imposed stiffer regulations upon them. Their tax of 20,000 gulden was increased to 30,000 gulden in 1760; to 50,000 in 1772; to 80,000 in 1778; and to 160,000 in 1813.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\n=== Joseph II (1780\u20131790) ===\n[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (1780\u20131790), son and successor of Maria Theresa, showed immediately on his accession that he intended to alleviate the condition of the Jews, communicating this intention to the Hungarian chancellor, Count Franz [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|Esterh\u00e1zy]] as early as May 13, 1781. In consequence the Hungarian government issued (March 31, 1783) a decree known as the ''Systematica gentis Judaicae regulatio'', which wiped out at one stroke the decrees that had oppressed the Jews for centuries. The royal free towns, except the mining-towns, were opened to the Jews, who were allowed to settle at leisure throughout the country. The ''regulatio'' decreed that the legal documents of the Jews should no longer be composed in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], or in [[Yiddish]], but in [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the languages used in the country at the time, and which the young Jews were required to learn within two years.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nDocuments written in Hebrew or in Yiddish were not legal; Hebrew books were to be used at worship only; the Jews were to organize [[elementary school]]s; the commands of the emperor, issued in the interests of the Jews, were to be announced in the [[synagogue]]s; and the rabbis were to explain to the people the salutary effects of these decrees. The subjects to be taught in the Jewish schools were to be the same as those taught in the national schools; the same text-books were to be used in all the elementary schools; and everything that might offend the religious sentiment of non-conformists was to be omitted.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\n[[File:Josef II medal.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A medal minted during the reign of Josef II, commemorating his grant of religious liberty to Jews and [[Protestants]].]]\nDuring the early years Christian teachers were to be employed in the Jewish schools, but they were to have nothing to do with the religious affairs of such institutions. After the lapse of ten years a Jew might establish a business, or engage in trade, only if he could prove that he had attended a school. The usual school-inspectors were to supervise the Jewish schools and to report to the government. The Jews were to create a fund for organizing and maintaining their schools. Jewish youth might enter the academies, and might study any subject at the universities except [[theology]]. Jews might rent farms only if they could cultivate the same without the aid of Christians.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nJews were allowed to [[peddler|peddle]] and to engage in various [[industry|industrial]] occupations, and to be admitted into the [[guild]]s. They were also permitted to engrave [[seal (device)|seal]]s, and to sell [[gunpowder]] and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]]; but their exclusion from the mining-towns remained in force. Christian masters were allowed to have Jewish [[apprentice]]s. All distinctive marks hitherto worn by the Jews were to be abolished, and they might even carry swords. On the other hand, they were required to discard the distinctive marks prescribed by their religion and to shave their beards. Emperor Joseph regarded this decree so seriously that he allowed no one to violate it.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 498\"/>\n\nThe Jews, in a petition dated April 22, 1783, expressed their gratitude to the emperor for his favors, and, reminding him of his principle that religion should not be interfered with, asked permission to wear beards. The emperor granted the prayer of the petitioners, but reaffirmed the other parts of the decree (April 24, 1783). The Jews organized schools in various places, at Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), [[\u00d3buda]], V\u00e1g\u00fajhely ([[Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom]]), and Nagyv\u00e1rad ([[Oradea]]). A decree was issued by the emperor (July 23, 1787) to the effect that every Jew should choose a German surname; and a further edict (1789) ordered, to the consternation of the Jews, that they should henceforth perform [[Conscription|military service]].{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=498\u2013499}}\n\nAfter the death of Joseph II the royal free cities showed a very hostile attitude toward the Jews. The citizens of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] petitioned the municipal council that after May 1, 1790, the Jews should no longer be allowed to live in the city. The government interfered; and the Jews were merely forbidden to engage in peddling in the city. Seven days previously a decree of expulsion had been issued at Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]), May 1 being fixed as the date of the Jews' departure. The Jews appealed to the government; and in the following December the city authorities of Nagyszombat were informed that the Diet had confirmed the former rights of the Jews, and that the latter could not be expelled.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=499}}.</ref>\n\n== Toleration and oppression (1790\u20131847) ==\n[[File:Ullmann M\u00f3ric.jpg|thumb|[[M\u00f3ric Ullmann]] (1782\u20131847), Hungarian Jewish banker, trader, founder of the Pesti Magyar Kereskedelmi Bank (Pesti Hungarian Commercial Bank).]]\n[[File:Old neoclassic Synagogue Szeged Hungary.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neoclassical architecture]] was used for this Synagogue in [[Szeged]].]]\nThe Jews of Hungary handed a petition, in which they boldly presented their claims to equality with other citizens, to King [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]] (1790\u20131792) at Vienna on November 29, 1790. He sent it the following day to the chancelleries of Hungary and Moravia for their opinions. The question was brought before the estates of the country on December 2, and the Diet drafted a bill showing that it intended to protect the Jews. This decision created consternation among the enemies of the latter. Nagyszombat ([[Trnava]]) addressed a further memorandum to the estates (December 4) in which it demanded that the Diet should protect the city's privileges. The Diet decided in favor of the Jews, and its decision was laid before the king.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\"/>\n\nThe Jews, confidently anticipating the king's decision in their favor, organized a splendid celebration on November 15, 1790, the day of his [[coronation]]; on January 10, 1791, the king approved the bill of the Diet; and the following law, drafted in conformity with the royal decision, was read by Judge [[Stephen Atzel]] in the session of February 5:\n[[File:Jewish cemetery tombs Timisoara Romania.jpg|thumb|The Jewish Cemetery in the city of [[Timisoara]], now part of Romania.]]\n\"In order that the condition of the Jews may be regulated pending such time as may elapse until their affairs and the privileges of various royal free towns relating to them shall have been determined by a commission to report to the next ensuing Diet, when his Majesty and the estates will decide on the condition of the Jews, the estates have determined, with the approval of his Majesty, that the Jews within the boundaries of Hungary and the countries belonging to it shall, in all the royal free cities and in other localities (except the royal mining-towns), remain under the same conditions in which they were on Jan. 1, 1790; and in case they have been expelled anywhere, they shall be recalled.\"<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\"/>\n\nThus came into force the famous law entitled ''De Judaeis'', which forms the thirty-eighth article of the laws of the Diet of 1790\u20131791. The ''De Judaeis'' law was gratefully received by the Jews; for it not only afforded them protection, but also gave them the assurance that their affairs would soon be regulated. Still, although the Diet appointed on February 7, 1791, a commission to study the question, the amelioration of the condition of the Hungarian Jews was not effected till half a century later, under [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand V]] (r. 1835\u20131848), during the session of the Diet of 1839\u20131840.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\"/> It is estimated that the Jewish population in Hungary grew by about 80% between 1815-1840,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jews of Hungary |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/hungary |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |access-date=2018-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729111919/https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/hungary |archive-date=2018-07-29 |url-status=live |df= }}</ref> bolstered by immigration due to the perception of royal tolerance.\n\nIn consequence of the petition of the Jews of Pest, the mover of which was [[Philip Jacobovics]], superintendent of the Jewish hospital, the general assembly of the county of Pest drafted instructions for the delegates on June 10, 1839, to the effect that if the Jews would be willing to adopt the [[Hungarian language|Magyar]] language they should be given equal rights with other Hungarian citizens.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 499\"/> From now on much attention was paid to the teaching of Hungarian in the schools; [[Moritz Bloch]] (Ballagi) translated the [[Pentateuch]] into Hungarian, and [[Moritz Rosenthal]] the [[Psalms]] and the ''[[Pirkei Avoth]]''. Various communities founded Hungarian reading-circles; and the Hungarian dress and language were more and more adopted. Many communities began to use Hungarian on their seals and in their documents, and some liberal rabbis even began to preach in that language.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=500}}.</ref>\n\nAt the sessions of the Diet subsequent to that of 1839\u20131840, as well as in various cities, a decided antipathy\u2014at times active and at times merely passive\u2014toward the Jews became manifest. In sharp contrast to this attitude was that of Baron [[J\u00f3zsef E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], who published in 1840 in the ''Budapesti Szemle'', the most prominent Hungarian review, a strong appeal for the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] of the Jews. This cause also found a friend in Count Charles Zay, the chief ecclesiastical inspector of the Hungarian [[Lutherans]], who warmly advocated Jewish interests in 1846.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\"/>\n\nAlthough the session of the Diet convened on November 7, 1847, was unfavorable to the Jews, the latter not only continued to cultivate the Hungarian language, but were also willing to sacrifice their lives and property in the hour of danger. During the [[Revolution of 1848]] they displayed their patriotism, even though attacked by the populace in several places at the beginning of the uprising. On March 19 the populace of Pressburg ([[Bratislava]]), encouraged by the antipathies of the citizens\u2014who were aroused by the fact that the Jews, leaving their [[ghetto]] around Pressburg Castle ([[Bratislava Castle]]), were settling in the city itself\u2014began hostilities that were continued after some days, and were renewed more fiercely in April.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\"/>\n\nAt this time the expulsion of the Jews from [[Sopron]], [[P\u00e9cs]], [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], and [[Szombathely]] was demanded; in the last two cities there were [[pogroms]]. At Szombathely, the mob advanced upon the synagogue, cut up the [[Torah]] scrolls, and threw them into a well. Nor did the Jews of Pest escape, while those at V\u00e1g\u00fajhely ([[Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom]]) especially suffered from the brutality of the mob. Bitter words against the Jews were also heard in the Diet. Some Jews advised [[History of the Jews in the United States#Jewish immigration|emigration to America]] as a means of escape; and a society was founded at Pest, with a branch at Pressburg, for that purpose. A few left Hungary, seeking a new home across the sea, but the majority remained.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\"/>\n\n== Revolution and emancipation (1848\u20131849) ==\n===Jews and the Hungarian Revolution=== <!-- polite note: Redirect [[Hungarian Jews in the Revolution]] links here -->\nJews entered the national guard as early as March 1848; although they were excluded from certain cities, they reentered as soon as the danger to the country seemed greater than the hatred of the citizens. At [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] the Jewish national guard formed a separate division. When the national guards of [[P\u00e1pa]] were mobilized against the [[Croatians]], [[Leopold L\u00f6w]], rabbi of P\u00e1pa, joined the Hungarian ranks, inspiring his companions by his words of encouragement. Jews were also to be found in the volunteer corps, and among the ''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|honv\u00e9d]]'' and ''[[landsturm]]''; and they constituted one-third of the volunteer division of Pest that marched along the [[Drava]] against the Croatians, being blessed by Rabbi Schwab on June 22, 1848.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 500\"/>\n\nMany Jews throughout the country joined the army to fight for their fatherland; among them, [[Adolf H\u00fcbsch]], subsequently rabbi at [[New York City]]; [[Solomon Marcus Schiller-Szinessy]], afterward lecturer at the [[University of Cambridge]]; and [[Ignatz Einhorn]], who, under the name of \"Eduard Horn,\" subsequently became state secretary of the [[Hungarian Ministry of Commerce]]. The rebellious [[Serbs|Serbians]] slew the Jews at [[Senta|Zenta]] who sympathized with Hungary; among them, Rabbi [[Israel Ullmann]] and [[Jacob M\u00fcnz]], son of [[Moses M\u00fcnz]] of [[\u00d3buda]] The conduct of the Jewish soldiers in the Hungarian army was highly commended by Generals [[Gy\u00f6rgy Klapka|Klapka]] and [[G\u00f6rgey]]. Einhorn estimated the number of Jewish soldiers who took part in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolution]] to be 20,000; but this is most likely exaggerated, as [[B\u00e9la Bernstein]] enumerates only 755 combatants by name in his work, ''Az 1848-49-iki Magyar Szabads\u00e1gharcz \u00e9s a Zsid\u00f3k'' (Budapest, 1898).{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=500\u2013501}}\n\nThe Hungarian Jews served their country not only with the sword, but also with funds. Communities and individuals, [[Chevra Kadisha]], and other Jewish societies, freely contributed silver and gold, armor and provisions, clothed and fed the soldiers, and furnished lint and other medical supplies to the Hungarian camps. Meanwhile, they did not forget to take steps to obtain their rights as citizens. When the Diet of 1847\u20131848 (in which, according to ancient law, only the [[nobles]] and those having the rights of nobles might take part) was dissolved (April 11), and the new Parliament \u2014 at which under the new laws the delegates elected by the commons also appeared \u2014 was convened at Pest (July 2, 1848), the Jews hopefully looked forward to the deliberations of the new body.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 501\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=501}}.</ref>\n\n===Brief emancipation and aftermath, 1849===\nMany Jews thought to pave the way for emancipation by a radical reform of their religious life. They thought this might ease their way, as legislators in the Diets and articles printed in the press suggested that the Jews should not receive equal civic rights until they reformed their religious practices. This reform had been first demanded in the session of 1839\u20131840. From this session onward, the press and general assemblies pushed for religious reform. Several counties instructed their representatives not to vote for the emancipation of the Jews until they desisted from practising the externals of their religion.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 501\"/>\n\nFor the purpose of urging [[Jewish emancipation]], all the Jews of Hungary sent delegates to a conference at Pest on July 5, 1848. It chose a commission of ten members to lobby with the Diet for emancipation. The commission delegates were instructed not to make any concessions related to practicing the Jewish faith. The commission soon after addressed a petition to the Parliament for emancipation, but it proved ineffective.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 501\"/>\n\nThe national assembly at [[Szeged]] granted emancipation of Jews on Saturday, the eve of the [[Ninth of Av]] (July 28, 1849). The bill, which was quickly debated and immediately became a law, fulfilled the hopes of the Reform party. The Jews obtained full citizenship. The Ministry of the Interior was ordered to call a convention of Jewish [[minister of religion|ministers]] and [[laymen]] for the purpose of drafting a [[confession of faith]], and of inducing the Jews to organize their religious life in conformity with the demands of the time, for instance, business hours on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. The bill included the clause referring to marriages between Jews and Christians, which clause both [[Lajos Kossuth]] and the Reform party advocated.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 501\"/>\n\nThe Jews' civic liberty lasted for just two weeks. After the Hungarian army's [[surrender at Vil\u00e1gos]] to [[Russia]]n troops, which had come to aid the Austrians in suppressing the Hungarian struggle for liberty, the Jews were severely punished by new authorities for having taken part in the uprising. Field Marshal [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], the new governor of Hungary, imposed heavy war-taxes upon them, especially upon the communities of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[\u00d3buda]], which had already been heavily taxed by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]], commander-in-chief of the Austrian army, on his triumphant entry into the Hungarian capital at the beginning of 1849. Haynau punished the communities of [[Kecskem\u00e9t]], [[Nagyk\u0151r\u00f6s]], [[Cegl\u00e9d]], [[Albertirsa]], Szeged, and Szabadka (now [[Subotica]], Serbia) with equal severity. Numerous Jews were imprisoned and executed; others sought refuge in [[emigration]].{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|pp=501\u2013502}}\n\nSeveral communities petitioned to be relieved of the war taxes. The ministry of war, however, increased the hurden, requiring that the communities of Pest, \u00d3buda, Kecskem\u00e9t, Czegl\u00e9d, Nagyk\u0151r\u00f6s, and Irsa should pay this tax not in kind, but in currency to the amount of 2,300,000 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|gulden]]. As the communities were unable to collect such monies, they petitioned the government to remit it. The Jewish communities of the entire country were ordered to share in raising the sum, on the grounds that most of the Jews of Hungary had supported the Revolution. Only the communities of Temesv\u00e1r (now [[Timi\u015foara]], Romania) and Pressburg (now [[Bratislava]], Slovakia) were exempted from this order, as they remained loyal to the existing Austrian government. The military commission added a clause to tax requirements, to the effect that individuals or communities might be exempted from the punishment, if they could prove by documents or witnesses, before a commission to be appointed, that they had not taken part in the Revolution, either by word or deed, morally or materially. The Jews refused this means of clearing themselves. They declared to be willing to redeem the tax by collecting a certain sum for a national school fund. Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] remitted the war-tax (September 20, 1850), but ordered that the Jews of Hungary without distinction should contribute toward a Jewish school fund of 1,000,000 gulden; they raised this sum within a few years.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=502}}\n\n== Struggles for a second emancipation (1859\u20131867) ==\n[[File:Falk Miksa.JPG|thumb|Prominent newspaper editor and journalist [[Miksa Falk|Miksa (Maxmilian) Falk]] returned to Hungary from Vienna following the emancipation in 1867.

When the Austrian troops were defeated in [[Italy]] in 1859, activists pressed for liberty. In that year the cabinet, with Emperor Franz Joseph in the chair, decreed that the status of the Jews should be regulated in agreement with the times, but with due regard for the conditions obtaining in the several localities and provinces. When the emperor convened the Diet on April 2, 1861, Jews pushed for emancipation but the early dissolution of that body prevented it from taking action in the matter.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 502\">{{harvnb|B\u00fcchler|1904|p=502}}.</ref>\n\nThe decade of absolutism in Hungary (1849\u20131859) resulted in Jews establishing schools, most of which were in charge of trained teachers. Based on the Jewish school fund, the government organized model schools at [[S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely]], Temesv\u00e1r ([[Timi\u015foara]]), [[P\u00e9cs]], and [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. In Pest the [[Israelite State Teachers' Seminary]] was founded in 1859, the principals of which have included [[Abraham Lederer]], [[Heinrich Deutsch]], and [[J\u00f3zsef B\u00e1n\u00f3czi]].<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 502\"/>\n\nWhen the Parliament dissolved in 1861, the emancipation of the Jews was deferred to the coronation of Franz Joseph. On December 22, 1867, the question came before the lower house, and on the favorable report of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] and [[Zsigmond Bern\u00e1th]], a bill in favor of emancipation was adopted; it was passed by the upper house on the following day.<ref name=\"Singer, 1906, p. 502\"/> Although the Antisemitic Party was represented in the Parliament, it was not taken seriously by the political elite of the country. Its agitation against Jews was not successful (see [[Tiszaeszl\u00e1r affair]]).\n\nOn October 4, 1877, the [[Budapest University of Jewish Studies]] opened in [[Budapest]]. The university is still operating, celebrating its 130th anniversary on October 4, 2007. Since its opening, it has been the only Jewish institute in all of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]].\n\nIn the 1890 Hungarian census, 64.0% of the Jewish population were counted as ethnic Hungarian by mother tongue, 33.1% as German (these were chiefly Yiddish speakers),<ref>http://www.bibl.u-szeged.hu/porta/szint/tarsad/szocio/studia/studia.htm</ref> 1.9% as Slovak, 0.8% as Romanian, and 0.2% as Ruthenian.\n\n== Austria-Hungary (1867\u20131918) ==\n[[File:02 Pecs, Hungary - Great Synagogue.jpg|thumb|Romantic style Great Synagogue in P\u00e9cs, built by [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] community in 1869.]]\n[[File:Szeged synagogue SF.jpg|thumb|[[Szeged Synagogue]]]]\n\n=== Family names ===\nMost Jews did not have family names before 1783.

Beginning in 1783, he ordered Jews to either choose or be given German family names by local committees. The actions were dependent on local conditions.\n\nWith the rise of Hungarian nationalism, the first wave of Magyarization of family names occurred between 1840 and 1849. After the Hungarian revolution, this process was stopped until 1867. After the [[Ausgleich]], many Jews changed their family names from German to Hungarian.\n\nIn 1942 during World War II, when Hungary became allied with Germany, the Hungarian Defense Ministry was tasked with \"race validation.\" Its officials complained that no Hungarian or German names were \"safe,\" as Jews might have any name. They deemed Slavic names to be \"safer\", but the decree listed 58 Slavic-sounding names regularly held by Jews.<ref>Decree to quicken the process of race validation, May 16, 1942 \u2013 quoted in ''Fegyvertelen \u00e1lltak az aknamez\u0151k\u00f6n'', 1962, edited by Elek Karsai, volume 2, p. 8</ref>\n\n=== Population statistics ===\n==== 1890 / 1900 / 1910 census summaries ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! 1890\n! 1900\n! 1910\n|-\n| Total population of Hungary, without Croatia\n| 15,162,988\n| 16,838,255\n| 18,264,533\n|-\n| Emigration to the US in the previous decade, '00-'09\n| 164,119\n| 261,444\n| 1,162,271\n|-\n| Jewish population, again without Croatia\n| 707,961\n| 831,162\n| 911,227\n|-\n| Increase of the total population in the previous decade\n| 10.28%\n| 11.05%\n| 8.47%\n|-\n| (Emigration to the US in the previous decade, '00-'09) / population at previous census\n| 1.19%\n| 1.72%\n| 6.90%\n|-\n| Increase of the Jewish population in the previous decade\n| 13.31%\n| 17.40%\n| 9.62%\n|-\n| Jewish/Total\n| 4.67%\n| 4.94%\n| 4.99%\n|}\n\nAlmost a quarter (22.35%) of the Jews of Hungary lived in Budapest in 1910.

This was a 28.7% increase in absolute terms since the 1890 census, and a 0.3% increase (from 4.7%) in the overall population of Hungary. At the time, the Jewish natural growth rate was higher than the Christian (although the difference had been narrowing), but so was the emigration rate, mainly to the United States.

This minority had managed to achieve great commercial success, and Jews were disproportionately represented in the professions, relative to their numbers. In 1921 [[Budapest]], 88% of the members of the stock exchange and 91% of the currency brokers were Jews, many of them ennobled.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} In interwar Hungary, more than half and perhaps as much as 90 percent of Hungarian industry was owned or operated by a few closely related Jewish banking families.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Jewish Hungarian country girl in 1928.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Jewish Hungarian country girl around 1930.]]\n[[File:In front of the Gr\u00fcnbaum grocery shop.jpg|thumb|Local customers in front of a Jewish grocery in [[Berzence]], around 1930.]]\n\nJews represented one-fourth of all university students and 43% percent at [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest Technological University]]. In 1920, 60 percent of Hungarian doctors, 51 percent of lawyers, 39 percent of all privately employed engineers and chemists, 34 percent of editors and journalists, and 29 percent of musicians identified themselves as Jews by religion.<ref>All these figures are from [[Yuri Slezkine|Slezkine, Yuri]]. ''The Jewish Century.'' Princeton, 2004. {{ISBN|0-691-11995-3}}</ref>\n\nResentment of this Jewish trend of success was widespread: Admiral Horthy himself declared that he was \"an anti-Semite\", and remarked in a letter to one of his prime ministers, \"I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theater, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad.\"{{sfn|Patai|1996|p=546}}\n\nUnfortunately for Jews they had also become, by a quirk of history, the most visible minority remaining in Hungary (besides ethnic Germans and Gypsies); the other large \"non-Hungarian\" populations (including Slovaks, Slovenes, Croats, and Romanians, among others) had been abruptly excised from the Hungarian population by the territorial losses at Trianon. That and the highly visible role of Jews in the economy, the media and the professions, as well as in the leadership of the 1919 Communist dictatorship left Hungary's Jews as an ethnically separate group which could serve as a scapegoat for the nation's ills.<ref name=\"Mason, John W 2000\"/> The scapegoating began quickly. In 1920, Horthy's government passed a \"Numerus Clausus\" law that placed limits on the number of minority students in proportion of their size of the population, thus restricting the Jewish enrollment at universities to five percent or less.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAnti-Jewish policies grew more repressive in the interwar period as Hungary's leaders, who remained committed to regaining territories lost in WW1, chose to align themselves (albeit warily) with the fascist governments of Germany and Italy \u2013 the international actors most likely to stand behind Hungary's claims.<ref name=\"Mason, John W 2000\"/> The inter-war years also saw the emergence of flourishing fascist groups, such as the [[Hungarian National Socialist Party]] and the [[Arrow Cross Party]].\n\n== Anti-Jewish measures ==\n=== Anti-Jewish Laws (1938\u20131941) ===\nStarting in 1938, Hungary under [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] passed a series of anti-Jewish measures in emulation of Germany's [[Nuremberg Laws]].\n\n# The \"'''First Jewish Law'''\" (May 29, 1938) restricted the number of Jews in each commercial enterprise, in the press, among physicians, engineers and lawyers to twenty percent.\n# The \"'''Second Jewish Law'''\" (May 5, 1939), for the first time, defined Jews racially: individuals with two, three or four Jewish-born grandparents were declared Jewish.\n# The \"'''Third Jewish Law'''\" (August 8, 1941) prohibited intermarriage and penalized sexual intercourse between Jews and non-Jews.\n\nTheir employment in government at any level was forbidden, they could not be editors at newspapers, their numbers were restricted to six per cent among theater and movie actors, physicians, lawyers and engineers. Private companies were forbidden to employ more than 12% Jews. 250,000 Hungarian Jews lost their income. Most of them lost their right to vote as well: before the second Jewish law, about 31% of the Jewish population of Borsod county (Miskolc excluded), 2496 people had this right. At the next elections, less than a month after this new anti-Jewish legislation, only 38 privileged Jews could vote.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Braham |editor1-first=Randolph L. |year=2007 |title=A Magyarorsz\u00e1gi Holokauszt F\u00f6ldrajzi Enciklopedi\u00e1ja |trans-title=The Geographic Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary |location=Budapest |publisher=Park Publishing |volume=1 |isbn=9789635307388 }}</ref>\n\nIn the elections of May 28\u201329, Nazi and Arrow Cross (Nyilas) parties received one quarter of the votes and 52 out of 262 seats.

It was not formally recognised by the Soviets at that time, but the Georgian government eventually managed to obtain ''[[de facto]]'' recognition from the [[White movement|White leaders]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. \n\nFollowing an abortive [[1920 Georgian coup attempt|Bolshevik coup]] in [[Tbilisi]],l and a failed attempt by the [[Red Army]] units to penetrate Georgia in early May 1920, [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s government agreed to sign a treaty with Georgia and to recognise its independence ''de jure'' if the Mensheviks formally undertook not to grant shelter on Georgian territory to any force hostile to Soviet Russia. Many Georgian politicians, including Foreign Minister, [[Evgeni Gegechkori]] regarded that clause as an infringement of Georgia's sovereignty and supported the rejection of the Russian terms. However, [[Georgian Prime Minister]] [[Noe Zhordania]] was anxious above all to secure for Georgia international recognition and so agreed to then.\n\nThe treaty was finally signed in Moscow by [[Grigol Uratadze]] for Georgia and [[Lev Karakhan]] for Russia on May 7, 1920.\n\n== Provisions ==\n\nIn the treaty's first two articles, Russia unconditionally recognized the independence of Georgia and renounced all interference in its internal affairs:  \n\n<blockquote>\nArticle I:\n\nProceeding from the right, proclaimed by the RSFSR, of all peoples to free [[self-determination]] up to and including separation from the State of which they constitute a part, Russia unreservedly recognizes the independence and sovereignty of the Georgian State and voluntarily renounces all the sovereign rights which had appertained to Russia with regard to the People and Territory of Georgia.\n\nArticle II:\n\nProceeding from the principles proclaimed in Article I above of the present Treaty, Russia undertakes to refrain from any kind of interference in the affairs of Georgia.<ref>Beichman, A.

Lewis, published 1995 by Brewers Publications, {{ISBN|0-937381-44-6}}</ref> during the [[medieval]] period in Europe, oats were a common ingredient in ale,<ref>Page 49, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref> and proportions up to 35% were standard. Despite some areas of Europe, such as Norway, still clinging to the use of oats in brewing until the early part of the 20th century, the practice had largely died out by the 16th century, so much so that in 1513 [[Tudor period|Tudor]] sailors refused to drink oat beer offered to them because of the bitter flavour.<ref>Page 78, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.lib.hku.hk/az.php|title=Databases|website=Libguides.lib.hku.hk}}</ref>\n\nThere was a revival of interest in using oats during the end of the 19th century, when (supposedly) restorative, nourishing and invalid beers, such as the later milk stout, were popular, because of the association of [[porridge]] with health.<ref>Page 158, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref> Maclay of Alloa produced an Original Oatmalt<!--correct spelling--> Stout in 1895 which used 70% \"oatmalt\", and a 63/- Oatmeal Stout in 1909, which used 30% \"flaked (porridge) oats\".<ref>Pages 59 & 60, ''Old British Beers'', Dr. John Harrison, published 2003 by Durden Park Beer Circle, {{ISBN|0-9517752-1-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D Mendocino Oatmeal Stout beer bottle 8286690116 o.jpg|left |thumb|145px|An oatmeal stout from [[Mendocino Brewing Company]], a modern craft brewery founded in 1983.]]\n\nIn the 20th century many oatmeal stouts contained only a minimal amount of oats. For example, in 1936 Barclay Perkins Oatmeal Stout used only 0.5% oats.<ref>Barclay Perkins brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> As the oatmeal stout was parti-gyled with their porter and standard stout, these two also contained the same proportion of oats. (Parti-gyle brewing involves blending the worts drawn from multiple mashes or sparges after the boil to produces beers of different gravities.) The name seems to have been a marketing device more than anything else. In the 1920s and 1930s Whitbread's London Stout and Oatmeal Stout were identical, just packaged differently. The amount of oats Whitbread used was minimal, again around 0.5%.<ref>Whitbread brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> With such a small quantity of oats used, it could only have had little impact on the flavour or texture of these beers.\n\nMany breweries were still brewing oatmeal stouts in the 1950s, for example Brickwoods in Portsmouth, Matthew Brown in Blackburn and Ushers in Trowbridge.<ref>Whitbread Gravity Book, Whitbread Archive in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> When Michael Jackson mentioned the defunct Eldrige Pope \"Oat Malt Stout\" in his 1977 book ''The World Guide to Beer'', oatmeal stout was no longer being made anywhere, but [[Charles Finkel]], founder of Merchant du Vin, was curious enough to commission [[Samuel Smith Brewery|Samuel Smith]] to produce a version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001674.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter \u2013 Kisses, oats and stouts|website=Beerhunter.com}}</ref> Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout then became the template for other breweries' versions.\n\nOatmeal stouts do not usually taste specifically of oats. The smoothness of oatmeal stouts comes from the high content of proteins, lipids (includes fats and waxes), and gums imparted by the use of oats. The gums increase the viscosity and body adding to the sense of smoothness.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.byo.com/stories/beer-styles/article/indices/11-beer-styles/1194-oatmeal-stout-style |title=Brew Your Own: The How-To Homebrew Beer Magazine \u2013 Beer Styles \u2013 Oatmeal Stout |first=Stephan  |last=Galante |website=Byo.com |date=October 1997 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Oyster stout==\n[[File:Marston's.Oyster.Stout.2012.JPG|right |thumb|165px|[[Marston's Brewery|Marston's]] Oyster Stout]]\n[[Oyster]]s have had a long association with stout.

The term ''stout'' was initially used to indicate a stronger porter than other porters issued by an individual brewery. Though not consistent, this is the usage that was most commonly employed. More recently, \"stout\" tends to be used to describe dry stouts, (containing a small amount of unmalted roast barley), or sweet stouts, (such as milk stouts), whilst \"porter\" describes a beer flavoured with roast malted barley.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/page.aspx?o=180680|title=Porter and Stout \u2013 CAMRA<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Camra.org.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Oatmeal stout==\n[[File:SamuelSmithsOatmealStout.jpg|thumb|165px|An oatmeal stout from [[Samuel Smith Old Brewery|Samuel Smith]], a legacy brewer dating to the 18th century]]\n''Oatmeal stout'' is a stout with a proportion of [[oat]]s, normally a maximum of 30%, added during the brewing process. Even though a larger proportion of oats in beer can lead to a bitter or astringent taste,<ref>Page 50, ''Stout'', Michael J. Lewis, published 1995 by Brewers Publications, {{ISBN|0-937381-44-6}}</ref> during the [[medieval]] period in Europe, oats were a common ingredient in ale,<ref>Page 49, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref> and proportions up to 35% were standard. Despite some areas of Europe, such as Norway, still clinging to the use of oats in brewing until the early part of the 20th century, the practice had largely died out by the 16th century, so much so that in 1513 [[Tudor period|Tudor]] sailors refused to drink oat beer offered to them because of the bitter flavour.<ref>Page 78, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.lib.hku.hk/az.php|title=Databases|website=Libguides.lib.hku.hk}}</ref>\n\nThere was a revival of interest in using oats during the end of the 19th century, when (supposedly) restorative, nourishing and invalid beers, such as the later milk stout, were popular, because of the association of [[porridge]] with health.<ref>Page 158, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref> Maclay of Alloa produced an Original Oatmalt<!--correct spelling--> Stout in 1895 which used 70% \"oatmalt\", and a 63/- Oatmeal Stout in 1909, which used 30% \"flaked (porridge) oats\".<ref>Pages 59 & 60, ''Old British Beers'', Dr. John Harrison, published 2003 by Durden Park Beer Circle, {{ISBN|0-9517752-1-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D Mendocino Oatmeal Stout beer bottle 8286690116 o.jpg|left |thumb|145px|An oatmeal stout from [[Mendocino Brewing Company]], a modern craft brewery founded in 1983.]]\n\nIn the 20th century many oatmeal stouts contained only a minimal amount of oats. For example, in 1936 Barclay Perkins Oatmeal Stout used only 0.5% oats.<ref>Barclay Perkins brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> As the oatmeal stout was parti-gyled with their porter and standard stout, these two also contained the same proportion of oats. (Parti-gyle brewing involves blending the worts drawn from multiple mashes or sparges after the boil to produces beers of different gravities.) The name seems to have been a marketing device more than anything else. In the 1920s and 1930s Whitbread's London Stout and Oatmeal Stout were identical, just packaged differently. The amount of oats Whitbread used was minimal, again around 0.5%.<ref>Whitbread brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> With such a small quantity of oats used, it could only have had little impact on the flavour or texture of these beers.\n\nMany breweries were still brewing oatmeal stouts in the 1950s, for example Brickwoods in Portsmouth, Matthew Brown in Blackburn and Ushers in Trowbridge.<ref>Whitbread Gravity Book, Whitbread Archive in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> When Michael Jackson mentioned the defunct Eldrige Pope \"Oat Malt Stout\" in his 1977 book ''The World Guide to Beer'', oatmeal stout was no longer being made anywhere, but [[Charles Finkel]], founder of Merchant du Vin, was curious enough to commission [[Samuel Smith Brewery|Samuel Smith]] to produce a version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001674.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter \u2013 Kisses, oats and stouts|website=Beerhunter.com}}</ref> Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout then became the template for other breweries' versions.\n\nOatmeal stouts do not usually taste specifically of oats. The smoothness of oatmeal stouts comes from the high content of proteins, lipids (includes fats and waxes), and gums imparted by the use of oats. The gums increase the viscosity and body adding to the sense of smoothness.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.byo.com/stories/beer-styles/article/indices/11-beer-styles/1194-oatmeal-stout-style |title=Brew Your Own: The How-To Homebrew Beer Magazine \u2013 Beer Styles \u2013 Oatmeal Stout |first=Stephan  |last=Galante |website=Byo.com |date=October 1997 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Oyster stout==\n[[File:Marston's.Oyster.Stout.2012.JPG|right |thumb|165px|[[Marston's Brewery|Marston's]] Oyster Stout]]\n[[Oyster]]s have had a long association with stout.
