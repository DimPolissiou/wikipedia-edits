Sixteen former players have been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with [[Yale University|Yale]] is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in their annual [[football (American)|football]] meeting, which dates back to 1875. While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, the \"Father of Football\", [[Walter Camp]] (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the state-of-the-art Harvard Stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>[http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html \"History of American Football\" NEWSdial.com]</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, Pages 127\u2013128</ref>\n\n[[File:Ralph Horween 2.jpg|thumb|[[Ralph Horween]]]]\nIn both 1919 and 1920, headed by [[All-American]] brothers [[Arnold Horween]] and [[Ralph Horween]], Harvard was undefeated (9\u20130\u20131, as they outscored their competition 229\u201319, and 8\u20130\u20131, respectively).<ref name=\"googleusercontent1\">{{cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uoqh_-6plk0J:www.jewsinsports.org/football.asp%3FID%3D73+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a |title=Horween, Ralph |publisher=Jews In Sports @ Virtual Museum |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130317030523/http://www.jewsinsports.org/football.asp?ID=73 |archivedate=March 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m_qtxvDUPbIJ:www.jewsinsports.org/football.asp%3FID%3D72+&cd=6&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a |title=Horween, Arnold |publisher=Jews In Sports @ Virtual Museum |date=March 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130313160633/http://www.jewsinsports.org/football.asp?ID=72 |archivedate=March 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vygvFMFm64C&pg=PT218&dq=marchmont+schwartz+jewish&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bTNNUcW9EqeH0QGHxYCwCg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA |title=The Gipper: George Gipp, Knute Rockne, and the Dramatic Rise of Notre Dame Football |author=Jack Cavanaugh |publisher= Skyhorse Publishing |year=2010|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}</ref>  The team won the 1920 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] against the [[University of Oregon]], 7\u20136.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt0zAQAAIAAJ&q=Ralph+Horween&dq=Ralph+Horween&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eZJKUe3NEtLl4AOq2YGICw&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCg |title=The New York Times Biographical Service |publisher=New York Times & Arno Press |year=1997 |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ralph Goldstein |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/29/sports/ralph-horween-100-the-oldest-ex-nfl-player.html |title=Ralph Horween, 100, the Oldest Ex-N.F.L.

Sixteen former players have been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with [[Yale University|Yale]] is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in their annual [[football (American)|football]] meeting, which dates back to 1875. While Harvard's football team is no longer one of the country's best as it often was a century ago during football's early days (it won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, [[Harvard Stadium]] introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, the \"Father of Football\", [[Walter Camp]] (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the state-of-the-art Harvard Stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the [[forward pass]], perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.<ref>[http://www.newsdial.com/sports/football/football-history.html \"History of American Football\" NEWSdial.com]</ref><ref>Nelson, David M., ''Anatomy of a Game: Football, the Rules, and the Men Who Made the Game'', 1994, Pages 127\u2013128</ref>\n\n[[File:Ralph Horween 2.jpg|thumb|[[Ralph Horween]]]]\nIn both 1919 and 1920, headed by [[All-American]] brothers [[Arnold Horween]] and [[Ralph Horween]], Harvard was undefeated (9\u20130\u20131, as they outscored their competition 229\u201319, and 8\u20130\u20131, respectively).<ref name=\"googleusercontent1\">{{cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uoqh_-6plk0J:www.jewsinsports.org/football.asp%3FID%3D73+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a |title=Horween, Ralph |publisher=Jews In Sports @ Virtual Museum |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130317030523/http://www.jewsinsports.org/football.asp?ID=73 |archivedate=March 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m_qtxvDUPbIJ:www.jewsinsports.org/football.asp%3FID%3D72+&cd=6&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a |title=Horween, Arnold |publisher=Jews In Sports @ Virtual Museum |date=March 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130313160633/http://www.jewsinsports.org/football.asp?ID=72 |archivedate=March 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vygvFMFm64C&pg=PT218&dq=marchmont+schwartz+jewish&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bTNNUcW9EqeH0QGHxYCwCg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA |title=The Gipper: George Gipp, Knute Rockne, and the Dramatic Rise of Notre Dame Football |author=Jack Cavanaugh |publisher= Skyhorse Publishing |year=2010|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}</ref>  The team won the 1920 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] against the [[University of Oregon]], 7\u20136.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt0zAQAAIAAJ&q=Ralph+Horween&dq=Ralph+Horween&hl=en&sa=X&ei=eZJKUe3NEtLl4AOq2YGICw&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCg |title=The New York Times Biographical Service |publisher=New York Times & Arno Press |year=1997 |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Ralph Goldstein |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/29/sports/ralph-horween-100-the-oldest-ex-nfl-player.html |title=Ralph Horween, 100, the Oldest Ex-N.F.L.

The statute amended the country's [[On Protecting Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development|child protection law]] and the [[Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses]], to criminalize the distribution of \"[[propaganda]] of non-traditional [[Intimate relationship|sexual relationships]]\" among minors. This definition includes materials that \"raises interest in\" such relationships, cause minors to \"form non-traditional sexual predispositions\", or \"[present] distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non-traditional sexual relationships.\" Businesses and organizations can also be forced to temporarily cease operations if convicted under the law, and foreigners may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days then deported, or fined up to 5,000 rubles and deported.\n\nThe Kremlin's backing of the law appealed to the [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalist]] [[Far-right politics|far-right]], but gained broad support among the [[Russians|Russian people]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (Russia is 50% Russian-Orthodox Catholic). The law was condemned by the [[Venice Commission]] of the [[Council of Europe]] (of which Russia is a member), by the United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of the Child]] and by [[human rights]] groups, such as [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]]. The statute was criticized for its broad and ambiguous wording (including the aforementioned \"raises interest in\" and \"among minors\"), which many critics characterized as being an effective ban on publicly promoting the [[LGBT rights by country or territory|rights]] and [[LGBT culture|culture]] of the [[LGBT community]]. The law was also criticized for leading to an increase and justification of [[violence against LGBT people|homophobic violence]],<ref name=ie-hunted/> while the implications of the laws in relation to the then-upcoming [[2014 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] being hosted by [[Sochi]] were also cause for concern, as the [[Olympic Charter]] contains language explicitly barring various forms of [[discrimination]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Elena Mizulina.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yelena Mizulina]], author of the law]]\nDespite the fact that the cities of [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] have been well known for their thriving [[LGBT community|LGBT communities]], there has been growing opposition towards gay rights among politicians since 2006.<ref name=nytreactions/> The city of Moscow has actively refused to authorize gay [[pride parade]]s, and former Moscow mayor [[Yuri Luzhkov]] supported the city's refusal to authorize the first two [[Moscow Pride]] events, describing them as \"satanic\" and blaming [[Western world|western]] groups for spreading \"this kind of enlightenment\" in the country.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moscow says No to May 25 gay pride parade|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130515/181167995.html|newspaper=RIA Novosti|date=15 May 2013|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=bbc-satanicparade>{{cite news|title=Moscow bans 'satanic' gay parade|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6310883.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/gay-pride-parade-satanic-mayor/2007/01/30/1169919305743.html |title=Gay Pride parade 'satanic': mayor |work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 January 2007 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}</ref> [[A Just Russia|Fair Russia]] member of parliament Alexander Chuev was also opposed to gay rights and attempted to introduce a similar \"propaganda\" law in 2007.

The term is defined as materials that are \"[aimed] at causing minors to form non-traditional sexual predispositions, notions of attractiveness of non-traditional sexual relationships, distorted ideas about the equal social value of traditional and non-traditional sexual relationships, or imposing information about non-traditional sexual relationships which raises interest in such relationships insofar as these acts do not amount to a [[Crime|criminal offence]].\" Article 2 makes similar amendments to \"On basic guarantees for the rights of the child in the Russian Federation\", commanding the government to protect children from such material.<ref name=a19-law/>\n\nArticle 3 of the bill amended the [[Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses]] with Article 6.21, which prescribes penalties for violations of the propaganda ban: Russian citizens found guilty can receive fines of up to 5,000 [[Russian ruble|rubles]], and public officials can receive fines of up to 50,000 rubles.

[[Article 19]] disputed the claimed intent of the law, and felt that many of the terms used within were too ambiguous, such as the aforementioned \"non-traditional sexual relationships\", and \"raises interest in\". The organization argued that it \"feasibly could apply to any information regarding [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]] that does not fit with what the State considers as in-line with 'tradition'.\" The term \"among minors\" was also criticized as being ambiguous, since it is unclear whether it refers to being in the presence of minors, or any place where minors could be present. They argued that \"predicting the presence of children in any space, on-line or off-line, is quite impossible and is a variable that the proponent of any expression will rarely be in absolute control of.\"<ref name=a19-law/>\n\nThe law was condemned by the [[Venice Commission]] of the [[Council of Europe]] (of which Russia is a member),<ref>Boris Dittrich, [https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/01/27/who-speaks-russias-children Who Speaks for Russia's Children?], [[Human Rights Watch]] (27 January 2014) (\"Russia is also a member of the Council of Europe.
