The ballad, produced by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Jimmy Jam]] and [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Terry Lewis]], received very little recognition until American pop singer-songwriter [[Christina Aguilera]] recorded it for her [[Christina Aguilera (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Aguilera, who worked with Warren in another song for her debut album, felt connected to the song after relating its lyrics to her relationship with her mother, and was encouraged by Warren to record the track.\n\nAguilera's version received mixed reviews from music critics, with some praising her vocal delivery, while others went on to criticize the ballad for being too clich\u00e9d. Nevertheless, the song became a huge success in the United States, peaking at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and entered the charts of multiple countries across the world.

The ballad, produced by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Jimmy Jam]] and [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Terry Lewis]], received very little recognition until American pop singer-songwriter [[Christina Aguilera]] recorded it for her [[Christina Aguilera (album)|self-titled debut album]].

Nevertheless, the song became a huge success in the United States, peaking at number three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and entered the charts of multiple countries across the world.

It is available as an alternative qualification in other countries.\n\nIt used to be the case that students would study over a two-year period, and that they would write examinations at the end of each year (AS and A2 respectively), with each counting for 1/2 of the final grade. In 2015, [[Ofqual]] decided to change the system so that students now write all of their examinations at the end of the second year. AS is still offered, but as a separate qualification. AS grades no longer count towards the final A-level.\n\nMost students [[#Studying|study three or four A level subjects]] simultaneously during the two post-16 years (ages 16\u201318) in a [[secondary school]], in a [[sixth form college]], in a further and higher education college, or in a tertiary college, as part of their [[further education]].\n\nA Levels are recognised by many universities as the standard for assessing the suitability of applicants for admission in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and many such universities partly base their admissions offers on a student's predicted A-level grades, with the majority of these offers conditional on achieving a minimum set of final grades. \n\nGCE pass rates are graded A\u2013Y. Y is ungraded and therefore a fail, whereas any grade above that is still an AS level at that grade\u2014for example, an AS level at Grade D or Grade U. \nCommon to misconceptions, Grades F through to U are still passes, and do not stand for \"fail\" or \"ungraded\".\n\n==History==\nA Levels were introduced in 1951 as a standardised school-leaving qualification, replacing the [[Higher School Certificate (United Kingdom)|Higher School Certificate]]. The examinations could be taken on a subject-by-subject basis, according to the strengths and interests of the student. This encouraged specialization and in-depth study of three to four subjects. The A Level at first was graded as simply distinction, pass or fail (although students were given an indication of their marks, to the nearest 5%), candidates obtaining a distinction originally had the option to sit a [[Scholarship Level]] paper on the same material, to attempt to win one of 400 national scholarships. The Scholarship Level was renamed the S-Level in 1963.\n\nQuite soon rising numbers of students taking the A-level examinations required more differentiation of achievement below the S-Level standard. Grades were therefore introduced. Between 1963 and 1986 the grades were [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]]:<ref>{{cite journal |first=Bruce |last=Choppin |title=Is Education Getting Better? |url=http://www.bera.ac.uk/system/files/Choppin,_1980.pdf |format=PDF |journal=British Educational Research Journal |volume=7 |issue=1 |year=1981 |page=11 |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224175946/http://www.bera.ac.uk/system/files/Choppin,_1980.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"publications.parliament.uk\">[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmeduski/153/15304.htm#a3 House of Commons Education and Skills Third Report, 2003] accessed 6 January 2013</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1984, the government's Secondary Examinations Council decided to replace the norm referencing with criterion referencing: grades would in future be awarded on examiner judgement<ref>{{cite web|title=THE BACKGROUND TO THE A LEVELS DEBATE|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmeduski/153/15304.htm|website=UK Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> thus eliminating a possible inadequacy of the existing scheme.\n\nThe criterion referencing scheme came into effect for the summer 1987 exams as the system set examiners specific criteria for the awarding of B and E grades to candidates, and then divided out the other grades according to fixed percentages. Rather than awarding an Ordinary Level for the lowest pass, a new \"N\" (for Nearly passed) was introduced. Criticisms of A level grading continued, and when Curriculum 2000 was introduced, the decision was made to have specific criteria for each grade, and the 'N' grade was abolished.\n\nIn 1989, Advanced Supplementary (AS) awards were introduced; they were intended to broaden the subjects a pupil studied post 16, and were to complement rather than be part of a pupil's A-level studies. AS-Levels were generally taken over two years, and in a subject the pupil was not studying at A-Level. Each AS level contained half the content of an A-Level, and at the same level of difficulty.\n\nInitially, a student might study three subjects at A-Level and one at [[Advanced Subsidiary level|AS-Level]], or often even four subjects at A-Level.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, due to decreasing public spending on education over time, a growing number of schools and sixth form colleges would now arrange for their pupils to study for three A-Levels instead of four.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/teenagers-forced-to-study-fewer-alevels-in-squeeze-on-public-spending-says-exam-boss-10446807.html</ref>\n\nA levels evolved gradually from a two-year linear course with an exam at the end, to a modular course, between the late 1980s and 2000. By the year 2000 there was a strong educational reason{{clarify|date=August 2015}} to standardise the exam and offer greater breadth to students through modules<ref>See the [[Dearing Report]] and Guaranteeing standards (DfEE, 1997)</ref> and there was also a pragmatic case based on the inefficiency of linear courses where up to 30% of students were failing to complete or pass.<ref>See the Audit Commission/Office for Standards in Education.(1993).

The Curriculum 2000 reforms also replaced the S-Level extension paper with the [[Advanced Extension Award]].\n\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] initiated reforms for A Levels to change from modular to the current linear structure.<ref>http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140430095946/http://www.education.gov.uk/nctl/examsadmin/news/archive/a00217355/alevels</ref> British Examination Boards ([[Edexcel]], [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] and [[Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations|OCR]]) regulated and accredited by the government of the United Kingdom responded to the government's reform announcements by modifying [[syllabus|specifications]] of several A Level subjects.<ref>http://www.edexcel.com/quals/gce/gce15/Pages/default.aspx</ref>\n\nOn the 18 March 2020, A-level examinations were cancelled in order to curtail the spread of [[COVID-19]] in the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic]], the measures were announced by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Boris Johnson]]. The A-level qualifications would instead be awarded based upon a mix teacher assessment and informal \"mock\" exams taken earlier in the school year.\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n===Structure===\nPrior to Government reforms of the A Level system, A-levels consisted of two equally weighted parts: AS (Advanced Subsidiary) Level, assessed in the first year of study, and A2 Level, assessed in the second year of study. Following the reforms, while it is still possible to take the AS Level as a stand-alone qualification, those exams do not count toward the full A Level, for which all exams are taken at the end of the course. An AS course usually comprises two modules, or three for science subjects and Mathematics; full A Level usually comprises four modules, or six for sciences and Mathematics. The modules within each part may have different weights. Modules are either assessed by exam papers marked by national organisations, or in limited cases by school-assessed, externally moderated [[coursework]].\n\n===Subjects offered===\n{{main|List of Advanced Level subjects|l1=List of Advanced Level Subjects (A-Level)}}\nA wide variety of subjects are offered at A-level by the five exam boards.

A typical route is to study four subjects at AS level and then drop down to three at A2 level, although some students continue with their fourth subject. Three is usually the minimum number of A Levels required for university entrance, with some universities specifying the need for a fourth AS subject. There is no limit set on the number of A Levels one can study, and a number of students take five or more A Levels. It is permissible to take A Levels in languages one already speaks fluently, or courses with overlapping content, even if not always fully recognized by universities. Many options choose to do coursework.\n\n===Grading===\nThe pass grades for A Levels are, from highest to lowest, '''A*''', '''A''', '''B''', '''C''', '''D''' and '''E'''. Those who do not reach the minimum standard required for a grade E receive the non-grade '''U''' (unclassified). There is no A* grade at AS level.\n\nThe process to decide these grades for modular A Levels involves the uniform mark scheme (UMS). Under this scheme, four-module A levels have a maximum mark of 400 UMS (or 200 UMS each for AS and A2), and six-module A levels have a maximum mark of 600 (or 300 UMS each for AS and A2). The maximum UMS within AS and A2 may be split unequally between each modules. For example, a Physics AS may have two exam modules worth 90 UMS and 150 UMS, and a coursework module worth 60 UMS. The 'raw marks' i.e. actual score received on a test may differ from UMS awarded. On each assignment, the correspondence of raw marks to UMS is decided by setting grade boundaries, a process which involves consultation by subject experts and consideration of statistics, aiming to keep standards for each grade the same year on year. Achieving less than 40% results in a U (unclassified). For passing grades, 40% corresponds to an E grade, 50% a D, 60% a C, 70% a B, and 80% an A. The A* grade was introduced in 2010 and is awarded to candidates who average 80% UMS across all modules, with a score over 90% UMS in all A2 modules.<ref>{{cite web|title=A-level results 2010: A* grade boosts new exams record|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11012369|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> In Mathematics, which comprises six 100 UMS modules, only the C3 and C4 modules count towards this requirement. In Further Mathematics and Additional Further Mathematics, where more than three A2 modules can be taken, the three best-scoring A2 modules count.\n\n===International comparisons===\n\n====Wales and Northern Ireland====\nRecent research and the corresponding findings have shown that over a time span of several years students from Northern Ireland would outperform students from England and Wales in A-level examinations.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/north-s-a-level-students-outperform-england-and-wales-1.2316305</ref>\n\n====Hong Kong====\nAccording to UCAS and HKEAA, the Hong Kong A-level examination has historically been benchmarked against the UK A Levels. In general, a UK A grade is broadly equivalent to a Hong Kong A-C grade. This conclusion is based mainly on the percentage of pupils achieving the respective grades in respective exams. In the UK, on average 25% of participants of each subject achieved an A grade every year, compared to the 25% A-C rate in Hong Kong \u2013 A(4%), A-B (10%), A-C (25%). According to the BBC, the percentage of students achieving an A* is about 8\u201310%, which essentially lies within the A-B range of their Hong Kong counterparts in respective subjects.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11012369]\" BBC</ref> However, the two systems measure mastery of different sets of skills and any comparison can be subjective and therefore meaningless.\n\n====United States====\nIn the [[United States]] of America (USA) the [[high school diploma]] is the qualification generally required for entry into colleges and universities. Students are usually evaluated and granted admission to US higher education institutions based on a combination of school marks, via a transcript from their high school, and a [[college entrance exam]], most commonly the [[SAT]] or [[ACT (test)|ACT]].\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the high school diploma is considered to be at the level of the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE), which is awarded at Year 11.<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\">{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf |title=International Qualifications for entry into college or university in 2013 |access-date=2014-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225115515/http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"ChavegnesUSInfo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chavagnes.org/news/Info_for_US_families.shtml |title=Info for US Families |publisher=Chavegnes International College |access-date=2014-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704014828/http://www.chavagnes.org/news/Info_for_US_families.shtml |archive-date=2017-07-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For [[sixth form|college]] and [[university]] admissions, the high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade of C is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\" />\n\nAs the more academically rigorous [[GCE Advanced Level|A Levels]] awarded at Year 13 are expected for university admission, the high school diploma alone is generally not considered to meet university requirements. Students who wish to study in the United Kingdom may additionally participate in the [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) or [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB) programs, which are considered to be at the level of the A Level qualifications and earn points on the [[UCAS Tariff]],<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\" /><ref name=\"UCASTariffTables\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/explore-your-options/entry-requirements/tariff-tables |title=UCAS Tariff Tables |access-date=2014-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027224702/http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/explore-your-options/entry-requirements/tariff-tables |archive-date=2014-10-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> or may opt to take A Level examinations in British [[international school]]s or as private candidates. College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) tests, such as the [[SAT Reasoning Test|SAT]], [[SAT Subject Test]]s, or the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], may also be considered.\n\nThe [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) recommends that in addition to a high school diploma, grades of 3 or above in at least two, or ideally three, Advanced Placement exams may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\"/> The [[IB Diploma]] may also be accepted. For the College Entrance Examination Board tests, a minimum score of 600 or higher in all sections of the SAT or a minimum score of 26 or higher in all sections of the ACT along with a minimum score of 600 in relevant SAT Subject Tests may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\" />\n\n===Special educational needs===\nThe Equality Act says that exam boards are required to take \u2018such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to avoid the disadvantage\u2019, meaning that they are required to make reasonable adjustments for students who would otherwise be at a substantial disadvantage when demonstrating their skills,\nknowledge and understanding in an assessment.<ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/601484/Access-arrangements-for-2015-16-academic_year_-_tracked.pdf</ref> For students taking GCE A Level examinations with learning difficulties, an injury/repetitive strain injury (RSI) or other disabilities, some of the access arrangements offered are:\n\n*Extra time (the most common approved is 25%, but the amount depends on the severity of the disability, and the student's processing speed. It can be allowed for: disorders such as [[ADHD]], [[Dyspraxia]], [[Dyslexia]],or any other disabilities that affect your processing speed, an injury that affects the time needed in the exam, or learning in English as a second language provided that the student has been studying in the UK for not more than 2 years)\n*An [[amanuensis]] (somebody types or handwrites as the student dictates; this is normally used when the student cannot write due to an injury or disability)\n*A word processor (without any spell checking tools) can be used by students who have trouble writing legibly or who are unable to write quickly enough to complete the exam within the time limit\n*A different format exam paper (large print, Braille, printed on coloured paper, etc.)\n*A 'reader' (a teacher/exam [[invigilator]] can read out the words written on the exam, but they cannot explain their meaning)\n*A different room (sometimes due to a disability a student can be placed in a room by themselves or with selected others; this also happens when an amanuensis is used, so as not to disturb the other candidates. All exam rooms are covered by separate dedicated invigilators.)\n\nAccess arrangements must be approved by the exam board concerned. There are others available, but these are the most commonly used.\n\n===Examination boards===\nA-level examinations in the UK are currently administered through 5 [[Examination boards in the United Kingdom#Creation of the current boards|examination boards]]: [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[OCR (examination board)|OCR]], [[Edexcel]] (London Examinations), [[WJEC (exam board)|WJEC]] and [[CCEA]]. The present 5 can trace their roots via a series of mergers or acquisitions to one or more of the originally 9 GCE Examination boards. Additionally, there are two examination boards offering A level qualifications internationally: Edexcel and the [[Cambridge International Examinations|CIE]]. OCR and CIE are both branches of the parent organization, [[Cambridge Assessment]]. In the UK it is customary for schools to register with multiple examination boards and to \"mix and match\" A Levels to get a combined curriculum that fits the school profile.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===\nA Levels are usually studied by students in Sixth Form, which refers to the last two years of secondary education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, taken at ages 16\u201318. Some secondary schools have their own Sixth Form, which admits students from lower year groups, but will often accept external applications. There are also many specialist Sixth Form and [[Further education|Further Education]] Colleges which admit from feeder schools across a large geographic area.  Admission to A level programmes is at the discretion of providers, and usually depends on GCSE grades. A typical requirement would be 5 A*-C grades at GCSE, although requirements can be higher, particularly for independent schools and grammar schools.\n\n===Scotland===\nA Levels are offered as an alternate qualification by a small number of educational institutions in [[Education in Scotland|Scotland]], in place of the standard [[Higher (Scottish)|Scottish Higher]], and the [[Advanced Higher]] levels of the [[Scottish Qualifications Certificate]]. The schools that offer A Levels are mainly private fee-paying schools particularly for students wishing to attend university in England.\n\n===International schools===\nMany [[international school]]s choose to use the British system for their wide recognition. Furthermore, students may choose to sit the papers of British examination bodies at education centres around the world, such as those belonging to the [[British Council]]. According to the British Council, A Levels are similar to the American [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] courses<ref>[http://www.britishcouncil.org/usa-education-uk-glossary.htmGlossary \u2013 EducationUK \u2013 British Council USA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which are themselves equivalent to first-year courses of America's four-year bachelor's degrees.\n\n===University admissions===\nA Level students often apply to universities before they have taken their final exams, with applications administered centrally through [[UCAS]]. British universities (including Scottish universities, which receive many applicants taking A Levels) consider GCSEs, AS-level results, predicted A Level results, and extracurricular accomplishments when deciding whether applicants should be made an offer through UCAS. These offers may be 'unconditional', guaranteeing a place regardless of performance in A2 examinations. Far more often, the offers are conditional on A level grades, and become void should the student fail to achieve the marks expected by the university (for example, conditional offer of three A Levels at grades B-B-C).<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=You asked the expert: A Level results |first=Carol |last=Jones |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14526439 |newspaper=BBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316194413/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14526439 |archivedate=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Universities may specify which subjects they wish these grades to be in (for example, conditional offer of grades A-A-B with a grade A in Mathematics).<ref name=BBC /> The offer may include additional requirements, such as attaining a particular grade in the [[Sixth Term Examination Paper]]. The university is obliged to accept the candidate if the conditions are met, but is not obliged to reject a candidate who misses the requirements. Leniency may in particular be shown if the candidate narrowly misses grades.\n\nA Level grades are also sometimes converted into numerical scores, typically [[UCAS Tariff|UCAS tariff]] scores. Under the new UCAS system starting in 2017, an A* grade at A Level is worth 56 points, while an A is worth 48, a B is worth 40, a C is worth 32, a D is 24, and a E is worth 16;<ref>{{cite web|title=The UCAS Tariff calculator|url=https://www.ucas.com/ucas/tariff-calculator|website=UCAS|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref> so a university may instead demand that an applicant achieve 112 points, instead of the equivalent offer of B-B-C. This allows greater flexibility to students, as 112 points could also, for example, be achieved through the combination A-B-D, which would not have met the requirements of a B-B-C offer because of the D grade.\n\nDepending on the specific offer made, a combination of more than 3 subjects (typically 4 or 5) with lower grades, or points from non-academic input such as higher level music grades or a Key Skills course, may also be accepted by the university. The text of the offer determines whether this flexibility is available \u2013 \"112 UCAS Points\" likely would, while \"112 UCAS Points from three A Level subjects\" would not.\n\n===International variants===\nThere are currently two examination boards which provide an international variant of the United Kingdom A level examinations to international students. These are [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE) and [[Edexcel]]. International A Level is widely available worldwide, with more than 125 countries providing the programme with 60 different choices of subjects.<ref>\"[http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel]\"</ref>\n\nUnlike the current modular system implemented in the UK, the CIE A-Level, or more commonly known as the Cambridge A level, practises a terminal-examination system. Students are required to sit for two major exams, AS and A2, at the end of each academic year. Each of the major exams carries the weightage of 50 percent to form a complete A Level. However, Edexcel A level students will be sitting the same paper as the students in UK concurrently.\n\nAdditionally, countries outside of the United Kingdom have established academic qualifications with the same or similar name, and with a similar format, to the United Kingdom A levels. However, these qualifications may be distinct in certain ways from those offered in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Awarding==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ UK: A-level Grades Awarded (%'age)<ref>{{cite web|title=A-Level Results, 2001\u20132014|url=http://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-results/a-levels|publisher=Joint Council of Qualifications}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stubbs|first=Brian|title=Student Performance Analysis: National percentage figures for A level grades|url=http://www.bstubbs.co.uk/a-lev.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=So are A-levels getting easier?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/1495184.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=16 August 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Warning over A-level results claims|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/2190351.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=13 August 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A-level results by subject 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/aug/19/alevels2004.alevels|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A-level results: Record drop in top grades as fewer get university places|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/08/16/a-level-results-record-drop-in-top-grades-as-fewer-get-university-places-538068/|newspaper=Metro|date=16 August 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n!

The course offers more subjects, extracurricular activity, a philosophical [[epistemological]] component known as \"[[Theory of Knowledge]]\", as well as the requirement of an extended essay on any subject of a candidate's choice. Unlike the current AS/A2 system, the International Baccalaureate is not based on a modular system. The Diploma Programme, administered by the [[International Baccalaureate]], is a recognised pre-university educational programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/diploma/|title=What is the Diploma Programme|publisher=ibo.org|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nFormer British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] recently suggested that one state school in every county should offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme as an alternative to A levels.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1184567/Fears-tier-education-pupils-taking-rival-exam-A-levels-rise-40.html|title=Fears of 'two-tier' education system as pupils taking rival exam to A-levels rise by 40%|first=Laura|last=Clark|work=Daily MailOnline|date=19 May 2009|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=School Level Exams in the UK |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/types_gcses.pdf |publisher=British Council Australia Education UK |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430183352/http://www.britishcouncil.org/types_gcses.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Breadth of study===\n\nThe A-level has been criticised for providing less breadth since many A-level students do not generally study more than three subjects in their final year.<sup>[18]</sup> A major part of this criticism is that, while a three- or four-subject curriculum can be balanced across the spectrum (e.g. students may choose one science subject (such as Maths, Chemistry, or Biology), a language subject (e.g. English Language, English Literature, French, German, Spanish), and a \"creative\" subject like Art Studies), in many cases students choose three closely linked subjects, for instance, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry or Sociology, Psychology, and Politics. This is in part due to university entrance requirements, which, for degree programs such as medicine, may require three related A-level subjects, but non-traditional combinations are becoming more common (\"British Council Australia Education UK\"). Thus, while the purpose of Curriculum 2000 was to encourage students to undertake contrasting subjects, to broaden their 'skill-base', there is a tendency to pursue similar disciplines. However, others disagree, arguing that the additional AS-level(s) studied would already have provided more breadth compared with the old system.\n\n===Predicted grading===\nStudents applying to universities before receiving their A Level results typically do so on the basis of predicted grades, which are issued by schools and colleges. A student's predicted grades usually depend on their GCSE results, family income, performance in tests and mock examinations, or a combination of these factors.\n\nA possible reformation would be something called the post-qualifications applications system (PQA), where applicants apply to university after they receive their results.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/5003366.stm Plans to change university entry]\", BBC News, 22 May 2006.</ref> It has been argued that this would be fairer to applicants, especially those from lower-income families whose results were thought to be under-predicted. However, a more recent UCAS report shows that although the reliability of predicted grades declines in step with family income, this can still lead to an over-prediction effect for lower income groups. Just 45% of predicted grades are accurate \u2013 47% are over-predictions and 9% under-predictions.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070206164504/http://www.ucas.com/candq/grades.pdf Estimating the Reliability of Predicted Grades]\", University and Colleges Admission Service (UCAS).

It is available as an alternative qualification in other countries.\n\nIt used to be the case that students would study over a two-year period, and that they would write examinations at the end of each year (AS and A2 respectively), with each counting for 1/2 of the final grade. In 2015, [[Ofqual]] decided to change the system so that students now write all of their examinations at the end of the second year. AS is still offered, but as a separate qualification. AS grades no longer count towards the final A-level.\n\nMost students [[#Studying|study three or four A level subjects]] simultaneously during the two post-16 years (ages 16\u201318) in a [[secondary school]], in a [[sixth form college]], in a further and higher education college, or in a tertiary college, as part of their [[further education]].\n\nA Levels are recognised by many universities as the standard for assessing the suitability of applicants for admission in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and many such universities partly base their admissions offers on a student's predicted A-level grades, with the majority of these offers conditional on achieving a minimum set of final grades. \n\nGCE pass rates are graded A\u2013Y. Y is ungraded and therefore a fail, whereas any grade above that is still an AS level at that grade\u2014for example, an AS level at Grade D or Grade U. \nCommon to misconceptions, Grades F through to U are still passes, and do not stand for \"fail\" or \"ungraded\".\n\n==History==\nA Levels were introduced in 1951 as a standardised school-leaving qualification, replacing the [[Higher School Certificate (United Kingdom)|Higher School Certificate]]. The examinations could be taken on a subject-by-subject basis, according to the strengths and interests of the student. This encouraged specialization and in-depth study of three to four subjects. The A Level at first was graded as simply distinction, pass or fail (although students were given an indication of their marks, to the nearest 5%), candidates obtaining a distinction originally had the option to sit a [[Scholarship Level]] paper on the same material, to attempt to win one of 400 national scholarships. The Scholarship Level was renamed the S-Level in 1963.\n\nQuite soon rising numbers of students taking the A-level examinations required more differentiation of achievement below the S-Level standard. Grades were therefore introduced. Between 1963 and 1986 the grades were [[Norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]]:<ref>{{cite journal |first=Bruce |last=Choppin |title=Is Education Getting Better? |url=http://www.bera.ac.uk/system/files/Choppin,_1980.pdf |format=PDF |journal=British Educational Research Journal |volume=7 |issue=1 |year=1981 |page=11 |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224175946/http://www.bera.ac.uk/system/files/Choppin,_1980.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"publications.parliament.uk\">[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmeduski/153/15304.htm#a3 House of Commons Education and Skills Third Report, 2003] accessed 6 January 2013</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1984, the government's Secondary Examinations Council decided to replace the norm referencing with criterion referencing: grades would in future be awarded on examiner judgement<ref>{{cite web|title=THE BACKGROUND TO THE A LEVELS DEBATE|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmeduski/153/15304.htm|website=UK Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> thus eliminating a possible inadequacy of the existing scheme.\n\nThe criterion referencing scheme came into effect for the summer 1987 exams as the system set examiners specific criteria for the awarding of B and E grades to candidates, and then divided out the other grades according to fixed percentages. Rather than awarding an Ordinary Level for the lowest pass, a new \"N\" (for Nearly passed) was introduced. Criticisms of A level grading continued, and when Curriculum 2000 was introduced, the decision was made to have specific criteria for each grade, and the 'N' grade was abolished.\n\nIn 1989, Advanced Supplementary (AS) awards were introduced; they were intended to broaden the subjects a pupil studied post 16, and were to complement rather than be part of a pupil's A-level studies. AS-Levels were generally taken over two years, and in a subject the pupil was not studying at A-Level. Each AS level contained half the content of an A-Level, and at the same level of difficulty.\n\nInitially, a student might study three subjects at A-Level and one at [[Advanced Subsidiary level|AS-Level]], or often even four subjects at A-Level.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, due to decreasing public spending on education over time, a growing number of schools and sixth form colleges would now arrange for their pupils to study for three A-Levels instead of four.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/teenagers-forced-to-study-fewer-alevels-in-squeeze-on-public-spending-says-exam-boss-10446807.html</ref>\n\nA levels evolved gradually from a two-year linear course with an exam at the end, to a modular course, between the late 1980s and 2000. By the year 2000 there was a strong educational reason{{clarify|date=August 2015}} to standardise the exam and offer greater breadth to students through modules<ref>See the [[Dearing Report]] and Guaranteeing standards (DfEE, 1997)</ref> and there was also a pragmatic case based on the inefficiency of linear courses where up to 30% of students were failing to complete or pass.<ref>See the Audit Commission/Office for Standards in Education.(1993).

The A-level qualifications would instead be awarded based upon a mix teacher assessment and informal \"mock\" exams taken earlier in the school year.\n\n==Curriculum==\n\n===Structure===\nPrior to Government reforms of the A Level system, A-levels consisted of two equally weighted parts: AS (Advanced Subsidiary) Level, assessed in the first year of study, and A2 Level, assessed in the second year of study. Following the reforms, while it is still possible to take the AS Level as a stand-alone qualification, those exams do not count toward the full A Level, for which all exams are taken at the end of the course. An AS course usually comprises two modules, or three for science subjects and Mathematics; full A Level usually comprises four modules, or six for sciences and Mathematics. The modules within each part may have different weights. Modules are either assessed by exam papers marked by national organisations, or in limited cases by school-assessed, externally moderated [[coursework]].\n\n===Subjects offered===\n{{main|List of Advanced Level subjects|l1=List of Advanced Level Subjects (A-Level)}}\nA wide variety of subjects are offered at A-level by the five exam boards.

A typical route is to study four subjects at AS level and then drop down to three at A2 level, although some students continue with their fourth subject. Three is usually the minimum number of A Levels required for university entrance, with some universities specifying the need for a fourth AS subject. There is no limit set on the number of A Levels one can study, and a number of students take five or more A Levels. It is permissible to take A Levels in languages one already speaks fluently, or courses with overlapping content, even if not always fully recognized by universities. Many options choose to do coursework.\n\n===Grading===\nThe pass grades for A Levels are, from highest to lowest, '''A*''', '''A''', '''B''', '''C''', '''D''' and '''E'''. Those who do not reach the minimum standard required for a grade E receive the non-grade '''U''' (unclassified). There is no A* grade at AS level.\n\nThe process to decide these grades for modular A Levels involves the uniform mark scheme (UMS). Under this scheme, four-module A levels have a maximum mark of 400 UMS (or 200 UMS each for AS and A2), and six-module A levels have a maximum mark of 600 (or 300 UMS each for AS and A2). The maximum UMS within AS and A2 may be split unequally between each modules. For example, a Physics AS may have two exam modules worth 90 UMS and 150 UMS, and a coursework module worth 60 UMS. The 'raw marks' i.e. actual score received on a test may differ from UMS awarded. On each assignment, the correspondence of raw marks to UMS is decided by setting grade boundaries, a process which involves consultation by subject experts and consideration of statistics, aiming to keep standards for each grade the same year on year. Achieving less than 40% results in a U (unclassified). For passing grades, 40% corresponds to an E grade, 50% a D, 60% a C, 70% a B, and 80% an A. The A* grade was introduced in 2010 and is awarded to candidates who average 80% UMS across all modules, with a score over 90% UMS in all A2 modules.<ref>{{cite web|title=A-level results 2010: A* grade boosts new exams record|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11012369|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref> In Mathematics, which comprises six 100 UMS modules, only the C3 and C4 modules count towards this requirement. In Further Mathematics and Additional Further Mathematics, where more than three A2 modules can be taken, the three best-scoring A2 modules count.\n\n===International comparisons===\n\n====Wales and Northern Ireland====\nRecent research and the corresponding findings have shown that over a time span of several years students from Northern Ireland would outperform students from England and Wales in A-level examinations.<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/north-s-a-level-students-outperform-england-and-wales-1.2316305</ref>\n\n====Hong Kong====\nAccording to UCAS and HKEAA, the Hong Kong A-level examination has historically been benchmarked against the UK A Levels. In general, a UK A grade is broadly equivalent to a Hong Kong A-C grade. This conclusion is based mainly on the percentage of pupils achieving the respective grades in respective exams. In the UK, on average 25% of participants of each subject achieved an A grade every year, compared to the 25% A-C rate in Hong Kong \u2013 A(4%), A-B (10%), A-C (25%). According to the BBC, the percentage of students achieving an A* is about 8\u201310%, which essentially lies within the A-B range of their Hong Kong counterparts in respective subjects.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-11012369]\" BBC</ref> However, the two systems measure mastery of different sets of skills and any comparison can be subjective and therefore meaningless.\n\n====United States====\nIn the [[United States]] of America (USA) the [[high school diploma]] is the qualification generally required for entry into colleges and universities. Students are usually evaluated and granted admission to US higher education institutions based on a combination of school marks, via a transcript from their high school, and a [[college entrance exam]], most commonly the [[SAT]] or [[ACT]].\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the high school diploma is considered to be at the level of the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE), which is awarded at Year 11.<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\">{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf |title=International Qualifications for entry into college or university in 2013 |access-date=2014-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225115515/http://www.arts.ac.uk/media/arts/colleges/lcf/courses/application-forms/int-quals2013.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"ChavegnesUSInfo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chavagnes.org/news/Info_for_US_families.shtml |title=Info for US Families |publisher=Chavegnes International College |access-date=2014-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704014828/http://www.chavagnes.org/news/Info_for_US_families.shtml |archive-date=2017-07-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> For [[sixth form|college]] and [[university]] admissions, the high school diploma may be accepted in lieu of the GCSE if an average grade of C is obtained in subjects with a GCSE counterpart.<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\" />\n\nAs the more academically rigorous [[GCE Advanced Level|A Levels]] awarded at Year 13 are expected for university admission, the high school diploma alone is generally not considered to meet university requirements.

College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) tests, such as the [[SAT Reasoning Test|SAT]], [[SAT Subject Test]]s, or the [[ACT (test)|ACT]], may also be considered.\n\nThe [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS) recommends that in addition to a high school diploma, grades of 3 or above in at least two, or ideally three, Advanced Placement exams may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\"/> The [[IB Diploma]] may also be accepted. For the College Entrance Examination Board tests, a minimum score of 600 or higher in all sections of the SAT or a minimum score of 26 or higher in all sections of the ACT along with a minimum score of 600 in relevant SAT Subject Tests may be considered as meeting general entry requirements for admission.<ref name=\"UCASIntQuals\" />\n\n===Special educational needs===\nThe Equality Act says that exam boards are required to take \u2018such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to avoid the disadvantage\u2019, meaning that they are required to make reasonable adjustments for students who would otherwise be at a substantial disadvantage when demonstrating their skills,\nknowledge and understanding in an assessment.<ref>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/601484/Access-arrangements-for-2015-16-academic_year_-_tracked.pdf</ref> For students taking GCE A Level examinations with learning difficulties, an injury/repetitive strain injury (RSI) or other disabilities, some of the access arrangements offered are:\n\n*Extra time (the most common approved is 25%, but the amount depends on the severity of the disability, and the student's processing speed. It can be allowed for: disorders such as [[ADHD]], [[Dyspraxia]], [[Dyslexia]],or any other disabilities that affect your processing speed, an injury that affects the time needed in the exam, or learning in English as a second language provided that the student has been studying in the UK for not more than 2 years)\n*An [[amanuensis]] (somebody types or handwrites as the student dictates; this is normally used when the student cannot write due to an injury or disability)\n*A word processor (without any spell checking tools) can be used by students who have trouble writing legibly or who are unable to write quickly enough to complete the exam within the time limit\n*A different format exam paper (large print, Braille, printed on coloured paper, etc.)\n*A 'reader' (a teacher/exam [[invigilator]] can read out the words written on the exam, but they cannot explain their meaning)\n*A different room (sometimes due to a disability a student can be placed in a room by themselves or with selected others; this also happens when an amanuensis is used, so as not to disturb the other candidates. All exam rooms are covered by separate dedicated invigilators.)\n\nAccess arrangements must be approved by the exam board concerned. There are others available, but these are the most commonly used.\n\n===Examination boards===\nA-level examinations in the UK are currently administered through 5 [[Examination boards in the United Kingdom#Creation of the current boards|examination boards]]: [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]], [[OCR (examination board)|OCR]], [[Edexcel]] (London Examinations), [[WJEC (exam board)|WJEC]] and [[CCEA]]. The present 5 can trace their roots via a series of mergers or acquisitions to one or more of the originally 9 GCE Examination boards. Additionally, there are two examination boards offering A level qualifications internationally: Edexcel and the [[Cambridge International Examinations|CIE]]. OCR and CIE are both branches of the parent organization, [[Cambridge Assessment]]. In the UK it is customary for schools to register with multiple examination boards and to \"mix and match\" A Levels to get a combined curriculum that fits the school profile.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===\nA Levels are usually studied by students in Sixth Form, which refers to the last two years of secondary education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, taken at ages 16\u201318. Some secondary schools have their own Sixth Form, which admits students from lower year groups, but will often accept external applications. There are also many specialist Sixth Form and [[Further education|Further Education]] Colleges which admit from feeder schools across a large geographic area.  Admission to A level programmes is at the discretion of providers, and usually depends on GCSE grades. A typical requirement would be 5 A*-C grades at GCSE, although requirements can be higher, particularly for independent schools and grammar schools.\n\n===Scotland===\nA Levels are offered as an alternate qualification by a small number of educational institutions in [[Education in Scotland|Scotland]], in place of the standard [[Higher (Scottish)|Scottish Higher]], and the [[Advanced Higher]] levels of the [[Scottish Qualifications Certificate]]. The schools that offer A Levels are mainly private fee-paying schools particularly for students wishing to attend university in England.\n\n===International schools===\nMany [[international school]]s choose to use the British system for their wide recognition. Furthermore, students may choose to sit the papers of British examination bodies at education centres around the world, such as those belonging to the [[British Council]]. According to the British Council, A Levels are similar to the American [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] courses<ref>[http://www.britishcouncil.org/usa-education-uk-glossary.htmGlossary \u2013 EducationUK \u2013 British Council USA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> which are themselves equivalent to first-year courses of America's four-year bachelor's degrees.\n\n===University admissions===\nA Level students often apply to universities before they have taken their final exams, with applications administered centrally through [[UCAS]]. British universities (including Scottish universities, which receive many applicants taking A Levels) consider GCSEs, AS-level results, predicted A Level results, and extracurricular accomplishments when deciding whether applicants should be made an offer through UCAS. These offers may be 'unconditional', guaranteeing a place regardless of performance in A2 examinations. Far more often, the offers are conditional on A level grades, and become void should the student fail to achieve the marks expected by the university (for example, conditional offer of three A Levels at grades B-B-C).<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=You asked the expert: A Level results |first=Carol |last=Jones |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14526439 |newspaper=BBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316194413/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14526439 |archivedate=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Universities may specify which subjects they wish these grades to be in (for example, conditional offer of grades A-A-B with a grade A in Mathematics).<ref name=BBC /> The offer may include additional requirements, such as attaining a particular grade in the [[Sixth Term Examination Paper]]. The university is obliged to accept the candidate if the conditions are met, but is not obliged to reject a candidate who misses the requirements. Leniency may in particular be shown if the candidate narrowly misses grades.\n\nA Level grades are also sometimes converted into numerical scores, typically [[UCAS Tariff|UCAS tariff]] scores. Under the new UCAS system starting in 2017, an A* grade at A Level is worth 56 points, while an A is worth 48, a B is worth 40, a C is worth 32, a D is 24, and a E is worth 16;<ref>{{cite web|title=The UCAS Tariff calculator|url=https://www.ucas.com/ucas/tariff-calculator|website=UCAS|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref> so a university may instead demand that an applicant achieve 112 points, instead of the equivalent offer of B-B-C. This allows greater flexibility to students, as 112 points could also, for example, be achieved through the combination A-B-D, which would not have met the requirements of a B-B-C offer because of the D grade.\n\nDepending on the specific offer made, a combination of more than 3 subjects (typically 4 or 5) with lower grades, or points from non-academic input such as higher level music grades or a Key Skills course, may also be accepted by the university. The text of the offer determines whether this flexibility is available \u2013 \"112 UCAS Points\" likely would, while \"112 UCAS Points from three A Level subjects\" would not.\n\n===International variants===\nThere are currently two examination boards which provide an international variant of the United Kingdom A level examinations to international students. These are [[Cambridge International Examinations]] (CIE) and [[Edexcel]]. International A Level is widely available worldwide, with more than 125 countries providing the programme with 60 different choices of subjects.<ref>\"[http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/academic/uppersec/alevel]\"</ref>\n\nUnlike the current modular system implemented in the UK, the CIE A-Level, or more commonly known as the Cambridge A level, practises a terminal-examination system. Students are required to sit for two major exams, AS and A2, at the end of each academic year. Each of the major exams carries the weightage of 50 percent to form a complete A Level. However, Edexcel A level students will be sitting the same paper as the students in UK concurrently.\n\nAdditionally, countries outside of the United Kingdom have established academic qualifications with the same or similar name, and with a similar format, to the United Kingdom A levels. However, these qualifications may be distinct in certain ways from those offered in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Awarding==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ UK: A-level Grades Awarded (%'age)<ref>{{cite web|title=A-Level Results, 2001\u20132014|url=http://www.jcq.org.uk/examination-results/a-levels|publisher=Joint Council of Qualifications}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stubbs|first=Brian|title=Student Performance Analysis: National percentage figures for A level grades|url=http://www.bstubbs.co.uk/a-lev.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=So are A-levels getting easier?|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/1495184.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=16 August 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Warning over A-level results claims|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/2190351.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=13 August 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A-level results by subject 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/aug/19/alevels2004.alevels|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=A-level results: Record drop in top grades as fewer get university places|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/08/16/a-level-results-record-drop-in-top-grades-as-fewer-get-university-places-538068/|newspaper=Metro|date=16 August 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n!

This is in part due to university entrance requirements, which, for degree programs such as medicine, may require three related A-level subjects, but non-traditional combinations are becoming more common (\"British Council Australia Education UK\"). Thus, while the purpose of Curriculum 2000 was to encourage students to undertake contrasting subjects, to broaden their 'skill-base', there is a tendency to pursue similar disciplines. However, others disagree, arguing that the additional AS-level(s) studied would already have provided more breadth compared with the old system.\n\n===Predicted grading===\nStudents applying to universities before receiving their A Level results typically do so on the basis of predicted grades, which are issued by schools and colleges. A student's predicted grades usually depend on their GCSE results, family income, performance in tests and mock examinations, or a combination of these factors.\n\nA possible reformation would be something called the post-qualifications applications system (PQA), where applicants apply to university after they receive their results.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/5003366.stm Plans to change university entry]\", BBC News, 22 May 2006.</ref> It has been argued that this would be fairer to applicants, especially those from lower-income families whose results were thought to be under-predicted. However, a more recent UCAS report shows that although the reliability of predicted grades declines in step with family income, this can still lead to an over-prediction effect for lower income groups. Just 45% of predicted grades are accurate \u2013 47% are over-predictions and 9% under-predictions.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070206164504/http://www.ucas.com/candq/grades.pdf Estimating the Reliability of Predicted Grades]\", University and Colleges Admission Service (UCAS).

A [[Mars-crosser asteroid]] [[132 Aethra]] is the lowest numbered asteroid to not have any proper orbital elements.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Hirayama family]]\n* [[Perturbation (astronomy)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Z.

Brunner is held responsible for sending over 100,000 [[European Jews]] to ghettos and concentration camps in eastern Europe. He was commander of the [[Drancy internment camp]] outside Paris from June 1943 to August 1944, from which nearly 24,000 people were deported.\n\nAfter some narrow escapes from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]], Brunner fled West Germany in 1954, first for Egypt, then Syria, where he remained until his death. He was the object of many manhunts and investigations over the years by different groups, including the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], the [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld|Klarsfelds]] and others. He was condemned to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' in France in 1954 for [[crimes against humanity]]. He lost an eye and then the fingers of his left hand as a result of [[letter bomb]]s sent to him in 1961 and 1980, reportedly by Israeli [[Secret service|intelligence]].<ref name=\"Bergman\" /> The government of Syria under [[Hafez el-Assad]] came close to [[extradition|extraditing]] him to [[East Germany]] before this plan was halted by the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in November 1989. Brunner survived all the attempts to detain him and was unrepentant about his activities to the end. During his long residence in Syria, Brunner was reportedly granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]], a generous salary and protection by the ruling [[Ba'ath Party]] in exchange for his advice on effective [[torture]] and [[interrogation technique]]s used by the Germans in [[World War II]].<ref>Adam Chandler, [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/12/eichmanns-best-man-lived-and-died-in-syria/383296 \"Eichmann's Best Man Lived and Died in Syria\"], ''The Atlantic Magazine'', 1 December 2014.</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1990s and continuing for two decades, there was periodic media speculation about Brunner's exact whereabouts and his possible demise. In November 2014, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] reported that Brunner had died in Syria in 2010,<ref name=swc2014/> and that he was buried somewhere in Damascus.

He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931 and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) in 1932. After joining the SS in 1938, he was assigned to the staff of the [[Central Office for Jewish Emigration]] in Austria and became its director in 1939. He worked closely with [[Adolf Eichmann]] on the [[Nisko Plan]], a failed attempt to set up a Jewish reservation in [[Nisko|Nisko, Poland]], later that same year.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=128}}\n\nBrunner held the rank of SS-''[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (captain) when he organized deportations to [[Nazi concentration camps]] from [[Vichy France]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovakia]]. He was commander of a train of Jews deported from [[Vienna]] to [[Riga]] in February 1942. En route, Brunner shot and killed Jewish financier Siegmund Bosel, who, although ill, had been hauled out of a Vienna hospital and placed on the train. According to historian Gertrude Schneider, who as a young girl was deported to Riga on the same train, but survived the Holocaust:{{quote|Alois Brunner chained Bosel, still in his pajamas, to the platform of the first car\u2014our car\u2014and berated him for having been a profiteer.

He personally conducted interrogations of new prisoners, and survivors of the camp have claimed that his office was covered in bloodstains and bullet holes. He instituted torture even for slight offences. As he was personally responsible to Eichmann, he circumvented the typical chain of command that included [[Helmut Knochen]], the Chief of the SS in Paris, and [[Heinz R\u00f6thke|Heinz Rothke]], the Jewish Affairs expert of the German police. He introduced a rigid system of categorization to control the inmates using information about their race and ethnicity derived from the interrogations. He deliberately misled prisoners about the living standards of their destinations at the extermination camps in the [[General Government]], including [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. Brunner also led round-ups of Jews in the [[Italian occupation of France|Italian Military Administration of France]] when the Germans assumed control in 1943 following the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ended all legal exemptions preventing Jews from being deported by Vichy France, and extended the deportations to Jews of French nationality.

The identity of Brunner was apparently mixed up with that of another SS member with the same surname, Anton Brunner, who was executed for war crimes. Alois, like [[Josef Mengele]], did not have the [[SS blood group tattoo|SS blood type tattoo]], which prevented his identity from detection in an Allied prison camp.

Brunner is held responsible for sending over 100,000 [[European Jews]] to ghettos and concentration camps in eastern Europe. He was commander of the [[Drancy internment camp]] outside Paris from June 1943 to August 1944, from which nearly 24,000 people were deported.\n\nAfter some narrow escapes from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in the immediate aftermath of [[World War II]], Brunner fled West Germany in 1954, first for Egypt, then Syria, where he remained until his death. He was the object of many manhunts and investigations over the years by different groups, including the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], the [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld|Klarsfelds]] and others. He was condemned to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' in France in 1954 for [[crimes against humanity]]. He lost an eye and then the fingers of his left hand as a result of [[letter bomb]]s sent to him in 1961 and 1980, reportedly by Israeli [[Secret service|intelligence]].<ref name=\"Bergman\" /> The government of Syria under [[Hafez el-Assad]] came close to [[extradition|extraditing]] him to [[East Germany]] before this plan was halted by the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in November 1989. Brunner survived all the attempts to detain him and was unrepentant about his activities to the end. During his long residence in Syria, Brunner was reportedly granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]], a generous salary and protection by the ruling [[Ba'ath Party]] in exchange for his advice on effective [[torture]] and [[interrogation technique]]s used by the Germans in [[World War II]].<ref>Adam Chandler, [https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/12/eichmanns-best-man-lived-and-died-in-syria/383296 \"Eichmann's Best Man Lived and Died in Syria\"], ''The Atlantic Magazine'', 1 December 2014.</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1990s and continuing for two decades, there was periodic media speculation about Brunner's exact whereabouts and his possible demise. In November 2014, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] reported that Brunner had died in Syria in 2010,<ref name=swc2014/> and that he was buried somewhere in Damascus. The exact date of death and place of death are unknown, with recent information pointing to 2001 as the year of his death.\n\n==Second World War==\nBorn in [[Rohrbrunn|N\u00e1dk\u00fat]], [[Vas County (former)|Vas, Austria-Hungary]] (now Rohrbrunn, [[Burgenland]], Austria), he was the son of Joseph Brunner and Ann Kruise. He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931 and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) in 1932. After joining the SS in 1938, he was assigned to the staff of the [[Central Office for Jewish Emigration]] in Austria and became its director in 1939. He worked closely with [[Adolf Eichmann]] on the [[Nisko Plan]], a failed attempt to set up a Jewish reservation in [[Nisko|Nisko, Poland]], later that same year.{{sfn|Cesarani|2005|p=128}}\n\nBrunner held the rank of SS-''[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]'' (captain) when he organized deportations to [[Nazi concentration camps]] from [[Vichy France]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939-1945)|Slovakia]]. He was commander of a train of Jews deported from [[Vienna]] to [[Riga]] in February 1942. En route, Brunner shot and killed Jewish financier Siegmund Bosel, who, although ill, had been hauled out of a Vienna hospital and placed on the train. According to historian Gertrude Schneider, who as a young girl was deported to Riga on the same train, but survived the Holocaust:{{quote|Alois Brunner chained Bosel, still in his pajamas, to the platform of the first car\u2014our car\u2014and berated him for having been a profiteer.

He personally conducted interrogations of new prisoners, and survivors of the camp have claimed that his office was covered in bloodstains and bullet holes. He instituted torture even for slight offences. As he was personally responsible to Eichmann, he circumvented the typical chain of command that included [[Helmut Knochen]], the Chief of the SS in Paris, and [[Heinz R\u00f6thke|Heinz Rothke]], the Jewish Affairs expert of the German police. He introduced a rigid system of categorization to control the inmates using information about their race and ethnicity derived from the interrogations. He deliberately misled prisoners about the living standards of their destinations at the extermination camps in the [[General Government]], including [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]]. Brunner also led round-ups of Jews in the [[Italian occupation of France|Italian Military Administration of France]] when the Germans assumed control in 1943 following the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ended all legal exemptions preventing Jews from being deported by Vichy France, and extended the deportations to Jews of French nationality.

The identity of Brunner was apparently mixed up with that of another SS member with the same surname, Anton Brunner, who was executed for war crimes. Alois, like [[Josef Mengele]], did not have the [[SS blood group tattoo|SS blood type tattoo]], which prevented his identity from detection in an Allied prison camp. Anton Brunner, who had worked in [[Vienna]] deporting Jews, was confused after the war with Alois due to the shared surname, including by historians such as [[Gerald Reitlinger]].<ref>Schneider, Gertrude, ''Journey into terror: story of the Riga Ghetto'' (2nd abbr. edition), Westport, Connecticut, Praeger, 2001, pp. 54, 167; {{ISBN|0-275-97050-7}}</ref>\n\nClaiming he had \"received official documents under a false name from American authorities\", Brunner claimed he had found work as a driver for the [[United States Army]] in the period after the war.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Syria, a Long-Hunted Nazi Talks|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 October 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/29/world/in-syria-a-long-hunted-nazi-talks.html|first=James M.|last=Markham}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nazi Criminal Says Mixup Aided His Escape|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 November 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/07/world/around-the-world-nazi-criminal-says-mixup-aided-his-escape.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=George J.
