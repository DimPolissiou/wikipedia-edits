The Westminster Gate or Kings Street Gate further south was built in a simpler more classical style with circular corner towers and domed turrets, and was demolished in 1723.  The Holbein Gate is shown in drawings and engravings, including an engraving made by [[George Vertue]] in 1725 and published in 1747 in Vol. I of ''[[Vetusta Monumenta]]''.\n\nThe gate was a rectangular building of three floors, with the principal rooms on the upper two floors.  Projecting square bases on each corner supporting octagonal towers and turrets.  A passageway between the towers approximately {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide allowed traffic to pass beneath a flat archway, with one footway to the east and possibly a second footway to the west through the towers (although the west footway may have been blocked and then cleared).  Above the arch was an [[oriel window]] with two row of six lights (one to either side and four in the centre) on the first floor, and a window of four lights in a double row on the first floor.  The top of the tower was surmounted by a parapet with battlements.  Each face of the octagonal towers had two-light windows in double rows.  Both sides of the gate were faced with chequerboard patterns of flint and stone, and also decorative carved panels, including a royal coat of arms above the arch, gryphons holding shields, and other royal emblems, such as the portcullis, fleur-de-lys and Tudor rose.  Roundels to either side of the large central windows held with busts, possibly by [[Giovanni da Maiano]]. (Three terracotta busts by [[Pietro Torrigiano]] owned by the Wright family in [[Hatfield Peverel]] until the 1920s were thought to come from the Gate, but later scholarship doubts any connection.)  The arch was later filled in down to the springing, flattening its profile.  A gallery to the west overlooked the Royal Tiltyard (now [[Horse Guards Parade]]) leading eventually to St James's park.  Another gallery led to the Cockpit.\n\nThe upper storey was used as the Paper Office, from perhaps 1672 until 1756.  The lower storey was used as lodgings.

[[Devil (Islam)|Iblis]] (Devil) refused out of [[pride]]<ref>{{Cite quran|15|26|e=32|s=ns}}</ref> and was banished from ''[[Jannah]]'' ([[Paradise]]).\n\nAccording to the Quran, God had already decided before the creation of Adam that mankind (Adam and his progeny) would be placed on earth. Islam does not describe mankind's life on earth as a punishment, rather as part of God's plan.\n\n\"'Verily, I am going to place mankind generations after generations on earth.'  They (the angels) said: 'Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, while we (the angels) glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You?'  God said: 'I know that which you do not know.'\"\n<br />\n\nGod then teaches Adam the names of all things and assembles the angels in front of Adam so as to show them that there is more to Adam than they know, particularly the high intellectual capacity of Adam:<blockquote>\"And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\" They said: \"Glory to Thee (said the angels), of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth, it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom.\" He said: \"O Adam! Tell them their names.\" When he had told them, God said (to the angels): \"Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what to reveal and what to conceal?\"</blockquote>God commands the angels to bow down to Adam.  All obey, except for Iblis, who feels that is made from fire, should not be bowing to Adam who was made from earth. His disobedience of God's command followed by pride caused to fall out of God's favour:<blockquote>\"And behold, We said to the angels: \"Bow down to Adam\" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused He was of those who reject faith (those who are disobedient).\" (2:34)</blockquote>God later places Adam and  Eve in the garden and tells them that they are free to enjoy of its fruits except not to come near a certain tree: (2:35)<blockquote>\"We said: \"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.\"</blockquote>Satan then deceives Adam and Eve into eating of the fruits of the tree: (2:36)<blockquote>\"Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: \"Get ye down, all (ye people), with some of you having enmity towards others. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time.\"</blockquote>Adam and Eve feel a lot of remorse for their actions, but God turns to Adam in mercy and consoles him: (2:37)<blockquote>\"Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord Turned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.\"</blockquote>God then informs Adam that God will send his guidance to Adam and his progeny: (2:38)<blockquote>\"We said: \"Get down all of you from this place (the garden), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.\"</blockquote>In the Garden of Eden, [[Satan#Islam|Satan]] (often identified as Iblis) lures [[Adam and Eve]] into disobeying God by tasting the fruit from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|forbidden tree]].

An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.\n\nIn industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying [[environmental degradation]] and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.<ref>Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].</ref> Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], anarchist-controlled territories undertook several environmental reforms, which were possibly the largest in the world at the time.

Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities.

Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]]'', which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in [[Yosemite Valley]] and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form [[Yosemite National Park]] and went on to set up the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.\n\nIn the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the [[American bison]]. The death of the last [[passenger pigeon]] as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and to popularise their concerns. In 1916, the [[National Park Service]] was founded by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]].\n\nThe [[Forestry Commission]] was set up in 1919 in Britain to increase the amount of woodland in Britain by buying land for [[afforestation]] and [[reforestation]].

It explained Leopold's belief that humankind should have moral respect for the environment and that it is unethical to harm it. The book is sometimes called the most influential book on conservation.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and beyond, photography was used to enhance public awareness of the need for protecting land and recruiting members to environmental organisations. [[David Brower]], [[Ansel Adams]] and [[Nancy Newhall]] created the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series, which helped raise public environmental awareness and brought a rapidly increasing flood of new members to the Sierra Club and to the environmental movement in general. \"This Is Dinosaur\" edited by [[Wallace Stegner]] with photographs by [[Martin Litton (environmentalist)|Martin Litton]] and [[Philip Hyde (photographer)|Philip Hyde]] prevented the building of dams within [[Dinosaur National Monument]] by becoming part of a new kind of activism called environmentalism that combined the conservationist ideals of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir with hard-hitting advertising, lobbying, book distribution, letter writing campaigns, and more. The powerful use of photography in addition to the written word for conservation dated back to the creation of [[Yosemite National Park]], when photographs persuaded Abraham Lincoln to preserve the beautiful glacier carved landscape for all time. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series galvanised public opposition to building dams in the [[Grand Canyon]] and protected many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often led a coalition of many environmental groups including the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]] and many others.\n\nAfter a focus on preserving wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other groups broadened their focus to include such issues as air and water pollution, population concern, and curbing the [[exploitation of natural resources]].\n\n===Post-war expansion===\n{{See also | Steady-state economy #Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns }}\nIn 1962, ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] was published.

The book's legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. With this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills, and environmental interest grew. New pressure groups formed, notably [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth (US)]], as well as notable local organisations such as the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]], which was founded in 1967.\n\nIn the 1970s, the environmental movement gained rapid speed around the world as a productive outgrowth of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movement.<ref>/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/opinion/in-praise-of-the-counterculture.html</ref>\n\nThe world's first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the [[United Tasmania Group]] [[Tasmania|Tasmania, Australia]] and the [[Values Party]] of New Zealand.<ref name=\"Dann, Christine\">{{cite web |last=Dann|first=Christine|title=The development of the first two Green parties New Zealand and Tasmania|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/literature/dann/chapterfive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515170932/http://www.globalgreens.org/literature/dann/chapterfive.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 May 2011|work=From Earth's last islands.

The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the [[Ecology Party]], and then the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]].\n\nProtection of the environment also became important in the [[developing world]]; the [[Chipko movement]] was formed in India under the influence of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mhatmas Gandhi]] and they set up peaceful resistance to [[deforestation]] by literally hugging trees (leading to the term \"tree huggers\"). Their peaceful methods of protest and slogan \"ecology is permanent economy\" were very influential.\n\nAnother milestone in the movement was the creation of [[Earth Day]]. Earth Day was first observed in San Francisco and other cities on 21 March 1970, the first day of spring. It was created to give awareness to environmental issues. On 21 March 1971, United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of a [[spaceship Earth]] on Earth Day, hereby referring to the [[ecosystem services]] the earth supplies to us, and hence our obligation to protect it (and with it, ourselves). Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the [[Earth Day Network]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthday.net/ |title=Resource temporarily unavailable |publisher=Earthday.net |accessdate=22 April 2011}}</ref> and is celebrated in more than 192 countries every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/earth-day-2019/story?id=62552199|title=Earth Day 2019: Everything you need to know|publisher=abcnews.go.com |date=22 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe UN's first major conference on international environmental issues, the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (also known as the Stockholm Conference), was held on 5\u201316 June 1972. It marked a turning point in the development of international environmental politics.<ref name=\"Baylis3\">John Baylis, Steve Smith. 2005. The Globalization of World Politics (3rd ed). Oxford. Oxford University Press. pp. 454\u201355</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1970s, many felt that people were on the edge of environmental catastrophe. The [[Back-to-the-land movement]] started to form and ideas of environmental ethics joined with [[anti-Vietnam War]] sentiments and other political issues. These individuals lived outside normal society and started to take on some of the more radical environmental theories such as [[deep ecology]]. Around this time more mainstream environmentalism was starting to show force with the signing of the [[Endangered Species Act]] in 1973 and the formation of [[CITES]] in 1975. Significant amendments were also enacted to the United States [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]<ref>Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, {{usstat|84|1676}}, {{uspl|91|604}}, 31 December 1970.</ref> and [[Clean Water Act]].<ref>[http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=68261&documentId=70515&glinID=70515 Pub.L. 95-217] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229205148/http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=68261&documentId=70515&glinID=70515 |date=29 February 2012 }}, 27 December 1977.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, [[James Lovelock]], a British scientist, published ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth'', which put forth the [[Gaia hypothesis]]; it proposes that life on earth can be understood as a single organism. This became an important part of the [[Deep Green Resistance|Deep Green]] ideology. Throughout the rest of the history of environmentalism there has been debate and argument between more radical followers of this Deep Green ideology and more mainstream environmentalists.\n\n===21st century and beyond===\nEnvironmentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as [[global warming]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[plastic pollution]].\n\nResearch demonstrates a precipitous decline in the US public's interest in 19 different areas of environmental concern.<ref>{{cite journal|author=McCallum, M.L.|author2=G.W.

Because of these divisions, the environmental movement can be categorized into these primary focuses: [[environmental science]], environmental activism, environmental advocacy, and [[environmental justice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/enviro-j/|title=American Environmental Justice Movement |publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Free market environmentalism===\n{{Main|Free-market environmentalism}}\n\nFree market environmentalism is a theory that argues that the [[free market]], [[property rights]], and [[tort]] law provide the best tools to preserve the health and [[sustainability]] of the environment. It considers environmental stewardship to be natural, as well as the expulsion of polluters and other aggressors through individual and [[class action]].\n\n===Evangelical environmentalism===\n{{Main|Evangelical environmentalism}}\n\nEvangelical environmentalism is an environmental movement in the United States of America in which some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] have emphasized [[Bible|biblical]] mandates concerning humanity's role as steward and subsequent responsibility for the care taking of Creation. While the movement has focused on different environmental issues, it is best known for its focus of addressing climate action from a biblically grounded [[theology|theological]] perspective. This movement is controversial among some non-Christian environmentalists due to its rooting in a specific religion.\n\n===Preservation and conservation===\n{{Main|Conservation movement|Conservation in the United States}}\n\nEnvironmental preservation in the United States and other parts of the world, including Australia, is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing, often to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Cunningham\n  | first = William P.\n  | display-authors = etal\n  | title = Environmental encyclopedia\n  | publisher = Gale Research\n  | year = 1998\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc02cunn\n  | isbn = 978-0-8103-9314-1\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}</ref> Regulations and laws may be enacted for the preservation of natural resources.\n\n==Organisations and conferences==\n{{Main|List of environmental organizations}}\n[[File:ReefDoctor work station in Ifaty, Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Reef doctor work station in [[Tsifota|Ifaty]], [[Madagascar]]]]\n\nEnvironmental organisations can be global, regional, national or local; they can be government-run or private ([[NGO]]). Environmentalist activity exists in almost every country. Moreover, groups dedicated to community development and social justice also focus on environmental concerns.\n\nSome US environmental organisations, among them the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], specialise in bringing lawsuits (a tactic seen as particularly useful in that country). Other groups, such as the US-based [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[Earth Day]], [[National Cleanup Day]], [[the Nature Conservancy]], and [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and global groups like the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Friends of the Earth]], disseminate information, participate in [[Hearing (law)|public hearings]], [[Lobbying|lobby]], [[Demonstration (people)|stage demonstrations]], and may purchase land for [[Nature reserve|preservation]]. Statewide nonprofit organisations such as the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]] often collaborate with these national organisations and employ similar strategies. Smaller groups, including [[Wildlife Conservation International]], conduct research on [[endangered species]] and [[ecosystems]]. More radical organisations, such as [[Greenpeace]], [[Earth First!]], and the [[Earth Liberation Front]], have more directly opposed actions they regard as environmentally harmful. While Greenpeace is devoted to nonviolent confrontation as a means of bearing witness to environmental wrongs and bringing issues into the public realm for debate, the underground ''Earth Liberation Front'' engages in the clandestine destruction of property, the release of caged or penned animals, and other criminal acts. Such tactics are regarded as unusual within the movement, however.\n\nOn an international level, concern for the environment was the subject of a [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in Stockholm in 1972, attended by 114 nations. Out of this meeting developed [[UNEP]] ([[United Nations Environment Programme]]) and the follow-up [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in 1992. Other international organisations in support of environmental policies development include the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]] (as part of [[NAFTA]]), the [[European Environment Agency]] (EEA), and the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC).\n\n==Environmental protests==\n[[File:ClimateCampBAA.jpg|thumb|Climate activists blockade [[British Airports Authority]]'s headquarters for day of action]]\n[[File:March Against Monsanto Vancouver.jpg|thumb|\"[[March Against Monsanto]]\", Vancouver, Canada, 25 May 2013]]\n{{Main|List of environmental protests}}\n\nNotable environmental protests and campaigns include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[2010 Xinfa aluminum plant protest]]\n* [[Anti-WAAhnsinns Festival]]\n* [[Car-Free Days]]\n* [[Camp for Climate Action]]\n* [[Campaign against Climate Change]]\n* [[Climate Rush]]\n* [[Cof\u00e1n people#Oil drilling|Cof\u00e1n people oil drilling protest (Ecuador)]]\n* [[Earth Day]]\n* [[Earth First!]]\n* [[Earthlife Africa]]\n* [[Global Climate Strike (disambiguation)|Global Climate Strike]]s<!--Intentional link to DAB page--><ref>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/climate-crisis-6-million-people-join-latest-wave-of-worldwide-protests</ref><ref>https://www.vox.com/2019/9/17/20864740/greta-thunberg-youth-climate-strike-fridays-future</ref>\n* [[Global Day of Action]]\n* [[Gurindji Strike]]\n* [[Hands off our Forest]]\n* [[Homes before Roads]]\n* [[Kupa Piti Kungka Tjuta]]\n* [[Love Canal protests]]\n* [[March Against Monsanto]]\n* [[Nevada Desert Experience]]\n* [[Plane Mad]]\n* [[Plane Stupid]]\n* [[Qidong protest]]\n* [[Save Manapouri Campaign]]\n* [[Say Yes demonstrations]]\n* [[Shifang protest]]\n* [[Stop Climate Chaos]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Environmentalists==\n{{Main|Environmentalist}}\n\nNotable advocates for [[environmental protection]] and [[sustainability]] include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Edward Abbey]] (author)\n* [[David Attenborough]] (broadcaster, naturalist)\n* [[John James Audubon]] (naturalist)\n* [[Judi Bari]] (environmentalist)\n* [[Frances Beinecke]] (environmentalist and former president of the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]])\n* [[David Bellamy]] (botanist)\n* [[Wendell Berry]] (farmer, philosopher)\n* [[Murray Bookchin]] (anarchist, philosopher, social ecologist)\n* [[Erin Brockovich]] (environmental lawyer and activist)\n* [[David Brower]] (writer, activist)\n* [[Lester Brown]] (environmental analyst, author)\n* [[Carol Browner]] (lawyer and activist)\n* [[Kevin Buzzacott]] (Aboriginal activist)\n* [[Berta Caceres]] (environmental and indigenous rights activist)\n* [[Helen Caldicott]] (medical doctor)\n* [[Rachel Carson]] (biologist, writer)\n* [[Majora Carter]] (urban revitalization strategist)\n* [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] (British Royal Family member)\n* [[Barry Commoner]] (biologist, politician)\n* [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau]] (explorer, ecologist)\n* [[Herman Daly]] ([[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]])\n* [[Peter Dauvergne]] (political scientist)\n* [[Laurie David]] (activist and producer)\n* [[Marina DeBris]] (environmental artist)\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] (actor and environmentalist)<ref>{{cite web | title=Leonardo DiCaprio  | website=World Wildlife Fund | url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/leaders/leonardo-dicaprio | accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Sylvia Earle]] (marine biologist)\n* [[Elizabeth Economy]] (China environment expert)\n* [[Paul R.

An Alkali inspector and four sub-inspectors were appointed to curb this pollution. The responsibilities of the inspectorate were gradually expanded, culminating in the Alkali Order 1958 which placed all major heavy industries that emitted [[smoke]], grit, dust and fumes under supervision.\n\nIn industrial cities local experts and reformers, especially after 1890, took the lead in identifying [[environmental degradation]] and pollution, and initiating grass-roots movements to demand and achieve reforms.<ref>Harold L. Platt, ''Shock cities: the environmental transformation and reform of Manchester and Chicago'' (2005) [https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Cities-Environmental-Transformation-Manchester/dp/0226670767/  excerpt].</ref> Typically the highest priority went to water and air pollution. The [[Environmental Protection UK|Coal Smoke Abatement Society]] was formed in 1898 making it one of the oldest environmental NGOs. It was founded by artist Sir [[William Blake Richmond]], frustrated with the pall cast by coal smoke. Although there were earlier pieces of legislation, the [[Public Health Act 1875]] required all furnaces and fireplaces to consume their own smoke. It also provided for sanctions against factories that emitted large amounts of black smoke. The provisions of this law were extended in 1926 with the Smoke Abatement Act to include other emissions, such as soot, ash and gritty particles and to empower local authorities to impose their own regulations.\n\nDuring the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]], anarchist-controlled territories undertook several environmental reforms, which were possibly the largest in the world at the time.

Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead (a byproduct of town gas production) which produces minimal smoke. 'Smoke control areas' were introduced in some towns and cities where only smokeless fuels could be burnt and power stations were relocated away from cities.

By 1900, public support for the organisation had grown, and it had over 25,000 members. The [[Garden city movement]] incorporated many environmental concerns into its [[urban planning]] manifesto; the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]] and [[The Clarion]] movement also began to advocate measures of [[nature conservation]].<ref>Gould, (1988) pp. 16, 23\u201324, 36\u201338, 84\u201386.</ref>\n\n[[File:Walden Thoreau.jpg|thumb|left|Original title page of ''[[Walden]]'' by [[Henry David Thoreau]].]]\n[[Environmental movement in the United States|The movement in the United States]] began in the late 19th century, out of concerns for protecting the natural resources of the West, with individuals such as [[John Muir]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] making key philosophical contributions. Thoreau was interested in peoples' relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life. He published his experiences in the book ''[[Walden]]'', which argues that people should become intimately close with nature. Muir came to believe in nature's inherent right, especially after spending time hiking in [[Yosemite Valley]] and studying both the ecology and geology. He successfully lobbied congress to form [[Yosemite National Park]] and went on to set up the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892. The conservationist principles as well as the belief in an inherent right of nature were to become the bedrock of modern environmentalism.\n\nIn the 20th century, environmental ideas continued to grow in popularity and recognition. Efforts were starting to be made to save some wildlife, particularly the [[American bison]]. The death of the last [[passenger pigeon]] as well as the endangerment of the American bison helped to focus the minds of conservationists and to popularise their concerns. In 1916, the [[National Park Service]] was founded by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]].\n\nThe [[Forestry Commission]] was set up in 1919 in Britain to increase the amount of woodland in Britain by buying land for [[afforestation]] and [[reforestation]]. The commission was also tasked with promoting forestry and the production of timber for trade.<ref name=woodland>{{cite journal|title=Forestry Commission \u2013 a brief history|publisher=Woodland Trust|url=http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/campaigning/save-ancient-forests/Documents/a-brief-history-of-the-fc.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref> During the 1920s the Commission focused on acquiring land to begin planting out new forests; much of the land was previously used for agricultural purposes.

The concept of the ''Dauerwald'' (best translated as the \"perpetual forest\") which included concepts such as [[forest management]] and protection was promoted and efforts were also made to curb [[air pollution]].<ref>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/technology_and_culture/v048/48.1olsen.html Jonathan Olsen \"How Green Were the Nazis?

It explained Leopold's belief that humankind should have moral respect for the environment and that it is unethical to harm it. The book is sometimes called the most influential book on conservation.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and beyond, photography was used to enhance public awareness of the need for protecting land and recruiting members to environmental organisations. [[David Brower]], [[Ansel Adams]] and [[Nancy Newhall]] created the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series, which helped raise public environmental awareness and brought a rapidly increasing flood of new members to the Sierra Club and to the environmental movement in general. \"This Is Dinosaur\" edited by [[Wallace Stegner]] with photographs by [[Martin Litton (environmentalist)|Martin Litton]] and [[Philip Hyde (photographer)|Philip Hyde]] prevented the building of dams within [[Dinosaur National Monument]] by becoming part of a new kind of activism called environmentalism that combined the conservationist ideals of Thoreau, Leopold and Muir with hard-hitting advertising, lobbying, book distribution, letter writing campaigns, and more. The powerful use of photography in addition to the written word for conservation dated back to the creation of [[Yosemite National Park]], when photographs persuaded Abraham Lincoln to preserve the beautiful glacier carved landscape for all time. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series galvanised public opposition to building dams in the [[Grand Canyon]] and protected many other national treasures. The Sierra Club often led a coalition of many environmental groups including the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]] and many others.\n\nAfter a focus on preserving wilderness in the 1950s and 1960s, the Sierra Club and other groups broadened their focus to include such issues as air and water pollution, population concern, and curbing the [[exploitation of natural resources]].\n\n===Post-war expansion===\n{{See also | Steady-state economy #Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns }}\nIn 1962, ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by American biologist [[Rachel Carson]] was published. The book cataloged the environmental impacts of the indiscriminate spraying of [[DDT]] in the US and questioned the logic of releasing large amounts of chemicals into the environment without fully understanding their effects on human health and ecology. The book suggested that DDT and other pesticides may cause [[cancer]] and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds.<ref name=\"Silent Spring\">{{cite book |title=Silent Spring |first=Rachel |last=Carson |authorlink=Rachel Carson |year=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8093-2218-3|title-link=Silent Spring }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The resulting public concern led to the creation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1970 which subsequently banned the agricultural use of DDT in the US in 1972. The limited use of DDT in [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vector]] control continues to this day in certain parts of the world and remains controversial. The book's legacy was to produce a far greater awareness of environmental issues and interest into how people affect the environment. With this new interest in environment came interest in problems such as air pollution and petroleum spills, and environmental interest grew. New pressure groups formed, notably [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth (US)]], as well as notable local organisations such as the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]], which was founded in 1967.\n\nIn the 1970s, the environmental movement gained rapid speed around the world as a productive outgrowth of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] movement.<ref>/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/11/opinion/in-praise-of-the-counterculture.html</ref>\n\nThe world's first political parties to campaign on a predominantly environmental platform were the [[United Tasmania Group]] [[Tasmania|Tasmania, Australia]] and the [[Values Party]] of New Zealand.<ref name=\"Dann, Christine\">{{cite web |last=Dann|first=Christine|title=The development of the first two Green parties New Zealand and Tasmania|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/literature/dann/chapterfive.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515170932/http://www.globalgreens.org/literature/dann/chapterfive.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 May 2011|work=From Earth's last islands.

The first national green party in Europe was PEOPLE, founded in Britain in February 1973, which eventually turned into the [[Ecology Party]], and then the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]].\n\nProtection of the environment also became important in the [[developing world]]; the [[Chipko movement]] was formed in India under the influence of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mhatmas Gandhi]] and they set up peaceful resistance to [[deforestation]] by literally hugging trees (leading to the term \"tree huggers\"). Their peaceful methods of protest and slogan \"ecology is permanent economy\" were very influential.\n\nAnother milestone in the movement was the creation of [[Earth Day]]. Earth Day was first observed in San Francisco and other cities on 21 March 1970, the first day of spring. It was created to give awareness to environmental issues. On 21 March 1971, United Nations Secretary-General U Thant spoke of a [[spaceship Earth]] on Earth Day, hereby referring to the [[ecosystem services]] the earth supplies to us, and hence our obligation to protect it (and with it, ourselves). Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the [[Earth Day Network]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthday.net/ |title=Resource temporarily unavailable |publisher=Earthday.net |accessdate=2011-04-22}}</ref> and is celebrated in more than 192 countries every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/earth-day-2019/story?id=62552199|title=Earth Day 2019: Everything you need to know|publisher=abcnews.go.com |date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe UN's first major conference on international environmental issues, the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (also known as the Stockholm Conference), was held on 5\u201316 June 1972. It marked a turning point in the development of international environmental politics.<ref name=\"Baylis3\">John Baylis, Steve Smith. 2005. The Globalization of World Politics (3rd ed). Oxford.

The [[Back-to-the-land movement]] started to form and ideas of environmental ethics joined with [[anti-Vietnam War]] sentiments and other political issues. These individuals lived outside normal society and started to take on some of the more radical environmental theories such as [[deep ecology]]. Around this time more mainstream environmentalism was starting to show force with the signing of the [[Endangered Species Act]] in 1973 and the formation of [[CITES]] in 1975. Significant amendments were also enacted to the United States [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]<ref>Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, {{usstat|84|1676}}, {{uspl|91|604}}, 1970-12-31.</ref> and [[Clean Water Act]].<ref>[http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=68261&documentId=70515&glinID=70515 Pub.L. 95-217] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229205148/http://www.glin.gov/download.action?fulltextId=68261&documentId=70515&glinID=70515 |date=29 February 2012 }}, 27 December 1977.</ref>\n\nIn 1979, [[James Lovelock]], a British scientist, published ''Gaia: A new look at life on Earth'', which put forth the [[Gaia hypothesis]]; it proposes that life on earth can be understood as a single organism. This became an important part of the [[Deep Green Resistance|Deep Green]] ideology. Throughout the rest of the history of environmentalism there has been debate and argument between more radical followers of this Deep Green ideology and more mainstream environmentalists.\n\n===21st century and beyond===\nEnvironmentalism continues to evolve to face up to new issues such as [[global warming]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[plastic pollution]].\n\nResearch demonstrates a precipitous decline in the US public's interest in 19 different areas of environmental concern.<ref>{{cite journal|author=McCallum, M.L.|author2=G.W.

Because of these divisions, the environmental movement can be categorized into these primary focuses: [[environmental science]], environmental activism, environmental advocacy, and [[environmental justice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/enviro-j/|title=American Environmental Justice Movement |publisher= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Free market environmentalism===\n{{Main|Free-market environmentalism}}\n\nFree market environmentalism is a theory that argues that the [[free market]], [[property rights]], and [[tort]] law provide the best tools to preserve the health and [[sustainability]] of the environment. It considers environmental stewardship to be natural, as well as the expulsion of polluters and other aggressors through individual and [[class action]].\n\n===Evangelical environmentalism===\n{{Main|Evangelical environmentalism}}\n\nEvangelical environmentalism is an environmental movement in the United States of America in which some [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] have emphasized [[Bible|biblical]] mandates concerning humanity's role as steward and subsequent responsibility for the care taking of Creation. While the movement has focused on different environmental issues, it is best known for its focus of addressing climate action from a biblically grounded [[theology|theological]] perspective. This movement is controversial among some non-Christian environmentalists due to its rooting in a specific religion.\n\n===Preservation and conservation===\n{{Main|Conservation movement|Conservation in the United States}}\n\nEnvironmental preservation in the United States and other parts of the world, including Australia, is viewed as the setting aside of natural resources to prevent damage caused by contact with humans or by certain human activities, such as logging, mining, hunting, and fishing, often to replace them with new human activities such as tourism and recreation.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Cunningham\n  | first = William P.\n  | display-authors = etal\n  | title = Environmental encyclopedia\n  | publisher = Gale Research\n  | year = 1998\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc02cunn\n  | isbn = 978-0-8103-9314-1\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}</ref> Regulations and laws may be enacted for the preservation of natural resources.\n\n==Organisations and conferences==\n{{Main|List of environmental organizations}}\n[[File:ReefDoctor work station in Ifaty, Madagascar.jpg|thumb|Reef doctor work station in [[Tsifota|Ifaty]], [[Madagascar]]]]\n\nEnvironmental organisations can be global, regional, national or local; they can be government-run or private ([[NGO]]). Environmentalist activity exists in almost every country. Moreover, groups dedicated to community development and social justice also focus on environmental concerns.\n\nSome US environmental organisations, among them the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], specialise in bringing lawsuits (a tactic seen as particularly useful in that country). Other groups, such as the US-based [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[Earth Day]], [[National Cleanup Day]], [[the Nature Conservancy]], and [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and global groups like the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Friends of the Earth]], disseminate information, participate in [[Hearing (law)|public hearings]], [[Lobbying|lobby]], [[Demonstration (people)|stage demonstrations]], and may purchase land for [[Nature reserve|preservation]]. Statewide nonprofit organisations such as the [[Wyoming Outdoor Council]] often collaborate with these national organisations and employ similar strategies. Smaller groups, including [[Wildlife Conservation International]], conduct research on [[endangered species]] and [[ecosystems]]. More radical organisations, such as [[Greenpeace]], [[Earth First!]], and the [[Earth Liberation Front]], have more directly opposed actions they regard as environmentally harmful. While Greenpeace is devoted to nonviolent confrontation as a means of bearing witness to environmental wrongs and bringing issues into the public realm for debate, the underground ''Earth Liberation Front'' engages in the clandestine destruction of property, the release of caged or penned animals, and other criminal acts. Such tactics are regarded as unusual within the movement, however.\n\nOn an international level, concern for the environment was the subject of a [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in Stockholm in 1972, attended by 114 nations.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.
