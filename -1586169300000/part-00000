{"title_page": "Belt (mechanical)", "text_new": "{{Short description|Method of connecting two rotating shafts or pulleys}}\n[[File:Flachriemen.png|thumb|Flat belt]]\n[[File:HagleyBeltDrive01.jpg|thumb|Flat belt drive in the machine shop at the [[Hagley Museum and Library|Hagley Museum]]]]\nA '''belt''' is a loop of flexible material used to link two or more rotating [[Drive shaft|shafts]] mechanically, most often parallel. Belts may be used as a source of motion, to [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmit power]] efficiently or to track relative movement. Belts are looped over [[pulley]]s and may have a twist between the pulleys, and the shafts need not be parallel.\n\nIn a two pulley system, the belt can either drive the pulleys normally in one direction (the same if on parallel shafts), or the belt may be crossed, so that the direction of the driven shaft is reversed (the opposite direction to the driver if on parallel shafts). As a source of motion, a [[conveyor belt]] is one application where the belt is adapted to carry a load continuously between two points. The belt drive can also be used to change the speed of rotation, either up or down, by using different sized pulleys.\n\n==History==\nThe mechanical belt drive, using a [[pulley]] machine, was first mentioned in the text the ''Dictionary of Local Expressions'' by the Han Dynasty philosopher, poet, and politician [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53\u201318 BC) in 15 BC, used for a [[quilling]] machine that wound [[silk]] fibers on to [[bobbin]]s for [[Weaving|weavers']] shuttles.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 9 207208\">Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 207\u2013208.</ref> The belt drive is an essential component to the invention of the [[spinning wheel]].<ref name=\"Needham 1986\">Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 108.</ref><ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 9 160163\">Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 160\u2013163.</ref> The belt drive was not only used in textile technologies, it was also applied to hydraulic-powered bellows dated from the 1st century AD.<ref name=\"Needham 1986\"/>\n\n== Power transmission ==\nBelts are the cheapest utility for power transmission between shafts that may not be axially aligned.  Power transmission is achieved by purposely designed belts and pulleys. The variety of power transmission needs that can be met by a belt-drive transmission system are numerous, and this has led to many variations on the theme. Belt drives run smoothly and with little noise, and provide shock absorption for motors, loads, and bearings when the force and power needed changes.  A drawback to belt drives is that they transmit less power than gears or chain drives.  However, improvements in belt engineering allow use of belts in systems that only formerly allowed chain drives or gears.\n\nPower transmitted between a belt and a pulley is expressed as the product of difference of tension and belt velocity:\n\n:<math>P = (T_1 - T_2)v,</math>\n\nwhere, ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> are tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt respectively. They are related as\n\n:<math>\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = e^{\\mu\\alpha},</math>\n\nwhere, \u03bc is the coefficient of friction, and \u03b1 is the angle (in radians) subtended by contact surface at the centre of the pulley.\n\n===Pros and cons===\nBelt drives are simple, inexpensive, and do not require axially aligned shafts.  They help protect machinery from overload and jam, and damp and isolate noise and vibration.  Load fluctuations are shock-absorbed (cushioned).  They need no lubrication and minimal maintenance.  They have high efficiency (90\u201398%, usually 95%), high tolerance for misalignment, and are of relatively low cost if the shafts are far apart.  Clutch action is activated by releasing belt tension.  Different speeds can be obtained by stepped or tapered pulleys.\n\nThe angular-velocity ratio may not be constant or equal to that of the pulley diameters, due to slip and stretch. However, this problem has been largely solved by the use of toothed belts. Working temperatures range from - 35\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C.  Adjustment of center distance or addition of an idler pulley is crucial to compensate for wear and stretch.\n\n=== Flat belts ===\n[[File:Transmissionsriemen.jpg|thumb|right|The drive belt: used to transfer power from the engine's flywheel. Here shown driving a [[threshing machine]].]]\n[[File:Wide flat belt.JPG|thumb|A small section of a wide flat belt made of layers of leather with the fastener on one end, shown in an exhibit at the [[Suffolk Mills]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]]]\nFlat belts were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in [[line shaft]]ing to transmit power in factories.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" >By Rhys Jenkins, Newcomen Society, (1971). ''Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times'', Ayer Publishing. Page 34, {{ISBN|0-8369-2167-4}}.</ref> They were also used in countless [[agriculture|farming]], [[mining]], and [[logging]] applications, such as [[bucksaw]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[threshing machine|threshers]], [[silo|silo blowers]], [[conveyor system|conveyors]] for filling [[corn crib]]s or [[hayloft]]s, [[baler]]s, water [[pump]]s (for [[water well|wells]], mines, or [[swamp]]y farm fields), and [[electrical generator]]s. Flat belts are still used today, although not nearly as much as in the line-shaft era. The flat belt is a simple system of power transmission that was well suited for its day. It can deliver high power at high speeds&nbsp;(373&nbsp;kW at 51&nbsp;m/s), in cases of wide belts and large pulleys. But these wide-belt-large-pulley drives are bulky, consuming lots of space while requiring high tension, leading to high loads, and are poorly suited to close-centers applications, so V-belts have mainly replaced flat belts for short-distance power transmission; and longer-distance power transmission is typically no longer done with belts at all. For example, factory machines now tend to have individual electric motors.\n\nBecause flat belts tend to climb towards the higher side of the pulley, pulleys were made with a slightly convex or \"crowned\" surface (rather than flat) to allow the belt to self-center as it runs. Flat belts also tend to slip on the pulley face when heavy loads are applied, and many proprietary [[#Belt dressing|belt dressings]] were available that could be applied to the belts to increase friction, and so power transmission.\n\nFlat belts were traditionally made of leather or fabric. Today most are made of rubber or synthetic polymers. Grip of leather belts is often better if they are assembled with the hair side (outer side) of the leather against the pulley, although some belts are instead given a half-twist before joining the ends (forming a [[M\u00f6bius strip]]), so that wear can be evenly distributed on both sides of the belt. Belts ends are joined by lacing the ends together with leather thonging (the oldest of the methods),<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.farmcollector.com/Looking-Back/How-To-Lace-A-Flat-Belt.aspx\n | title = How to lace a flat belt\n | author = James N.

Flat belts were traditionally jointed, and still usually are, but they can also be made with endless construction.\n\n=== Rope drives ===\nIn the mid 19th century, British millwrights discovered that multi-grooved pulleys connected by [[rope]]s outperformed flat pulleys connected by leather belts.  [[Wire rope]]s were occasionally used, but [[cotton]], [[hemp]], [[Manila rope|manila hemp]] and [[flax]] rope saw the widest use.  Typically, the rope connecting two pulleys with multiple V-grooves was spliced into a single loop that traveled along a [[Helix|helical]] path before being returned to its starting position by an [[idler pulley]] that also served to maintain the tension on the rope.  Sometimes, a single rope was used to transfer power from one multiple-groove drive pulley to several single- or multiple-groove driven pulleys in this way.\n\nIn general, as with flat belts, rope drives were used for connections from [[Stationary steam engine|stationary engines]] to the [[jack shaft]]s and [[line shaft]]s of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery.  Unlike leather belts, however, rope drives were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances.  Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the \"flying rope\", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.<ref>Robert Grimshaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJcPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA224Rope Drive for Power Transmission] [[Cassier's Magazine]] Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219\u2013224.</ref><ref>John J.

Note:  This journal is the house organ of the Dodge Manufacturing Company and is mostly devoted rope-power systems.</ref>\n\n=== Round belts ===\nRound belts are a circular cross section belt designed to run in a pulley with a 60 degree V-groove. Round grooves are only suitable for idler pulleys that guide the belt, or when (soft) O-ring type belts are used. The V-groove transmits torque through a wedging action, thus increasing friction. Nevertheless, round belts are for use in relatively low [[torque]] situations only and may be purchased in various lengths or cut to length and joined, either by a staple, a metallic connector (in the case of hollow plastic), gluing or welding (in the case of [[polyurethane]]). Early [[sewing machine]]s utilized a leather belt, joined either by a metal staple or glued, to great effect.\n\n=== Spring belts ===\n[[File:Rew3k04-002 spring belt transmission.jpg|thumb|A two-stage transmission using spring belts on a toy vehicle]]\nSpring belts are similar to rope or round belts but consist of a long steel helical spring. They are commonly found on toy or small model engines, typically steam engines driving other toys or models or providing a transmission between the crankshaft and other parts of a vehicle. The main advantage over rubber or other elastic belts is that they last much longer under poorly controlled operating conditions. The distance between the pulleys is also less critical. Their main disadvantage is that slippage is more likely due to the lower coefficient of friction. The ends of a spring belt can be joined either by bending the last turn of the helix at each end by 90 degrees to form hooks, or by reducing the diameter of the last few turns at one end so that it \"screws\" into the other end.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|V belts}} ===<!-- Other articles link here -->\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|Belts on a [[Yanmar 2GM20]] marine [[diesel engine]]]]\n[[File:Multiple-V-belt drive 001.jpg|thumb|A multiple-V-belt drive on an [[air compressor]]]]\nV belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) solved the slippage and alignment problem. It is now the basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly [[trapezoid]]al (hence the name \"V\"). The \"V\" shape of the belt tracks in a mating groove in the [[pulley]] (or sheave), with the result that the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases\u2014the greater the load, the greater the wedging action\u2014improving [[torque]] transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios.  The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys.  Optimal speed range is {{convert|1000|\u2013|7000|ft/min|abbr=on}}. V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.\n\nFor high-power requirements, two or more V-belts can be joined side-by-side in an arrangement called a multi-V, running on matching multi-groove sheaves. This is known as a multiple-V-belt drive (or sometimes a \"classical V-belt drive\").\n\nV-belts may be homogeneously rubber or polymer throughout, or there may be fibers embedded in the rubber or polymer for strength and reinforcement. The fibers may be of textile materials such as cotton, [[polyamide]] (such as [[Nylon]]) or polyester or, for greatest strength, of steel or [[aramid]] (such as [[Technora]], [[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]]).\n\nWhen an endless belt does not fit the need, jointed and link V-belts may be employed. Most models offer the same power and speed ratings as equivalently-sized endless belts and do not require special pulleys to operate. A link v-belt is a number of polyurethane/polyester composite links held together, either by themselves, such as Fenner Drives' PowerTwist, or Nu-T-Link (with metal studs). These provide easy installation and superior environmental resistance compared to rubber belts and are length-adjustable by disassembling and removing links when needed.\n\n====V-belt history====\nTrade journal coverage of V-belts in automobiles from 1916 mentioned leather as the belt material,<ref name=\"HorselessAge1916-04-15_p324\">{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |date=1916-04-15 |title=Radiator fans and their design |journal=Horseless Age |volume=37 |issue=8 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA324#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> and mentioned that the V angle was not yet well standardized.<ref name=\"HorselessAge1916-04-15_p322\">{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |date=1916-04-15 |title=S.A.E. divisions exhibit activity |journal=Horseless Age |volume=37 |issue=8 |page=322 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA322#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> The endless rubber V-belt was developed in 1917 by John Gates of the [[Charles Gates, Jr.|Gates Rubber Company]]. Multiple-V-belt drive was first arranged a few years later by Walter Geist of the [[Allis-Chalmers]] corporation, who was inspired to replace the single rope of multi-groove-sheave [[#Rope drives|rope drives]] with multiple V-belts running parallel. Geist filed for a patent in 1925, and Allis-Chalmers began marketing the drive under the \"Texrope\" brand; the patent was granted in 1928 ({{US Patent|1662511}}). The \"Texrope\" brand still exists, although it has changed ownership and no longer refers to multiple-V-belt drive alone.\n\n=== Multi-groove belts ===\nA multi-groove, V-Ribbed, or polygroove belt<ref>DIN 7867.</ref> is made up of usually between 3 and 24 \"V\" shaped sections alongside each other. This gives a thinner belt for the same drive surface, thus it is more flexible, although often wider. The added flexibility offers an improved efficiency, as less energy is wasted in the internal friction of continually bending the belt. In practice this gain of efficiency causes a reduced heating effect on the belt, and a cooler-running belt lasts longer in service. Belts are commercially available in several sizes, with usually a 'P' (sometimes omitted) and a single letter identifying the pitch between grooves. The 'PK' section with a pitch of 3.56&nbsp;mm is commonly used for automotive applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gates.com/~/media/files/gates/industrial/power-transmission/chart/gatescorporationbeltidchart.pdf|title=Gates Belt I.D. Chart}}</ref>\n\nA further advantage of the polygroove belt that makes them popular is that they can run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with V-belts with a single idler pulley for tensioning, a polygroove belt may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.<ref name=\"Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed, Polygroove belts\">{{cite book\n  |title=Automotive Handbook\n  |publisher=[[Robert Bosch GmbH]]\n  |year=1993\n  |page=304\n  |edition=3rd\n  |isbn=0-8376-0330-7\n  |ref=Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed\n}}</ref>\n\nAny V-belt's ability to drive pulleys depends on wrapping the belt around a sufficient angle of the pulley to provide grip. Where a single-V-belt is limited to a simple convex shape, it can adequately wrap at most three or possibly four pulleys, so can drive at most three accessories. Where more must be driven, such as for modern cars with power steering and air conditioning, multiple belts are required. As the polygroove belt can be bent into concave paths by external idlers, it can wrap any number of driven pulleys, limited only by the power capacity of the belt.<ref name=\"Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed, Polygroove belts\" />\n\nThis ability to bend the belt at the designer's whim allows it to take a complex or \"[[serpentine belt|serpentine]]\" path. This can assist the design of a compact engine layout, where the accessories are mounted more closely to the engine block and without the need to provide movable tensioning adjustments. The entire belt may be tensioned by a single idler pulley.\n\n=== Ribbed belt ===\nA ribbed belt is a power transmission belt featuring lengthwise grooves. It operates from contact between the ribs of the belt and the grooves in the pulley. Its single-piece structure is reported to offer an even distribution of tension across the width of the pulley where the belt is in contact, a power range up to 600&nbsp;kW, a high speed ratio, serpentine drives (possibility to drive off the back of the belt), long life, stability and homogeneity of the drive tension, and reduced vibration. The ribbed belt may be fitted on various applications: compressors, fitness bikes, agricultural machinery, food mixers, washing machines, lawn mowers, etc.\n\n===Film belts===\nThough often grouped with flat belts, they are actually a different kind.  They consist of a very thin belt (0.5\u201315 millimeters or 100\u20134000 micrometres) strip of plastic and occasionally rubber.  They are generally intended for low-power (less than 10 watts), high-speed uses, allowing high efficiency (up to 98%) and long life.  These are seen in business machines, printers, tape recorders, and other light-duty operations.\n\n=== Timing belts ===\n[[File:Timing belt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Timing belt]]\n[[File:F8hub.jpg|thumb|Belt-drive cog on a [[belt-driven bicycle]]]]\n[[Toothed belt|Timing belt]]s (also known as '''toothed''', '''notch''', '''cog''', or '''synchronous''' belts) are a ''positive'' transfer belt and can track relative movement. These belts have teeth that fit into a matching toothed pulley. When correctly tensioned, they have no slippage, run at constant speed, and are often used to transfer direct motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used instead of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.  [[Camshaft]]s of automobiles, miniature timing systems, and [[stepper motor]]s often utilize these belts.  Timing belts need the least tension of all belts and are among the most efficient. They can bear up to {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} at speeds of {{convert|16,000|ft/min|abbr=on}}.\n\nTiming belts with a helical offset tooth design are available.  The helical offset tooth design forms a chevron pattern and causes the teeth to engage progressively.  The chevron pattern design is self-aligning and does not make the noise that some timing belts make at certain speeds, and is more efficient at transferring power (up to 98%).\n\nDisadvantages include a relatively high purchase cost, the need for specially fabricated toothed pulleys, less protection from overloading, jamming, and vibration due to their continuous tension cords, the lack of clutch action (only possible with friction-drive belts), and the fixed lengths, which do not allow length adjustment (unlike link V-belts or chains).\n\n=== Specialty belts ===\nBelts normally transmit power on the tension side of the loop.  However, designs for [[continuously variable transmission]]s exist that use belts that are a series of solid metal blocks, linked together as in a chain, transmitting power on the compression side of the loop.\n\n===Rolling roads===\nBelts used for [[Dynamometer#Chassis dynamometer (rolling road)|rolling roads]] for wind tunnels can be capable of {{convert|250|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arc.pininfarina.it/english/news.html |title=Pininfarina Aerodynamic and Aeroacoustic Research Center |publisher=Arc.pininfarina.it |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Standards for use==\n\nThe open belt drive has parallel shafts rotating in the same direction, whereas the cross-belt drive also bears parallel shafts but rotate in opposite direction.  The former is far more common, and the latter not appropriate for timing and standard V-belts unless there is a twist between each pulley so that the pulleys only contact the same belt surface. Nonparallel shafts can be connected if the belt's center line is aligned with the center plane of the pulley.  Industrial belts are usually reinforced rubber but sometimes leather types.  Non-leather, non-reinforced belts can only be used in light applications.\n\nThe pitch line is the line between the inner and outer surfaces that is neither subject to tension (like the outer surface) nor compression (like the inner).  It is midway through the surfaces in film and flat belts and dependent on cross-sectional shape and size in timing and V-belts. [[standard reference pitch diameter]] can be estimated by taking average of gear teeth tips diameter and gear teeth base diameter. The angular speed is inversely proportional to size, so the larger the one wheel, the less angular velocity, and vice versa.  Actual pulley speeds tend to be 0.5\u20131% less than generally calculated because of belt slip and stretch. In timing belts, the inverse ratio teeth of the belt contributes to the exact measurement.\nThe speed of the belt is:\n\nSpeed = Circumference based on [[Standard reference pitch diameter|pitch diameter]] \u00d7 angular speed in rpm\n\n===Selection criteria===\nBelt drives are built under the following required conditions: speeds of and power transmitted between drive and driven unit; suitable distance between shafts; and appropriate operating conditions. The equation for power is\n\n:power [kW] = ([[torque]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[newton-meter|N\u00b7m]]]) \u00d7 ([[rotational speed]] [rev/[[minute|min]]]) \u00d7 (2\u03c0 radians) / (60 [[second|s]] \u00d7 1000 W).\n\nFactors of power adjustment include speed ratio; shaft distance (long or short); type of drive unit (electric motor, internal combustion engine); service environment (oily, wet, dusty); driven unit loads (jerky, shock, reversed); and pulley-belt arrangement (open, crossed, turned).  These are found in engineering handbooks and manufacturer's literature. When corrected, the power is compared to rated powers of the standard belt cross-sections at particular belt speeds to find a number of arrays that perform best. Now the pulley diameters are chosen. It is generally either large diameters or large cross-section that are chosen, since, as stated earlier, larger belts transmit this same power at low belt speeds as smaller belts do at high speeds. To keep the driving part at its smallest, minimal-diameter pulleys are desired. Minimum pulley diameters are limited by the elongation of the belt's outer fibers as the belt wraps around the pulleys. Small pulleys increase this elongation, greatly reducing belt life. Minimal pulley diameters are often listed with each cross-section and speed, or listed separately by belt cross-section. After the cheapest diameters and belt section are chosen, the belt length is computed. If endless belts are used, the desired shaft spacing may need adjusting to accommodate standard-length belts. It is often more economical to use two or more juxtaposed V-belts, rather than one larger belt.\n\nIn large speed ratios or small central distances, the angle of contact between the belt and pulley may be less than 180\u00b0. If this is the case, the drive power must be further increased, according to manufacturer's tables, and the selection process repeated. This is because power capacities are based on the standard of a 180\u00b0 contact angle. Smaller contact angles mean less area for the belt to obtain traction, and thus the belt carries less power.\n\n===Belt friction===\n{{main|Belt friction}}\nBelt drives depend on [[friction]] to operate, but excessive friction wastes energy and rapidly wears the belt. Factors that affect belt friction include belt tension, contact angle, and the materials used to make the belt and pulleys.\n\n===Belt tension===\nPower transmission is a function of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads.  Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. Belt tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.\n\n===Belt wear===\nFatigue, more so than abrasion, is the culprit for most belt problems. This wear is caused by stress from rolling around the pulleys.  High belt tension; excessive slippage; adverse environmental conditions; and belt overloads caused by shock, vibration, or belt slapping all contribute to belt fatigue.\n\n===Belt vibration===\n[[Vibration]] signatures are widely used for studying belt drive malfunctions. Some of the common malfunctions or faults include the effects of belt [[Tension (physics)|tension]], speed, [[sheave]] [[Eccentricity (mechanics)|eccentricity]] and misalignment conditions. The effect of sheave Eccentricity on vibration signatures of the belt drive is quite significant. Although, vibration magnitude is not necessarily increased by this it will create strong amplitude modulation. When the top section of a belt is in [[Resonance energy transfer|resonance]], the vibrations of the machine is increased. However, an increase in the machine vibration is not significant when only the bottom section of the belt is in resonance. The vibration spectrum has the tendency to move to higher frequencies as the tension force of the belt is increased.\n\n===Belt dressing===\nBelt slippage can be addressed in several ways. Belt replacement is an obvious solution, and eventually the mandatory one (because no belt lasts forever). Often, though, before the replacement option is executed, retensioning (via pulley centerline adjustment) or dressing (with any of various coatings) may be successful to extend the belt's lifespan and postpone replacement. Belt dressings are typically liquids that are poured, brushed, dripped, or sprayed onto the belt surface and allowed to spread around; they are meant to recondition the belt's driving surfaces and increase friction between the belt and the pulleys. Some belt dressings are dark and sticky, resembling [[tar]] or [[syrup]]; some are thin and clear, resembling [[white spirit|mineral spirits]]. Some are sold to the public in [[aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] at auto parts stores; others are sold in drums only to industrial users.\n\n===Specifications===\nTo fully specify a belt, the material, length, and cross-section size and shape are required. Timing belts, in addition, require that the size of the teeth be given.\nThe length of the belt is the sum of the central length of the system on both sides, half the circumference of both pulleys, and the square of the sum (if crossed) or the difference (if open) of the radii. Thus, when dividing by the central distance, it can be visualized as the central distance times the height that gives the same squared value of the radius difference on, of course, both sides.  When adding to the length of either side, the length of the belt increases, in a similar manner to the Pythagorean theorem.  One important concept to remember is that as D<sub>1</sub> gets closer to D<sub>2</sub> there is less of a distance (and therefore less addition of length) until its approaches zero.\n\nOn the other hand, in a crossed belt drive the ''sum'' rather than the difference of radii is the basis for computation for length.  So the wider the small drive increases, the belt length is higher.\n\n==V-belt profiles==\n[[File:BeltProfiles.jpg|thumb|right]]\n[[File:V-belt angle.jpg|thumb|right|v-belt angle, XPZ & SPZ profile]]\nMetric v-belt profiles:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Belts may be used as a source of motion, to [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmit power]] efficiently or to track relative movement. Belts are looped over [[pulley]]s and may have a twist between the pulleys, and the shafts need not be parallel.\n\nIn a two pulley system, the belt can either drive the pulleys normally in one direction (the same if on parallel shafts), or the belt may be crossed, so that the direction of the driven shaft is reversed (the opposite direction to the driver if on parallel shafts). As a source of motion, a [[conveyor belt]] is one application where the belt is adapted to carry a load continuously between two points. The belt drive can also be used to change the speed of rotation, either up or down, by using different sized pulleys.\n\n==History==\nThe mechanical belt drive, using a [[pulley]] machine, was first mentioned in the text the ''Dictionary of Local Expressions'' by the Han Dynasty philosopher, poet, and politician [[Yang Xiong (author)|Yang Xiong]] (53\u201318 BC) in 15 BC, used for a [[quilling]] machine that wound [[silk]] fibers on to [[bobbin]]s for [[Weaving|weavers']] shuttles.<ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 9 207208\">Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 207\u2013208.</ref> The belt drive is an essential component to the invention of the [[spinning wheel]].<ref name=\"Needham 1986\">Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 108.</ref><ref name=\"needham volume 5 part 9 160163\">Needham (1988), Volume 5, Part 9, 160\u2013163.</ref> The belt drive was not only used in textile technologies, it was also applied to hydraulic-powered bellows dated from the 1st century AD.<ref name=\"Needham 1986\"/>\n\n== Power transmission ==\nBelts are the cheapest utility for power transmission between shafts that may not be axially aligned.  Power transmission is achieved by purposely designed belts and pulleys. The variety of power transmission needs that can be met by a belt-drive transmission system are numerous, and this has led to many variations on the theme. Belt drives run smoothly and with little noise, and provide shock absorption for motors, loads, and bearings when the force and power needed changes.  A drawback to belt drives is that they transmit less power than gears or chain drives.  However, improvements in belt engineering allow use of belts in systems that only formerly allowed chain drives or gears.\n\nPower transmitted between a belt and a pulley is expressed as the product of difference of tension and belt velocity:\n\n:<math>P = (T_1 - T_2)v,</math>\n\nwhere, ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> are tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt respectively. They are related as\n\n:<math>\\frac{T_1}{T_2} = e^{\\mu\\alpha},</math>\n\nwhere, \u03bc is the coefficient of friction, and \u03b1 is the angle (in radians) subtended by contact surface at the centre of the pulley.\n\n===Pros and cons===\nBelt drives are simple, inexpensive, and do not require axially aligned shafts.  They help protect machinery from overload and jam, and damp and isolate noise and vibration.  Load fluctuations are shock-absorbed (cushioned).  They need no lubrication and minimal maintenance.  They have high efficiency (90\u201398%, usually 95%), high tolerance for misalignment, and are of relatively low cost if the shafts are far apart.  Clutch action is activated by releasing belt tension.  Different speeds can be obtained by stepped or tapered pulleys.\n\nThe angular-velocity ratio may not be constant or equal to that of the pulley diameters, due to slip and stretch. However, this problem has been largely solved by the use of toothed belts. Working temperatures range from - 35\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C.  Adjustment of center distance or addition of an idler pulley is crucial to compensate for wear and stretch.\n\n=== Flat belts ===\n[[File:Transmissionsriemen.jpg|thumb|right|The drive belt: used to transfer power from the engine's flywheel. Here shown driving a [[threshing machine]].]]\n[[File:Wide flat belt.JPG|thumb|A small section of a wide flat belt made of layers of leather with the fastener on one end, shown in an exhibit at the [[Suffolk Mills]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]]]\nFlat belts were widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries in [[line shaft]]ing to transmit power in factories.<ref name=\"Jenkins\" >By Rhys Jenkins, Newcomen Society, (1971). ''Links in the History of Engineering and Technology from Tudor Times'', Ayer Publishing. Page 34, {{ISBN|0-8369-2167-4}}.</ref> They were also used in countless [[agriculture|farming]], [[mining]], and [[logging]] applications, such as [[bucksaw]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[threshing machine|threshers]], [[silo|silo blowers]], [[conveyor system|conveyors]] for filling [[corn crib]]s or [[hayloft]]s, [[baler]]s, water [[pump]]s (for [[water well|wells]], mines, or [[swamp]]y farm fields), and [[electrical generator]]s. Flat belts are still used today, although not nearly as much as in the line-shaft era. The flat belt is a simple system of power transmission that was well suited for its day. It can deliver high power at high speeds&nbsp;(373&nbsp;kW at 51&nbsp;m/s), in cases of wide belts and large pulleys. But these wide-belt-large-pulley drives are bulky, consuming lots of space while requiring high tension, leading to high loads, and are poorly suited to close-centers applications, so V-belts have mainly replaced flat belts for short-distance power transmission; and longer-distance power transmission is typically no longer done with belts at all. For example, factory machines now tend to have individual electric motors.\n\nBecause flat belts tend to climb towards the higher side of the pulley, pulleys were made with a slightly convex or \"crowned\" surface (rather than flat) to allow the belt to self-center as it runs. Flat belts also tend to slip on the pulley face when heavy loads are applied, and many proprietary [[#Belt dressing|belt dressings]] were available that could be applied to the belts to increase friction, and so power transmission.\n\nFlat belts were traditionally made of leather or fabric. Today most are made of rubber or synthetic polymers. Grip of leather belts is often better if they are assembled with the hair side (outer side) of the leather against the pulley, although some belts are instead given a half-twist before joining the ends (forming a [[M\u00f6bius strip]]), so that wear can be evenly distributed on both sides of the belt. Belts ends are joined by lacing the ends together with leather thonging (the oldest of the methods),<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.farmcollector.com/Looking-Back/How-To-Lace-A-Flat-Belt.aspx\n | title = How to lace a flat belt\n | author = James N.

Flat belts were traditionally jointed, and still usually are, but they can also be made with endless construction.\n\n=== Rope drives ===\nIn the mid 19th century, British millwrights discovered that multi-grooved pulleys connected by [[rope]]s outperformed flat pulleys connected by leather belts.  [[Wire rope]]s were occasionally used, but [[cotton]], [[hemp]], [[Manila rope|manila hemp]] and [[flax]] rope saw the widest use.  Typically, the rope connecting two pulleys with multiple V-grooves was spliced into a single loop that traveled along a [[Helix|helical]] path before being returned to its starting position by an [[idler pulley]] that also served to maintain the tension on the rope.  Sometimes, a single rope was used to transfer power from one multiple-groove drive pulley to several single- or multiple-groove driven pulleys in this way.\n\nIn general, as with flat belts, rope drives were used for connections from [[Stationary steam engine|stationary engines]] to the [[jack shaft]]s and [[line shaft]]s of mills, and sometimes from line shafts to driven machinery.  Unlike leather belts, however, rope drives were sometimes used to transmit power over relatively long distances.  Over long distances, intermediate sheaves were used to support the \"flying rope\", and in the late 19th century, this was considered quite efficient.<ref>Robert Grimshaw, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NJcPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA224Rope Drive for Power Transmission] [[Cassier's Magazine]] Vol. II, No. 9 (July 1892); pages 219\u2013224.</ref><ref>John J.

Note:  This journal is the house organ of the Dodge Manufacturing Company and is mostly devoted rope-power systems.</ref>\n\n=== Round belts ===\nRound belts are a circular cross section belt designed to run in a pulley with a 60 degree V-groove. Round grooves are only suitable for idler pulleys that guide the belt, or when (soft) O-ring type belts are used. The V-groove transmits torque through a wedging action, thus increasing friction. Nevertheless, round belts are for use in relatively low [[torque]] situations only and may be purchased in various lengths or cut to length and joined, either by a staple, a metallic connector (in the case of hollow plastic), gluing or welding (in the case of [[polyurethane]]). Early [[sewing machine]]s utilized a leather belt, joined either by a metal staple or glued, to great effect.\n\n=== Spring belts ===\n[[File:Rew3k04-002 spring belt transmission.jpg|thumb|A two-stage transmission using spring belts on a toy vehicle]]\nSpring belts are similar to rope or round belts but consist of a long steel helical spring. They are commonly found on toy or small model engines, typically steam engines driving other toys or models or providing a transmission between the crankshaft and other parts of a vehicle. The main advantage over rubber or other elastic belts is that they last much longer under poorly controlled operating conditions. The distance between the pulleys is also less critical. Their main disadvantage is that slippage is more likely due to the lower coefficient of friction. The ends of a spring belt can be joined either by bending the last turn of the helix at each end by 90 degrees to form hooks, or by reducing the diameter of the last few turns at one end so that it \"screws\" into the other end.\n\n=== {{Visible anchor|V belts}} ===<!-- Other articles link here -->\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|Belts on a [[Yanmar 2GM20]] marine [[diesel engine]]]]\n[[File:Multiple-V-belt drive 001.jpg|thumb|A multiple-V-belt drive on an [[air compressor]]]]\nV belts (also style V-belts, vee belts, or, less commonly, wedge rope) solved the slippage and alignment problem. It is now the basic belt for power transmission. They provide the best combination of traction, speed of movement, load of the bearings, and long service life. They are generally endless, and their general cross-section shape is roughly [[trapezoid]]al (hence the name \"V\"). The \"V\" shape of the belt tracks in a mating groove in the [[pulley]] (or sheave), with the result that the belt cannot slip off. The belt also tends to wedge into the groove as the load increases\u2014the greater the load, the greater the wedging action\u2014improving [[torque]] transmission and making the V-belt an effective solution, needing less width and tension than flat belts. V-belts trump flat belts with their small center distances and high reduction ratios.  The preferred center distance is larger than the largest pulley diameter, but less than three times the sum of both pulleys.  Optimal speed range is {{convert|1000|\u2013|7000|ft/min|abbr=on}}. V-belts need larger pulleys for their thicker cross-section than flat belts.\n\nFor high-power requirements, two or more V-belts can be joined side-by-side in an arrangement called a multi-V, running on matching multi-groove sheaves. This is known as a multiple-V-belt drive (or sometimes a \"classical V-belt drive\").\n\nV-belts may be homogeneously rubber or polymer throughout, or there may be fibers embedded in the rubber or polymer for strength and reinforcement. The fibers may be of textile materials such as cotton, [[polyamide]] (such as [[Nylon]]) or polyester or, for greatest strength, of steel or [[aramid]] (such as [[Technora]], [[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]]).\n\nWhen an endless belt does not fit the need, jointed and link V-belts may be employed. Most models offer the same power and speed ratings as equivalently-sized endless belts and do not require special pulleys to operate. A link v-belt is a number of polyurethane/polyester composite links held together, either by themselves, such as Fenner Drives' PowerTwist, or Nu-T-Link (with metal studs). These provide easy installation and superior environmental resistance compared to rubber belts and are length-adjustable by disassembling and removing links when needed.\n\n====V-belt history====\nTrade journal coverage of V-belts in automobiles from 1916 mentioned leather as the belt material,<ref name=\"HorselessAge1916-04-15_p324\">{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |date=1916-04-15 |title=Radiator fans and their design |journal=Horseless Age |volume=37 |issue=8 |page=324 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA324#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> and mentioned that the V angle was not yet well standardized.<ref name=\"HorselessAge1916-04-15_p322\">{{Citation |author=Editorial staff |date=1916-04-15 |title=S.A.E. divisions exhibit activity |journal=Horseless Age |volume=37 |issue=8 |page=322 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EVTmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA322#v=onepage&f=false |postscript=.}}</ref> The endless rubber V-belt was developed in 1917 by John Gates of the [[Charles Gates, Jr.|Gates Rubber Company]]. Multiple-V-belt drive was first arranged a few years later by Walter Geist of the [[Allis-Chalmers]] corporation, who was inspired to replace the single rope of multi-groove-sheave [[#Rope drives|rope drives]] with multiple V-belts running parallel. Geist filed for a patent in 1925, and Allis-Chalmers began marketing the drive under the \"Texrope\" brand; the patent was granted in 1928 ({{US Patent|1662511}}). The \"Texrope\" brand still exists, although it has changed ownership and no longer refers to multiple-V-belt drive alone.\n\n=== Multi-groove belts ===\nA multi-groove, V-Ribbed, or polygroove belt<ref>DIN 7867.</ref> is made up of usually between 3 and 24 \"V\" shaped sections alongside each other. This gives a thinner belt for the same drive surface, thus it is more flexible, although often wider. The added flexibility offers an improved efficiency, as less energy is wasted in the internal friction of continually bending the belt. In practice this gain of efficiency causes a reduced heating effect on the belt, and a cooler-running belt lasts longer in service. Belts are commercially available in several sizes, with usually a 'P' (sometimes omitted) and a single letter identifying the pitch between grooves. The 'PK' section with a pitch of 3.56&nbsp;mm is commonly used for automotive applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gates.com/~/media/files/gates/industrial/power-transmission/chart/gatescorporationbeltidchart.pdf|title=Gates Belt I.D. Chart}}</ref>\n\nA further advantage of the polygroove belt that makes them popular is that they can run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with V-belts with a single idler pulley for tensioning, a polygroove belt may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.<ref name=\"Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed, Polygroove belts\">{{cite book\n  |title=Automotive Handbook\n  |publisher=[[Robert Bosch GmbH]]\n  |year=1993\n  |page=304\n  |edition=3rd\n  |isbn=0-8376-0330-7\n  |ref=Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed\n}}</ref>\n\nAny V-belt's ability to drive pulleys depends on wrapping the belt around a sufficient angle of the pulley to provide grip. Where a single-V-belt is limited to a simple convex shape, it can adequately wrap at most three or possibly four pulleys, so can drive at most three accessories. Where more must be driven, such as for modern cars with power steering and air conditioning, multiple belts are required. As the polygroove belt can be bent into concave paths by external idlers, it can wrap any number of driven pulleys, limited only by the power capacity of the belt.<ref name=\"Bosch, Automotive Handbook, 3rd Ed, Polygroove belts\" />\n\nThis ability to bend the belt at the designer's whim allows it to take a complex or \"[[serpentine belt|serpentine]]\" path. This can assist the design of a compact engine layout, where the accessories are mounted more closely to the engine block and without the need to provide movable tensioning adjustments. The entire belt may be tensioned by a single idler pulley.\n\n=== Ribbed belt ===\nA ribbed belt is a power transmission belt featuring lengthwise grooves. It operates from contact between the ribs of the belt and the grooves in the pulley. Its single-piece structure is reported to offer an even distribution of tension across the width of the pulley where the belt is in contact, a power range up to 600&nbsp;kW, a high speed ratio, serpentine drives (possibility to drive off the back of the belt), long life, stability and homogeneity of the drive tension, and reduced vibration. The ribbed belt may be fitted on various applications: compressors, fitness bikes, agricultural machinery, food mixers, washing machines, lawn mowers, etc.\n\n===Film belts===\nThough often grouped with flat belts, they are actually a different kind.  They consist of a very thin belt (0.5\u201315 millimeters or 100\u20134000 micrometres) strip of plastic and occasionally rubber.  They are generally intended for low-power (less than 10 watts), high-speed uses, allowing high efficiency (up to 98%) and long life.  These are seen in business machines, printers, tape recorders, and other light-duty operations.\n\n=== Timing belts ===\n[[File:Timing belt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Timing belt]]\n[[File:F8hub.jpg|thumb|Belt-drive cog on a [[belt-driven bicycle]]]]\n[[Toothed belt|Timing belt]]s (also known as '''toothed''', '''notch''', '''cog''', or '''synchronous''' belts) are a ''positive'' transfer belt and can track relative movement. These belts have teeth that fit into a matching toothed pulley. When correctly tensioned, they have no slippage, run at constant speed, and are often used to transfer direct motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used instead of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.  [[Camshaft]]s of automobiles, miniature timing systems, and [[stepper motor]]s often utilize these belts.  Timing belts need the least tension of all belts and are among the most efficient. They can bear up to {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} at speeds of {{convert|16,000|ft/min|abbr=on}}.\n\nTiming belts with a helical offset tooth design are available.  The helical offset tooth design forms a chevron pattern and causes the teeth to engage progressively.  The chevron pattern design is self-aligning and does not make the noise that some timing belts make at certain speeds, and is more efficient at transferring power (up to 98%).\n\nDisadvantages include a relatively high purchase cost, the need for specially fabricated toothed pulleys, less protection from overloading, jamming, and vibration due to their continuous tension cords, the lack of clutch action (only possible with friction-drive belts), and the fixed lengths, which do not allow length adjustment (unlike link V-belts or chains).\n\n=== Specialty belts ===\nBelts normally transmit power on the tension side of the loop.  However, designs for [[continuously variable transmission]]s exist that use belts that are a series of solid metal blocks, linked together as in a chain, transmitting power on the compression side of the loop.\n\n===Rolling roads===\nBelts used for [[Dynamometer#Chassis dynamometer (rolling road)|rolling roads]] for wind tunnels can be capable of {{convert|250|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arc.pininfarina.it/english/news.html |title=Pininfarina Aerodynamic and Aeroacoustic Research Center |publisher=Arc.pininfarina.it |date= |accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref>\n\n==Standards for use==\n\nThe open belt drive has parallel shafts rotating in the same direction, whereas the cross-belt drive also bears parallel shafts but rotate in opposite direction.  The former is far more common, and the latter not appropriate for timing and standard V-belts unless there is a twist between each pulley so that the pulleys only contact the same belt surface. Nonparallel shafts can be connected if the belt's center line is aligned with the center plane of the pulley.  Industrial belts are usually reinforced rubber but sometimes leather types.  Non-leather, non-reinforced belts can only be used in light applications.\n\nThe pitch line is the line between the inner and outer surfaces that is neither subject to tension (like the outer surface) nor compression (like the inner).  It is midway through the surfaces in film and flat belts and dependent on cross-sectional shape and size in timing and V-belts. [[standard reference pitch diameter]] can be estimated by taking average of gear teeth tips diameter and gear teeth base diameter. The angular speed is inversely proportional to size, so the larger the one wheel, the less angular velocity, and vice versa.  Actual pulley speeds tend to be 0.5\u20131% less than generally calculated because of belt slip and stretch. In timing belts, the inverse ratio teeth of the belt contributes to the exact measurement.\nThe speed of the belt is:\n\nSpeed = Circumference based on [[Standard reference pitch diameter|pitch diameter]] \u00d7 angular speed in rpm\n\n===Selection criteria===\nBelt drives are built under the following required conditions: speeds of and power transmitted between drive and driven unit; suitable distance between shafts; and appropriate operating conditions. The equation for power is\n\n:power [kW] = ([[torque]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[newton-meter|N\u00b7m]]]) \u00d7 ([[rotational speed]] [rev/[[minute|min]]]) \u00d7 (2\u03c0 radians) / (60 [[second|s]] \u00d7 1000 W).\n\nFactors of power adjustment include speed ratio; shaft distance (long or short); type of drive unit (electric motor, internal combustion engine); service environment (oily, wet, dusty); driven unit loads (jerky, shock, reversed); and pulley-belt arrangement (open, crossed, turned).  These are found in engineering handbooks and manufacturer's literature. When corrected, the power is compared to rated powers of the standard belt cross-sections at particular belt speeds to find a number of arrays that perform best. Now the pulley diameters are chosen. It is generally either large diameters or large cross-section that are chosen, since, as stated earlier, larger belts transmit this same power at low belt speeds as smaller belts do at high speeds. To keep the driving part at its smallest, minimal-diameter pulleys are desired. Minimum pulley diameters are limited by the elongation of the belt's outer fibers as the belt wraps around the pulleys. Small pulleys increase this elongation, greatly reducing belt life. Minimal pulley diameters are often listed with each cross-section and speed, or listed separately by belt cross-section. After the cheapest diameters and belt section are chosen, the belt length is computed. If endless belts are used, the desired shaft spacing may need adjusting to accommodate standard-length belts. It is often more economical to use two or more juxtaposed V-belts, rather than one larger belt.\n\nIn large speed ratios or small central distances, the angle of contact between the belt and pulley may be less than 180\u00b0. If this is the case, the drive power must be further increased, according to manufacturer's tables, and the selection process repeated. This is because power capacities are based on the standard of a 180\u00b0 contact angle. Smaller contact angles mean less area for the belt to obtain traction, and thus the belt carries less power.\n\n===Belt friction===\n{{main|Belt friction}}\nBelt drives depend on [[friction]] to operate, but excessive friction wastes energy and rapidly wears the belt. Factors that affect belt friction include belt tension, contact angle, and the materials used to make the belt and pulleys.\n\n===Belt tension===\nPower transmission is a function of belt tension. However, also increasing with tension is stress (load) on the belt and bearings. The ideal belt is that of the lowest tension that does not slip in high loads.  Belt tensions should also be adjusted to belt type, size, speed, and pulley diameters. Belt tension is determined by measuring the force to deflect the belt a given distance per inch of pulley. Timing belts need only adequate tension to keep the belt in contact with the pulley.\n\n===Belt wear===\nFatigue, more so than abrasion, is the culprit for most belt problems. This wear is caused by stress from rolling around the pulleys.  High belt tension; excessive slippage; adverse environmental conditions; and belt overloads caused by shock, vibration, or belt slapping all contribute to belt fatigue.\n\n===Belt vibration===\n[[Vibration]] signatures are widely used for studying belt drive malfunctions. Some of the common malfunctions or faults include the effects of belt [[Tension (physics)|tension]], speed, [[sheave]] [[Eccentricity (mechanics)|eccentricity]] and misalignment conditions. The effect of sheave Eccentricity on vibration signatures of the belt drive is quite significant. Although, vibration magnitude is not necessarily increased by this it will create strong amplitude modulation. When the top section of a belt is in [[Resonance energy transfer|resonance]], the vibrations of the machine is increased. However, an increase in the machine vibration is not significant when only the bottom section of the belt is in resonance. The vibration spectrum has the tendency to move to higher frequencies as the tension force of the belt is increased.\n\n===Belt dressing===\nBelt slippage can be addressed in several ways. Belt replacement is an obvious solution, and eventually the mandatory one (because no belt lasts forever). Often, though, before the replacement option is executed, retensioning (via pulley centerline adjustment) or dressing (with any of various coatings) may be successful to extend the belt's lifespan and postpone replacement. Belt dressings are typically liquids that are poured, brushed, dripped, or sprayed onto the belt surface and allowed to spread around; they are meant to recondition the belt's driving surfaces and increase friction between the belt and the pulleys. Some belt dressings are dark and sticky, resembling [[tar]] or [[syrup]]; some are thin and clear, resembling [[white spirit|mineral spirits]]. Some are sold to the public in [[aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] at auto parts stores; others are sold in drums only to industrial users.\n\n===Specifications===\nTo fully specify a belt, the material, length, and cross-section size and shape are required. Timing belts, in addition, require that the size of the teeth be given.\nThe length of the belt is the sum of the central length of the system on both sides, half the circumference of both pulleys, and the square of the sum (if crossed) or the difference (if open) of the radii. Thus, when dividing by the central distance, it can be visualized as the central distance times the height that gives the same squared value of the radius difference on, of course, both sides.  When adding to the length of either side, the length of the belt increases, in a similar manner to the Pythagorean theorem.  One important concept to remember is that as D<sub>1</sub> gets closer to D<sub>2</sub> there is less of a distance (and therefore less addition of length) until its approaches zero.\n\nOn the other hand, in a crossed belt drive the ''sum'' rather than the difference of radii is the basis for computation for length.  So the wider the small drive increases, the belt length is higher.\n\n==V-belt profiles==\n[[File:BeltProfiles.jpg|thumb|right]]\n[[File:V-belt angle.jpg|thumb|right|v-belt angle, XPZ & SPZ profile]]\nMetric v-belt profiles:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The senior class president was George E. Sarkozy, one of those that participated in the ceremony.  The school was designed by architect Everett Lane Williams of the [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] architectural firm Van Leyen, Schilling & Keough. The school building, designed in the [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]] style, cost at $2.2M and was inspired in part by the buildings of the [[University of Michigan Law School]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] as well as the [[Rushton Triangular Lodge|Rushton]] and [[Apethorpe Hall|Apethore]] halls in [[Northamptonshire, England]].\n\nThe exterior of Fordson is made of granite and uses Briar Hill sandstone trim. The library has hand carved oak paneling, a fireplace, painted wall murals by Zoltan Sepeshy, tapestries and Jacobean [[fumed-oak]] furnishings and many bronze and marble statues including, [[Athena]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], [[Niobe]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The main entrance has ten [[bust (sculpture)|busts]] that include philosophers, playwrights, and mathematicians like [[Plato]], Aristedes, [[Sophocles]], [[Homer]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Aesculapius]], [[Euripides]], [[Pindar]], [[Archimedes]], and [[Socrates]]. The main hall also includes a blue and gold [[Fordson|Fordson Tractor]] with lettering of state champions imprinted on its top.[http://www.trekearth.com/gallery/North_America/United_States/photo58852.htm] The building features architectural sculpture by [[Corrado Parducci]]. Fordson's architecture was represented in the 1987 film, [[The Rosary Murders]] when the library and tower were displayed. The school also became recognized as a Michigan Historical Site in 1998.\n\n===Fordson Tower===\nThe Tower was constructed in 1926 and has been used for innumerable things. During World War II, the Tower was used to spot enemy aircraft that could have been headed for the [[River Rouge Plant]], where tanks were in production. The media center used the Tower for archival storage, classes, and media center office space. Students of Fordson hung signs over the Tower including a \"for sale\" sign in the 1950s and the most recent in 1993 exclaiming Fordson's State Championship in football. follow my tiktok Waael.23\n\n===Renovations and additions===\nIn 2005, an addition was adjoined to the northwestern body of the school. A cafeteria, ten classrooms including science and computer labs, and the replacement of the greenhouse comprised the new wing. The addition preserved the structure and appearance of the school by using the alternating dark and light limestone scheme and proceeding with the same architectural model developed from the school's inception. Consequently, Fordson received the Governor's Award for Historic Preservation and has been featured in many publications including the Masonry Institute of Michigan [https://web.archive.org/web/20070503070226/http://mim-online.org/storypole_archives.html] and the architects of the addition, TMP architecture. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060315/http://www.dearbornschools.org/district/documents/37FordsonAward.doc]\n\nIn 2007, the athletic facilities underwent an extensive renovation. The natural turf varsity football field and the practice field on the eastern side of the athletic campus were replaced by [[AstroTurf]] surfaces. The track and tennis courts were also renovated. Beyond the tennis courts on the northern side of the campus, trees were planted when a seldom used sidewalk was demolished. Sarkozy field, the prior soccer field for the school was sold to the city of [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]] for $800,000. The total cost before the sale was $1.6 million.\n\n===Present day===\nIn 2009 the [[Wayne County Regional Education Service Agency]] issued a report strongly asking Fordson High's administration to only use Arabic when absolutely necessary to communicate to students and parents.<ref>\"[https://archive.today/20120710032537/http://detnews.com/article/20090115/SCHOOLS/901150395/Dearborn-schools-urged-to-ban-Arabic Dearborn schools urged to ban Arabic]\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150723173813/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20090115/SCHOOLS/901150395 Archive]).

Every class that graduates from Fordson provides the school with a gift. The class of 1956 presented seventy-six flags representing members of the [[United Nations]] of that year. The flags have been used at every graduation since then with many other flags being donated over the years. Football has a strong tradition within the school and the helmet is a basic element of this example. The helmet at Fordson comprises yellow with two blue stripes over the top for the varsity team, one for the junior varsity team and zero for the freshman team. Also tradition, the stripes are made with electrical tape.\n\n===Winthrop Trip===\nEvery spring since 1991, a few Fordson juniors and seniors have had the opportunity to travel by train across the country to [[Winthrop, Washington]].

The senior class president was George E. Sarkozy, one of those that participated in the ceremony.  The school was designed by architect Everett Lane Williams of the [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] architectural firm Van Leyen, Schilling & Keough. The school building, designed in the [[Collegiate Gothic in North America|Collegiate Gothic]] style, cost at $2.2M and was inspired in part by the buildings of the [[University of Michigan Law School]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] as well as the [[Rushton Triangular Lodge|Rushton]] and [[Apethorpe Hall|Apethore]] halls in [[Northamptonshire, England]].\n\nThe exterior of Fordson is made of granite and uses Briar Hill sandstone trim. The library has hand carved oak paneling, a fireplace, painted wall murals by Zoltan Sepeshy, tapestries and Jacobean [[fumed-oak]] furnishings and many bronze and marble statues including, [[Athena]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], [[Niobe]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]. The main entrance has ten [[bust (sculpture)|busts]] that include philosophers, playwrights, and mathematicians like [[Plato]], Aristedes, [[Sophocles]], [[Homer]], [[Demosthenes]], [[Aesculapius]], [[Euripides]], [[Pindar]], [[Archimedes]], and [[Socrates]]. The main hall also includes a blue and gold [[Fordson|Fordson Tractor]] with lettering of state champions imprinted on its top.[http://www.trekearth.com/gallery/North_America/United_States/photo58852.htm] The building features architectural sculpture by [[Corrado Parducci]]. Fordson's architecture was represented in the 1987 film, [[The Rosary Murders]] when the library and tower were displayed. The school also became recognized as a Michigan Historical Site in 1998.\n\n===Fordson Tower===\nThe Tower was constructed in 1926 and has been used for innumerable things. During World War II, the Tower was used to spot enemy aircraft that could have been headed for the [[River Rouge Plant]], where tanks were in production. The media center used the Tower for archival storage, classes, and media center office space. Students of Fordson hung signs over the Tower including a \"for sale\" sign in the 1950s and the most recent in 1993 exclaiming Fordson's State Championship in football.\n\n===Renovations and additions===\nIn 2005, an addition was adjoined to the northwestern body of the school. A cafeteria, ten classrooms including science and computer labs, and the replacement of the greenhouse comprised the new wing. The addition preserved the structure and appearance of the school by using the alternating dark and light limestone scheme and proceeding with the same architectural model developed from the school's inception. Consequently, Fordson received the Governor's Award for Historic Preservation and has been featured in many publications including the Masonry Institute of Michigan [https://web.archive.org/web/20070503070226/http://mim-online.org/storypole_archives.html] and the architects of the addition, TMP architecture. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060315/http://www.dearbornschools.org/district/documents/37FordsonAward.doc]\n\nIn 2007, the athletic facilities underwent an extensive renovation. The natural turf varsity football field and the practice field on the eastern side of the athletic campus were replaced by [[AstroTurf]] surfaces. The track and tennis courts were also renovated. Beyond the tennis courts on the northern side of the campus, trees were planted when a seldom used sidewalk was demolished. Sarkozy field, the prior soccer field for the school was sold to the city of [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]] for $800,000. The total cost before the sale was $1.6 million.\n\n===Present day===\nIn 2009 the [[Wayne County Regional Education Service Agency]] issued a report strongly asking Fordson High's administration to only use Arabic when absolutely necessary to communicate to students and parents.<ref>\"[https://archive.today/20120710032537/http://detnews.com/article/20090115/SCHOOLS/901150395/Dearborn-schools-urged-to-ban-Arabic Dearborn schools urged to ban Arabic]\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20150723173813/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20090115/SCHOOLS/901150395 Archive]).

SDS acts as a [[surfactant]], covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.\n\nSDS tends to form spherical [[micelle]]s in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the [[critical micellar concentration]] (CMC).

The gel is produced by [[radical polymerisation]] in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75&nbsp;mm or 1.5&nbsp;mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst [[TEMED]] and the radical initiator [[ammonium persulfate]] (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] and protects the gel solution of the [[radical scavenger]] oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with [[filter paper]]. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for [[protein sequencing]], the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with [[cysteine]]s in proteins.\n\nBy using a [[gradient mixer]], gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses.<ref name=\"Margolis\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Margolis J, Kenrick KG | title=2-dimensional resolution of plasma proteins by combination of polyacrylamide disc and gradient gel electrophoresis. | journal=Nature | year= 1969 | volume= 221 | issue= 5185 | pages= 1056\u20137 | pmid=5774398 | doi= 10.1038/2211056a0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=5774398| bibcode=1969Natur.221.1056M }}</ref> Commercial gel systems (so-called ''pre-cast gels'') usually use the buffer substance [[Bis-tris methane]] with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel.<ref name=\"HachmannAmshey2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Hachmann|first1=John P.|last2=Amshey|first2=Joseph W.|title=Models of protein modification in Tris\u2013glycine and neutral pH Bis\u2013Tris gels during electrophoresis: Effect of gel pH|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=342|issue=2|year=2005|pages=237\u2013245|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.015|pmid=15935323}}</ref><ref name=\"WiltfangArold1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Wiltfang|first1=Jens|last2=Arold|first2=Norbert|last3=Neuhoff|first3=Volker|title=A new multiphasic buffer system for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins and peptides with molecular masses 100 000-1000, and their detection with picomolar sensitivity|journal=Electrophoresis|volume=12|issue=5|year=1991|pages=352\u2013366|issn=0173-0835|doi=10.1002/elps.1150120507|pmid=1718736}}</ref> These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use.

Heating disrupts the [[secondary structure|secondary]] and [[tertiary structure]]s of the protein by disrupting [[hydrogen bond]]s and stretching the molecules. Optionally, [[disulfide bridge]]s can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing [[thiol]]s such as [[\u03b2-mercaptoethanol]] (\u03b2-ME, 5% by volume), [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT, 10 millimolar) or [[dithioerythritol]] (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.\n\nIn addition to the samples, a [[molecular-weight size marker]] is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of \u00b1 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel.<ref name=\"Rosenberg2006\">{{cite book|author=Ian M. Rosenberg|title=Protein Analysis and Purification: Benchtop Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gi-UgCF8G6EC&pg=PA103|date=22 December 2006|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4412-3|pages=103\u2013}}</ref> The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.\n\n=== Electrophoresis ===\n[[File:Gelelektrophoreseapparatur.jpg|thumb|Electrophoresis chamber after a few minutes of electrophoresis. In the first pocket a size marker was applied with bromophenol blue, in the other pockets, the samples were added [[bromocresol green]]]]\nFor separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a [[voltage]] (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged [[anode]]. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.\n\nThe fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye [[bromophenol blue]] to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.\n\nThe most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different [[wiktionary:Pore|pore]] size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), [[ionic strength]] and [[pH value]]s (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing [[Tris]]-[[glycine]]-[[chloride]] [[Buffering agent|buffer]] system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the [[zwitterionic]] form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-[[Tricine]] buffer system of Sch\u00e4gger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4ggervon Jagow1987\">{{cite journal|last1=Sch\u00e4gger|first1=Hermann|last2=von Jagow|first2=Gebhard|title=Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=166|issue=2|year=1987|pages=368\u2013379|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2|pmid=2449095}}</ref>\n\n=== Gel staining ===\n[[File:Coomassie3.jpg|thumb|Coomassie-stained 10% Tris/Tricine gel.

This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in \"tailing\" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color (\"smear\") below a band.<ref name=\"BurgessDeutscher2009\">{{cite book|author1=Richard R Burgess|author2=Murray P.

Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet [[cellophane]] film to which the gel and a one percent [[glycerol]] solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips.

The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility.

It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low [[scalability]], it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.\n\nAdditionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the [[western blot]] for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a ''band shift'') or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).\n\nIn [[mass spectrometry]] of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using [[in-gel digestion]]. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical [[ultracentrifugation]], but less exact than a [[mass spectrometry]] or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the [[DNA sequence]].\n\nIn medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the [[HIV test]] and to evaluate [[proteinuria]]. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific [[antibodies]] of the patient, if they are present in his [[blood serum]]. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various [[serum protein]]s in the urine, e.g. [[Albumin]], [[Alpha-2-macroglobulin]] and [[IgG]].\n\n== Variants ==\nSDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] sequentially combines [[isoelectric focusing]] or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. [[Native PAGE]] is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] can be used, e.g. the [[SDD-AGE]]. Some [[enzyme]]s can be detected via their [[enzyme activity]] by [[zymography]].\n\n== Alternatives ==\nWhile being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different [[chromatography|chromatographic]] methods with subsequent [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], for example [[affinity chromatography]] (or even [[tandem affinity purification]]), [[size exclusion chromatography]], [[ion exchange chromatography]].<ref name=\"Janson2012\">{{cite book|author=Jan-Christer Janson|title=Protein Purification: Principles, High Resolution Methods, and Applications|url=|date=3 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00219-3}}</ref> Proteins can also be separated by size in a [[tangential flow filtration]]<ref name=\"Desai2000\">{{cite book|author=Mohamed A.

SDS acts as a [[surfactant]], covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.\n\nSDS tends to form spherical [[micelle]]s in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the [[critical micellar concentration]] (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules ([[monomer]]) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules.<ref name=\"TurroYekta1978\">{{cite journal|last1=Turro|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Yekta|first2=Ahmad|title=Luminescent probes for detergent solutions.

The gel is produced by [[radical polymerisation]] in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75&nbsp;mm or 1.5&nbsp;mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst [[TEMED]] and the radical initiator [[ammonium persulfate]] (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] and protects the gel solution of the [[radical scavenger]] oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with [[filter paper]]. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for [[protein sequencing]], the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with [[cysteine]]s in proteins.\n\nBy using a [[gradient mixer]], gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses.<ref name=\"Margolis\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Margolis J, Kenrick KG | title=2-dimensional resolution of plasma proteins by combination of polyacrylamide disc and gradient gel electrophoresis. | journal=Nature | year= 1969 | volume= 221 | issue= 5185 | pages= 1056\u20137 | pmid=5774398 | doi= 10.1038/2211056a0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&tool=sumsearch.org/cite&retmode=ref&cmd=prlinks&id=5774398| bibcode=1969Natur.221.1056M }}</ref> Commercial gel systems (so-called ''pre-cast gels'') usually use the buffer substance [[Bis-tris methane]] with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel.<ref name=\"HachmannAmshey2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Hachmann|first1=John P.|last2=Amshey|first2=Joseph W.|title=Models of protein modification in Tris\u2013glycine and neutral pH Bis\u2013Tris gels during electrophoresis: Effect of gel pH|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=342|issue=2|year=2005|pages=237\u2013245|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.015|pmid=15935323}}</ref><ref name=\"WiltfangArold1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Wiltfang|first1=Jens|last2=Arold|first2=Norbert|last3=Neuhoff|first3=Volker|title=A new multiphasic buffer system for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins and peptides with molecular masses 100 000-1000, and their detection with picomolar sensitivity|journal=Electrophoresis|volume=12|issue=5|year=1991|pages=352\u2013366|issn=0173-0835|doi=10.1002/elps.1150120507|pmid=1718736}}</ref> These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use.

Heating disrupts the [[secondary structure|secondary]] and [[tertiary structure]]s of the protein by disrupting [[hydrogen bond]]s and stretching the molecules. Optionally, [[disulfide bridge]]s can be cleaved by reduction.

After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.\n\nIn addition to the samples, a [[molecular-weight size marker]] is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of \u00b1 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel.<ref name=\"Rosenberg2006\">{{cite book|author=Ian M.

In the first pocket a size marker was applied with bromophenol blue, in the other pockets, the samples were added [[bromocresol green]]]]\nFor separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a [[voltage]] (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged [[anode]]. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.\n\nThe fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye [[bromophenol blue]] to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.\n\nThe most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different [[wiktionary:Pore|pore]] size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), [[ionic strength]] and [[pH value]]s (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing [[Tris]]-[[glycine]]-[[chloride]] [[Buffering agent|buffer]] system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the [[zwitterionic]] form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-[[Tricine]] buffer system of Sch\u00e4gger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4ggervon Jagow1987\">{{cite journal|last1=Sch\u00e4gger|first1=Hermann|last2=von Jagow|first2=Gebhard|title=Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=166|issue=2|year=1987|pages=368\u2013379|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2|pmid=2449095}}</ref>\n\n=== Gel staining ===\n[[File:Coomassie3.jpg|thumb|Coomassie-stained 10% Tris/Tricine gel.

This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in \"tailing\" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color (\"smear\") below a band.<ref name=\"BurgessDeutscher2009\">{{cite book|author1=Richard R Burgess|author2=Murray P.

For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a [[gel extraction]] can be performed.\n\n=== Archiving ===\n[[File:Gel_Blue_Coomassie.jpg|thumb|Two SDS gels after completed separation of the samples and staining in a drying frame]]\nAfter protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet [[cellophane]] film to which the gel and a one percent [[glycerol]] solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n== Molecular mass determination ==\n[[File:LogM over Rf.png|thumb|The proteins of the size marker (black X) show an approximately straight line in the representation of log M over Rf.

The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility.

It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low [[scalability]], it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.\n\nAdditionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the [[western blot]] for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a ''band shift'') or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).\n\nIn [[mass spectrometry]] of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using [[in-gel digestion]]. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical [[ultracentrifugation]], but less exact than a [[mass spectrometry]] or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the [[DNA sequence]].\n\nIn medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the [[HIV test]] and to evaluate [[proteinuria]]. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific [[antibodies]] of the patient, if they are present in his [[blood serum]]. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various [[serum protein]]s in the urine, e.g. [[Albumin]], [[Alpha-2-macroglobulin]] and [[IgG]].\n\n== Variants ==\nSDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] sequentially combines [[isoelectric focusing]] or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. [[Native PAGE]] is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] can be used, e.g. the [[SDD-AGE]]. Some [[enzyme]]s can be detected via their [[enzyme activity]] by [[zymography]].\n\n== Alternatives ==\nWhile being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different [[chromatography|chromatographic]] methods with subsequent [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], for example [[affinity chromatography]] (or even [[tandem affinity purification]]), [[size exclusion chromatography]], [[ion exchange chromatography]].<ref name=\"Janson2012\">{{cite book|author=Jan-Christer Janson|title=Protein Purification: Principles, High Resolution Methods, and Applications|url=|date=3 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00219-3}}</ref> Proteins can also be separated by size in a [[tangential flow filtration]]<ref name=\"Desai2000\">{{cite book|author=Mohamed A.
