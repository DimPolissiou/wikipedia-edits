The court held that such wide restrictions of basic rights may be adopted only under the Crisis Act by the Government as whole and not under Protection of Public Health Act by the Ministry of Health alone. Both the curfew and retail sale ban were originally adopted by Government Resolutions on 14 and 15 March respectively, however then they were replaced by Ministry of Health Protection Measures from 24 March onwards.

The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]], the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is the fictional \"space ranger\" character that he was based on who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. After an argument, they manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack Woody and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody and trap Scud in a car jam; the other toys realize their mistake and try to help, but RC's batteries run out before he reaches the truck. Realizing that Sid's rocket is still strapped to Buzz's back, Woody ignites it, hurtling them towards the truck. Woody throws RC back into the truck before he and Buzz soar into the air; Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket just before it explodes, and he glides with Woody to safety inside a box in the Davis's van, right next to Andy, who concludes they were in the car all along.\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] at their new home, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals; one of the toys is a [[Mrs. Potato Head]], to Mr. Potato Head's delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]], a [[pull-string]] [[cowboy]] doll who is Andy's favourite toy.\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]], a space ranger [[action figure]] and Woody's rival, who later becomes his best friend.\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body.\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog]], a [[dachshund]] [[slinky]] toy.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Rex, a nervous green [[Tyrannosaurus]] figurine.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Hamm, a smart-talking [[piggy bank]].\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], a [[Bisque doll|porcelain]] shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest.\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], Woody and Buzz's owner.\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Sid Phillips|Sid Phillips]], Andy's next door neighbor, who tortures toys for his own amusement.\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Mrs. Davis]], Andy's mother.\n* [[R.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film. Disney could also kill the film at any time with only a small penalty. These early negotiations became a point of contention between Jobs and Eisner for many years.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}\n\nAn agreement to produce a feature film based on ''Tin Toy'' with a working title of ''Toy Story'' was finalized and production began soon thereafter.<ref name=\"PixMagicMan\">{{cite news|last=Schlender|first=Brent|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|title=Pixar's magic man|date=May 17, 2006|publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]]|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120715081233/http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|archive-date=July 15, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe original treatment for ''Toy Story'', drafted by Lasseter, [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Pete Docter]], had little in common with the eventually finished film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=121}} It paired Tinny, the one-man band from ''Tin Toy'', with a ventriloquist's dummy and sent them on a sprawling odyssey.

Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I.

However, character designer [[Bud Luckey]] suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy.

Pixar impressed Disney with their technical innovation, but convincing Disney of the plot was more difficult. At each of Pixar's presentations, Katzenberg tore much of it up, giving out detailed comments and notes. Katzenberg wanted primarily to add \"more edginess\" to the two main characters.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and they asked for adult references to be added to the film.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=129}} Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993\u2014an event they later dubbed the \"Black Friday Incident\".<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\">{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|title=Toy' Wonder|date=December 8, 1995|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205204251/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|archive-date=December 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The results were disastrous.

Schumacher replied bluntly: \"Because it's not their movie any more; it's completely not the movie that John set out to make.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nLasseter was embarrassed by what was on the screen, later recalling, \"It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean characters that I've ever seen.\" He asked Disney for two weeks to rework the script, and Katzenberg was supportive.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy.

Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in ''Toy Story'' came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=136}} Under Galyn Susman and [[Sharon Calahan]], the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"CNN110animators\" /> There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} A camera team, aided by [[David DiFrancesco]], recorded the frames onto [[film stock]]. To fit a 1.85:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], ''Toy Story'' was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} During post-production, the film was sent to [[Skywalker Sound]], where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.<ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Toy Story (soundtrack)}}\n\nDisney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}} The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy.

The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]], the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. After an argument, they manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack Woody and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and try to help, but RC's batteries run out before he reaches the truck.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film.

Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I.

However, character designer [[Bud Luckey]] suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy.

The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy. Jobs demanded more funds to complete the film and insisted that Disney was liable for the cost overruns.

Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was first either created out of [[Modelling clay|clay]] or modeled from a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer-animated design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\">{{cite news|last=Snider|first=Burr|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|title=The Toy Story Story|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|pages=1\u20136|date=December 1995|accessdate=March 13, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131017031124/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|archive-date=October 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Once the animators had a model, its articulation and motion controls were coded; this allowed each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /> Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\">{{cite journal|last=Henne |first=Mark |last2=Hickel |first2=Hal |last3=Johnson |first3=Ewan |last4=Konishi |first4=Sonoks |title=The Making of Toy Story |journal=CompCon '96.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in ''Toy Story'' came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=136}} Under Galyn Susman and [[Sharon Calahan]], the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"CNN110animators\" /> There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} A camera team, aided by [[David DiFrancesco]], recorded the frames onto [[film stock]]. To fit a 1.85:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], ''Toy Story'' was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} During post-production, the film was sent to [[Skywalker Sound]], where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.<ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Toy Story (soundtrack)}}\n\nDisney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}} The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:El Capitan Theatre, Hollywood, California (2997200450).jpg|thumb|The [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, where ''Toy Story''{{'}}s Los Angeles, California's premiere took place on November 19, 1995.|alt=Exterior shot of the El Capitan Theatre.]]\n\nThere were two premieres of ''Toy Story'' in November 1995.

They regarded Jesus as the Messiah but not as divine.\n* [[Euchites]] or Messalians &ndash; belief that the essence (ousia) of the Trinity could be perceived by the carnal senses; that the Threefold God transformed himself into a single hypostasis (substance) in order to unite with the souls of the perfect; that God has taken different forms in order to reveal himself to the senses; only such sensible revelations of God confer perfection upon the Christian; and the state of perfection, freedom from the world and passion, is attained solely by prayer, not through the church or sacraments.\n* [[Lucifer of Cagliari|Luciferians]] &ndash; strongly anti-Arian sect in Sardinia\n* [[Marcionism]] &ndash; Early Christian dualist belief system. Marcion affirmed Jesus Christ as the savior sent by God and Paul as his chief apostle, but he rejected the Hebrew Bible and the Hebrew God. Marcionists believed that the wrathful Hebrew God was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament.\n* [[Montanism]] &ndash; beliefs of Montanism contrasted with orthodox Christianity in the following ways: the belief that the prophecies of the Montanists superseded and fulfilled the doctrines proclaimed by the Apostles; the encouragement of ecstatic prophesying; the view that Christians who fell from grace could not be redeemed; a stronger emphasis on the avoidance of sin and church discipline, emphasizing chastity, including forbidding remarriage.\n* [[Pelagianism]]/[[Semipelagianism]] &ndash; belief that original sin did not taint human nature and that mortal will is still capable of choosing good or evil without Divine aid.\n\n==Gnostic heresies==\n* [[Manichaeism]] &ndash; major dualistic religion stating that good and evil are equally powerful, and that material things are evil.\n* [[Paulicianism]] &ndash; Gnostic and dualistic sect\n* [[Priscillianism]] &ndash; Gnostic and Manichaean sect\n* [[Naassenes]] &ndash; Gnostic sect from around 100 A.D.\n* [[Sethian]] &ndash; belief that the snake in the Garden of Eden was an agent of the true God and brought knowledge of truth to man via the fall of man\n* [[Ophites]] &ndash; belief that the serpent who tempted Adam and Eve was a hero, and that the God who forbade Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge is the enemy\n* [[Valentianism]] &ndash; Gnostic and dualistic sect\n\n==Christological heresies==\n* [[Adoptionism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus was born merely human and that he became divine later in his life.\n* [[Apollinarism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus had a human body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a divine mind. Apollinaris further taught that the souls of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies.\n* [[Arianism]] &ndash; teachings adopted by the theologian Arius which state that Christ had been given every honor but divinity, which conflicts with the doctrine of the hypostatic union (Christ's nature was wholly divine and wholly human) which was held by the Church.\n* [[Docetism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus' physical body was an illusion, as was his crucifixion; that is, Jesus only seemed to have a physical body and to physically die, but in reality he was incorporeal, a pure spirit, and hence could not physically die\n* [[Macedonians (religious group)]] or pneumatomachians &ndash; belief that Holy Spirit was a creation of the Son, and a servant of the Father and the Son\n* [[Melchisedechians]] &ndash; considered Melchisedech an incarnation of the Logos (divine Word) and identified him with the Holy Ghost\n* [[Monarchianism]] &ndash; emphasized the indivisibility of God (the Father) at the expense of the other persons of the Trinity.\n* [[Monophysitism]] or [[Eutychianism]] &ndash; belief that Christ has only one nature (divine), as opposed to the Chalcedonian position which holds that Christ has two natures, one divine and one human or the Miaphysite position which holds that the divine and human natures of Christ were united as one divine human nature from the point of the Incarnation onwards.\n* [[Monothelitism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus Christ had two natures but only one will. This is contrary to the orthodox interpretation of Christology, which teaches that Jesus Christ has two wills (human and divine) corresponding to his two natures\n* [[Nestorianism]] &ndash; belief that Christ exists as two persons, the man Jesus and the divine Son of God, or Logos, rather than as two natures (True God and True Man) of one divine person.\n* [[Patripassianism]] &ndash; belief that the Father and Son are not two distinct persons, and thus God the Father suffered on the cross as Jesus.\n* [[Psilanthropism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus is \"merely human\": either that he never became divine, or that he never existed before his incarnation as a man.\n* [[Sabellianism]] &ndash; belief that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three aspects of one God, rather than three distinct persons in one God.\n\n==Medieval heresies==\n* [[Bogomils]] &ndash; Gnostic dualistic sect that was both Adoptionist and Manichaean.\n* [[Catharism]] &ndash; Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and the Bogomils of Bulgaria, with a strong dualist influence against the physical world, regarded as evil, thus denied that Jesus could become incarnate and still be the son of God.\n* [[Conciliarism]] &ndash; claims that the council (and laity) is always above the ordinary (and extraordinary) magisterium.\n* [[Brethren of the Free Spirit|Free Spirit]] &ndash; mixed mystical beliefs with Christianity. Its practitioners believed that it was possible to reach perfection on earth through a life of austerity and spiritualism.

They regarded Jesus as the Messiah but not as divine.\n* [[Euchites]] or Messalians &ndash; belief that the essence (ousia) of the Trinity could be perceived by the carnal senses; that the Threefold God transformed himself into a single hypostasis (substance) in order to unite with the souls of the perfect; that God has taken different forms in order to reveal himself to the senses; only such sensible revelations of God confer perfection upon the Christian; and the state of perfection, freedom from the world and passion, is attained solely by prayer, not through the church or sacraments.\n* [[Lucifer of Cagliari|Luciferians]] &ndash; strongly anti-Arian sect in Sardinia\n* [[Marcionism]] &ndash; Early Christian dualist belief system. Marcion affirmed Jesus Christ as the savior sent by God and Paul as his chief apostle, but he rejected the Hebrew Bible and the Hebrew God. Marcionists believed that the wrathful Hebrew God was a separate and lower entity than the all-forgiving God of the New Testament.\n* [[Montanism]] &ndash; beliefs of Montanism contrasted with orthodox Christianity in the following ways: the belief that the prophecies of the Montanists superseded and fulfilled the doctrines proclaimed by the Apostles; the encouragement of ecstatic prophesying; the view that Christians who fell from grace could not be redeemed; a stronger emphasis on the avoidance of sin and church discipline, emphasizing chastity, including forbidding remarriage.\n* [[Pelagianism]]/[[Semipelagianism]] &ndash; belief that original sin did not taint human nature and that mortal will is still capable of choosing good or evil without Divine aid.\n\n==Gnostic heresies==\n* [[Manichaeism]] &ndash; major dualistic religion stating that good and evil are equally powerful, and that material things are evil.\n* [[Paulicianism]] &ndash; Gnostic and dualistic sect\n* [[Priscillianism]] &ndash; Gnostic and Manichaean sect\n* [[Naassenes]] &ndash; Gnostic sect from around 100 A.D.\n* [[Sethian]] &ndash; belief that the snake in the Garden of Eden was an agent of the true God and brought knowledge of truth to man via the fall of man\n* [[Ophites]] &ndash; belief that the serpent who tempted Adam and Eve was a hero, and that the God who forbade Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge is the enemy\n* [[Valentianism]] &ndash; Gnostic and dualistic sect\n\n==Christological heresies==\n* [[Adoptionism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus was born merely human and that he became divine later in his life.\n* [[Apollinarism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus had a human body and lower soul (the seat of the emotions) but a divine mind. Apollinaris further taught that the souls of men were propagated by other souls, as well as their bodies.\n* [[Arianism]] &ndash; teachings adopted by the theologian Arius which state that Christ had been given every honor but divinity, which conflicts with the doctrine of the hypostatic union (Christ's nature was wholly divine and wholly human) which was held by the Church.\n* [[Docetism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus' physical body was an illusion, as was his crucifixion; that is, Jesus only seemed to have a physical body and to physically die, but in reality he was incorporeal, a pure spirit, and hence could not physically die\n* [[Macedonians (religious group)]] or pneumatomachians &ndash; belief that Holy Spirit was a creation of the Son, and a servant of the Father and the Son\n* [[Melchisedechians]] &ndash; considered Melchisedech an incarnation of the Logos (divine Word) and identified him with the Holy Ghost\n* [[Monarchianism]] &ndash; emphasized the indivisibility of God (the Father) at the expense of the other persons of the Trinity.\n* [[Monophysitism]] or [[Eutychianism]] &ndash; belief that Christ has only one nature (divine), as opposed to the Chalcedonian position which holds that Christ has two natures, one divine and one human or the Miaphysite position which holds that the divine and human natures of Christ were united as one divine human nature from the point of the Incarnation onwards.\n* [[Monothelitism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus Christ had two natures but only one will. This is contrary to the orthodox interpretation of Christology, which teaches that Jesus Christ has two wills (human and divine) corresponding to his two natures\n* [[Nestorianism]] &ndash; belief that Christ exists as two persons, the man Jesus and the divine Son of God, or Logos, rather than as two natures (True God and True Man) of one divine person.\n* [[Patripassianism]] &ndash; belief that the Father and Son are not two distinct persons, and thus God the Father suffered on the cross as Jesus.\n* [[Psilanthropism]] &ndash; belief that Jesus is \"merely human\": either that he never became divine, or that he never existed before his incarnation as a man.\n* [[Sabellianism]] &ndash; belief that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three aspects of one God, rather than three distinct persons in one God.\n\n==Medieval heresies==\n* [[Bogomils]] &ndash; Gnostic dualistic sect that was both Adoptionist and Manichaean.\n* [[Catharism]] &ndash; Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and the Bogomils of Bulgaria, with a strong dualist influence against the physical world, regarded as evil, thus denied that Jesus could become incarnate and still be the son of God.\n* [[Conciliarism]] &ndash; claims that the council (and laity) is always above the ordinary (and extraordinary) magisterium.\n* [[Brethren of the Free Spirit|Free Spirit]] &ndash; mixed mystical beliefs with Christianity. Its practitioners believed that it was possible to reach perfection on earth through a life of austerity and spiritualism. They believed that they could communicate directly with God and did not need the Christian church for intercession.\n* [[Iconoclasm]] &ndash; idea that icons and images must be destroyed, as they have no place in the worship of God\n* [[Fraticelli]] (Spiritual Franciscans) &ndash; extreme proponents of the rule of Saint Francis of Assisi, especially with regard to poverty, and regarded the wealth of the Church as scandalous, and that of individual churchmen as invalidating their status.\n* [[Henricians]] &ndash; rejection of the doctrinal and disciplinary authority of the church; recognition of the Gospel freely interpreted as the sole rule of faith; refusal to recognize any form of worship or liturgy; and condemnation of the baptism of infants, the Eucharist, the sacrifice of the mass, the communion of saints, and prayers for the dead.\n* [[Waldensians]] (Waldenses or Vaudois)  &ndash; spiritual movement of the later Middle Ages, headed by Peter Waldo\n\n==Renaissance==\n* [[Hussites]] &ndash; program of the Hussites is contained in the four articles of Prague, which were agreed upon in July 1420. These are often summarized as: Freedom to preach the Word of God, celebration of the Lord's Supper in both kinds (bread and wine to priests and laity alike), no secular power for the clergy, punishment for the mortal sins.\n* [[Lollardy]] &ndash; practice of the followers of Wycliffe\n* [[Girolamo Savonarola]] &ndash; Savonarola called for simplicity in church interior and rigorous moral stances\n\n==Reformation==\nThe Catholic Church believes that all of the following are heretical.

It contains an [[ancient Egyptian temple]] for the goddess [[Isis]]. The site lies along the [[Damietta]] branch of the Nile, north of [[Sebennytos]] and 8 kilometers (5 mi) west of [[Mansoura]].<ref name=\"Wilkinson 2000\">Wilkinson, Richard H. (2000). ''The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt''. Thames & Hudson. pp. 10, 104\u2013105</ref> The temple is known as the '''Iseion''' and was the first large temple to have been dedicated to Isis. In earlier shrines at the site, she may have been worshipped alongside her mythological husband, [[Osiris]], and son, [[Horus]]. It was begun by the [[pharaoh|kings]] of the [[Thirtieth Dynasty of Egypt|Thirtieth Dynasty]] (380\u2013343 BC) and completed under [[Ptolemy III]] (r. 246\u2013222 BC).<ref>Wilkinson, Richard H.

It paralleled the deity's most important temple, located at [[Philae]] in [[Upper Egypt]].<ref name=\"Wilkinson 2000\"/> Most Egyptian temples were built primarily of [[limestone]] or [[sandstone]], with harder stones such as [[granite]] used only for individual elements such as statues, [[obelisks]], or doorways,<ref>Wilkinson, Richard H. (2000). ''The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt''. Thames & Hudson. pp. 40\u201341</ref> but the Iseion was built entirely of granite.<ref name=\"Wilkinson 2000\"/> The temple was demolished at some point, possibly in ancient times, by an earthquake or by the removal of its stone to serve as building material.

The items are more easily remembered as a group than as the individual items themselves. These chunks can be highly subjective because they rely on an individuals perceptions and past experiences, that are able to be linked to the information set. The size of the chunks generally range anywhere from two to six items, but often differ based on language and culture.\n\nAccording to Johnson (1970), there are four main concepts associated with the memory process of chunking: chunk, memory code, decode, and recode.<ref>{{Citation|last=Johnson|first=Neal F.|title=The Role of Chunking and Organization in The Process of Recall11The research reported herein was supported through the Cooperative Research Program of the Office of Education, U.

These item or information sets are to be stored in the same memory code. The process of recoding is where one learns the code for a chunk, and decoding is when the code is translated into the information that it represents.\n\nThe phenomenon of chunking as a memory mechanism is easily observed in the way individuals group numbers, and information, in the day-to-day life. For example, when recalling a number such as 12101946, if numbers are grouped as 12, 10 and 1946, a mnemonic is created for this number as a day, month and year. It would be stored as December 10, 1946 instead of a string of numbers. Similarly, another illustration of the limited capacity of working memory as suggested by George Miller can be seen from the following example: While recalling a mobile phone number such as 9849523450, we might break this into 98 495 234 50. Thus, instead of remembering 10 separate digits that is beyond the \"seven plus-or-minus two\" memory span, we are remembering four groups of numbers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=George A.|date=1956|title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/h0043158|journal=Psychological Review|volume=63|issue=2|pages=81\u201397|doi=10.1037/h0043158|issn=1939-1471}}</ref>\n\n==Modality Effect==\nA [[modality effect]] is present in chunking. That is, the mechanism used to convey the list of items to the individual affects how much \"chunking\" occurs.\n\nExperimentally, it has been found that auditory presentation results in a larger amount of grouping in the responses of individuals than visual presentation does. Previous literature, such as George Miller's [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information (1956)]] has shown that the probability of recall of information is greater when the \"chunking\" strategy is used.<ref name=\":0\" /> As stated above, the grouping of the responses occurs as individuals place them into categories according to their inter-relatedness based on semantic and perceptual properties. Lindley (1966) showed that since the groups produced have meaning to the participant, this strategy makes it easier for an individual to recall and maintain information in memory during studies and testing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindley|first=Richard H.|date=1966-08-01|title=Recoding as a function of chunking and meaningfulness|journal=Psychonomic Science|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=393\u2013394|doi=10.3758/BF03330953|issn=0033-3131|doi-access=free}}</ref> Therefore, when \"chunking\" is used as a strategy, one can expect a higher proportion of correct recalls.\n\n==Memory training systems, mnemonic==\nVarious kinds of [[memory]] training systems and [[mnemonics]] include training and drill in specially-designed recoding or chunking schemes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Don R.|date=1977-10-01|title=Individual differences in immediate serial recall: A matter of mnemonics?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028577900147|journal=Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=403\u2013411|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(77)90014-7|issn=0010-0285}}</ref> Such systems existed before Miller's paper, but there was no convenient term to describe the general strategy or substantive and reliable research. The term \"chunking\" is now often used in reference to these systems. As an illustration, patients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] typically experience working memory deficits; chunking is an effective method to improve patients' verbal working memory performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huntley|first=Jonathan|last2=Bor|first2=Daniel|last3=Hampshire|first3=Adam|last4=Owen|first4=Adrian|last5=Howard|first5=Robert|date=May 2011|title=Working memory task performance and chunking in early Alzheimer's disease|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/working-memory-task-performance-and-chunking-in-early-alzheimers-disease/4CCC776A58F051F8E3393E82F0EDBB68|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=198|issue=5|pages=398\u2013403|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.110.083857|issn=0007-1250|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Channel capacity,\"Magic number seven,\" Increase of short-term memory==\n{{Main|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two}}\n\nThe word ''chunking'' comes from a famous 1956 paper by [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]], \"[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neisser|first=Ulric|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/cognitive-psychology/oclc/192730|title=Cognitive psychology|date=1967|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|isbn=978-0-390-66509-6|location=New York|language=English|oclc=192730}}</ref> At a time when [[information theory]] was beginning to be applied in psychology, Miller observed that some human cognitive tasks fit the model of a \"channel capacity\" characterized by a roughly constant capacity in bits, but short-term memory did not. A variety of studies could be summarized by saying that short-term memory had a capacity of about \"seven plus-or-minus two\" chunks. Miller (1956) wrote, \"With binary items the span is about nine and, although it drops to about five with [[monosyllabic]] English words, the difference is far less than the hypothesis of constant information would require (see also, [[memory span]]). The span of immediate memory seems to be almost independent of the number of bits per chunk, at least over the range that has been examined to date.\" Miller acknowledged that \"we are not very definite about what constitutes a chunk of information.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMiller (1956) noted that according to this theory, it should be possible to increase short-term memory for low-information-content items effectively by mentally recoding them into a smaller number of high-information-content items. He imagined this process being useful in scenarios such as \"a man just beginning to learn [[morse code|radio-telegraphic code]] hears each dit and dah as a separate chunk. Soon he is able to organize these sounds into letters and then he can deal with the letters as chunks. Then the letters organize themselves as words, which are still larger chunks, and he begins to hear whole phrases.\" Thus, a telegrapher can effectively \"remember\" several dozen dits and dahs as a single phrase. Naive subjects can remember a maximum of only nine binary items, but Miller reports a 1954 experiment in which people were trained to listen to a string of binary digits and (in one case) mentally group them into groups of five, recode each group into a name (for example, \"twenty-one\" for 10101), and remember the names. With sufficient drill, people found it possible to remember as many as forty binary digits. Miller wrote:\n\n<blockquote>It is a little dramatic to watch a person get 40 binary digits in a row and then repeat them back without error. However, if you think of this merely as a mnemonic trick for extending the memory span, you will miss the more important point that is implicit in nearly all such mnemonic devices. The point is that recoding is an extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount of information that we can deal with.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Expertise and skilled memory effects==\nStudies have shown that people have better memories when they are trying to remember items with which they are familiar. Similarly, people tend to create chunks with which they are familiar. This familiarity allows them to remember more individual pieces of content, and also more chunks as a whole. One well-known chunking study was conducted by Chase and Ericsson, who worked with an undergraduate student, SF, over two years.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chase|first=William G.|title=Skill and Working Memory|date=1982-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742108605460|work=Psychology of Learning and Motivation|volume=16|pages=1\u201358|editor-last=Bower|editor-first=Gordon H.|publisher=Academic Press|language=en|doi=10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60546-0|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Ericsson|first2=K. Anders}}</ref> They wanted to see if a person's digit span could be improved with practice. SF began the experiment with a normal span of 7 digits. SF was a long-distance runner, and chunking strings of digits into race times increased his digit span. By the end of the experiment his digit span had grown to 80 numbers. A later description of the research in ''The Brain-Targeted Teaching Model for 21st Century Schools'' (2012) states that SF later expanded his strategy by incorporating ages and years, but his chunks were always familiar, and thus allowed him to recall the to-be-remembered chunks more easily.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardiman, Mariale M.

Hierarchical representations of sequences have an edge over linear representations. They combine efficient local action at low hierarchical levels while maintaining the guidance of an overall structure. While the representation of a linear sequence is simple from storage point of view, there can be potential problems during retrieval. For instance, if there is a break in the sequence chain, subsequent elements will become inaccessible. On the other hand, a hierarchical representation would have multiple levels of representation. A break in the link between lower level nodes does not render any part of the sequence inaccessible, since the control nodes (chunk nodes) at the higher level would still be able to facilitate access to the lower level nodes. \n[[Image:HierarchicalChunking.jpg|600px|center|Schematic of a hierarchical sequential structure with three levels. The lowest level could be a linear representation, while intermediate levels denote chunk nodes. The highest level is the entire sequence.]]\n\nChunks in [[motor learning]] are identified by pauses between successive actions in Terrace (2001).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/avc/terrace/default.htm|title=Serial Organization of Behavior|website=pigeon.psy.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> It is also suggested that during the sequence performance stage (after learning), participants download list items as chunks during pauses. He also argued for an operational definition of chunks suggesting a distinction between the notions of input and output chunks from the ideas of short-term and long-term memory.

The items are more easily remembered as a group than as the individual items themselves. These chunks can be highly subjective because they rely on an individuals perceptions and past experiences, that are able to be linked to the information set. The size of the chunks generally range anywhere from two to six items, but often differ based on language and culture.\n\nAccording to Johnson (1970), there are four main concepts associated with the memory process of chunking: chunk, memory code, decode, and recode.<ref>{{Citation|last=Johnson|first=Neal F.|title=The Role of Chunking and Organization in The Process of Recall11The research reported herein was supported through the Cooperative Research Program of the Office of Education, U.

These item or information sets are to be stored in the same memory code. The process of recoding is where one learns the code for a chunk, and decoding is when the code is translated into the information that it represents.\n\nThe phenomenon of chunking as a memory mechanism is easily observed in the way individuals group numbers, and information, in the day-to-day life. For example, when recalling a number such as 12101946, if numbers are grouped as 12, 10 and 1946, a mnemonic is created for this number as a day, month and year. It would be stored as December 10, 1946 instead of a string of numbers. Similarly, another illustration of the limited capacity of working memory as suggested by George Miller can be seen from the following example: While recalling a mobile phone number such as 9849523450, we might break this into 98 495 234 50. Thus, instead of remembering 10 separate digits that is beyond the \"seven plus-or-minus two\" memory span, we are remembering four groups of numbers.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=George A.|date=1956|title=The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/h0043158|journal=Psychological Review|volume=63|issue=2|pages=81\u201397|doi=10.1037/h0043158|issn=1939-1471}}</ref>\n\n==Modality Effect==\nA [[modality effect]] is present in chunking. That is, the mechanism used to convey the list of items to the individual affects how much \"chunking\" occurs.\n\nExperimentally, it has been found that auditory presentation results in a larger amount of grouping in the responses of individuals than visual presentation does. Previous literature, such as George Miller's [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information (1956)]] has shown that the probability of recall of information is greater when the \"chunking\" strategy is used.<ref name=\":0\" /> As stated above, the grouping of the responses occurs as individuals place them into categories according to their inter-relatedness based on semantic and perceptual properties. Lindley (1966) showed that since the groups produced have meaning to the participant, this strategy makes it easier for an individual to recall and maintain information in memory during studies and testing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lindley|first=Richard H.|date=1966-08-01|title=Recoding as a function of chunking and meaningfulness|journal=Psychonomic Science|language=en|volume=6|issue=8|pages=393\u2013394|doi=10.3758/BF03330953|issn=0033-3131|doi-access=free}}</ref> Therefore, when \"chunking\" is used as a strategy, one can expect a higher proportion of correct recalls.\n\n==Memory training systems, mnemonic==\nVarious kinds of [[memory]] training systems and [[mnemonics]] include training and drill in specially-designed recoding or chunking schemes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lyon|first=Don R.|date=1977-10-01|title=Individual differences in immediate serial recall: A matter of mnemonics?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028577900147|journal=Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=403\u2013411|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(77)90014-7|issn=0010-0285}}</ref> Such systems existed before Miller's paper, but there was no convenient term to describe the general strategy or substantive and reliable research.

Miller]], \"[[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two|The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Neisser|first=Ulric|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/cognitive-psychology/oclc/192730|title=Cognitive psychology|date=1967|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|isbn=978-0-390-66509-6|location=New York|language=English|oclc=192730}}</ref> At a time when [[information theory]] was beginning to be applied in psychology, Miller observed that some human cognitive tasks fit the model of a \"channel capacity\" characterized by a roughly constant capacity in bits, but short-term memory did not. A variety of studies could be summarized by saying that short-term memory had a capacity of about \"seven plus-or-minus two\" chunks. Miller (1956) wrote, \"With binary items the span is about nine and, although it drops to about five with [[monosyllabic]] English words, the difference is far less than the hypothesis of constant information would require (see also, [[memory span]]). The span of immediate memory seems to be almost independent of the number of bits per chunk, at least over the range that has been examined to date.\" Miller acknowledged that \"we are not very definite about what constitutes a chunk of information.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMiller (1956) noted that according to this theory, it should be possible to increase short-term memory for low-information-content items effectively by mentally recoding them into a smaller number of high-information-content items. He imagined this process being useful in scenarios such as \"a man just beginning to learn [[morse code|radio-telegraphic code]] hears each dit and dah as a separate chunk. Soon he is able to organize these sounds into letters and then he can deal with the letters as chunks. Then the letters organize themselves as words, which are still larger chunks, and he begins to hear whole phrases.\" Thus, a telegrapher can effectively \"remember\" several dozen dits and dahs as a single phrase. Naive subjects can remember a maximum of only nine binary items, but Miller reports a 1954 experiment in which people were trained to listen to a string of binary digits and (in one case) mentally group them into groups of five, recode each group into a name (for example, \"twenty-one\" for 10101), and remember the names. With sufficient drill, people found it possible to remember as many as forty binary digits. Miller wrote:\n\n<blockquote>It is a little dramatic to watch a person get 40 binary digits in a row and then repeat them back without error. However, if you think of this merely as a mnemonic trick for extending the memory span, you will miss the more important point that is implicit in nearly all such mnemonic devices. The point is that recoding is an extremely powerful weapon for increasing the amount of information that we can deal with.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Expertise and skilled memory effects==\nStudies have shown that people have better memories when they are trying to remember items with which they are familiar. Similarly, people tend to create chunks with which they are familiar. This familiarity allows them to remember more individual pieces of content, and also more chunks as a whole. One well-known chunking study was conducted by Chase and Ericsson, who worked with an undergraduate student, SF, over two years.<ref>{{Citation|last=Chase|first=William G.|title=Skill and Working Memory|date=1982-01-01|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079742108605460|work=Psychology of Learning and Motivation|volume=16|pages=1\u201358|editor-last=Bower|editor-first=Gordon H.|publisher=Academic Press|language=en|doi=10.1016/s0079-7421(08)60546-0|access-date=2020-04-14|last2=Ericsson|first2=K. Anders}}</ref> They wanted to see if a person's digit span could be improved with practice. SF began the experiment with a normal span of 7 digits. SF was a long-distance runner, and chunking strings of digits into race times increased his digit span. By the end of the experiment his digit span had grown to 80 numbers. A later description of the research in ''The Brain-Targeted Teaching Model for 21st Century Schools'' (2012) states that SF later expanded his strategy by incorporating ages and years, but his chunks were always familiar, and thus allowed him to recall the to-be-remembered chunks more easily.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hardiman, Mariale M.

Hierarchical representations of sequences have an edge over linear representations. They combine efficient local action at low hierarchical levels while maintaining the guidance of an overall structure. While the representation of a linear sequence is simple from storage point of view, there can be potential problems during retrieval. For instance, if there is a break in the sequence chain, subsequent elements will become inaccessible. On the other hand, a hierarchical representation would have multiple levels of representation. A break in the link between lower level nodes does not render any part of the sequence inaccessible, since the control nodes (chunk nodes) at the higher level would still be able to facilitate access to the lower level nodes. \n[[Image:HierarchicalChunking.jpg|600px|center|Schematic of a hierarchical sequential structure with three levels. The lowest level could be a linear representation, while intermediate levels denote chunk nodes. The highest level is the entire sequence.]]\n\nChunks in [[motor learning]] are identified by pauses between successive actions in Terrace (2001).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/avc/terrace/default.htm|title=Serial Organization of Behavior|website=pigeon.psy.tufts.edu|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> It is also suggested that during the sequence performance stage (after learning), participants download list items as chunks during pauses. He also argued for an operational definition of chunks suggesting a distinction between the notions of input and output chunks from the ideas of short-term and long-term memory. Input chunks reflect the limitation of working memory during the encoding of new information (how new information is stored in long-term memory), and how it is retrieved during subsequent recall. Output chunks reflect the organization of over-learned motor programs that are generated on-line in working memory. Sakai et al. (2003) showed that participants spontaneously organize a sequence into a number of chunks across few sets, and that these chunks were distinct among participants tested on the same sequence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sakai|first=Katsuyuki|last2=Kitaguchi|first2=Katsuya|last3=Hikosaka|first3=Okihide|date=2003-09-01|title=Chunking during human visuomotor sequence learning|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-003-1548-8|journal=Experimental Brain Research|volume=152|issue=2|pages=229\u2013242|doi=10.1007/s00221-003-1548-8|issn=0014-4819}}</ref> They also demonstrated that performance of a shuffled sequence was poorer when the chunk patterns were disrupted than when the chunk patterns were preserved.

Several successful computational models of learning and expertise have been developed using this idea, such as [[EPAM]] (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) and [[CHREST (cognitive architecture)|CHREST]] (Chunk Hierarchy and Retrieval Structures).

She was classically trained attending both the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Leningrad State Choreographic Institute]] and [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography|Moscow Choreographic School]]. She performed in Russia until her marriage in the early 1930s to a Japanese diplomat. After agreeing to move to Japan in 1936, she developed classical ballet in the country, bringing with her the theoretical and pedagogical materials to underpin her dance lessons and establish the field.\n\nFrom 1936 to her retirement in 1957, Sapphire was employed by the Nihon Gekij\u014d variety theater, serving as its [[prima ballerina]], choreographer and ballet instructor. She performed classic Russian ballets producing all aspects of the productions, as well as choreographing Japanese dances for stage and film. She retired from the stage in 1953, but continued to be influential in ballet until 1957. In 1960, her husband was assigned to a post in Poland and she lived there for three years. In her later years, Sapphire wrote three books about ballet, which remain influential in Japan.\n\n==Early life and training==\nOlga Ivanova Pavlova was born on 28 June 1907 in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia to Juliana Kuzminichna Kuzmina and Gustav Yanovich Grudberg.

ballerina and choreographer '''Olga Ivanovna Pavlova''' ({{lang-ru|\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430}}), whose married name was '''Midori Shimizu''' ({{lang-ja|\u6e05\u6c34\u307f\u3069\u308a}}). She was classically trained attending both the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Leningrad State Choreographic Institute]] and [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography|Moscow Choreographic School]]. She performed in Russia until her marriage in the early 1930s to a Japanese diplomat. After agreeing to move to Japan in 1936, she developed classical ballet in the country, bringing with her the theoretical and pedagogical materials to underpin her dance lessons and establish the field.\n\nFrom 1936 to her retirement in 1957, Sapphire was employed by the Nihon Gekij\u014d variety theater, serving as its [[prima ballerina]], choreographer and ballet instructor. She performed classic Russian ballets producing all aspects of the productions, as well as choreographing Japanese dances for stage and film. She retired from the stage in 1953, but continued to be influential in ballet until 1957. In 1960, her husband was assigned to a post in Poland and she lived there for three years. In her later years, Sapphire wrote three books about ballet, which remain influential in Japan.\n\n==Early life and training==\nOlga Ivanova Pavlova was born on 28 June 1907 in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia to Juliana Kuzminichna Kuzmina and Gustav Yanovich Grudberg. Her parents had a [[common-law marriage]], as they were unable to marry since Grudberg was not a member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. He was a locksmith, originally from [[Riga]] and her mother was originally from [[Pskov]], near the [[Estonia]]n border. When their first child, Ekaterina was born, she was baptized with the surname Pavlova, a family name of her great-uncle.

He was a member of two [[Stanley Cup]]-winning teams, the Ottawa Silver Seven of 1906 and the Quebec Bulldogs of 1913. His two brothers [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] and [[Harry Smith (ice hockey, born 1883)|Harry Smith]] also played professional ice hockey.<ref name=\"pp\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19070306&id=GgsbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z0gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2959,1390828 |title=Smith Family Famous in the Hockey World |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=March 6, 1907 |p=14}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nSmith was born in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Smith,<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |title=Death Notices: Harry Smith |date=May 6, 1953 |p=34}}</ref> one of seven brothers who would play senior ice hockey.<ref name=\"pp\"/> Smith began playing senior hockey as an amateur with the Ottawa Emmetts from 1903 until 1905. He joined the [[Ottawa Victorias]] of the [[Federal Amateur Hockey League]] (FAHL) in 1905-06, and also played for the [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Hockey Club]], aka the \"Silver Seven\" that same year, playing with his brothers Alf and Harry.\n\nHe moved to [[Pittsburgh]] to become a professional with the [[Pittsburgh Professionals]] in 1906, playing three seasons with the team before returning to Canada to join the Brantford Indians of the [[Ontario Professional Hockey League]] (OPHL). Smith played two seasons with Brantford. In 1910-11 he became a member of the [[Galt Professionals]] of the OPHL helping Galt win the OPHL championship. Along with most of the Galt team, he bolted to the [[Moncton Victorias]] the following season, helping Moncton win the Maritime championship. The Galt and Moncton teams Smith was a member of played consecutive Stanley Cup challenges, Galt against Ottawa in 1911 and Moncton against Quebec in 1912, both times unsuccessfully. Smith then joined the [[Quebec Bulldogs]]. After the 1913\u201314 season in Quebec, he was traded (twice) to [[Toronto Shamrocks]]. This caused a dispute with the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]]. At that time, the NHA and PCHA had an agreement whereby the PCHA teams could draft one player from three of the six teams of the NHA. He was traded away from Quebec, which was eligible to lose a player. He started play for Shamrocks, though he had been drafted by Victoria of the PCHA. It was found that the initial trade was not allowed, and Quebec re-traded him to Toronto during the season, disregarding the PCHA efforts to get him. During the 1914\u201315 season, he was traded back to Quebec, avoiding the PCHA draft again.\n\nWhile skating for the Ottawa Victorias in 1906, Smith led the FAHL with 12 goals (including eight goals in a game against [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]] on February 23, 1906).

He was a member of two [[Stanley Cup]]-winning teams, the Ottawa Silver Seven of 1906 and the Quebec Bulldogs of 1913. His two brothers [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] and [[Harry Smith (ice hockey, born 1883)|Harry Smith]] also played professional ice hockey.<ref name=\"pp\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19070306&id=GgsbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z0gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2959,1390828 |title=Smith Family Famous in the Hockey World |work=The Pittsburgh Press |date=March 6, 1907 |p=14}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nSmith was born in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], to Mr. and Mrs. Henry Smith,<ref>{{cite news |work=Ottawa Citizen |title=Death Notices: Harry Smith |date=May 6, 1953 |p=34}}</ref> one of seven brothers who would play senior ice hockey.<ref name=\"pp\"/> Smith began playing senior hockey as an amateur with the Ottawa Emmetts from 1903 until 1905. He joined the [[Ottawa Victorias]] of the [[Federal Amateur Hockey League]] (FAHL) in 1905-06, and also played for the [[Stanley Cup]] champion [[Ottawa Senators (original)|Ottawa Hockey Club]], aka the \"Silver Seven\" that same year, playing with his brothers Alf and Harry.\n\nHe moved to [[Pittsburgh]] to become a professional with the [[Pittsburgh Professionals]] in 1906, playing three seasons with the team before returning to Canada to join the Brantford Indians of the [[Ontario Professional Hockey League]] (OPHL). Smith played two seasons with Brantford. In 1910-11 he became a member of the [[Galt Professionals]] of the OPHL helping Galt win the OPHL championship. Along with most of the Galt team, he bolted to the [[Moncton Victorias]] the following season, helping Moncton win the Maritime championship. The Galt and Moncton teams Smith was a member of played consecutive Stanley Cup challenges, Galt against Ottawa in 1911 and Moncton against Quebec in 1912, both times unsuccessfully. Smith then joined the [[Quebec Bulldogs]]. After the 1913\u201314 season in Quebec, he was traded (twice) to [[Toronto Shamrocks]]. This caused a dispute with the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]]. At that time, the NHA and PCHA had an agreement whereby the PCHA teams could draft one player from three of the six teams of the NHA. He was traded away from Quebec, which was eligible to lose a player. He started play for Shamrocks, though he had been drafted by Victoria of the PCHA. It was found that the initial trade was not allowed, and Quebec re-traded him to Toronto during the season, disregarding the PCHA efforts to get him. During the 1914\u201315 season, he was traded back to Quebec, avoiding the PCHA draft again.\n\nWhile skating for the Ottawa Victorias in 1906, Smith led the FAHL with 12 goals (including eight goals in a game against [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]] on February 23, 1906). In future years, he was the leading goal-scorer in the OPHL (1908\u201309), the MPHA (1910\u201311) and the NHA (1913\u201314, 1914\u201315).\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Regular season and playoffs===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|[[Regular season]]\n! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"|\n! colspan=\"5\"|[[Playoffs]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
