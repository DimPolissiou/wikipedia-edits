The character and Azaria's portrayal of him had come under scrutiny since the [[Hari Kondabolu]] documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'' released in 2017. Apu's portrayal came under scrutiny again when the Simpsons staff referenced the criticism as being too [[politically correct]] in the [[The Simpsons (season 29)|season 29]] episode \"[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]\" which resulted in backlash from some people concerned about the issue who felt that the response was immature. Azaria said that it was a mutual decision made between himself and the senior staff, stating, \"all we know there is I won't be doing the voice anymore, unless there's someway to transition it or something.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/apu-voice-actor/|title='The Simpsons' Star Hank Azaria Will No Longer Voice Apu [TCA 2020]|work=SlashFilm|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of The Simpsons episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Episode table|main\n|background = #3901A4 \n|overall    = \n|season     = \n|title      = \n|titleR     = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/simpsons/listings/|title=''The Simpsons'' Episode Listings|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref>\n|director   = \n|writer     = \n|airdate    = \n|airdateR   = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\" />\n|prodcode   = \n|viewers    = \n|country    = U.S.\n|episodes   = \n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|The Simpsons (season 31)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 663\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[The Winter of Our Monetized Content]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Ryan Koh]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|29}}\n |ProdCode        = YABF19\n |Viewers         = 2.33<ref name=\"31.01\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-sept-29-2019/|title='60 Minutes,' 'NCIS: Los Angeles,' and 'Sunday Night Football' adjust up: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 1, 2019|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary    = [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] become viral video stars.

Taylor's characters were adopted during this season's production cycle by voice actress [[Grey Griffin]] starting with the episode \"[[Marge the Lumberjill]]\", though the last episode to feature Taylor would be \"Thanksgiving of Horror\" which aired afterwards due to being part of the [[The Simpsons (season 30)|prior season]]'s production run that was deliberately scheduled to air close to [[Thanksgiving]] 2019.\n\n==Accolades==\nIn early December 2019 it was announced that three episodes had been nominated for [[Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Animation|Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation]] for the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2019|72nd Writers Guild of America Awards]], resulting in ''The Simpsons'' having the most nominations overall that year.

The episode \"[[The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby]]\" was delayed from the previous season, with the original intent to air it instead of \"[[I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say D'oh]]\" on April 7, 2019. The episode was put on hold after the show's producers decided to make a short film related to the episode involving Maggie and another baby named Hudson titled ''[[Playdate with Destiny]]'' as well. The short film premiered on February 29, 2020, attached to advanced screenings of the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] release ''[[Onward (film)|Onward]]'' with \"The Incredible Lightness of Being a Baby\" serving as a sequel to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/the-simpsons-short-playdate-with-destiny-onward-origins/|title=Exclusive: The story behind the secret ''Simpsons'' short heading to theaters|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nIt was during the run of this season that longtime voice actor [[Hank Azaria]] announced that he was officially stepping down from voicing [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], a character he had played since the episode \"[[The Telltale Head]]\" from the first season. The character and Azaria's portrayal of him had come under scrutiny since the [[Hari Kondabolu]] documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'' released in 2017. Apu's portrayal came under scrutiny again when the Simpsons staff referenced the criticism as being too [[politically correct]] in the [[The Simpsons (season 29)|season 29]] episode \"[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]\" which resulted in backlash from some people concerned about the issue who felt that the response was immature. Azaria said that it was a mutual decision made between himself and the senior staff, stating, \"all we know there is I won't be doing the voice anymore, unless there's someway to transition it or something.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/apu-voice-actor/|title='The Simpsons' Star Hank Azaria Will No Longer Voice Apu [TCA 2020]|work=SlashFilm|accessdate=January 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of The Simpsons episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Episode table|main\n|background = #3901A4 \n|overall    = \n|season     = \n|title      = \n|titleR     = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/simpsons/listings/|title=''The Simpsons'' Episode Listings|publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]}}</ref>\n|director   = \n|writer     = \n|airdate    = \n|airdateR   = <ref name=\"The Futon Critic\" />\n|prodcode   = \n|viewers    = \n|country    = U.S.\n|episodes   = \n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|The Simpsons (season 31)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 663\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[The Winter of Our Monetized Content]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Bob Anderson (director)|Bob Anderson]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Ryan Koh]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|9|29}}\n |ProdCode        = YABF19\n |Viewers         = 2.33<ref name=\"31.01\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-sept-29-2019/|title='60 Minutes,' 'NCIS: Los Angeles,' and 'Sunday Night Football' adjust up: Sunday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 1, 2019|accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|ShortSummary    = [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] become viral video stars.
