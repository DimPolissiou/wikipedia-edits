He invited Hackett to join him for Sunday mass. Hackett started accompanying him, and was impressed when Kennedy took it upon himself to fill in for a missing altar boy one Sunday.<ref name=Thomas37-40 /> Hackett admired Kennedy's determination to bypass his shortcomings, and remembered him redoubling his efforts whenever something did not come easy to him, which included athletics, studies, success with girls, and popularity.<ref name=Mills34 /> Hackett remembered the two of them being \"misfits\", a commonality that drew him to Kennedy, along with an unwillingness to conform to how others acted even if doing so meant not being accepted. Kennedy's grades improved.<ref name=Thomas37-40 />\n\nOne of his first relationships was with a girl named Piedy Bailey. The pair was photographed together when he walked her home after chapel on a Sunday night. Bailey was fond of him and remembered him as being \"very appealing\". She recalled him being funny, \"separate, larky; outside the cliques; private all the time\". Soon after he transferred to Milton, he pressed his father to allow him to enlist, as he wanted to catch up to his brothers who were both serving in the military.<ref name=Thomas37-40 /> Kennedy had arrived at Milton unfamiliar with his peers and made little attempt to know the names of his classmates; he called most of the other boys \"fella\" instead. For this, he was nicknamed \"Fella\". Most of the school's students had come in eighth or ninth grade and cliques had already been formed. Despite this, his schoolmates would later say the school had no prejudice. He had an early sense of virtue; he disliked dirty jokes and bullying, once stepping in when an upperclassman tried bothering a younger student.<ref name=Thomas37-40>Thomas, pp. 37\u201340.</ref> The headmaster at Milton would later summarize that he was a \"very intelligent boy, quiet and shy, but not outstanding, and he left no special mark on Milton\".<ref name=Smith33 />\n\n=== Relationship with parents ===\nIn Kennedy's younger years, his father dubbed him the \"runt\" of the family and wrote him off. Close family friend [[Lem Billings]] once remarked to Joe Sr. that he was \"the most generous little boy\", and Joe Sr. replied that he did not know where his son \"got that\". Billings commented that the only similarity between Robert and Joe Sr. was their eye color.<ref name=Thomas30 /> As Kennedy grew, his father worried that he was soft on others, conflicting with his ideology. In response, Kennedy developed a tough persona that masked his gentle personality, attempting to appease his father.<ref name=Mills19>Mills, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Biographer Judie Mills wrote that Joe Sr.'s lack of interest in Robert was evident by the length of time it took for him to decide to transfer him to Milton Academy. Both Joe Jr. and John attended the exclusive Protestant prep school [[Choate School|Choate]] from their first year, while Robert was already a junior by the time he was enrolled at Milton. Despite his father's disdain, Kennedy continued to seek his approval, requesting that Joe Sr. write him a letter about his opinions on different political events and World War II.<ref name=Mills34 />\n\nAs a child, Kennedy also strove to meet his mother's expectations to become the most dutiful, religious, affectionate, and obedient of the Kennedy children, but the father and son grew distant.<ref name=\"Hilty15-16\"/> Rose found his gentle personality endearing, though this was noted as having made him \"invisible to his father\".<ref name=Mills34 /> She influenced him heavily and like her, he became a devout Catholic and throughout his lifetime he practiced his religion more seriously than the other boys in the family.<ref>{{cite book|title=In His Own Right: The Political Odyssey of Senator Robert F.

Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum'', Boston)]]\nKennedy ran on a platform of racial and economic justice, non-aggression in foreign policy, decentralization of power, and social change. A crucial element of his campaign was an engagement with the young, whom he identified as being the future of a reinvigorated American society based on partnership and equality. His policy objectives did not sit well with the business community, where he was viewed as something of a fiscal liability, opposed as they were to the tax increases necessary to fund social programs. At one of his university speeches (Indiana University Medical School), he was asked, \"Where are we going to get the money to pay for all these new programs you're proposing?\" He replied to the medical students, about to enter lucrative careers, \"From you.\"<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/><ref>Newfield, Jack. (1988) [1969]. Robert Kennedy: A Memoir. Plume</ref>\n\nIt was this intense and frank mode of dialogue with which he was to continue to engage those whom he viewed as not being traditional allies of Democratic ideals or initiatives. In a speech at the [[University of Alabama]], he argued, \"I believe that any who seek high office this year must go before all Americans, not just those who agree with them, but also those who disagree, recognizing that it is not just our supporters, not just those who vote for us, but all Americans who we must lead in the difficult years ahead.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://acumen.lib.ua.edu/u0008_0000001_0000013 | title =Emphasis (1968), Robert F.

His message of change raised hope for some and brought fear to others. Kennedy wanted to be a bridge across the divide of American society. His bid for the presidency saw not only a continuation of the programs he and his brother had undertaken during the president's term in office, but also an extension of Johnson's Great Society.<ref name=\"Schlesinger 2002 1978, p. xvi\">Schlesinger (2002) [1978], p. xvi.</ref>\n\nKennedy visited numerous small towns and made himself available to the masses by participating in long motorcades and street-corner stump speeches, often in troubled inner cities. He made urban poverty a chief concern of his campaign, which in part led to enormous crowds that would attend his events in poor urban areas or rural parts of [[Appalachia]].<ref>Schlesinger (2002) [1978], pp. 863, 864, 882, 883.</ref>\n\n[[File:RFK speech on MLK.png|thumb|250px|Kennedy giving his [[Robert F.

Schlesinger comments that Kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians, at once both temperamental and forgiving. In this he was very much his father's son, lacking truly lasting emotional independence, and yet possessing a great desire to contribute. He lacked the innate self-confidence of his contemporaries yet found a greater self-assurance in the experience of married life, an experience that he stated had given him a base of self-belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/>\n\nUpon hearing yet again the assertion that he was \"ruthless\", Kennedy once joked to a reporter, \"If I find out who has called me ruthless I will destroy him.\" He also confessed to possessing a bad temper that required self-control: \"My biggest problem as counsel is to keep my temper. I think we all feel that when a witness comes before the United States Senate, he has an obligation to speak frankly and tell the truth. To see people sit in front of us and lie and evade makes me boil inside. But you can't lose your temper; if you do, the witness has gotten the best of you.\"<ref>Schlesinger, p. 150.</ref>\n\nAttorney Michael O'Donnell wrote, \"[Kennedy] offered that most intoxicating of political aphrodisiacs: authenticity. He was blunt to a fault, and his favorite campaign activity was arguing with college students. To many, his idealistic opportunism was irresistible.\"\n\n<blockquote>In his earlier life, Kennedy had developed a reputation as the family's attack dog.  He was a hostile cross-examiner on Joseph McCarthy's Senate committee; a fixer and leg-breaker as JFK's campaign manager; an unforgiving and merciless cutthroat\u2014his father's son right down to Joseph Kennedy's purported observation that \"he hates like me.\"  Yet Bobby Kennedy somehow became a liberal icon, an antiwar visionary who tried to outflank Lyndon Johnson's Great Society from the left.<ref name=\"o'donnell\">{{cite news|title=How the Thug Became a Dove|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-thug-became-a-dove-1497042993|author=O'Donnell, Michael|date=June 9, 2017|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|page=C7}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How the Thug Became a Dove|url=http://www.michael-odonnell.com/how-the-thug-became-a-dove/|author=O'Donnell, Michael|date=June 10, 2017|publisher=michael-odonnell.com|access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>On Kennedy's ideological development, his brother John once remarked, \"He might once have been intolerant of liberals as such because his early experience was with that high-minded, high-speaking kind who never got anything done.

He invited Hackett to join him for Sunday mass. Hackett started accompanying him, and was impressed when Kennedy took it upon himself to fill in for a missing altar boy one Sunday.<ref name=Thomas37-40 /> Hackett admired Kennedy's determination to bypass his shortcomings, and remembered him redoubling his efforts whenever something did not come easy to him, which included athletics, studies, success with girls, and popularity.<ref name=Mills34 /> Hackett remembered the two of them being \"misfits\", a commonality that drew him to Kennedy, along with an unwillingness to conform to how others acted even if doing so meant not being accepted. Kennedy's grades improved.<ref name=Thomas37-40 />\n\nOne of his first relationships was with a girl named Piedy Bailey. The pair was photographed together when he walked her home after chapel on a Sunday night. Bailey was fond of him and remembered him as being \"very appealing\". She recalled him being funny, \"separate, larky; outside the cliques; private all the time\". Soon after he transferred to Milton, he pressed his father to allow him to enlist, as he wanted to catch up to his brothers who were both serving in the military.<ref name=Thomas37-40 /> Kennedy had arrived at Milton unfamiliar with his peers and made little attempt to know the names of his classmates; he called most of the other boys \"fella\" instead. For this, he was nicknamed \"Fella\". Most of the school's students had come in eighth or ninth grade and cliques had already been formed. Despite this, his schoolmates would later say the school had no prejudice. He had an early sense of virtue; he disliked dirty jokes and bullying, once stepping in when an upperclassman tried bothering a younger student.<ref name=Thomas37-40>Thomas, pp. 37\u201340.</ref> The headmaster at Milton would later summarize that he was a \"very intelligent boy, quiet and shy, but not outstanding, and he left no special mark on Milton\".<ref name=Smith33 />\n\n=== Relationship with parents ===\nIn Kennedy's younger years, his father dubbed him the \"runt\" of the family and wrote him off. Close family friend [[Lem Billings]] once remarked to Joe Sr. that he was \"the most generous little boy\", and Joe Sr. replied that he did not know where his son \"got that\". Billings commented that the only similarity between Robert and Joe Sr. was their eye color.<ref name=Thomas30 /> As Kennedy grew, his father worried that he was soft on others, conflicting with his ideology. In response, Kennedy developed a tough persona that masked his gentle personality, attempting to appease his father.<ref name=Mills19>Mills, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> Biographer Judie Mills wrote that Joe Sr.'s lack of interest in Robert was evident by the length of time it took for him to decide to transfer him to Milton Academy. Both Joe Jr. and John attended the exclusive Protestant prep school [[Choate School|Choate]] from their first year, while Robert was already a junior by the time he was enrolled at Milton. Despite his father's disdain, Kennedy continued to seek his approval, requesting that Joe Sr. write him a letter about his opinions on different political events and World War II.<ref name=Mills34 />\n\nAs a child, Kennedy also strove to meet his mother's expectations to become the most dutiful, religious, affectionate, and obedient of the Kennedy children, but the father and son grew distant.<ref name=\"Hilty15-16\"/> Rose found his gentle personality endearing, though this was noted as having made him \"invisible to his father\".<ref name=Mills34 /> She influenced him heavily and like her, he became a devout Catholic and throughout his lifetime he practiced his religion more seriously than the other boys in the family.<ref>{{cite book|title=In His Own Right: The Political Odyssey of Senator Robert F.

Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum'', Boston)]]\nKennedy ran on a platform of racial and economic justice, non-aggression in foreign policy, decentralization of power, and social change. A crucial element of his campaign was an engagement with the young, whom he identified as being the future of a reinvigorated American society based on partnership and equality. His policy objectives did not sit well with the business community, where he was viewed as something of a fiscal liability, opposed as they were to the tax increases necessary to fund social programs. At one of his university speeches (Indiana University Medical School), he was asked, \"Where are we going to get the money to pay for all these new programs you're proposing?\" He replied to the medical students, about to enter lucrative careers, \"From you.\"<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/><ref>Newfield, Jack. (1988) [1969]. Robert Kennedy: A Memoir. Plume</ref>\n\nIt was this intense and frank mode of dialogue with which he was to continue to engage those whom he viewed as not being traditional allies of Democratic ideals or initiatives. In a speech at the [[University of Alabama]], he argued, \"I believe that any who seek high office this year must go before all Americans, not just those who agree with them, but also those who disagree, recognizing that it is not just our supporters, not just those who vote for us, but all Americans who we must lead in the difficult years ahead.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://acumen.lib.ua.edu/u0008_0000001_0000013 | title =Emphasis (1968), Robert F.

His message of change raised hope for some and brought fear to others. Kennedy wanted to be a bridge across the divide of American society. His bid for the presidency saw not only a continuation of the programs he and his brother had undertaken during the president's term in office, but also an extension of Johnson's Great Society.<ref name=\"Schlesinger 2002 1978, p. xvi\">Schlesinger (2002) [1978], p. xvi.</ref>\n\nKennedy visited numerous small towns and made himself available to the masses by participating in long motorcades and street-corner stump speeches, often in troubled inner cities.

His mother had a similar concern,<ref name=Thomas30 /> as he was the \"smallest and thinnest\", but soon afterward, the family discovered \"there was no fear of that\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1120.html|title=Robert Francis Kennedy: Attorney General, Senator and Heir of the New Frontier|first=Alden|last=Whitman|date=June 6, 1968 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824125625/http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1120.html | archivedate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> Family friend [[Lem Billings]] met Kennedy when he was 8 years old and would later reflect that he loved him, adding that Kennedy \"was the nicest little boy I ever met\".<ref name=Schlesinger21-23 /> Billings also said Kennedy was barely noticed \"in the early days, but that's because he didn't bother anybody\".<ref name=Hilty15-16 /> Luella Hennessey, who became the nurse for the Kennedy children when Kennedy was 12, called him \"the most thoughtful and considerate\" of his siblings.<ref name=Schlesinger21-23>Schlesinger, pp. 21\u201323.</ref>\n\nKennedy was teased by his siblings, as in their family it was a norm for humor to be displayed in that fashion. He would turn jokes on himself or remain silent.<ref name=Thomas30>Thomas, pp. 30\u201331.</ref> Despite his gentle demeanor, he could be outspoken, and once engaged a priest in a public argument that horrified his mother, who later conceded that he had been correct all along. Even when arguing for a noble cause, his comments could have \"a cutting quality\".<ref>Hilty, pp. 51\u201352.</ref>\n\nAlthough Joe Kennedy's most ambitious dreams centered around Bobby's older brothers, Bobby maintained the code of personal loyalty that seemed to infuse the life of his family. His competitiveness was admired by his father and elder brothers, while his loyalty bound them more affectionately close.\n\nA rather timid child, he was often the target of his father's dominating temperament. Working on the campaigns of older brother John, he was more involved, passionate, and tenacious than the candidate himself, obsessed with detail, fighting out every battle, and taking workers to task. He had always been closer to John than the other members of the family.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/>\n\nKennedy's opponents on [[Capitol Hill]] maintained that his collegiate magnanimity was sometimes hindered by a tenacious and somewhat impatient manner. His professional life was dominated by the same attitudes that governed his family life: a certainty that good humor and leisure must be balanced by service and accomplishment. Schlesinger comments that Kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians, at once both temperamental and forgiving. In this he was very much his father's son, lacking truly lasting emotional independence, and yet possessing a great desire to contribute. He lacked the innate self-confidence of his contemporaries yet found a greater self-assurance in the experience of married life, an experience that he stated had given him a base of self-belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/>\n\nUpon hearing yet again the assertion that he was \"ruthless\", Kennedy once joked to a reporter, \"If I find out who has called me ruthless I will destroy him.\" He also confessed to possessing a bad temper that required self-control: \"My biggest problem as counsel is to keep my temper. I think we all feel that when a witness comes before the United States Senate, he has an obligation to speak frankly and tell the truth. To see people sit in front of us and lie and evade makes me boil inside. But you can't lose your temper; if you do, the witness has gotten the best of you.\"<ref>Schlesinger, p. 150.</ref>\n\nAttorney Michael O'Donnell wrote, \"[Kennedy] offered that most intoxicating of political aphrodisiacs: authenticity. He was blunt to a fault, and his favorite campaign activity was arguing with college students. To many, his idealistic opportunism was irresistible.\"\n\n<blockquote>In his earlier life, Kennedy had developed a reputation as the family's attack dog.  He was a hostile cross-examiner on Joseph McCarthy's Senate committee; a fixer and leg-breaker as JFK's campaign manager; an unforgiving and merciless cutthroat\u2014his father's son right down to Joseph Kennedy's purported observation that \"he hates like me.\"  Yet Bobby Kennedy somehow became a liberal icon, an antiwar visionary who tried to outflank Lyndon Johnson's Great Society from the left.<ref name=\"o'donnell\">{{cite news|title=How the Thug Became a Dove|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-thug-became-a-dove-1497042993|author=O'Donnell, Michael|date=June 9, 2017|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|page=C7}}{{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How the Thug Became a Dove|url=http://www.michael-odonnell.com/how-the-thug-became-a-dove/|author=O'Donnell, Michael|date=June 10, 2017|publisher=michael-odonnell.com|access-date=October 19, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>On Kennedy's ideological development, his brother John once remarked, \"He might once have been intolerant of liberals as such because his early experience was with that high-minded, high-speaking kind who never got anything done.

He was more religious than his brothers<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/> and approached his duties with a Catholic [[worldview]].\n\nThroughout his life, he made reference to his faith, how it informed every area of his life, and how it gave him the strength to re-enter politics following his older brother's assassination. His was not an unresponsive and staid faith, but the faith of a Catholic Radical, perhaps the first successful Catholic Radical in American political history.<ref>Schlesinger, p. 191 Cf. Murray Kempton, ''The Progressive'', September 1960.</ref>\n\nIn the last years of his life, he also found great solace in the playwrights and poets of ancient Greece, especially the writings of [[Aeschylus]],<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/> suggested to him by Jacqueline after JFK's death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robert Kennedy: His Life|first=Evan|last=Thomas |publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2013|page=22}}</ref> In his Indianapolis speech on April 4, 1968, following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Kennedy slightly misquoted these lines from Aeschylus:\n<ref>{{cite book| editor1-last = McConnell| editor1-first = Justine| editor2-last = Hall| editor2-first = Edith| title = Ancient Greek Myth in World Fiction since 1989| publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing| series = Bloomsbury Studies in Classical Reception| date = June 2, 2016| pages = 249| url = https://books.google.com/?id=dnGQCwAAQBAJ&dq=| isbn = 9781472579409}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boomhower|first=Ray E.|title=Robert F.

Besides in 1980, the Ramsar site was also declared a wildlife sanctuary by the [[Sindh Province|Sindh government]].\n\nThis sanctuary is supporting nature's richest ecosystem. It provides food and shelter to a number of migratory and local wildlife species. The marshy Rann of Kutch, with its surrounding [[Thar desert]] area in Sindh, is one of the most potential habitats for a number of animals and birds in the province.\n\nThis area is known to be a breeding ground for [[flamingo]]es and staging ground for pelicans, cranes, storks and many species of [[waterfowl]]. It is also an important site for animals like [[blue bull]]s, [[chinkara]]s and [[desert wolves]], which have been sighted over here regularly. The site supports many species of birds and mammals which are locally and globally threatened. The site is also a wintering area for water birds. It is estimated that this wetland regularly supports over 40,000 water birds.\n\nThe marshy habitat is most attractive for water bird species such as [[common teal]], [[shell duck]], [[mallard]], [[pochard]], flamingo and [[pelican]]. Occasionally, the range of other species has also been seen in the outskirts of the site.

It is about 7,505.22 square kilometres in size and is reputed to be the largest salt desert in the world.\n\nRann of Kutch Wildlife Sanctuary is located in Badin District, Sindh, Pakistan. The Rann of Kutch is geographically the widest Ramsar site spread over 566,375 hectares out of all 10 identified Ramsar sites in Sindh.\n\n==Geology==\nIt comprises stabilized sand dunes, some more than 170m in height, with broad inter-dunal valleys of alluvial soil, integral with the large Rann of Kutch across the frontier with India, which includes permanent saline marshes, coastal brackish lagoons, tidal mudflats, and estuarine habitats.. Some 500,000 agro-pastoralists live in 330 villages/hamlets in the site area, and rich archaeological remains include three giant temples dating from 1375-1449. Scarcity of water remains the potential threat to the ecosystem.\n\n==Local species==\n\n===Fauna===\nThis area is known to be a breeding ground for flamingoes and staging ground for pelicans, cranes, storks and many species of waterfowl. It is also an important site for animals like [[blue bull]], chinkara and desert wolf, which have been sighted over here regularly. The site supports many species of birds and mammals which are locally and globally threatened. The site is also a wintering area for water birds. It is estimated that this wetland regularly supports over 40,000 water birds. The marshy habitat is most attractive for water bird species such as common teal, shell duck, mallard, pochard, flamingo and pelican. Occasionally, the range of other species also been seen in the outskirts of the site. These include peafowl, sarus cranes, houbara bustard and the peregrine and saker falcons.ereeere.\n\n===Flora===\nThe flora consists of grasses and dry thorny scrub such as ''[[Apluda aristata]]'', ''[[Dichanthium annulatum]]'', ''[[Panicum antidotale]]'', ''[[Cenchrus]]'' spp., ''[[Pennisetum]]'' spp., ''[[Cymbopogon]]'' spp. and ''Elionurus'' spp. The large trees include ''Prosopis juliflora'', ''Prosopis cineraria'', ''Caparis decidua'', ''Ziziphus nummularia'', ''Acacia senegal'' and ''Salvadora oleoides '' is found in the desert area of kutch.\n\n==Threats==\nCattle grazing, tree cutting and vehicular traffic are the major threats to this ecoregion's habitat. The proposed expansion of the commercial salt extraction operations will result in disturbances to wildlife, especially to the wild ass population and the, bustards, flamingoes, and pelicans \nDespite the fact that areas in the Rann of Kutch remain largely intact, it is considered vulnerable to development activities such as construction and water diversion projects.

In response the government organized the [[Camp of National Unity]] (OZON), which took control of the Polish parliament in 1938. The Polish parliament then drafted anti-Jewish legislation which was similar to [[anti-Jewish laws]] which existed in Germany, Hungary, and Romania.

It is an informal tenet of Polish religiosity, enables Poles to view themselves as the main victims of the Nazis, enables them to deny their historic responsibility for anti-Jewish crimes, and provides a scapegoat for problems in the post-communist transition. Unlike other European societies, contemporary Polish antisemitism is not related to attitudes towards Israel. Furthermore, political representation of those employing antisemitic rhetoric is very limited.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mikolaj_Winiewski/publication/311486760_Antisemitism_in_current_Poland_economic_religious_and_historical_aspects/links/5848664108aeda696825e5ac.pdf Bilewicz, Micha\u0142, Miko\u0142aj Winiewski, and Zuzanna Radzik. \"Antisemitism in Poland: Psychological, Religious, and Historical Aspects.\" Journal for the Study of Antisemitism 4 (2016): 423-440.], quote: Overall, the case of Poland is an example of the endurance of antisemitism without Jews\u2014or at least with a scant Jewish population (Lendvai, 1971). This leads to an interesting question about the psychological reasons of such long-enduring prejudice without an object. Based on the research and observation of political and social life in Poland, one could say that antisemitism plays several important functions in contemporary Polish society: it is one of the informal tenets of religiosity in current Poland; it defines a scapegoat for the problems and troubles of the post-transition period; it allows the denial of responsibility for historical crimes toward Jews; and it supports perceiving the ingroup as the main victim of the Nazi occupation. These functions clearly allow antisemitism to exist\u2014even without any significant Jewish presence in the country. At the same time, however, there is no link between such antisemitism and attitudes toward contemporary Israel. In this case, Polish society is far less anti-Jewish than many other European societies; in addition, the political representation of antisemitic prejudice is very limited\u2014most politicians who were actively using antisemitic rhetoric are currently out of political life or at the margins of mainstream political debate</ref> One contemporary motif that is claimed to be antisemitic is the [[Jew with a coin]] picture, displayed in 18% Polish homes to bring luck.\n\n==Roma==\nIn June 1991 the [[M\u0142awa riot]] occurred, which was a series of violent incidents against Polska Roma that broke out after one Polish man was killed and another Polish man was permanently harmed when a Romani teenager drove into three ethnic Poles in a crosswalk, killing one, then left the scene of the accident.<ref name=\"Emigh\">{{cite book|author1=Rebecca Jean Emigh|first2=Iv\u00e1n|last2=Szel\u00e9nyi|authorlink2=Iv\u00e1n Szel\u00e9nyi|title=Poverty, Ethnicity, and Gender in Eastern Europe During the Market Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O_tXHTK2kQUC&pg=PA101|accessdate= 13 September 2019|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96881-6|pages=101\u2013102}}</ref> After the accident a rioting mob attacked wealthy Romani settlements in the Polish town of [[M\u0142awa]].

However, over the course of the '90s, the level of tolerance decreased. By 1999, EVS recorded Poland as having one of the highest rates of xenophobia in Europe, while antisemitism also increased during this time. The factors behind these decreases in tolerance and the radicalization in attitudes towards other ethnic groups during this time likely included the country's economic problems associated with a costly transition from Communism (for example, high unemployment), ineffectual government and possibly an increase in immigration from outside.<ref name=evs/>\n\nThese attitudes began to change after 2000, possibly due to Poland's entry into the European Union, increased travel abroad and more frequent encounters with people of other races. By 2008, the EVS showed Poland as one of the least xenophobic countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The negative attitudes towards Jews have likewise returned to their lower 1990s level, although they do remain somewhat above the European average.<ref name=evs/> During the same time period, ''ethnic tolerance'' and ''political tolerance'' increased in Southern Europe (Spain, Greece) and decreased in other parts of Northern Europe (Netherlands).<ref name=evs/>\n\nWhile the Roma group was listed as most rejected, the level of exclusion was still lower than elsewhere in Europe, most likely due the long history of Roma (see [[Polska Roma]]) and their relatively low numbers in the country.<ref name=evs/>\n\n=== 2012 CRP survey ===\nIn a 2012 survey conducted by the Center for Research on Prejudice at the [[University of Warsaw]], it was found that 78.5% of participants disagreed with traditional antisemitic statements (e.g. \"Jews are responsible for the death of Jesus Christ\"), but 52.9% agreed with secondary antisemitic statements (e.g. \"Jews spread the stereotype of Polish anti-Semitism\"), and 64.6% believed in a \"Jewish conspiracy\" (e.g. \"Jews would like to rule the world\").<ref name=\"Bilewicz et al.\">{{Cite journal |last=Bilewicz |first=Michal |last2=Winiewski |first2=Miko\u0142aj |last3=Kofta |first3=Miros\u0142aw |last4=W\u00f3jcik |first4=Adrian |date=2013 |title=Harmful Ideas, The Structure and Consequences of Anti-Semitic Beliefs in Poland |journal=Political Psychology |language=en |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=821\u2013839 |doi=10.1111/pops.12024 |issn=1467-9221}}</ref> The authors noted that \"belief in [a] Jewish conspiracy proved to be the strongest significant predictor of discriminatory intentions towards Jews in all fields.

Following the death of Poland's ruler [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] in 1935, the Endeks intensified its efforts and in 1937 it declared that its \"main aim and duty must be to remove the Jews from all spheres of social, economic, and cultural life in Poland\", which lead to violence in a few cases (pogroms in smaller towns).

It is an informal tenet of Polish religiosity, enables Poles to view themselves as the main victims of the Nazis, enables them to deny their historic responsibility for anti-Jewish crimes, and provides a scapegoat for problems in the post-communist transition. Unlike other European societies, contemporary Polish antisemitism is not related to attitudes towards Israel. Furthermore, political representation of those employing antisemitic rhetoric is very limited.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mikolaj_Winiewski/publication/311486760_Antisemitism_in_current_Poland_economic_religious_and_historical_aspects/links/5848664108aeda696825e5ac.pdf Bilewicz, Micha\u0142, Miko\u0142aj Winiewski, and Zuzanna Radzik. \"Antisemitism in Poland: Psychological, Religious, and Historical Aspects.\" Journal for the Study of Antisemitism 4 (2016): 423-440.], quote: Overall, the case of Poland is an example of the endurance of antisemitism without Jews\u2014or at least with a scant Jewish population (Lendvai, 1971). This leads to an interesting question about the psychological reasons of such long-enduring prejudice without an object. Based on the research and observation of political and social life in Poland, one could say that antisemitism plays several important functions in contemporary Polish society: it is one of the informal tenets of religiosity in current Poland; it defines a scapegoat for the problems and troubles of the post-transition period; it allows the denial of responsibility for historical crimes toward Jews; and it supports perceiving the ingroup as the main victim of the Nazi occupation. These functions clearly allow antisemitism to exist\u2014even without any significant Jewish presence in the country. At the same time, however, there is no link between such antisemitism and attitudes toward contemporary Israel. In this case, Polish society is far less anti-Jewish than many other European societies; in addition, the political representation of antisemitic prejudice is very limited\u2014most politicians who were actively using antisemitic rhetoric are currently out of political life or at the margins of mainstream political debate</ref> One contemporary motif that is claimed to be antisemitic is the [[Jew with a coin]] picture, displayed in 18% Polish homes to bring luck.\n\n==Roma==\nIn June 1991 the [[M\u0142awa riot]] occurred, which was a series of violent incidents against Polska Roma that broke out after one Polish man was killed and another Polish man was permanently harmed when a Romani teenager drove into three ethnic Poles in a crosswalk, killing one, then left the scene of the accident.<ref name=\"Emigh\">{{cite book|author1=Rebecca Jean Emigh|first2=Iv\u00e1n|last2=Szel\u00e9nyi|authorlink2=Iv\u00e1n Szel\u00e9nyi|title=Poverty, Ethnicity, and Gender in Eastern Europe During the Market Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O_tXHTK2kQUC&pg=PA101|accessdate= 13 September 2019|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96881-6|pages=101\u2013102}}</ref> After the accident a rioting mob attacked wealthy Romani settlements in the Polish town of [[M\u0142awa]].

However, over the course of the '90s, the level of tolerance decreased. By 1999, EVS recorded Poland as having one of the highest rates of xenophobia in Europe, while antisemitism also increased during this time. The factors behind these decreases in tolerance and the radicalization in attitudes towards other ethnic groups during this time likely included the country's economic problems associated with a costly transition from Communism (for example, high unemployment), ineffectual government and possibly an increase in immigration from outside.<ref name=evs/>\n\nThese attitudes began to change after 2000, possibly due to Poland's entry into the European Union, increased travel abroad and more frequent encounters with people of other races. By 2008, the EVS showed Poland as one of the least xenophobic countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The negative attitudes towards Jews have likewise returned to their lower 1990s level, although they do remain somewhat above the European average.<ref name=evs/> During the same time period, ''ethnic tolerance'' and ''political tolerance'' increased in Southern Europe (Spain, Greece) and decreased in other parts of Northern Europe (Netherlands).<ref name=evs/>\n\nWhile the Roma group was listed as most rejected, the level of exclusion was still lower than elsewhere in Europe, most likely due the long history of Roma (see [[Polska Roma]]) and their relatively low numbers in the country.<ref name=evs/>\n\n=== 2012 CRP survey ===\nIn a 2012 survey conducted by the Center for Research on Prejudice at the [[University of Warsaw]], it was found that 78.5% of participants disagreed with traditional antisemitic statements (e.g. \"Jews are responsible for the death of Jesus Christ\"), but 52.9% agreed with secondary antisemitic statements (e.g. \"Jews spread the stereotype of Polish anti-Semitism\"), and 64.6% believed in a \"Jewish conspiracy\" (e.g. \"Jews would like to rule the world\").<ref name=\"Bilewicz et al.\">{{Cite journal |last=Bilewicz |first=Michal |last2=Winiewski |first2=Miko\u0142aj |last3=Kofta |first3=Miros\u0142aw |last4=W\u00f3jcik |first4=Adrian |date=2013 |title=Harmful Ideas, The Structure and Consequences of Anti-Semitic Beliefs in Poland |journal=Political Psychology |language=en |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=821\u2013839 |doi=10.1111/pops.12024 |issn=1467-9221}}</ref> The authors noted that \"belief in [a] Jewish conspiracy proved to be the strongest significant predictor of discriminatory intentions towards Jews in all fields.

The [[federal poverty level]] is defined as \"the minimum amount of income that a household needs to be able to afford housing, food, and other basic necessities.\"<ref>Borger, C., Gearing, M., Macaluso, T., Mills, G., Montaquila, J., Weinfield, N., & Zedlewski, S.

Also, urgent car repairs reduce a family's ability to provide food, since the issue must be addressed in order to allow individuals to travel to and from work.<ref name=\"Q & A: The Causes Behind Hunger in America\" /> Although income cannot be labeled as the sole cause of hunger, it plays a key role in determining if people possess the means to provide basic needs to themselves and their family.\n\nThe loss of a job reflects a core issue that contributes to hunger - employment insecurity.<ref name=\"Q & A: The Causes Behind Hunger in America\" /> People who live in areas with higher unemployment rates and who have a minimal or very low amount of liquid assets are shown to be more likely to experience hunger or food insecurity. The complex interactions between a person's job status, income and benefits, and the number of dependents they must provide for, influence the impact of hunger on a family.<ref name=\"America's Second Harvest\">O'Brien, D., Staley, E., Torres Aldeen, H., & Uchima, S.

/>\n\nAccording to the ''Journal of Applied Geography'', community gardens are most successful when they are developed using a bottom-up approach, in which community members are actively engaged from the start of the planning process.<ref name=\"Corrigan (community gardens)\" /> This empowers community members by allowing them to take complete ownership over the garden and make decisions about the food they grow.<ref name=\"Corrigan (community gardens)\" /> Community gardens are also beneficial because they allow community members to develop a better understanding of the food system, the gardening process, and healthy versus unhealthy foods.<ref name=\"Corrigan (community gardens)\" /> Community gardens thereby promote better consumption choices and allow community members to maintain healthier lifestyles.<ref name=\"Corrigan (community gardens)\" />\n\nDespite the many advantages of community gardens, community members may face challenges in regard to accessing and securing land,

sector hunger relief===\n[[File:Passing out groceries.jpg|thumb|300px|Volunteers pass out food items from a [[Feeding America]] food bank.]]\nThe oldest type of formal hunger relief establishment used in the United States is believed to be the [[almshouse]], but these are no longer in existence.  In the 21st century, hunger relief agencies run by civil society include:\n\n* ''Food pantries'' are the most numerous food aid establishment found within the United States. The food pantry hands out packages of grocery to the hungry. Unlike soup kitchens, they invariably give out enough food for several meals, which is to be consumed off the premises.  A related establishment is the ''food closet'',  which serves a similar purpose to the food pantry, but will never be a dedicated building.  Instead a food closet will be a room within a larger building like a church or community center.  Food closets can be found in rural communities too small to support a food pantry. Food pantries often have procedures to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them,  such as requiring registration.\n*[[Soup kitchen]]s, along with similar establishments like ''food kitchens'' and ''meal centers'', provide hot meals for the hungry and are the second most common type of food aid agency in the U.S. Unlike food pantry, these establishments usually provide only a single meal per visit, but they have the advantage for the end user of generally providing food with no questions asked.\n* The [[food bank]] is the third most common type of food aid agency. While some will give food direct to the hungry, food banks in the U.S. generally provide a warehouse like function, distributing food to front line agencies such as food pantries and soup kitchens.\n* [[Food rescue]] organizations also perform a warehouse like function, distributing food to front line organizations, though they are less common and tend to operate on a smaller scale than do food banks. Whereas food banks may receive supplies from large growers, manufacturers, supermarkets and the federal government, rescue organizations typically retrieve food from sources such as restaurants along with smaller shops and farms.\n\nTogether, these civil society food assistance establishments are sometimes called the \"Emergency Food Assistance System\" (EFAS). In 2010, an estimated 37 million Americans received food from the EFAS. However,  the amount of aid it supplies is much less than the public sector, with an estimate made in 2000 suggesting that the EFAS is able to give out only about $9.5 worth of food per person per month. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002,  about 80% of emergency kitchens and food pantries, over 90% of food banks, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after 1981, with much of the growth occurring after 1991.<ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"sweet\"/><ref name = \"welfareCrisis\">\n{{cite book\n|last = Riches\n|first = Graham\n|title=Food banks and the welfare crisis\n|chapter = ''passim'', see esp.

Other settlers were saved after being supplied with food by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], with the intercession of [[Pocahontas]] being a famous example.  It did not take long however for colonists to adapt to conditions in the new world, discovering North America to be a place of extraordinary fertility. According to author Peter K.

The ratio of productive land to population was high. Upper class Americans often still held to the old European ideal of [[Noblesse oblige]] and made sure their workers had sufficient food. Labour shortages meant the poor could invariably find a position - although until the American Revolution this often involved [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]], this at least protected the poor from the unpredictable nature of [[wage labor]], and sometimes paupers were rewarded with their own plot of land at the end of their period of servitude.  Additionally, working class traditions of looking out for each other were strong.<ref name = \"end\"/><ref name = \"escape\"/>\n\nSocial and economic conditions changed substantially in the early 19th century, especially with the market reforms of the 1830s.  While overall prosperity increased, productive land became harder to come by, and was often only available for those who could afford substantial rates. It became more difficult to make a living either from public lands or a small farm without substantial capital to buy up to date technology.  Sometimes small farmers were forced off their lands by economic pressure and became homeless. American society responded by opening up numerous [[almshouse]]s, and some municipal officials began giving out small sums of cash to the poor. Such measures did not fully check the rise in hunger; by 1850, life expectancy in the US had dropped to 43 years, about the same as then prevailed in Western Europe.<ref name = \"escape\"/>\n\nThe number of hungry and [[homeless people in the U.S.]] increased in the 1870s due to industrialization. Though economic developments were hugely beneficial overall, driving America's [[Gilded Age]], they had a negative impact on some of the poorest citizens. As was the case in 19th century Britain, many influential Americans believed in [[classical liberalism]] and opposed government intervention to help the hungry, as they thought it could encourage dependency and would disrupt the operation of the free market.  The 1870s saw the [[Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor|AICP]] and the American branch of the [[Charity Organization Society]] successfully lobby to end the practice where city official would hand out small sums of cash to the poor. Unlike in Britain though, there was no nationwide restrictions on private efforts to help the hungry, and civil society immediately began to provide alternative aid for the poor, establishing [[soup kitchens]] in U.S. cities.<ref name = \"end\"/><ref name = \"escape\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|author=Todd DePastino\n|title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/citizenhobohowce00depa/page/22 22]\n|year=2005\n|isbn=978-0226143798\n|publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]\n|author-link=Todd DePastino\n|url=https://archive.org/details/citizenhobohowce00depa/page/22\n}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Nixon 30-0316a.jpg|thumb|210px|Following the \"rediscovery\" of hunger in America during the late 1960s, President [[Richard Nixon]] addressed Congress saying:\n\"That hunger and malnutrition should persist in a land such as ours is embarrassing and intolerable....

The existence of hunger within the U.S. became a widely discussed issue due to coverage in the [[Mass media]]. Both civil society and government responded.  Existing soup kitchens and bread lines run by the private sector increased their opening times, and many new ones were established.  Government sponsored relief was one of the main strands of the [[New Deal]] launched by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Some of the government established  [[Alphabet agencies]] aimed to relieve poverty by raising wages,  others by reducing unemployment as with the [[Works Progress Administration]]. The [[Federal Surplus Relief Corporation]]  aimed to directly tackle hunger by providing poor people with food.<ref>The FSRC also helped farmers by buying food they were unable to sell profitably on the market.</ref>  By the late 1940s, these various relief efforts combined with improved economic conditions had been successful in substantially reducing hunger within the United States.<ref name = \"sweet\"/>\n\nAccording to sociology professor Janet Poppendieck, hunger within the US was widely considered to be a solved problem until the mid-1960s.<ref name = \"sweet\">\n{{cite book\n|last = Poppendieck\n|first = Janet\n|title= Sweet Charity?: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement\n|chapter = Introduction, Chpt 1\n|year= 1999\n|isbn= 978-0140245561\n|publisher= Penguine\n}}</ref>\nBy the mid-sixties, several states had ended the free distribution of federal food surpluses, instead providing an early form of food stamps, which had the benefit of allowing recipients to choose food of their liking, rather than having to accept whatever happened to be in surplus at the time.  There was however a minimum charge; some people could not afford the stamps, causing them to suffer severe hunger.<ref name = \"sweet\"/>  One response from American society to the rediscovery of hunger was to step up the support provided by private sector establishments like soup kitchens and meal centers. The [[food bank]], a new form of civil society hunger relief agency,  was invented in 1967 by [[John van Hengel]].<ref name = \"sweet\"/> It was not however until the 1980s that U.S. food banks began to experience rapid growth.\n\nA second response to the \"rediscovery\" of hunger in the mid-to-late sixties, spurred by [[Joseph S. Clark's and Robert F. Kennedy's tour of the Mississippi Delta]], was the extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. The ''Hunger lobby'', as it was widely called by journalists, was largely successful in achieving its aims, at least in the short term. In 1967 a Senate subcommittee held widely publicized hearings on the issue, and in 1969 President [[Richard Nixon]] made an emotive address to Congress where he called for government action to end hunger in the U.S.<ref name = \"betweenTheLines\">{{cite book\n|author= R Shep Melnick\n|title=Between the Lines: Interpreting Welfare Rights\n|chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/betweenlinesinte00meln\n|chapter-url-access= registration\n|chapter= Chpt. 9: The Surprising success of food stamps\n|year= 1994\n|isbn=978-0815756637\n|publisher = [[Brookings Institution]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grass roots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice in the same way as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity. In the early 1980s, President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration scaled back welfare provision, leading to a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies.<ref name = \"sweet\"/><ref name = \"walter\">{{cite book\n|editor= William A Dando\n|last= Walter\n|first= Andrew\n|title=Food and Famine in the 21st Century\n|pages = 171\u2013181\n|year=2012\n|isbn= 978-1598847307\n|publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]]}}</ref>\n\nPoppendieck says that for the first few years after the change, there was vigorous opposition from the political Left, who argued that the state welfare was much more suitable for meeting recipients needs. This idea was questionable to many, well other thought it was perfect for the situation.

There is not a single cause attributed to hunger and there is much debate over who or what is responsible for the prevalence of hunger in the United States. However, researchers most commonly focus on the link between hunger and poverty. The [[federal poverty level]] is defined as \"the minimum amount of income that a household needs to be able to afford housing, food, and other basic necessities.\"<ref>Borger, C., Gearing, M., Macaluso, T., Mills, G., Montaquila, J., Weinfield, N., & Zedlewski, S.

Also, urgent car repairs reduce a family's ability to provide food, since the issue must be addressed in order to allow individuals to travel to and from work.<ref name=\"Q & A: The Causes Behind Hunger in America\" /> Although income cannot be labeled as the sole cause of hunger, it plays a key role in determining if people possess the means to provide basic needs to themselves and their family.\n\nThe loss of a job reflects a core issue that contributes to hunger - employment insecurity.<ref name=\"Q & A: The Causes Behind Hunger in America\" /> People who live in areas with higher unemployment rates and who have a minimal or very low amount of liquid assets are shown to be more likely to experience hunger or food insecurity. The complex interactions between a person's job status, income and benefits, and the number of dependents they must provide for, influence the impact of hunger on a family.<ref name=\"America's Second Harvest\">O'Brien, D., Staley, E., Torres Aldeen, H., & Uchima, S.

/>\n\nAccording to the ''Journal of Applied Geography'', community gardens are most successful when they are developed using a bottom-up approach, in which community members are actively engaged from the start of the planning process.<ref name=\"Corrigan (community gardens)\" /> This empowers community members by allowing them to take complete ownership over the garden and make decisions about the food they grow.<ref name=\"Corrigan (community gardens)\" /> Community gardens are also beneficial because they allow community members to develop a better understanding of the food system, the gardening process, and healthy versus unhealthy foods.<ref name=\"Corrigan (community gardens)\" /> Community gardens thereby promote better consumption choices and allow community members to maintain healthier lifestyles.<ref name=\"Corrigan (community gardens)\" />\n\nDespite the many advantages of community gardens, community members may face challenges in regard to accessing and securing land,

sector hunger relief===\n[[File:Passing out groceries.jpg|thumb|300px|Volunteers pass out food items from a [[Feeding America]] food bank.]]\nThe oldest type of formal hunger relief establishment used in the United States is believed to be the [[almshouse]], but these are no longer in existence.  In the 21st century, hunger relief agencies run by civil society include:\n\n* ''Food pantries'' are the most numerous food aid establishment found within the United States. The food pantry hands out packages of grocery to the hungry. Unlike soup kitchens, they invariably give out enough food for several meals, which is to be consumed off the premises.  A related establishment is the ''food closet'',  which serves a similar purpose to the food pantry, but will never be a dedicated building.  Instead a food closet will be a room within a larger building like a church or community center.  Food closets can be found in rural communities too small to support a food pantry. Food pantries often have procedures to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them,  such as requiring registration.\n*[[Soup kitchen]]s, along with similar establishments like ''food kitchens'' and ''meal centers'', provide hot meals for the hungry and are the second most common type of food aid agency in the U.S. Unlike food pantry, these establishments usually provide only a single meal per visit, but they have the advantage for the end user of generally providing food with no questions asked.\n* The [[food bank]] is the third most common type of food aid agency. While some will give food direct to the hungry, food banks in the U.S. generally provide a warehouse like function, distributing food to front line agencies such as food pantries and soup kitchens.\n* [[Food rescue]] organizations also perform a warehouse like function, distributing food to front line organizations, though they are less common and tend to operate on a smaller scale than do food banks. Whereas food banks may receive supplies from large growers, manufacturers, supermarkets and the federal government, rescue organizations typically retrieve food from sources such as restaurants along with smaller shops and farms.\n\nTogether, these civil society food assistance establishments are sometimes called the \"Emergency Food Assistance System\" (EFAS). In 2010, an estimated 37 million Americans received food from the EFAS. However,  the amount of aid it supplies is much less than the public sector, with an estimate made in 2000 suggesting that the EFAS is able to give out only about $9.5 worth of food per person per month. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002,  about 80% of emergency kitchens and food pantries, over 90% of food banks, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after 1981, with much of the growth occurring after 1991.<ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"sweet\"/><ref name = \"welfareCrisis\">\n{{cite book\n|last = Riches\n|first = Graham\n|title=Food banks and the welfare crisis\n|chapter = ''passim'', see esp.

Compared with South America, readily available food could be hard to come by.  Many settlers starved to death, leading to several colonies being abandoned.  Other settlers were saved after being supplied with food by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], with the intercession of [[Pocahontas]] being a famous example.  It did not take long however for colonists to adapt to conditions in the new world, discovering North America to be a place of extraordinary fertility. According to author Peter K. Eisinger, the historian  [[Robert Beverley, Jr.|Robert Beverley]]'s portrayal of America as the \"Garden of the World\" was already a stock image as early as 1705.<ref name = \"end\">{{Cite book\n | author = Peter K.

The ratio of productive land to population was high. Upper class Americans often still held to the old European ideal of [[Noblesse oblige]] and made sure their workers had sufficient food. Labour shortages meant the poor could invariably find a position - although until the American Revolution this often involved [[Indentured servant|indentured servitude]], this at least protected the poor from the unpredictable nature of [[wage labor]], and sometimes paupers were rewarded with their own plot of land at the end of their period of servitude.  Additionally, working class traditions of looking out for each other were strong.<ref name = \"end\"/><ref name = \"escape\"/>\n\nSocial and economic conditions changed substantially in the early 19th century, especially with the market reforms of the 1830s.  While overall prosperity increased, productive land became harder to come by, and was often only available for those who could afford substantial rates. It became more difficult to make a living either from public lands or a small farm without substantial capital to buy up to date technology.  Sometimes small farmers were forced off their lands by economic pressure and became homeless. American society responded by opening up numerous [[almshouse]]s, and some municipal officials began giving out small sums of cash to the poor. Such measures did not fully check the rise in hunger; by 1850, life expectancy in the US had dropped to 43 years, about the same as then prevailed in Western Europe.<ref name = \"escape\"/>\n\nThe number of hungry and [[homeless people in the U.S.]] increased in the 1870s due to industrialization. Though economic developments were hugely beneficial overall, driving America's [[Gilded Age]], they had a negative impact on some of the poorest citizens. As was the case in 19th century Britain, many influential Americans believed in [[classical liberalism]] and opposed government intervention to help the hungry, as they thought it could encourage dependency and would disrupt the operation of the free market.  The 1870s saw the [[Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor|AICP]] and the American branch of the [[Charity Organization Society]] successfully lobby to end the practice where city official would hand out small sums of cash to the poor. Unlike in Britain though, there was no nationwide restrictions on private efforts to help the hungry, and civil society immediately began to provide alternative aid for the poor, establishing [[soup kitchens]] in U.S. cities.<ref name = \"end\"/><ref name = \"escape\"/><ref>{{cite book\n|author=Todd DePastino\n|title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/citizenhobohowce00depa/page/22 22]\n|year=2005\n|isbn=978-0226143798\n|publisher=[[Chicago University Press]]\n|author-link=Todd DePastino\n|url=https://archive.org/details/citizenhobohowce00depa/page/22\n}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Nixon 30-0316a.jpg|thumb|210px|Following the \"rediscovery\" of hunger in America during the late 1960s, President [[Richard Nixon]] addressed Congress saying:\n\"That hunger and malnutrition should persist in a land such as ours is embarrassing and intolerable....

The existence of hunger within the U.S. became a widely discussed issue due to coverage in the [[Mass media]]. Both civil society and government responded.  Existing soup kitchens and bread lines run by the private sector increased their opening times, and many new ones were established.  Government sponsored relief was one of the main strands of the [[New Deal]] launched by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Some of the government established  [[Alphabet agencies]] aimed to relieve poverty by raising wages,  others by reducing unemployment as with the [[Works Progress Administration]]. The [[Federal Surplus Relief Corporation]]  aimed to directly tackle hunger by providing poor people with food.<ref>The FSRC also helped farmers by buying food they were unable to sell profitably on the market.</ref>  By the late 1940s, these various relief efforts combined with improved economic conditions had been successful in substantially reducing hunger within the United States.<ref name = \"sweet\"/>\n\nAccording to sociology professor Janet Poppendieck, hunger within the US was widely considered to be a solved problem until the mid-1960s.<ref name = \"sweet\">\n{{cite book\n|last = Poppendieck\n|first = Janet\n|title= Sweet Charity?: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement\n|chapter = Introduction, Chpt 1\n|year= 1999\n|isbn= 978-0140245561\n|publisher= Penguine\n}}</ref>\nBy the mid-sixties, several states had ended the free distribution of federal food surpluses, instead providing an early form of food stamps, which had the benefit of allowing recipients to choose food of their liking, rather than having to accept whatever happened to be in surplus at the time.  There was however a minimum charge; some people could not afford the stamps, causing them to suffer severe hunger.<ref name = \"sweet\"/>  One response from American society to the rediscovery of hunger was to step up the support provided by private sector establishments like soup kitchens and meal centers. The [[food bank]], a new form of civil society hunger relief agency,  was invented in 1967 by [[John van Hengel]].<ref name = \"sweet\"/> It was not however until the 1980s that U.S. food banks began to experience rapid growth.\n\nA second response to the \"rediscovery\" of hunger in the mid-to-late sixties, spurred by [[Joseph S. Clark's and Robert F. Kennedy's tour of the Mississippi Delta]], was the extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. The ''Hunger lobby'', as it was widely called by journalists, was largely successful in achieving its aims, at least in the short term. In 1967 a Senate subcommittee held widely publicized hearings on the issue, and in 1969 President [[Richard Nixon]] made an emotive address to Congress where he called for government action to end hunger in the U.S.<ref name = \"betweenTheLines\">{{cite book\n|author= R Shep Melnick\n|title=Between the Lines: Interpreting Welfare Rights\n|chapter-url= https://archive.org/details/betweenlinesinte00meln\n|chapter-url-access= registration\n|chapter= Chpt. 9: The Surprising success of food stamps\n|year= 1994\n|isbn=978-0815756637\n|publisher = [[Brookings Institution]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grass roots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice in the same way as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity. In the early 1980s, President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s administration scaled back welfare provision, leading to a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies.<ref name = \"sweet\"/><ref name = \"walter\">{{cite book\n|editor= William A Dando\n|last= Walter\n|first= Andrew\n|title=Food and Famine in the 21st Century\n|pages = 171\u2013181\n|year=2012\n|isbn= 978-1598847307\n|publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]]}}</ref>\n\nPoppendieck says that for the first few years after the change, there was vigorous opposition from the political Left, who argued that the state welfare was much more suitable for meeting recipients needs.

According to a 2012 study by [[UCLA School of Public Health#Research centers|UCLA Center for Health Policy Research]], even married couples who both work but have low incomes will sometimes now require emergency food assistance.<ref name=\"loansafe\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.loansafe.org/thousands-more-in-solano-napa-counties-are-turning-to-food-banks \n |title=Thousands More in Solano, Napa Counties are Turning to Food Banks \n |last=Ferreras \n |first=Alex \n |date=2012-07-11 \n |accessdate=2012-07-11 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717045016/http://www.loansafe.org/thousands-more-in-solano-napa-counties-are-turning-to-food-banks \n |archivedate=2012-07-17 \n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news\n |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/poverty-hunger-america\n |title= Poverty and hunger in America\n |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]\n |last= Turner\n |first= John\n |date = 2012-09-20\n |accessdate= 2012-10-01\n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gleaners.org/ Gleaners Indiana Food bank] Retrieved 2012-07-18</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 90s, advocates of small government had been largely successful in un-politicizing hunger, making it hard to launch effective efforts to address the root causes, such as changing government policy to reduce poverty among low earners. In contrast to the 1960s and 70s, the 21st century has seen little significant political lobbying for an end to hunger within America, though by 2012 there had been an increase in efforts by various activists and journalists to raise awareness of the problem.  American society has however responded to increased hunger by substantially increasing its provision of emergency food aid and related relief, from both the private and public sector, and from the two working together in partnership.<ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/>\n\nAccording to a [[USDA]] report, 14.3% of American households were food insecure during at least some of 2013, falling to 14% in 2014. The report stated the fall was not statistically significant. The percentage of households experiencing very low food security remained at 5.6% for both 2013 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err194.aspx |title=Household Food Security in the United States in 2014 |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |author1=Alisha Coleman-Jensen |author2=Matthew Rabbitt |author3=Christian Gregory |author4=Anita Singh |date=September 2015 |accessdate=2016-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729005742/http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err194.aspx |archive-date=July 29, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nIn a July 2016 discussion on the importance of private sector engagement with the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], Malcolm Preston the global sustainability leader at [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], suggested that unlike the older Millennial development goals, the SDGs are applicable to the advanced economies due to issues such as hunger in the United States.

Tibi argues that there is a need for Europe to defend these values, especially in times of [[globalization]] and [[Human migration|migration]] from Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/interview-with-german-islam-expert-bassam-tibi-europeans-have-stopped-defending-their-values-a-440340.html|title=Interview with German Islam Expert Bassam Tibi: \"Europeans Have Stopped Defending Their Values\"|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=2 October 2006|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}</ref> On the other hand, Tibi argues that [[racism]] is a European invention, and that Europeans must overcome what he calls \"Euro-arrogance\" and [[xenophobia]] to integrate immigrants.<ref name=tibi227/>\n\nHe criticizes [[Colonial empire|European imperialism]], arguing that it disrupted and deformed other cultures. Acknowledging that Muslim conquerors also did some wrong, Tibi argues that at least Muslim conquests were not driven by any kind of racism, unlike the European conquests.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bassam Tibi|title=Islam between culture and politics|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year =2001|page=92}}</ref>\n\n=== On Germany ===\nHe has criticised the left-green dominated German media for stifling debate about Islam in Germany, leading to ordinary people being afraid to state their opinions. As an example he gives [[Uwe Tellkamp]], who expressed criticisim against the German policy of migration and was attacked in [[mainstream media]] and painted as a right-extremist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/die-islam-konferenz-ist-deutsche-unterwerfung-ld.1371525|title=\u00abDer deutsche Staat kapituliert vor dem Islam\u00bb {{!}} NZZ|last=Neff|first=Benedict|date=2018-04-05|work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung|access-date=2018-04-07|language=de-CH|issn=0376-6829}}</ref> He has also criticised authorities in Germany for not standing up to the large organised Islamic community organisations like the [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs]] and for not supporting liberal Muslims like [[Seyran Ate\u015f]] and [[Necla Kelek]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/die-islam-konferenz-ist-deutsche-unterwerfung-ld.1371525|title=\u00abDer deutsche Staat kapituliert vor dem Islam\u00bb {{!}} NZZ|last=Neff|first=Benedict|date=2018-04-05|work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung|access-date=2018-04-07|language=de-CH|issn=0376-6829}}</ref>\n\n===On Israel===\nBassam Tibi has criticized the [[Likud]] party of Israel as blocking the peace process. He states that in the 1990s, the Likud adopted the \"Three Nos\" policy:<ref name=mideast/>\n<blockquote>\"No to the Palestinian State, no to dividing [[Jerusalem]], no to returning [[Golan Heights]] to Syria.</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Tibi, the Likud government of 1996 engaged in provoking Arabs by constructing [[Har Homa]] in [[East Jerusalem|Arab Jerusalem]], and digging a tunnel under the [[Temple Mount]], and thereby exposing Israel to terrorism.<ref name=mideast>{{cite book|author=Bassam Tibi|title=Conflict and war in the Middle East: from interstate war to new security|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year =1998|page=195}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2019}}\nIn 1995 he was decorated by the President of Germany, [[Roman Herzog]], with the [[Bundesverdienstkreuz]], cross of merits first class.{{cn|date=February 2017}} In 2003, the Swiss Foundation for European Awareness granted him in Zurich with the annual prize.{{cn|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Published works==\n\n===Books in English===\n*''The Crisis of Modern Islam: A Preindustrial Culture in the Scientific-Technological Age''.
