In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to [[Kemosabe Records]]. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single \"[[Right Round]]\".\n\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the number-six record ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012). She has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including \"[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]\", \"[[Your Love Is My Drug]]\", \"[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]\", \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", \"[[Die Young (Kesha song)|Die Young]]\", \"[[My First Kiss]]\" with [[3OH!3]], and the chart-topping \"[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]\", \"[[We R Who We R]]\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, and \"[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]\" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. \"Tik Tok\", at one point, was the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|best-selling digital single in history]], selling over 16.5 million units internationally. As of November 2019, the song has sold over 25 million copies. In 2020, Kesha released her fourth studio album [[High Road (Kesha album)|''High Road'']]. She has also written songs for other artists, including \"[[Till the World Ends]]\" for [[Britney Spears]] (2011).\n\nKesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as ''[[Kesha v. Dr. Luke]]'', were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claims [[breach of contract]] and [[defamation]] by Kesha.\n\nAs of 2019, Kesha has reportedly sold over 71 million records in the United States and over 134 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"PR Newswire\">{{cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-music-superstar-pitbull-to-host-the-2013-american-music-awards-on-sunday-november-24th-at-8-pm-etpt-on-abc-230672391.html|title=International Music Superstar Pitbull To Host The 2013 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 24th at 8 p.m. ETPT on ABC|author=|date=November 5, 2013|page=1|agency= PR Newswire|publisher=UBM pic|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC\">{{cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101171769|title=International Music Superstar Pitbull To Host The \"2013 American Music Awards\u00ae\" on Sunday, November 24th At 8 PM ET/PT On ABC|author=|date=November 5, 2013|page=1|publisher=CNBC|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> She was also listed as the 26th top artist on ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]''{{'}}s decade end charts from 2010 to 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/top-artists-2010s|title=Billboard\u2019s Top Artists of the 2010s|website=Billboard|access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> Kesha has received several awards and nominations, including her win for the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act]] in 2010.\n\n==Early life==\nKesha Rose Sebert was born in [[Los Angeles, California]] on March 1, 1987.

In 2005, at age 18, Kesha was signed to [[Kemosabe Records]]. Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper [[Flo Rida]]'s number-one single \"[[Right Round]]\".\n\nKesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]'' (2010) and ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017), and the number-six record ''[[Warrior (Kesha album)|Warrior]]'' (2012). She has attained ten top-ten singles on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including \"[[Blah Blah Blah (Kesha song)|Blah Blah Blah]]\", \"[[Your Love Is My Drug]]\", \"[[Take It Off (Kesha song)|Take It Off]]\", \"[[Blow (Kesha song)|Blow]]\", \"[[Die Young (Kesha song)|Die Young]]\", \"[[My First Kiss]]\" with [[3OH!3]], and the chart-topping \"[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]\", \"[[We R Who We R]]\", \"Right Round\" with Flo Rida, and \"[[Timber (Pitbull song)|Timber]]\" with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. \"Tik Tok\", at one point, was the [[List of best-selling singles#Best-selling digital singles|best-selling digital single in history]], selling over 16.5 million units internationally. As of November 2019, the song has sold over 25 million copies. In 2020, Kesha released her fourth studio album [[High Road (Kesha album)|''High Road'']]. She has also written songs for other artists, including \"[[Till the World Ends]]\" for [[Britney Spears]] (2011).\n\nKesha's career was halted between ''Warrior'' and ''Rainbow'' due to a legal dispute with her former producer [[Dr. Luke]], which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as ''[[Kesha v.

{"title_page": "List of DOS commands", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nThis article presents a list of commands used by [[DOS]] [[operating system]]s, especially as used on [[x86]]-based [[IBM PC compatible]]s (PCs). [[List of DOS operating systems#Other operating systems|Other DOS operating systems]] are not part of the scope of this list.\n\nIn DOS, many standard [[system command]]s were provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files.  Some commands were built into the command interpreter, others existed as external commands on disk. Over the several generations of DOS, commands were added for the additional functions of the operating system. In the current [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, a text-mode command prompt window, [[cmd.exe]], can still be used.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Command processing==\nThe command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal \u2014 built into COMMAND.COM; others are external commands stored on disk. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND.COM will parse the line and attempt to match a command name to a built-in command or to the name of an executable program file or [[batch file]] on disk. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the command prompt is refreshed.\n\nExternal commands were too large to keep in the command processor, or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command [[path (variable)|path]] set in the command interpreter.\n\nIn the list below, commands that can accept more than one file name, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a ''<kbd>[[filespec]]</kbd>'' (file specification) parameter. Commands that can accept only a single file name are said to accept a ''<kbd>filename</kbd>'' parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a \"/\" or a \"-\" may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into filenames, file specifications, and other options.\n\nThe command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands, but the command names themselves and file names are case-insensitive.\n\nMany commands are the same across many DOS systems, but some differ in command syntax or name.\n\n==DOS commands==\nA partial list of the most common commands for [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM PC DOS]] follows below.\n\n===APPEND===\nSets the path to be searched for data files or displays the current search path. \nThe APPEND command is similar to the PATH command that tells DOS where to search for program files (files with a .COM, . EXE, or .BAT file name extension).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\">{{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=Running MS-DOS Version 6.22 (20th Anniversary Edition), 6th Revised edition|date=2003|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=0-7356-1812-7}}</ref>\n\n===ASSIGN===\n{{Further|Drive letter assignment}}\nThe command redirects requests for disk operations on one drive to a different drive. It can also display drive assignments or reset all drive letters to their original assignments.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 2 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ATTRIB===\n{{Main|ATTRIB}}\nAttrib changes or views the attributes of one or more files. It defaults to display the attributes of all files in the current directory. The file attributes available include read-only, archive, system, and hidden attributes. The command has the capability to process whole folders and subfolders of files and also process all files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BACKUP and RESTORE===\nThese are commands to [[backup]] and restore files from an external disk. These appeared in version 2, and continued to [[IBM PC DOS|PC DOS]] 5 and MS-DOS 6 (PC DOS 7 had a deversioned check). In DOS 6, these were replaced by commercial programs (CPBACKUP, MSBACKUP), which allowed files to be restored to different locations.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===BASIC and BASICA===\n{{Main|IBM BASIC}}\n\nAn implementation of the [[BASIC]] programming language for PCs. Implementing BASIC in this way was very common in operating systems on 8- and 16-bit machines made in the 1980s.\n\n[[IBM]] computers had BASIC 1.1 in ROM, and IBM's versions of BASIC used code in this ROM-BASIC, which allowed for extra memory in the code area.  BASICA last appeared in [[IBM PC DOS]] 5.02, and in [[OS/2]] (2.0 and later), the version had ROM-BASIC moved into the program code.\n\nMicrosoft released [[GW-BASIC]] for machines with no ROM-BASIC.  Some OEM releases had basic.com and basica.com as loaders for GW-BASIC.EXE.\n\nBASIC was dropped after MS-DOS 4, and PC DOS 5.02.  OS/2 (which uses PC DOS 5), has it, while MS-DOS 5 does not.\n\n===BREAK===\nThis command is used to instruct DOS to check whether the {{Keypress|Ctrl}} and {{Keypress|Break}} keys have been pressed before carrying out a program request.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CALL===\n{{See also|start (command)}}\nStarts a batch file from within another batch file and returns when that one ends.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CD and CHDIR===\n{{Main|cd (command)}}\n\nThe CHDIR (or the alternative name CD) command either displays or changes the current working [[directory (file systems)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHCP===\nThe command either displays or changes the active [[Windows code page|code page]] used to display [[glyph|character glyphs]] in a [[Win32 console|console window]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHKDSK===\n{{Main|CHKDSK}}\n\nCHKDSK verifies a storage [[volume]] (for example, a [[hard disk]], [[Disk partitioning|disk partition]] or [[floppy disk]]) for file system integrity. The command has the ability to fix errors on a volume and recover information from defective [[disk sector]]s of a volume.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHOICE===\n{{Main|choice (command)}}\n\nThe CHOICE command is used in batch files to prompt the user to select one item from a set of single-character ''choices''. Choice was introduced as an external command with MS-DOS 6.0;<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerhope.com/choicehl.htm|title=MS-DOS choice command help|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> [[Novell DOS]] 7<ref name=\"drdos7ch7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drdos.com/dosdoc/usergeng/07ugch7.htm|title=Caldera DR-DOS 7.03 User Guide|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> and PC DOS 7.0. Earlier versions of [[DR DOS]] supported this function with the built-in ''switch'' command (for numeric choices) or by beginning a command with a question mark.<ref name=\"drdos7ch7\" /> This command was formerly called ync (yes-no-cancel).{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n===CLS===\n{{Main|cls (command)}}\n\nThe CLS or CLRSCR command clears the [[Computer terminal|terminal screen]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COMMAND===\n{{Main|COMMAND.COM}}\n\nStart a new instance of the command interpreter.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COMP===\n{{Main|comp (command)}}\n\nShow differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 1 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===COPY===\n{{Main|copy (command)}}\n\nMakes copies of existing files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CTTY===\nDefines the [[Computer terminal|terminal]] device (for example, COM1) to use for input and output.<ref> Does not automatically appear in Help </ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n\n===DATE===\nDisplays the [[system date]] and prompts the user to enter a new date. Complements the [[#TIME|TIME]] command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DBLBOOT===\n(Not a command: This is a batch file added to DOS 6.X Supplemental Disks to help create DoubleSpace boot floppies - see https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/100/Q100021/)\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n===DBLSPACE===\n{{Main|DriveSpace}}\n\nA [[disk compression]] utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.0 (released in 1993) and version 6.2.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DEBUG===\n{{Main|debug (command)}}\n\nA very primitive assembler and disassambler.\n\n===DEFRAG===\n{{Main|Microsoft Drive Optimizer}}\n\nThe command has the ability to analyze the file fragmentation on a disk drive or to [[Defragmentation|defragment]] a drive. This command is called DEFRAG in MS-DOS/PC DOS and <kbd>diskopt</kbd> in [[DR-DOS]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DEL and ERASE===\n{{Main|del (command)}}\n\nDEL (or the alternative form ERASE) is used to delete one or more files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DELTREE===\n{{Main|DELTREE}}\n\nDeletes a directory along with all of the files and subdirectories that it contains. Normally, it will ask for confirmation of the potentially dangerous action. Since the RD (RMDIR) command can not delete a directory if the directory is not empty, the DELTREE command can be used to delete the whole directory.\n\nThe <code>deltree</code> command is included in certain versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]s.  It is specifically available only in versions of [[MS-DOS]] 6.0 and higher,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> and in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]]. In Windows NT, the functionality provided exists but is handled by the command ''rd'' or ''rmdir'' which has slightly different syntax. This command has been deprecated for Windows 7.\n\n===DIR===\n{{Main|dir (command)}}\n\nThe DIR command displays the contents of a directory. The contents comprise the disk's volume label and serial number; one directory or filename per line, including the filename extension, the file size in bytes, and the date and time the file was last modified; and the total number of files listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining on the disk. The command is one of the few commands that exist from the first versions of DOS.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> The command can display files in subdirectories. The resulting directory listing can be sorted by various criteria and filenames can be displayed in a chosen format.\n\n===DISKCOMP===\n{{Main|diskcomp}}\n\nA command for comparing the complete contents of a [[floppy disk]] to another one.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DISKCOPY===\n{{Main|diskcopy}}\n\nA command for copying the complete contents of a diskette to another diskette.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DOSKEY===\n{{Main|DOSKEY}}\n\nA command that adds [[command history]], [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] functionality, and improved editing features to the command-line interpreter.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===DRVSPACE===\n{{Main|DriveSpace}}\n\nA [[disk compression]] utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.22.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===ECHO===\n{{Main|echo (command)}}\n\nThe ECHO command prints its own arguments back out to the DOS equivalent of the [[Standard streams|standard output stream.]] (Hence the name, ECHO) Usually, this means directly to the screen, but the output of ''echo'' can be redirected, like any other command, to files or devices. Often used in [[batch file]]s to print text out to the user.\n\nAnother important use of the echo command is to toggle echoing of commands on and off in batch files. Traditionally batch files begin with the <code>@echo off</code> statement. This says to the interpreter that echoing of commands should be off during the whole execution of the batch file, thus resulting in a \"tidier\" output (the <code>@</code> symbol declares that this particular command (echo off) should also be executed without echo.)\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EDIT===\n{{Main|MS-DOS Editor}}\n\nEDIT is a full-screen [[text editor]], included with MS-DOS versions 5 and 6,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> OS/2 and Windows NT to 4.0 The corresponding program in Windows 95 and later, and Windows 2000 and later is Edit v2.0. PC DOS 6 and later use the [[E (PC DOS)|DOS ''E'' Editor]] and DR-DOS used ''editor'' up to version 7.\n\n===EDLIN===\n{{Main|Edlin}}\n\nDOS line-editor.  It can be used with a script file, like debug, this makes it of some use even today.  The absence of a console editor in MS-DOS/PC DOS 1-4 created an after-market for third-party editors.\n\nIn DOS 5, an extra command \"?\" was added to give the user much-needed help.\n\nDOS 6 was the last version to contain EDLIN; for MS-DOS 6, it's on the supplemental disks,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> while PC DOS 6 had it in the base install. Windows NT 32-bit, and OS/2 have Edlin.\n\n===EMM386===\n{{Main|EMM386}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe EMM386 command enables or disables EMM386 expanded-memory support on a computer with an [[80386]] or higher processor. \n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== ERASE ===\nSee: [[List of DOS commands#DEL and ERASE|DEL and ERASE]]\n\n===EXE2BIN===\n{{Main|exe2bin}}\n\nConverts an [[executable]] ([[.exe]]) file into a [[binary file]] with the [[filename extension|extension]] [[COM file|.com]], which is a memory image of the program.\n\nThe size of the resident [[Code segment|code]] and [[Data segment|data sections]] combined in the input .exe file must be less than 64 KB. The file must also have no [[Call stack|stack segment]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 through 5. It is available separately for version 6 on the Supplemental Disk.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EXIT===\n{{Main|exit (command)}}\n\nExits the current command processor.  If the exit is used at the primary command, it has no effect unless in a DOS window under Microsoft Windows, in which case the window is closed and the user returns to the desktop.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EXPAND===\nThe Microsoft File Expansion Utility is used to uncompress one or more compressed [[cabinet (file format)|cabinet files]] (.CAB). The command dates back to 1990 and was supplied on floppy disc for MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref>https://ss64.com/nt/expand.html</ref><ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FAKEMOUS===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\nFAKEMOUS is an IBM PS/2 mouse utility used with [[AccessDOS]]. Is is included on the MS-DOS 6 Supplemental Disk.<ref>https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/097/Q97835/</ref><ref>https://jeffpar.github.io/kbarchive/kb/117/Q117600/</ref>\nAccessDOS assists persons with disabilities.\n\n===FASTHELP===\n{{See also|help (command)}}\n\nProvides information for MS-DOS commands.\n\n===FASTOPEN===\n{{Main|FASTOPEN}}\n\nA command that provides accelerated access to frequently-used [[File system|files and directories]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FC===\n{{Main|File Compare}}\n\nShow differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later \u2013 primarily non-IBM releases.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FDISK===\n{{Main|fdisk}}\n\nThe FDISK command manipulates hard disk [[partition table]]s. The name derives from IBM's habit of calling hard drives ''fixed disks''. FDISK has the ability to display information about, create, and delete DOS partitions or [[Disk partitioning|logical DOS drive]]. It can also install a standard [[master boot record]] on the hard drive.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FIND===\n{{Main|Find (Windows)}}\n\nThe FIND command is a [[Filter (software)|filter]] to find lines in the input [[data stream]] that contain or don't contain a specified [[String (computer science)|string]] and send these to the output data stream. It may also be used as a [[Pipeline (software)|pipe]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FINDSTR===\nThe FINDSTR command is a GREP-oriented ''FIND''-like utility. Among its uses is the logical-OR lacking in FIND.\n:FINDSTR \"YES NO MAYBE\" *.txt\n::would find all files with one or more of the above-listed words YES, NO, MAYBE.\n\n===FOR===\n{{Main|For loop}}\n\nIteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.\nThe FOR loop can be used to [[parse]] a file or the output of a command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FORMAT===\n{{Main|format (command)}}\n\nDeletes the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] entries and the [[root directory]] of the drive/partition, and reformats it for MS-DOS. In most cases, this should only be used on floppy drives or other [[removable media]]. This command can potentially erase everything on a computer's drive.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===GOTO===\n{{Main|Goto}}\n\nThe ''Goto'' command transfers execution to a specified label. Labels are specified at the beginning of a line, with a colon ({{codett|:likethis}}).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\nUsed in [[Batch file]]s.\n\n===GRAFTABL===\n{{Main|GRAFTABL}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe GRAFTABL command enables the display of an extended character set in graphics mode.<ref>[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/graftabl graftabl | Microsoft Docs]</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===GRAPHICS===\nA TSR program to enable the sending of graphical screen dump to printer by pressing <Print Screen>.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===HELP===\n{{Main|help (command)}}\n\nGives help about DOS commands.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 thru Windows XP. Full-screen command help is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> Beginning with Windows XP, the command processor \"DOS\" offers builtin-help for commands by using \"/?\" (e.g. COPY /?)\n\n===IF===\n{{Main||Control flow}}\n\nIF is a conditional statement, that allows branching of the program execution. It evaluates the specified condition, and only if it is true, then it executes the remainder of the command line. Otherwise, it skips the remainder of the line and continues with next command line. \n\nUsed in [[Batch file]]s.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===INTERSVR and INTERLNK===\nIn MS-DOS; <kbd>filelink</kbd> in DR-DOS.\n\nNetwork PCs using a [[null modem cable]] or [[LapLink cable]].

This was usually done by moving [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR programs]] and [[device driver]]s to the [[Upper memory area|upper memory]]. The whole process required two system restarts. Before the first restart the user was asked whether to enable [[Expanded memory|EMS Memory]], since use of expanded memory required a reserved 64KiB region in upper memory. The first restart inserted the SIZER.EXE program which gauged the memory needed by each TSR or Driver. MemMaker would then calculate the optimal Driver and TSR placement in upper memory and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS accordingly, and reboot the second time.<ref>{{cite book | title = Using MS-DOS 6.22 | first = Jim | last = Cooper | publisher = [[Que Publishing]] | page = 455 |  isbn = 0789725738 | date = May 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u7oN-5y7nGsC&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=configuring+memory+with+memmaker+cooper#v=onepage&q=configuring%20memory%20with%20memmaker%20cooper&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMEMMAKER.EXE and SIZER.EXE were developed for Microsoft by [[Helix Software Company]] and were eliminated starting in [[MS-DOS 7]] ([[Windows 95]]); however, they could be obtained from Microsoft's FTP server as part of the OLDDOS.EXE package, alongside other tools. \n\nPC DOS uses another program called RamBoost to optimize memory, working either with PC DOS's [[HIMEM]]/[[EMM386]] or a third-party memory manager.

This command is processed by the command processor. Thus, its output can be redirected to create a zero-byte file. REM is useful in logged sessions or screen-captures. One might add comments by way of labels, usually starting with double-colon (::).   These are not processed by the command processor.\n\n=== REN ===\n{{Main|ren (command)}}\n\nThe REN command renames a file. Unlike the <code>move</code> command, this command cannot be used to rename subdirectories, or rename files across drives. Mass renames can be accomplished by the use of the wildcards characters asterisk (*) and question mark (?).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490987.aspx |title=Microsoft TechNet Rename (ren) article}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== REPLACE ===\n{{Main|replace (command)}}\n\nA command that is used to replace one or more existing [[computer file]]s or add new files to a target [[directory (computing)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== RESTORE ===\nSee: [[List of DOS commands#BACKUP and RESTORE|BACKUP and RESTORE]]\n\n=== SCANDISK ===\n{{Main|Microsoft ScanDisk}}\n\nDisk diagnostic utility. Scandisk was a replacement for the <code>chkdsk</code> utility, starting with MS-DOS version 6.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> Its primary advantages over <code>chkdsk</code> is that it is more reliable and has the ability to run a surface scan which finds and marks bad clusters on the disk.

It will expand an abbreviated form which the command processor can recognise into its full form. It can see through <kbd>SUBST</kbd> and <kbd>JOIN</kbd> to find the actual directory.\n\nMS-DOS can find files and directories given their names, without full path information, if the search object is on a path specified by the environment variable [[PATH (environment variable)|PATH]]. For example, if <kbd>PATH</kbd> includes <kbd>C:\\PROGRAMS</kbd>, and file <kbd>MYPROG.EXE</kbd> is on this directory, then if <code>MYPROG</code> is typed at the command prompt, the command processor will execute <code>C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE</code>. In this case,\n\n TRUENAME MYPROG\n\nwould display\n\n C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE\n\nThis command displays the [[UNC path]]names of mapped network or local CD drives. This command is an undocumented DOS command. The help switch \"<kbd>/?</kbd>\" defines it as a \"Reserved command name\". It is available in MS-DOS 5.00.0. This command is similar to the [[which (command)|which]] command, which, given an executable found in $PATH, would give a full path and name. The C library function <code>realpath</code> performs this function. The Microsoft Windows command processors do not support this command.\n<real code.st>\n\n=== TYPE ===\n{{Main|TYPE (DOS command)}}\n\nDisplays a file. The <kbd>[[List of DOS commands#MORE|more]]</kbd> command is frequently used in conjunction with this command, e.g. <kbd>type ''long-text-file'' | more</kbd>.

[[List of DOS operating systems#Other operating systems|Other DOS operating systems]] are not part of the scope of this list.\n\nIn DOS, many standard [[system command]]s were provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files.  Some commands were built into the command interpreter, others existed as external commands on disk. Over the several generations of DOS, commands were added for the additional functions of the operating system. In the current [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system, a text-mode command prompt window, [[cmd.exe]], can still be used.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n==Command processing==\nThe command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal \u2014 built into COMMAND.COM; others are external commands stored on disk. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND.COM will parse the line and attempt to match a command name to a built-in command or to the name of an executable program file or [[batch file]] on disk. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the command prompt is refreshed.\n\nExternal commands were too large to keep in the command processor, or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command [[path (variable)|path]] set in the command interpreter.\n\nIn the list below, commands that can accept more than one file name, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a ''<kbd>[[filespec]]</kbd>'' (file specification) parameter. Commands that can accept only a single file name are said to accept a ''<kbd>filename</kbd>'' parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a \"/\" or a \"-\" may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into filenames, file specifications, and other options.\n\nThe command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands, but the command names themselves and file names are case-insensitive.\n\nMany commands are the same across many DOS systems, but some differ in command syntax or name.\n\n==DOS commands==\nA partial list of the most common commands for [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM PC DOS]] follows below.\n\n===APPEND===\nSets the path to be searched for data files or displays the current search path. \nThe APPEND command is similar to the PATH command that tells DOS where to search for program files (files with a .COM, .

Implementing BASIC in this way was very common in operating systems on 8- and 16-bit machines made in the 1980s.\n\n[[IBM]] computers had BASIC 1.1 in ROM, and IBM's versions of BASIC used code in this ROM-BASIC, which allowed for extra memory in the code area.  BASICA last appeared in [[IBM PC DOS]] 5.02, and in [[OS/2]] (2.0 and later), the version had ROM-BASIC moved into the program code.\n\nMicrosoft released [[GW-BASIC]] for machines with no ROM-BASIC.  Some OEM releases had basic.com and basica.com as loaders for GW-BASIC.EXE.\n\nBASIC was dropped after MS-DOS 4, and PC DOS 5.02.  OS/2 (which uses PC DOS 5), has it, while MS-DOS 5 does not.\n\n===BREAK===\nThis command is used to instruct DOS to check whether the {{Keypress|Ctrl}} and {{Keypress|Break}} keys have been pressed before carrying out a program request.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CALL===\n{{See also|start (command)}}\nStarts a batch file from within another batch file and returns when that one ends.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CD and CHDIR===\n{{Main|cd (command)}}\n\nThe CHDIR (or the alternative name CD) command either displays or changes the current working [[directory (file systems)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHCP===\nThe command either displays or changes the active [[Windows code page|code page]] used to display [[glyph|character glyphs]] in a [[Win32 console|console window]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===CHKDSK===\n{{Main|CHKDSK}}\n\nCHKDSK verifies a storage [[volume]] (for example, a [[hard disk]], [[Disk partitioning|disk partition]] or [[floppy disk]]) for file system integrity.

Normally, it will ask for confirmation of the potentially dangerous action. Since the RD (RMDIR) command can not delete a directory if the directory is not empty, the DELTREE command can be used to delete the whole directory.\n\nThe <code>deltree</code> command is included in certain versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]s.  It is specifically available only in versions of [[MS-DOS]] 6.0 and higher,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> and in [[Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]]. In Windows NT, the functionality provided exists but is handled by the command ''rd'' or ''rmdir'' which has slightly different syntax. This command has been deprecated for Windows 7.\n\n===DIR===\n{{Main|dir (command)}}\n\nThe DIR command displays the contents of a directory. The contents comprise the disk's volume label and serial number; one directory or filename per line, including the filename extension, the file size in bytes, and the date and time the file was last modified; and the total number of files listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining on the disk.

Often used in [[batch file]]s to print text out to the user.\n\nAnother important use of the echo command is to toggle echoing of commands on and off in batch files. Traditionally batch files begin with the <code>@echo off</code> statement. This says to the interpreter that echoing of commands should be off during the whole execution of the batch file, thus resulting in a \"tidier\" output (the <code>@</code> symbol declares that this particular command (echo off) should also be executed without echo.)\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===EDIT===\n{{Main|MS-DOS Editor}}\n\nEDIT is a full-screen [[text editor]], included with MS-DOS versions 5 and 6,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> OS/2 and Windows NT to 4.0 The corresponding program in Windows 95 and later, and Windows 2000 and later is Edit v2.0. PC DOS 6 and later use the [[E (PC DOS)|DOS ''E'' Editor]] and DR-DOS used ''editor'' up to version 7.\n\n===EDLIN===\n{{Main|Edlin}}\n\nDOS line-editor.  It can be used with a script file, like debug, this makes it of some use even today.  The absence of a console editor in MS-DOS/PC DOS 1-4 created an after-market for third-party editors.\n\nIn DOS 5, an extra command \"?\" was added to give the user much-needed help.\n\nDOS 6 was the last version to contain EDLIN; for MS-DOS 6, it's on the supplemental disks,<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> while PC DOS 6 had it in the base install.

The name derives from IBM's habit of calling hard drives ''fixed disks''. FDISK has the ability to display information about, create, and delete DOS partitions or [[Disk partitioning|logical DOS drive]]. It can also install a standard [[master boot record]] on the hard drive.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FIND===\n{{Main|Find (Windows)}}\n\nThe FIND command is a [[Filter (software)|filter]] to find lines in the input [[data stream]] that contain or don't contain a specified [[String (computer science)|string]] and send these to the output data stream. It may also be used as a [[Pipeline (software)|pipe]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FINDSTR===\nThe FINDSTR command is a GREP-oriented ''FIND''-like utility. Among its uses is the logical-OR lacking in FIND.\n:FINDSTR \"YES NO MAYBE\" *.txt\n::would find all files with one or more of the above-listed words YES, NO, MAYBE.\n\n===FOR===\n{{Main|For loop}}\n\nIteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.\nThe FOR loop can be used to [[parse]] a file or the output of a command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n===FORMAT===\n{{Main|format (command)}}\n\nDeletes the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] entries and the [[root directory]] of the drive/partition, and reformats it for MS-DOS.

This was usually done by moving [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR programs]] and [[device driver]]s to the [[Upper memory area|upper memory]]. The whole process required two system restarts. Before the first restart the user was asked whether to enable [[Expanded memory|EMS Memory]], since use of expanded memory required a reserved 64KiB region in upper memory. The first restart inserted the SIZER.EXE program which gauged the memory needed by each TSR or Driver. MemMaker would then calculate the optimal Driver and TSR placement in upper memory and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS accordingly, and reboot the second time.<ref>{{cite book | title = Using MS-DOS 6.22 | first = Jim | last = Cooper | publisher = [[Que Publishing]] | page = 455 |  isbn = 0789725738 | date = May 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=u7oN-5y7nGsC&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=configuring+memory+with+memmaker+cooper#v=onepage&q=configuring%20memory%20with%20memmaker%20cooper&f=false}}</ref>\n\nMEMMAKER.EXE and SIZER.EXE were developed for Microsoft by [[Helix Software Company]] and were eliminated starting in [[MS-DOS 7]] ([[Windows 95]]); however, they could be obtained from Microsoft's FTP server as part of the OLDDOS.EXE package, alongside other tools. \n\nPC DOS uses another program called RamBoost to optimize memory, working either with PC DOS's [[HIMEM]]/[[EMM386]] or a third-party memory manager.

The user would usually use the copy command to copy files to LPT1.\n\n=== PRINTFIX ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== PROMPT ===\n{{See also|Prompt (computing)}}\n\nThe PROMPT command allows the user to change the prompt in the command screen.  The default prompt is $p (i.e. prompt $p), which displays the drive and current path as the prompt, but can be changed to anything.  'Prompt $d', displays the current system date as the prompt. Type 'prompt /?' in the cmd screen for help on this function.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 2.1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== QBASIC ===\n{{Main|QBasic}}\n\nAn [[integrated development environment]] and [[BASIC]] [[Interpreted language|interpreter]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== RD or RMDIR ===\n{{Main|rmdir}}\n\nRemove a directory (delete a directory); by default the directories must be empty of files for the command to succeed.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\nThe [[List of DOS commands#DELTREE|deltree]] command in some versions of MS-DOS and all versions of [[Windows 9x]] removes non-empty directories.\n\n=== RECOVER ===\n{{Main|recover (command)}}\n\nA primitive [[filesystem]] error recovery utility included in MS-DOS / IBM PC DOS.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 through 5.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== REM ===\nRemark ([[comment (computer programming)|comment]]) command, normally used within a [[batch file]], and for DR-DOS, PC/MS-DOS 6 and above, in CONFIG.SYS. This command is processed by the command processor. Thus, its output can be redirected to create a zero-byte file. REM is useful in logged sessions or screen-captures. One might add comments by way of labels, usually starting with double-colon (::).   These are not processed by the command processor.\n\n=== REN ===\n{{Main|ren (command)}}\n\nThe REN command renames a file. Unlike the <code>move</code> command, this command cannot be used to rename subdirectories, or rename files across drives. Mass renames can be accomplished by the use of the wildcards characters asterisk (*) and question mark (?).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490987.aspx |title=Microsoft TechNet Rename (ren) article}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== REPLACE ===\n{{Main|replace (command)}}\n\nA command that is used to replace one or more existing [[computer file]]s or add new files to a target [[directory (computing)|directory]].\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== RESTORE ===\nSee: [[List of DOS commands#BACKUP and RESTORE|BACKUP and RESTORE]]\n\n=== SCANDISK ===\n{{Main|Microsoft ScanDisk}}\n\nDisk diagnostic utility. Scandisk was a replacement for the <code>chkdsk</code> utility, starting with MS-DOS version 6.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> Its primary advantages over <code>chkdsk</code> is that it is more reliable and has the ability to run a surface scan which finds and marks bad clusters on the disk. It also provided mouse point-and-click [[Text user interface|TUI]], allowing for interactive session to complement command-line batch run.\n<code>chkdsk</code> had surface scan and bad cluster detection functionality included, and was used again on Windows NT based operating systems.\n\n=== SELECT ===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe SELECT command formats a disk and installs country-specific information and keyboard codes.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and 4 and IBM PC DOS releases 3 through 3.3.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\nThis command is no longer included in DOS Version 6 and later.\n\n=== SET ===\nSets [[environment variable]]s.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n[[cmd.exe]] in Windows NT 2000, 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, and a number of third-party solutions allow direct entry of environment variables from the command prompt. From at least Windows 2000, the <code>set</code> command allows for the evaluation of strings into variables, thus providing ''inter alia'' a means of performing integer arithmetic.<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Karp\n| first      = David Aaron\n| author2    = [[Tim O'Reilly]]\n| author3    = Troy Mott\n| title      = Windows XP in a nutshell\n| url        = https://archive.org/details/windowsxpinnutsh00karp\n| url-access = registration\n| accessdate = 2010-11-26\n| edition    = 2\n| series     = Nutshell handbook\n| year       = 2005\n| publisher  = [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly Media, Inc.]]\n| isbn       = 978-0-596-00900-7\n| page       = [https://archive.org/details/windowsxpinnutsh00karp/page/422 422]\n}}</ref>\n\n=== SETUP ===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\nThis command does a computer setup. With all computers running DOS versions 5 and\nlater, it runs the computer setup, such as Windows 95 setup and Windows 98 setup.\n\n=== SETVER ===\n{{See also|ver (command)}}\n\nSetVer is a [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program designed to return a different value to the version of DOS that is running.  This allows programs that look for a specific version of DOS to run under a different DOS.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SHARE ===\n{{Main|share (command)}}\n\nInstalls support for file sharing and locking capabilities.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SHIFT ===\nThe SHIFT command increases number of [[replaceable parameter]]s to more than the standard ten for use in [[batch file]]s.\nThis is done by changing the position of replaceable parameters. It replaces each of the replacement parameters with the subsequent one (e.g. {{codett|%0}} with {{codett|%1}}, {{codett|%1}} with {{codett|%2}}, etc.).\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SIZER ===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe external command SIZER.EXE is not intended to be started directly from the command prompt. Is used by [[MemMaker]] during the memory-optimization process.\n\n=== SMARTDRV ===\n{{Main|SmartDrive}}\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SORT ===\nA [[Filter (software)|filter]] to sort lines in the input data stream and send them to the output data stream. Similar to the Unix command <code>[[Sort (Unix)|sort]]</code>. Handles files up to 64k. This sort is always case insensitive.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722869.aspx|title=Microsoft on \"sort\"|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SUBST ===\n{{Main|SUBST}}\n\nA utility to map a subdirectory to a drive letter.<ref name=\"murdock\" /> The opposite can be achieved via the [[#JOIN|JOIN]] command.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== SYS ===\n{{Main|SYS (command)}}\n\nA utility to make a volume bootable.  Sys rewrites the Volume Boot Code (the first sector of the partition that SYS is acting on) so that the code, when executed, will look for [[IO.SYS]].  SYS also copies the core DOS system files, IO.SYS, [[MSDOS.SYS]], and [[COMMAND.COM]], to the volume.  SYS does ''not'' rewrite the Master Boot Record, contrary to widely held belief.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== TELNET ===\nThe Telnet Client is a tool for developers and administrators to help manage and test network connectivity. <ref> Client must be activated from Admin </ref>\n\n=== TIME ===\n{{Main|TIME (command)}}\n\nDisplay the [[system time]] and waits for the user to enter a new time.

It will expand an abbreviated form which the command processor can recognise into its full form. It can see through <kbd>SUBST</kbd> and <kbd>JOIN</kbd> to find the actual directory.\n\nMS-DOS can find files and directories given their names, without full path information, if the search object is on a path specified by the environment variable [[PATH (environment variable)|PATH]]. For example, if <kbd>PATH</kbd> includes <kbd>C:\\PROGRAMS</kbd>, and file <kbd>MYPROG.EXE</kbd> is on this directory, then if <code>MYPROG</code> is typed at the command prompt, the command processor will execute <code>C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE</code>. In this case,\n\n TRUENAME MYPROG\n\nwould display\n\n C:\\PROGRAMS\\MYPROG.EXE\n\nThis command displays the [[UNC path]]names of mapped network or local CD drives. This command is an undocumented DOS command. The help switch \"<kbd>/?</kbd>\" defines it as a \"Reserved command name\". It is available in MS-DOS 5.00.0. This command is similar to the [[which (command)|which]] command, which, given an executable found in $PATH, would give a full path and name. The C library function <code>realpath</code> performs this function. The Microsoft Windows command processors do not support this command.\n<real code.st>\n\n=== TYPE ===\n{{Main|TYPE (DOS command)}}\n\nDisplays a file. The <kbd>[[List of DOS commands#MORE|more]]</kbd> command is frequently used in conjunction with this command, e.g. <kbd>type ''long-text-file'' | more</kbd>. TYPE can be used to concatenate files (type file1 file2 > file3); however this won't work for large files{{dubious|date=November 2014}}{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\u2014use copy command instead.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== UNDELETE ===\n{{Main|Undeletion}}\n\nRestores file previously deleted with <kbd>del</kbd>. By default all recoverable files in the working directory are restored; options are used to change this behavior. If the MS-DOS <kbd>mirror</kbd> [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program is used, then deletion tracking files are created and can be used by <kbd>undelete</kbd>.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== UNFORMAT ===\n{{See also|format (command)}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe UNFORMAT command is used to undo the effects of formatting a disk.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VER ===\n{{Main|ver (command)}}\n\nAn internal DOS command, that reports the DOS version presently running, and since MS-DOS 5, whether DOS is loaded high.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VERIFY ===\nEnables or disables the feature to determine if files have been correctly written to disk. If no parameter is provided, the command will display the current setting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~murdock/verify.html|title=DOS Command: VERIFY|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VOL ===\n{{Main|vol (command)}}\n\nAn internal command that displays the disk volume label and serial number.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== VSAFE ===\n{{Main|MSAV}}\n\nA [[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]] program that continuously monitors the computer for viruses.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" />\n\n=== XCOPY ===\n{{Main|XCOPY}}\n\nCopy entire directory trees. Xcopy is a version of the copy command that can move files and directories from one location to another.\n\nXCOPY usage and attributes can be obtained by typing \"XCOPY /?\" in the DOS Command line.\n\nThe command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.<ref name=\"RUNNINGMSDOS\" /> \n\n== See also ==\n* [[:Category:Windows commands]]\n* [[Command-line interface]]\n* [[List of CONFIG.SYS directives]]\n* [[Timeline of DOS operating systems]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Cite book|author-last=Cooper|author-first=Jim|title=Special Edition Using MS-DOS 6.22, Third Edition|date=2001|publisher=[[Que Publishing]]|isbn=978-0789725738}}\n* {{Cite book|author-last=Wolverton|author-first=Van|title=MS-DOS Commands: Microsoft Quick Reference, 4th Revised edition|date=1990|publisher=[[Microsoft Press]]|isbn=978-1556152894}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikibooks|Guide to Windows Commands}}\n*[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands Command-Line Reference]  : Microsoft TechNet Database \"Command-Line Reference\"\n*[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749839.aspx The MS-DOS 6 Technical Reference on TechNet] contains the official Microsoft MS-DOS 6 command reference documention.\n*[http://www.drdos.com/dosdoc/ DR-DOS 7.03 online manual]\n*[http://www.mdgx.com/secrets.htm MDGx MS-DOS Undocumented + Hidden Secrets]\n\nThere are several guides to DOS commands available that are licensed under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]]:\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130612114615/http://fd-doc.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php The FreeDOS Spec] at SourceForge is a [[plaintext]] specification, written in 1999, for how DOS commands should work in FreeDOS\n*[http://www.computerhope.com/msdos.htm MS-DOS commands]\n*[http://www.windows-commandline.com/windows-cmd-commands-reference/ Reference for windows commands with examples]\n*[http://www.textfiles.com/hacking/MICROSOFT/dosundoc.txt A Collection of Undocumented and Obscure Features in Various MS-DOS Versions]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Dos Commands}}\n[[Category:DOS commands]]\n[[Category:Microsoft lists|DOS commands]]\n", "name_user": "Ghettoblaster", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DOS_commands"}

He was born in Staines-upon-Thames, Surrey<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mikevickers.net/a-potted-biography/|title=A potted biography \u2013 Mike Vickers|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>. He originally played [[flute]] and saxophone but with the increasing popularity of [[guitar]]s in bands, it was decided that Manfred Mann should have a guitarist in their line-up. Vickers volunteered for this role but he always preferred playing woodwind. His tough flute soloing on hard [[blues]] tracks such as \"Without You\" prefigured the work of [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] with [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] five years later. As the group were all multi-instrumentalists, multi-tracking was used to allow Vickers to perform on guitar and woodwind on the same recordings, while drummer [[Mike Hugg]] similarly doubled on [[vibraphone]].\n\nVickers was credited as a co-writer on Manfred Mann's early hit singles and contributed a few tracks to albums, including \"The Abominable Snowmann\" and \"You're for Me\". In 1965, his bandmate [[Tom McGuinness (musician)|Tom McGuinness]] described him as \"the nicest one of the group \u2026 nice nearly all the time. But when he's nasty he just can't be nice about it.\" McGuinness added: \"He collects saxophones \u2013 which we buy for him.\"<ref>Sleeve note, ''Mann Made'', HMV 1911, 1965</ref>\n\nBy 1965, according to McGuinness, Vickers was already \"recording with his own orchestra and looks like becoming a definite threat to [[Semprini]]\".<ref>Sleeve note, ''Mann Made'', HMV 1911, 1965</ref> At the end of that year, he quit the band, although his first solo album, ''I Wish I Were a Group Again'', did not appear until 1968. In June 1967, he conducted the orchestra for the live recording of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", which was shown on live TV across the world when communications satellite technology was celebrated by a worldwide link-up.\n\nVickers was one of the first musicians in the UK to use the Moog synthesiser.  He taught The Beatles to play it, and he demonstrated it on the BBC science programme \u201cTomorrow\u2019s World\u201d. Keith Emerson first used Vickers\u2019 Moog (live, with Vickers patching and Emerson playing) in 1970 before Emerson got his own. Vickers recorded a number of library music records featuring the Moog through the 1970s.\n\nVickers persevered as a [[composer]] and [[arranger]] for records, television shows and films. He composed \"Pegasus\", the theme from the cult [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''[[The Adventures of Don Quick]]'' in 1970. One of his most familiar TV compositions is \"Jet Set\", which was used as the theme music for the [[NBC]] [[game show]] ''[[Jackpot (game show)|Jackpot]]'' in 1974\u201375, and since 1977 as opening music for the sports series ''[[This Week in Baseball]]''. He also wrote \"Gathering Crowds\", under the [[pseudonym]] Patrick J. O'Hara Scott, which has been the closing theme for ''This Week in Baseball'' throughout its history. His film work includes the scores to ''[[The Sandwich Man (1966 film)|The Sandwich Man]]'' (1966), ''[[Press for Time]]'' (1966), ''[[My Lover, My Son]]'' (1970), ''[[Please Sir!
