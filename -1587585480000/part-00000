The Albans were a mixed nation composed of all the above people. Dionysius adds that it is possible that a barbarian element from among the neighboring people or a remnant of the ancient inhabitants of the place were mixed with the Greek. But all these people, having lost their tribal past came to be called by one common name, Latins, after Latinus, who had been the king of the country. The leaders of the colony were the twin brothers Romulus and Remus.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg001.perseus-grc1:2.2 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 2.2]</ref>\n\n===Other myths===\nAnother story told how [[Rhomos|Romos]], a son of [[Odysseus]] and [[Circe]], was the one who founded Rome.<ref>, Goldberg, ''Epic in Republican Rome'', 1995, p. 50-51.</ref> [[Martin P. Nilsson]] speculates that this older story was becoming a bit embarrassing as Rome became more powerful and tensions with the Greeks grew. Being descendants of the Greeks was no longer preferable, so the Romans settled on the Trojan foundation myth instead. Nilsson further speculates that the name of Romos was changed by the Romans to the native name Romulus, but the name Romos (later changed to the native Remus) was never forgotten by the people, and so these two names came to stand side by side as founders of the city.<ref>Nilsson, Olympian, 1964, p. 264.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, [[Julian (emperor)|Emperor Julian]] in his satire called \"The Caesars\", which describes a contest between the previous Roman emperors, with [[Alexander the Great]] called in as an extra contestant, in the presence of the assembled gods, he made Alexander say: \"I am aware that you Romans are yourselves descended from the Greeks,...\"<ref>[http://www.attalus.org/translate/caesars.html Julian: The Caesars, 324]</ref> Rome was also founded by the caretakers Romulus and Remus two nickers who were the descendents of the roman army who fought the heshins.\n\n201AC\n\n==The name of Rome==\n{{Further|History of Rome}}\n\nThere is no consensus on the etymology of the city's name. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712\u20131778) suggested [[Greek language|Greek]] \"{{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7}}\" (''{{transl|grc|rh\u014dm\u0113}}''), meaning \"strength, vigor\".<ref>Cf. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], ''[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|The Social Contract]]'', Book IV, Chapter IV, written in 1762, where he writes in a footnote that the word for Rome is Greek in origin and means force. \"There are writers who say that the name 'Rome' is derived from 'Romulus'. It is in fact Greek and means force.\"</ref>  A modern theory of etymology holds that the name of the city is of [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] origin (and perhaps the city itself, though this cannot be proven), derived from ''rumon'', \"river\".<ref name=\"baldi\">{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Baldi |author-link=Philip Baldi |title=The Foundations of Latin|pages=106\u20137|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2002}}</ref>\n\n\nSpongebob\n\n==Later commemoration==\nDuring the [[Italian Renaissance]], a group of [[Italian humanism|humanists]] affiliated with the [[Roman Academies#The Renaissance|Roman Academy]] formed a [[sodality]] to pursue [[antiquarian]] interests, celebrating the \"birthday of Rome\" annually on April 20. In 1468, the Academy was suppressed by [[Pope Paul II]] for fomenting \"republicanism, [[paganism]], and conspiracy\", but the sodality was reinstated about ten years later under [[Sixtus IV]] as the ''Societas Literatorum S. Victoris in Esquiliis'' (\"Literary Society of [[St. Victor (disambiguation)|Saint Victor]] on the [[Esquiline]]\"). The reformed group placed itself under the new patronage of saints Victor, [[Fortunatus the Apostle|Fortunatus]], and [[Saint Genesius (disambiguation)|Genesius]], \"whose [[feast day]] was conveniently proven to coincide with the [[Palilia]]\". Their \"Palilia\" was organized by [[Pomponio Leto]] and featured speeches, a communal meal, and a poetry competition.<ref>Angela Fritsen, \"Ludovico Lazzarelli's ''Fasti Christianae religionis'': Recipient and Context of an Ovidian Poem,\" in ''Myricae: Essays on Neo-Latin Literature in Memory of Jozef Ijsewijn'' (Leuven University Press, 2000), pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Coarelli, F. 1974.

Dionysius mentions that the Trojans, were also Greek people who were originally from the [[Peloponnesus]].<ref>Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1.60.3\u20131.61.1 {{PD-notice}}</ref> He also adds that even Romans say that the [[Pallantium]] was founded by Greeks from [[Pallantium (Arcadia)|Pallantium]] of [[Arcadia]], about sixty years before the [[Trojan war]] and the leader was Evander.<ref name = \"Dionysius-1.45.1\">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg001.perseus-grc1:1.31.1 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 1.45.1]</ref>\n\nLater at the sixteenth generation after the Trojan war the Albans united these places into one settlement, surrounding them with a wall and a ditch. The Albans were a mixed nation composed of all the above people. Dionysius adds that it is possible that a barbarian element from among the neighboring people or a remnant of the ancient inhabitants of the place were mixed with the Greek. But all these people, having lost their tribal past came to be called by one common name, Latins, after Latinus, who had been the king of the country. The leaders of the colony were the twin brothers Romulus and Remus.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0081.tlg001.perseus-grc1:2.2 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, 2.2]</ref>\n\n===Other myths===\nAnother story told how [[Rhomos|Romos]], a son of [[Odysseus]] and [[Circe]], was the one who founded Rome.<ref>, Goldberg, ''Epic in Republican Rome'', 1995, p. 50-51.</ref> [[Martin P. Nilsson]] speculates that this older story was becoming a bit embarrassing as Rome became more powerful and tensions with the Greeks grew. Being descendants of the Greeks was no longer preferable, so the Romans settled on the Trojan foundation myth instead. Nilsson further speculates that the name of Romos was changed by the Romans to the native name Romulus, but the name Romos (later changed to the native Remus) was never forgotten by the people, and so these two names came to stand side by side as founders of the city.<ref>Nilsson, Olympian, 1964, p. 264.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, [[Julian (emperor)|Emperor Julian]] in his satire called \"The Caesars\", which describes a contest between the previous Roman emperors, with [[Alexander the Great]] called in as an extra contestant, in the presence of the assembled gods, he made Alexander say: \"I am aware that you Romans are yourselves descended from the Greeks,...\"<ref>[http://www.attalus.org/translate/caesars.html Julian: The Caesars, 324]</ref> Rome was also founded by the caretakers Romulus and Remus two nickers who were the descendents of the roman army who fought the heshins.\n\n201AC\n\n==The name of Rome==\n{{Further|History of Rome}}\n\nThere is no consensus on the etymology of the city's name. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712\u20131778) suggested [[Greek language|Greek]] \"{{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7}}\" (''{{transl|grc|rh\u014dm\u0113}}''), meaning \"strength, vigor\".<ref>Cf. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], ''[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|The Social Contract]]'', Book IV, Chapter IV, written in 1762, where he writes in a footnote that the word for Rome is Greek in origin and means force. \"There are writers who say that the name 'Rome' is derived from 'Romulus'. It is in fact Greek and means force.\"</ref>  A modern theory of etymology holds that the name of the city is of [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] origin (and perhaps the city itself, though this cannot be proven), derived from ''rumon'', \"river\".<ref name=\"baldi\">{{cite book |first=Philip |last=Baldi |author-link=Philip Baldi |title=The Foundations of Latin|pages=106\u20137|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2002}}</ref>\n\n== Archaeology ==\n<!-- Do not use \"archeology\" here -->\nThere is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from about 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures [[Palaeolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] sites.<ref>Heiken, G., Funiciello, R. and De Rita, D. (2005), The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the Eternal City. Princeton University Press</ref> Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the [[Bronze Age]] and the beginning of the [[Iron Age]], each hill between the sea and the Capitol was topped by a village (on the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).<ref name=coa9>Coarelli (1984) p. 9</ref>\n\nIn any case, the location that became the city of Rome was inhabited by Latin settlers from various regions, farmers and pastoralists, as evidenced by differences in pottery and burial techniques.<ref name=\"baldi\"/> The historical [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] were originally an [[Italic people|Italic tribe]] who inhabited the [[Alban Hills]].{{when|date=March 2014}} They later moved down into the valleys, which provided better land for agriculture. The island [[Tiber Island|Isola Tiberina]] was the site of an important ancient [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]. The area around the [[Tiber]] was particularly advantageous and offered notable strategic resources: the river was a natural border on one side, and the hills could provide a safe defensive position on the other side. This position would also have enabled the Latins to control the river and the commercial and military traffic on it from the natural observation point at [[Isola Tiberina]]. Moreover, road traffic could be controlled, since Rome was at the intersection of the principal roads to the sea coming from [[Sabinum]] (in the northeast) and [[Etruria]] (to the northwest).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThere is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (\"synoecism\") of several villages around the largest one on the Palatine. This aggregation, signalling the transition from a proto-urban to an urban settlement, was made possible by the increase in agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}: in turn, these boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly [[Ischia]] and [[Cumae]]). All these events, which according to the archeological excavations occurred around the mid 8th century BC, can be considered as the origin of the city.<ref name=coa9/>\n\nRecent studies suggest that the [[Quirinal hill]] was very important in ancient times, although the first hill to be inhabited seems to have been the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine]] (thus confirming the legend), which is also at the centre of ancient Rome.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Its three peaks, the minor hills ''Cermalus'' or ''Germalus'', ''Palatium'', and ''Velia'', were united with the three peaks of the Esquiline (''Cispius'', ''Fagutal'', and ''Oppius''), and then villages on the [[Caelian Hill]] and [[Suburra]].\n\nRecent discoveries revealed that the ''Germalus'' on the northern part of the Palatine was the site of a village (dated to the 9th century BC) with circular or [[elliptic]]al dwellings. It was protected by a clay wall (perhaps reinforced with wood), and it is likely that this is the particular location on the Palatine hill where Rome was actually founded. {{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe territory of this federation was surrounded by a sacred border called the ''[[pomerium]]'', which enclosed the so-called Servian{{Clarify|date=April 2017}} expansion of Rome.\n\nFestivals for the ''[[Septimontium]]'' (literally \"of the seven hills\") on December 11 were previously considered to be related to the foundation of Rome. However, April 21 is the only date for Rome's foundation upon which all the legends agree, and it has recently been argued that Septimontium celebrated the first federations among Roman hills. A similar federation was, in fact, celebrated by the Latins at [[Cave, Italy|Cave]] or at [[Monte Cavo]] (in ''[[Castelli Romani|Castelli]]'').{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Later commemoration==\nDuring the [[Italian Renaissance]], a group of [[Italian humanism|humanists]] affiliated with the [[Roman Academies#The Renaissance|Roman Academy]] formed a [[sodality]] to pursue [[antiquarian]] interests, celebrating the \"birthday of Rome\" annually on April 20. In 1468, the Academy was suppressed by [[Pope Paul II]] for fomenting \"republicanism, [[paganism]], and conspiracy\", but the sodality was reinstated about ten years later under [[Sixtus IV]] as the ''Societas Literatorum S. Victoris in Esquiliis'' (\"Literary Society of [[St. Victor (disambiguation)|Saint Victor]] on the [[Esquiline]]\"). The reformed group placed itself under the new patronage of saints Victor, [[Fortunatus the Apostle|Fortunatus]], and [[Saint Genesius (disambiguation)|Genesius]], \"whose [[feast day]] was conveniently proven to coincide with the [[Palilia]]\". Their \"Palilia\" was organized by [[Pomponio Leto]] and featured speeches, a communal meal, and a poetry competition.<ref>Angela Fritsen, \"Ludovico Lazzarelli's ''Fasti Christianae religionis'': Recipient and Context of an Ovidian Poem,\" in ''Myricae: Essays on Neo-Latin Literature in Memory of Jozef Ijsewijn'' (Leuven University Press, 2000), pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Coarelli, F. 1974.
