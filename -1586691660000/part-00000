In 1949 he was awarded a fellowship to study in Europe, where he was to spend the rest of his life. He lived in France and Germany, and travelled widely throughout the Continent. Cohen and his first wife, Virginia Adler, lived in Sam Francis' old studio on the Boulevard Arago in Paris, where he studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n== Artistic career ==\nCohen's work was representational and figurative, owing most to Dufy, Bonnard, Chagall, Kokoschka, Rouault and Soutine. His favourite subjects were ports and river banks, vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits. .\n\nIn the 1950s he had one-man exhibitions in Germany and Paris. French critics described him as an 'intimist', 'ranking among our best painters',<ref>Masques et Visages, 1958; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation</ref> and hailing his paintings as 'good, direct and natural'.<ref>Le Peintre, 1958; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> In 1958 he had his first one-man exhibition at the Ben Uri in London, where two years later he decided to settle. His exhibition at the Obelisk Gallery in 1960 was the first of several sell-out shows in Britain.\n\nHe had already met with considerable success in Germany and France. But with the large, ambitious, shimmering canvases of his ''Aspects of the Thames'' exhibition in 1961 Cohen really began to win critical acclaim in Britain too. \n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.jpg|frame|Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation]]\n\nThe young Anita Brookner wrote in the ''Burlington Magazine'' that he was 'a fresh and accessible artist of considerable accomplishment, whose abstract impressionist compositions were enlivened by an acute charm of colour'.<ref>Anita Brookner, Burlington Magazine, 1961</ref> ''The Tatler'' admired 'the rich sense of colour that makes his work immediately striking and lastingly memorable' and again noted the combination of abstract design and representation which remained important throughout his career: 'Look . . . at almost any few square inches of a Cohen canvas and you have a little gem of abstract painting'.<ref>Robert Wraight, Tatler, 1961</ref> Edward Lucie-Smith, in ''Arts Review'', found the paintings 'strikingly well constructed', adding: 'the architecture is nearly always firm and logical. . . . I admire these pictures most as virtuoso demonstrations of technical skill. They have immense panache and glitter, and yet they are self-consistent'.<ref>Edward Lucie-Smith, Arts Review, 1961</ref> The ''New Daily'' appreciated the 'visionary quality' of their effects of light.<ref>C. R. Cammell, New Daily, 1961.</ref>\n\nCohen followed this with an even more successful exhibition at the Brook Street Gallery in 1963, on the theme of the ''commedia dell'arte.'' The ''Daily Telegraph'' described the technical achievement of his images as 'formidable', and declared him 'one of the best draughtsmen at work today', adding that 'Only Picasso in one or two early works has in our time touched such depths through the characters of the ''Commedia dell'Arte'.''<ref>Terence Mullaly, Daily Telegraph, October 1963.</ref> Conroy Maddox, wrote in ''Arts Review'' that 'The paintings are a show of force and theatricality. . . . Cohen has certainly gained a sensuous richness and a robust and vigorous way of handling his material'.<ref>Conroy Maddox, Arts Review, 1963.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Polichinelle (Red Punch)', 1963, acrylic on hardboard, 40 x 30 in; 101.6 x 76.2 cm.

Alfred Cohen Art Foundation]]\n\nThe inspiration of the ''commedia dell'arte'' was to recur throughout Cohen's work. But once again he resisted the temptation to repeat a successful formula, and completely reinvented his painting yet again. Now he turned his attention to the landscape of Kent, where he settled with his second wife, Diana Saunders, in 1963. His exhibition of 'Recent Paintings' at the Brook Street Gallery in 1965 sounded a note that was to remain important in Cohen's work, focusing on the English countryside and country people. His attraction to Britain never waned. 'I don't want to leave it. America is no longer my home. I feel more of a foreigner there than I do anywhere in Europe.'<ref>Philip Oakes, 'Cohen GB', Sunday Times (29 Dec 1968)' clipping in Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> But he was also attempting to capture the features of the land that most perplexed him. First, its postwar air of decline: 'It is crumbling from the inside, and crumbling in style. It's elegant, but there's danger in the elegance.' But also the challenge represented by its crowded seclusion. As the writer Philip Oakes explains: 'He evolved a new style, using paint like a sculptor, laying down slabs of colour, carving it with his brush so that the fields and hedges and houses seemed to be hewn from the canvas'.<ref name=\"auto2\">Oakes, 'Cohen GB'.</ref>\n\nHis British landscapes were well-received too, with critics continuing to praise his compositional intelligence. ''Pictures on Exhibit'' said:\n\nThere are very few artists of today's generation with the ability to synthesise the quality of 20th Century Ecole de l'Europe in the sense that the late impressionists and the post-impressionists did it for their epoch. Alfred Cohen is one of them, and maybe this explains his success with a wide category of collectors. Their enthusiasm is unstinting . . . . These are recognizably contemporary paintings. C\u00e9zanne's tough palette is neatly handled and we are charmed without experiencing for a split-second any doubt that these are really good paintings. . . . There are few enough painters like him nowadays; hardly one capable of capturing the British scene in such an attractive and authoritative way.<ref>P. Sheldon-Williams, Pictures on Exhibit, 1965; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref>\n\nCohen had nine one-man exhibitions in London, and others in Heidelberg, Hannover, Paris, Toronto, Montreal, Tokyo, Cape Town, Belfast, and many other cities and towns in England, including Cambridge, York, Harrogate, Leeds, Rye, and King's Lynn. He had two-person exhibitions with Josef Herman, Patrick Hall, and Mary Newcomb. And his work was also included in many international mixed exhibitions, such as one at the U.S. Embassy in London of 'Five Americans in Britain', with R. B. Kitaj and others.\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Near Goudhurst', 1965, oil on board, 9.75 x 11.in; 24.8 x 29.9 cm.

The first of his four exhibitions there was in 1969. It continued the exploration of the country. 'He was always effective and satisfying', wrote the ''Jewish Chronicle'', 'but his Kentish landscapes have been a consistent breakthrough . . . .

James Burr, in ''Apollo'', noted:\n\nMany subjects have engaged the expressionist fervour of Alfred Cohen; in these recent paintings, the boats and houses of the coastlines of France predominate. He reacts with a fierce passion to direct experience that is organized into a formal structure. . . .

You can't pass them without a chuckle'.<ref>Peter Stone, Jewish Chronicle, 1976.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1970s Cohen took up print-making. His hand-coloured etchings, often of flowers, were sold worldwide. He also turned his sense of space and design to the renovation of houses. In 1978 he and Diana moved to Wighton, north Norfolk, where they converted an old schoolhouse into a studio, print workshop, and art gallery. They later discovered that this was the house where Henry Moore had lived as an art student in the 1920s, and where he had begun to sculpt.

He often exhibited there. Tony Warner found his exhibition at the King's Lynn arts centre in 1991 'invigorating', describing how it: 'glows with colour. . . . There is an obvious joy in the visual world. . . . each painting is carefully crafted. Layers of paint build up to an intricate pattern of complementary colours.

Howard Jacobson, in the ''Independent'', praised his 'wonderfully violent paintings':\n\nhe painted sensuously, in paint rather than in epigrams, and, like many of the best artists still alive in the last quarter of the 20th century, had to take a back seat to that institutionalised facetiousness we know as conceptualism. . . . It should, of course, be Tate Modern that exhibits him, but he's a little hot for their whitened aesthetic. . . . And not only too hot, but too possessed of the satiric daemon. For me, although you can see the influences of Vuillard and Kokoschka and Soutine on Cohen, his best work has Daumier behind it, the vigorousness of caricature and the savage grotesqueries of the commedia dell'arte. . .<ref>Howard Jacobson, The Independent, 02 February 2002, The Weekend Review, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'The Entrance of Punch', 1963, oil on canvas, 40 x 32 in; 101.6 x 81.3 cm.

In 1949 he was awarded a fellowship to study in Europe, where he was to spend the rest of his life. He lived in France and Germany, and travelled widely throughout the Continent. Cohen and his first wife, Virginia Adler, lived in Sam Francis' old studio on the Boulevard Arago in Paris, where he studied at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]].<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\n== Artistic career ==\nCohen's work was representational and figurative, owing most to Dufy, Bonnard, Chagall, Kokoschka, Rouault and Soutine. His favourite subjects were ports and river banks, vibrant flower compositions and searching portraits. .\n\nIn the 1950s he had one-man exhibitions in Germany and Paris. French critics described him as an 'intimist', 'ranking among our best painters',<ref>Masques et Visages, 1958; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation</ref> and hailing his paintings as 'good, direct and natural'.<ref>Le Peintre, 1958; clipping in the Archive of the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.</ref> In 1958 he had his first one-man exhibition at the Ben Uri in London, where two years later he decided to settle. His exhibition at the Obelisk Gallery in 1960 was the first of several sell-out shows in Britain.\n\nHe had already met with considerable success in Germany and France. But with the large, ambitious, shimmering canvases of his ''Aspects of the Thames'' exhibition in 1961 Cohen really began to win critical acclaim in Britain too. \n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation.jpg|frame|Alfred Cohen, 'Docklands Night', 1961, oil on canvas, 28 x 36 in; 71.1 x 91.4 cm; private collection; on loan to the Alfred Cohen Art Foundation]]\n\nThe young Anita Brookner wrote in the ''Burlington Magazine'' that he was 'a fresh and accessible artist of considerable accomplishment, whose abstract impressionist compositions were enlivened by an acute charm of colour'.<ref>Anita Brookner, Burlington Magazine, 1961</ref> ''The Tatler'' admired 'the rich sense of colour that makes his work immediately striking and lastingly memorable' and again noted the combination of abstract design and representation which remained important throughout his career: 'Look . . . at almost any few square inches of a Cohen canvas and you have a little gem of abstract painting'.<ref>Robert Wraight, Tatler, 1961</ref> Edward Lucie-Smith, in ''Arts Review'', found the paintings 'strikingly well constructed', adding: 'the architecture is nearly always firm and logical. . . . I admire these pictures most as virtuoso demonstrations of technical skill. They have immense panache and glitter, and yet they are self-consistent'.<ref>Edward Lucie-Smith, Arts Review, 1961</ref> The ''New Daily'' appreciated the 'visionary quality' of their effects of light.<ref>C. R. Cammell, New Daily, 1961.</ref>\n\nCohen followed this with an even more successful exhibition at the Brook Street Gallery in 1963, on the theme of the ''commedia dell'arte.'' The ''Daily Telegraph'' described the technical achievement of his images as 'formidable', and declared him 'one of the best draughtsmen at work today', adding that 'Only Picasso in one or two early works has in our time touched such depths through the characters of the ''Commedia dell'Arte'.''<ref>Terence Mullaly, Daily Telegraph, October 1963.</ref> Conroy Maddox, wrote in ''Arts Review'' that 'The paintings are a show of force and theatricality. . . .

Howard Jacobson, in the ''Independent'', praised his 'wonderfully violent paintings':\n\nhe painted sensuously, in paint rather than in epigrams, and, like many of the best artists still alive in the last quarter of the 20th century, had to take a back seat to that institutionalised facetiousness we know as conceptualism. . . . It should, of course, be Tate Modern that exhibits him, but he's a little hot for their whitened aesthetic. . . . And not only too hot, but too possessed of the satiric daemon. For me, although you can see the influences of Vuillard and Kokoschka and Soutine on Cohen, his best work has Daumier behind it, the vigorousness of caricature and the savage grotesqueries of the commedia dell'arte. . .<ref>Howard Jacobson, The Independent, 02 February 2002, The Weekend Review, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfred Cohen, 'The Entrance of Punch', 1963, oil on canvas, 40 x 32 in; 101.6 x 81.3 cm.

It is now known as ''Onychoprion fuscatus''.<ref>Bridge ''et al.'' (2005)</ref> The genus name is from [[Ancient Greek]] ''onux'', \"claw\" or \"nail\", and ''prion'', \"saw\". The specific ''fuscatus'' is [[Latin]] for \"dark\".<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher= Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n167 167], 282}}</ref>\n\nColloquially, it is known as the wideawake tern or just wideawake. This refers to the incessant calls produced by a colony of these birds, as does the [[Hawaiian (language)|Hawaiian]] name ''\u02bbewa \u02bbewa'' which roughly means \"[[cacophony]]\".<ref>From ''\u02bbewa'', \"crooked, out of shape, imperfect\" (Pukui ''et al.'' 1992: p.17)</ref> In most of [[Polynesia]] its name is ''manutara'' or similar &ndash; literally \"tern-bird\",<ref>The Polynesian word for terns (''tara'') is the same as the word for \"pointed\"; it is easy to see how these sharp-billed fork-tailed birds came to be called thus (Tregear, 1891)</ref> though it might be better rendered in English as \"the tern\" or \"common tern\". This refers to the fact that wherever [[Polynesian seafarer]]s went on their long voyages, they usually would find these birds in astounding numbers. It is also known as ''kaveka'' in the [[Marquesas Islands]], where dishes using its eggs are a delicacy.<ref name=\"BlondBrash2006\">{{cite book|last1=Blond|first1=Becca|last2=Brash|first2=Celeste|last3=Rogers|first3=Hilary|title=Tahiti & French Polynesia.

Some recent authors further subdivide the [[Indopacific]] population into up to 8 subspecies altogether, but much of the variation is really [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]].

It is a bird of the tropical oceans, breeding on islands throughout the [[equator]]ial zone.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\nThe sooty tern was described by Linnaeus in 1766 as ''Sterna fuscata'', bearing this name for many years until the genus ''Sterna'' was split up. It is now known as ''Onychoprion fuscatus''.<ref>Bridge ''et al.'' (2005)</ref> The genus name is from [[Ancient Greek]] ''onux'', \"claw\" or \"nail\", and ''prion'', \"saw\". The specific ''fuscatus'' is [[Latin]] for \"dark\".<ref name=job>{{cite book | last= Jobling | first= James A | year= 2010| title= The Helm Dictionary of Scientific Bird Names | url= https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling | publisher= Christopher Helm | location = London | isbn = 978-1-4081-2501-4 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/Helm_Dictionary_of_Scientific_Bird_Names_by_James_A._Jobling/page/n167 167], 282}}</ref>\n\nColloquially, it is known as the wideawake tern or just wideawake. This refers to the incessant calls produced by a colony of these birds, as does the [[Hawaiian (language)|Hawaiian]] name ''\u02bbewa \u02bbewa'' which roughly means \"[[cacophony]]\".<ref>From ''\u02bbewa'', \"crooked, out of shape, imperfect\" (Pukui ''et al.'' 1992: p.17)</ref> In most of [[Polynesia]] its name is ''manutara'' or similar &ndash; literally \"tern-bird\",<ref>The Polynesian word for terns (''tara'') is the same as the word for \"pointed\"; it is easy to see how these sharp-billed fork-tailed birds came to be called thus (Tregear, 1891)</ref> though it might be better rendered in English as \"the tern\" or \"common tern\". This refers to the fact that wherever [[Polynesian seafarer]]s went on their long voyages, they usually would find these birds in astounding numbers. It is also known as ''kaveka'' in the [[Marquesas Islands]], where dishes using its eggs are a delicacy.<ref name=\"BlondBrash2006\">{{cite book|last1=Blond|first1=Becca|last2=Brash|first2=Celeste|last3=Rogers|first3=Hilary|title=Tahiti & French Polynesia.

Some recent authors further subdivide the [[Indopacific]] population into up to 8 subspecies altogether, but much of the variation is really [[cline (population genetics)|clinal]].

The average life span is 32 years.<ref>[http://www.fws.gov/midway/sote.html FWS]</ref> Juvenile sooty terns are scaly grey above and below. The sooty tern is unlikely to be confused with any tern apart from the similarly dark-backed but smaller [[bridled tern]] (''O. anaethetus'').

It has very marine habits compared to most terns; sooty terns are generally found inland only after severe [[storm]]s. The [[Field Museum]], for example, has a male specimen which was found exhausted on August 2, 1933 on the slopes of [[Mount Cameroon]] above [[Buea]], about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|ASL]], after foul weather had hit the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref>Boulton & Rand (1952)</ref> This species is a rare vagrant to western [[Europe]], although a bird was present at [[Cemlyn Bay and lagoon|Cemlyn Bay]], [[Wales]] for 11 days in July 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaelmckee.co.uk/bird_s.asp?ID=325&Region=Rarities&Year=2005|title=Sooty Tern Cemlyn Bay, Anglesey, Wales|website=michaelmckee.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIt is also not normally found on the [[Pacific]] coasts of the [[Americas]] due to its [[pelagic]] habits.
