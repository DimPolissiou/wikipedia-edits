First, the most northern part of Iloilo, Estancia, was settled. Some migrants moved to Batad, Balasan and Carles. Then, Ajuy was settled, and from there communities spread to inhabit the present Conception and San Dionisio area. In time, communities of Ajuy spread upland to populate the hamlet of Sara. The families of Sara spread to Lemery. Other families inhabited the coast of Bobog (Banate-Viejo), and traversed the mountain now called San Rafael. Some families settled near the River Jalaud. Others moved further South and settled in Irong-irong and finally stopped at Ogtong.

Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map of the Philippines showing Banate as one of the ancient towns on the island of Panay.]]\n\n====Origin of the Town's Name====\nAt the beginning of the Christianisation of Panay, Bobog was a ''visita''<ref>Cf. Sub-section ''\"The Residencia and The Visita\"'' of the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)]].</ref> of the Augustinian parish and monastery of Dumangas. Gaspar de San Agustin mentioned the existence of the town in his book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565\u20131615)''.<ref name=\"Padre San Agust\u00edn 1615 pp. 374-375\"/> Another Augustinian historian Fray Juan Fernandez, in his ''Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay'', affirms that Banate was known in the ancient times as ''Bobog'' or ''Bog-og''. The Augustinian friar says that the modern name Banate might have been derived from some flora that abundantly thrive in the town. One possibility is the ''Butacea'', named by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Murraya exotica''. If the spelling and the pronunciation are corrupted, and instead of Banate what is written or pronounced is ''Bangate'', it would therefore be the leguminous papilion\u00e1cea called in botany as ''Abrus praecatorius''.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Cf. Fr. Juan Fernandez, O.S.A, ''Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay'' in ''Monographs of the Towns of Panay'', Jose Espinosa, Jr., trans., Iloilo City: University of San Augustine, 2006, pp. ---.</ref>\n\nTo the inhabitants, the town's modern name is commonly attributed to the presence of many ''Bangate'' trees in the area. According to a local legend, when the Spaniards arrived, all the inhabitants of Banate fled away for safety. An old man, however, failed to escape because he was of advanced age and was already so weak. It was raining then. So, the old man took shelter under the ''Bangate'' tree where a Spanish officer found him later on. The white man asked the native; ''\"Come se llama esto pueblo?\"'',  The old man, uncertain what to say, merely said \"''Bangate''\" thinking that the Spaniard was asking him about the name of the tree. Unable to understand clearly what the old man mumbled, the Spaniard thought the native had said \"''Banate''\". While such legend sounds too absurd to be true, it is the only explanation often given by people when asked why their town is called Banate. Indeed, ''''Bangate'''' trees still abound within the territorial limits of the municipality.\n\n====Banate at the Beginning of the Colonial Period====\n\n''Bobog'', in the early part of its history as a Christian settlement and a Visita of Dumangas, was placed under the advocation of St. John the Evangelist.<ref>Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565\u20131615)'', Manuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas: Madrid 1975, pp. 374-375.</ref> In the early part of the 1700s, it was called \"''Banate Viejo''\" by the Spaniards. A map of the Philippines, made by the Jesuit priest Fr. Murillo Velarde and published in Manila in 1734, shows Banate Viejo among the ancient towns of the island.<ref>The ancient towns and their visitas explicitly illustrated in the map are: Arevalo, Iloilo (extends to Pavia Santa Barbara , Cabatuan and Maasin), Molo, Jaro ( stretching to current Lapaz and Leganes), Guimbal, Tigbaun, Oton, Dumangas, Anilao, Banate, Barotac (Nuevo), Ajuy Dulano, Laglag, Pase, Alimodian. Cf. Inset for Fr. Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map.</ref> The appelative \"Viejo\", which the Spaniards attached to the early hispanized name of the town, indicates the ancient origin of Banate.\n\nFr. Juan Fernandez says that Banate was formally established as a municipality in 1763. By then, it acquired as its Visita the settlement of ''Sinaba-an''.<ref name=\"Smo 1922 p. 293\">Cf. ''Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Hispano-Agustiniano y Boletin Oficial de la Provincia del Smo. Nombre de Jes\u00fas de Filipinas'', 1922: Imprenta del Monasterio de El Escorial, Vol. XVII (Enero-Junio de 1922), p. 293.</ref><ref group=note>The logical location of \"Sinabaan\" would be what is now Barotac Viejo. The fact that this town had a history of being attached to Banate, also during the American period, as well as its proximity to Banate support to this theory. Besides, Fr. Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map shows the name \"Banate Viejo\" extending also over areas where the present Barotac Viejo is located. Another possibility could be San Rafael or San Enrique. However, in Banate's history, there seems to be no reference to this old town's close interaction during the previous centuries with the other two new towns in Iloilo.</ref> In a private definitory of the Augustinian Order, on 31 October 1763, Fr. Alejandro Arias was appointed as Vicar for the town.<ref>Cf.

The houses were of simple construction, but the community had good defenses to protect itself against the frequent Moro incursions. People were engaged, however, in agriculture, which constituted their main occupation. Fishing was also a very important trade, because of the abundance of the harvest from Banate Bay. At this period, Banate and Anilao formed a single town, which was considerably important.<ref name=\"Buzeta y Felipe Bravo p. 339\">Cf.

However, it was also a natural target to invaders. In 1764, many people would leave the town because of a disastrous incursion and pillage of the Moros from Mindanao. R. P. Fray Arias, O.S.A., the town's priest who was at the same time the parish priest of Guimbal,<ref>Cf. Elviro J.

It could be noted, however, that the town had its first duly appointed Gobernadorcillo in the person of Don Felix Baviera, in 1837. Included within the territorial jurisdiction of the town of Banate during that time were Barotac Viejo and Anilao. The original site of the [[Poblacion]] of Banate was in what is now known as ''Bularan''. The small Church there, around which the town grew, was then situated near the shore. Nearby, towards the North, the town cemetery was located. For the market place, nipa and bamboo shacks were constructed near the area where the first Church used to be. During the later part of the 19th century the present [[Roman Catholic]] stone Church was constructed in the adjacent barangay which subsequently became the [[Poblacion]] or the capital of the town.<ref name=\"Juan Fernandez 2006, pp. 64\"/> \n{{multiple image\n| align = right| width =150\n| image1 =Blanco-Banate-Sulbod 1.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =Blanco-Banate-Sulbod 2.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 =\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = Decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] Antonio Blanco, dated 5 April 1850, separating the towns of Banate and Anilao from the jurisdiction of [[Barotac Nuevo]] in Iloilo ([[Philippines]]).

Agapito Lope, Augustinian, who was parish priest of the town of Banate, Province of Yloilo (Philippines) at the time of the Spanish Government declares the following: 1\u02da That time in this town of Banate, there was a parochial church of strong materials up to the tower, with zinc and galvanized iron cover; it had three naves with a transept and three altars. It had lands that could serve as an orchard and, in fact, a part of these was used for vegetables and for forage during the time when this writer held the honor of governing the said parish. They did not have any fence. These lands covered an extension of some two hundred meters long by a hundred and twenty wide, from the beach following a drain and outlet next to the house of Do\u00f1a Vicenta Baban and crossing the royal road until behind the church. The aforementioned parish house held a dozen molave harigues of extraordinary magnitude of eighty centimeters in diameter; the zinc cover. Up to the year one thousand eight hundred ninety and nine, there was a parish house by the beach made of strong materials (up to the upper floor) and wood, with Nipa roof. From this house the harigues or pillars were taken to raise the new parish house. 2\u02da There was no chapel in the neighborhoods. 3\u02da There was a fenced cemetery with a short wall about five hundred meters distant from the housing of the Poblacion, on the road that leads to the mountain near the hill called Cambang-bat\u00f3. 4\u02da That time, the church had no other known assets than those mentioned above. 5) There was above all (I say in order to inform if asked about the truth), the distinguished residents of the said town: Don Eugenio Badilla, Do\u00f1a Carmen Baban, Don Marcelo (La) Madrid, Don F.

On October 27, 1899, General Diocno informed General Delgado of the docking at Iloilo of the [[USS Concord (PG-3)|USS Concord]]. On board were 3,000 troops and 200 horses. On November 2, two American gunboats bombarded the town of Banate. On the 5th, American forces began their advance outside the frontlines toward San Miguel. Landings were made in Banate on November 25, in Capiz and Calivo in December, and in San Jose de Buenavista in January 1900. Unable to resist the American advance, the Filipino revolutionaries retreated to the mountains of Panay. Delgado retreated to the mountains of Lambunao, Diocno to the hills of Aclan, and Fullon to the vicinity of Mt. Madia-as. By July 1, 1900, the Panay defenders had opted to shift to guerrilla tactics.<ref>''Folio 886/11'', Francisco Jalandoni describes formation of the guerrilla bands in Iloilo Province, July 1, 1900, Selected Documents, ''Philippine Revolutionary Records'' (PRR), National Library.</ref><ref name=\"cids.up.edu.ph\">[https://adventuresinpowercity.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/1409-1651-1-pb.pdf Cf.

Afterwards, Benjamin Buyco also became the first Mayor of Anilao.\n\nDuring this period, a Banatenhon - [[Ludovico Arroyo Ba\u00f1as]] - was chosen as one of the ten personnel of the American government telegraph service in the Philippines to compose the first and only group of Filipino ''pensionados'' who, in 1919, underwent advanced training in wireless telegraphy (radio), at the US Naval Radio School in Cavite. The training of the ten Filipinos was made possible through a special arrangement between the U. S. Naval Authorities in the Philippines and the Insular Government. To select the trainees, a special examination was conducted among the 398 students of the Post-Telegraph School.<ref>[[:File:Filipino Telecom Pensionados 1919.jpg|''Telecom Standout'' in ''The Telecom News'', Philippines: 31 March 1959, p.2.]]</ref><ref>[[:File:Ludovico Arroyo Banas Biography.jpg|Policarpio Y.

However, if Fuentes is included, the total population would be 25,597. Banate has average annual population growth rate of 1.21% based on the population change within the years 1990\u20131995. In the year 2010, the town's population reached 29,543.\n\n=== The Natives of Banate ===\n[[File:Banate Bay, at the break of dawn.jpg|thumb|300px|Sunrise at Banate Bay.]]\n\nAs any other old Spanish town in the province of Iloilo, the natives of Banate were given surnames starting usually with the letter BA, BAL, BAS, etc. after the name of the town itself. This is also true for Barotac Viejo which was once a part of the pueblo which is why one can notice even up to the present that both towns share some families/clans with the same surnames.\n\n=== Municipal income ===\n\nBeing a very versatile town with livelihood income both coming from the sea and the farmlands, Banate has generated actual income from calendar year 1995 to calendar year 1999 reaching up to P82,167,999.30. The increase of the town's income was mainly due to the increase in revenue allotment, tax, and operating revenue of the municipality. It could be observed that Banate is increasingly growing in commerce and industry.\n\n=== Household ===\n[[File:Banate Countryside.JPG|thumb|300px|Barangay Carmelo, Banate]]\n\nThe 1995 Census of Population and Housing (which includes Fuentes) recorded a total of 4,761 households with an average household size of 6 person per household for the urban area, and 5 persons per household for the rural area. The urban area, comprising Poblacion, Alacaygan, Bularan, Carmelo, Talokgangan and Zona Sur, had a total household of 1,653. The 12 rural barangays had a total of 2,908 households with San Salvador having the highest number households (480).\n\nThe 12 barangays belonging to the rural area had a population of 15,772 or about 62% of the total population of Banate. Of the 12 barangays, San Salvador had the highest population (2,380 or 9.31%), while Fuentes, (a disputed barangay between Banate and Anilao) had the least population of only 621 persons or 4% of the rural population, since some residents considered themselves residents of Anilao.\n\n=== Population density ===\nBanate has an A & D area of 5,240.849 and a population of 25,597 as of 1995. The municipal gross density is 500 people/km\u00b2. [[Urban density]] is 1600 people/km\u00b2, of which Bularan is the highest having a density of 15,700 people/km\u00b2. In the rural area, population density is 300 people/km\u00b2. As projected, within the twelve (12) year period (1999\u20132010), the municipal gross population density will increase from 500 to 600 people/km\u00b2.\n\n=== Age-sex distribution ===\n\nOf the 25,597 (as of 1995), the male population has numbered 12,949 or 50.59% with those in the age bracket of 5 \u2013 9 years old having the highest population (1,743 or 13%). The age bracket with the lowest percentage are those with the age ranging from 85 years old and above (30 or 0.23%).On the other hand, female population has reached to 12,648 or 49.41% with those in the age range of 5 \u2013 9 years old having the highest number (1,649 or 13%). The female residents with age range of 85 and above number 48 or 0.38%. The date of the census of 1995 shows that the ratio of male and female residents is 102:100.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Inmaculada Concepcion de Banate.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] is popular among the Roman Catholics who compose the majority of the residents in Banate, as well as among the members of the Aglipayan denomination, which has a considerable number of followers in the town.]]\n\nBased on the 1990 record, the majority of the Banatenhon's are Roman Catholics (16,338 or 70%); the next religious denomination with the second highest number of adherence are the Aglipayans or the members of the Philippine Independent Church (5,057 or 22%); there are 750 Protestants who comprise 3% of the population; Iglesia ni Kristo has 203 churchgoers or 1% of the population; and members of other religious sects like United Church of Christ in the Philippines, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventist, Muslims, etc. number 1,012 or 4% of the local population.\n\n=== Statistics on marriage ===\n\nA greater percentage of the population 10 years old and over are single (49.32%) than married (45.75%). About 3.73% are widowed; 0.37% are separated; and 0.82% are common law partners and unknown. The number of unmarried persons is higher among the adult males (4,840) as compared with those who are married (4,174). Among adult females the proportion of married persons is higher (4,253 or 23.09%) than those who are unmarried (4,245 or 23.05%).\n\n=== Language ===\n\nMajority of the people living in Banate speak Hiligaynon or 99.54% and 0.46% of the population speaks other Visayan dialects. English and Tagalog are also understood and spoken, and are also used in school, business, and government day to day transactions.\n\nIt is notable that when Banatenhons speak Hiligaynon, people from other places could easily distinguish the accent, most of the time dismissing the Banatenhons as Dumangasanons. Among the towns in the surrounding area, only Banate and Dumangas speak pure Hiligaynon, as opposed to other towns whose native tongue is Kinaray-a.\n\n=== Economic dependency ratio ===\nAs of 1995, a total of 10,711 persons with ages below 15 and over 64 years old are considered dependents; 14,625 belong to the working population with ages 15\u201365 years old. Hence, there are 7 dependents out of 10 working persons.\n\n=== Labor force ===\n\nAs of 1990 the labor force numbered 13,643 persons or 57% of the total population. Of these, there are 6,747 or 49.45%  male and 6,896 or 50.55% female ranging the age 15 years old and above. Of the 13,643, 7,886 have stable employment. 5,239 of these are male and 2,647 are female. Population projection shows that from 1995 to the year 2010, the population growth rate is 1.21%. This means an additional potential work force for the municipality, which when properly exploited will generate a maximum income to the town of Banate. The labor force within the twelve (12) year period (1999\u20132010) will reach to 18,683 and 11,527 of these, will be economically active labor force (15 years old and over).\n\n==Banate-Negros Occidental Bridge==\n\nOn July 30, 2006, governors from 16 provinces of the Visayas met at the Provincial Capitol of Negros Occidental in Bacolod City to discuss the construction of bridges linking Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, and Leyte. They call these bridges the ''Trans-Visayas Friendship Bridges''. Among these bridges would be the Banate-Negros Occidental Bridge, which would link the Island of Negros to the Island of Panay.<ref>[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/12/10/PROV2006121082049.html Manila Bulletin Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Located at the spot nearest to Negros, Banate is the most logical and ideal place for the construction of the connecting bridge between the two islands of the Visayas.<ref>{{cite news |date=December 11, 2006 |title=Proposed Trans-Visayas Friendship Bridges Get RDC 6 Nod |url=http://www.thenewstoday.info/2006/12/11/proposed.trans.visayas.friendship.bridges.get.rdc6.nod.html |work=The News Today |accessdate=June 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Historical/Unique Landmarks==\n\n=== The Roman Catholic Church ===\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right| width =150\n| image1 =Carmen Baban Bell.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =Fray Arquero Bell medium.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 =Fray Arquero Bell small.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer =Bells casted by Hilario Sunico for St. John the Baptist Parish in Banate, Iloilo (Philippines) during the incumbency of the Fray Bernardo Arquero, O.S.A. as parish priest (1893-1898).

The Catholic community was established in Banate by the friars of the Augustinian Order in 1763, when Fray Alejandro Arias was assigned to in the town.<ref>Cf. Elviro Jorde Perez, ''Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas'', Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 262.</ref>\nThe present church was erected under the supervision of Fray Eustaqio Tor\u00e9s, OSA in 1870. But was left unfinished when Fray Tor\u00e9s was transferred to Barotac Nuevo, where he also built another church.<ref>Cf. Elviro Jorde Perez, ''Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas'', Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 535.</ref> This probably explains why there is no particular architectural style found in the edifice. Nevertheless, the church of Banate withstood the tests of time, from fires to the bombings of the war. Built in the shape of a Latin cross, it is one of the old churches in Iloilo, still intact and whole from the narthex to the apse and transepts unlike some churches which were either cut into half or damaged either by nature or war. It is made of corals, limestone and rocks and put together through a mixture of Apog and Eggs. The first detailed description of the church building can be found in the 1911 Report of Fray Agapito Lope, parish priest of Banate in 1893. It is also one of the widest, in terms of space, having three spacious naves all in all surpassing even that of Santa Barbara or Lambunao.<ref>[[:File:Banate-Fray Lope-1911 a.jpg|Fray Agapito Lope Manuscript 1911, p. 1.]]</ref><ref>[[:File:Banate-Fray Lope- 1911 b.jpg|Fray Agapito Lope Manuscript 1911, p. 2.]]</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right| height =200\n| image1 =Apolonia Baviera.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =Madrid-Brillantes Matrimonio.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 =\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = Sample of entries in old Canonical Books of St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church.

The ''campana mayor'' is one of the largest in the island but it is, unfortunately, broken. It is the last existing old Augustinian-built church in the north. It was built under forced-labor.

Report of R.P. Fray Bernardo Arquero, O.S.A., dated 1 January 1897, on the statistical data and historical information of the Parish of St. John the Baptist in Banate, Iloilo (Philippines).

Masses are held, in both Roman Catholic and Aglipayan Churches after which, devotees' carry in procession a decorated carroza containing the statue of the Patron saint through the main streets of the town. The townspeople cook typical delicious dishes for the guests to eat and, later in the afternoon, children as well as teenagers go to the plaza to enjoy the fun at the \"peryahan\". People would throw water to everyone roaming in the streets, as part of the celebration. In the evening, a \"search\" for Miss Banate is held in the municipal covered gymnasium, where the crowd would pack in the gym, in order to cheer for their respective candidates.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egdRjD2G5Ao Search for Miss Banate, Banate Town Fiesta 2015.

The town boasts of antique ivory religious images, which are only seen displayed during the Easter Triduum celebrations and processions. Both the Roman Catholic and the Aglipayan Communities in this town have preserved the Western and Catholic way of making the memory of the passion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ alive through the heritage received from the Spaniards, who evangelized the town for centuries. The meditation on the seven last words of Jesus and the re-enactment of his last moments on calvary attract devotees from neighboring towns on Good Fridays.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUYPNY1fPk Banate Holy Week Procession.]</ref>\n\n===Kasag Festival===\n\nFor over 17 years in the making, Kasag festival came as an offshoot of the Annual Street Dancing Competition as highlight of the Annual Town Fiesta, and the promotion of the town's famed product, the Blue Crabs  (scientific name: Portunus Pelagicus which translates to ''\u201csavory beautiful swimmer\u201d''), through as the Municipality's One Town One Product (OTOP) project. The idea of Kasag Festival as vessel of promotion and marketing of the town product sprung from the OTOP Coordinator during the OTOP presentation at Passi City,\n\nPrevious Street Dancing Competitions were held every 24th day of June, as one of the highlights of the final day of the Annual Town Fiesta honoring and thanking God through the intercession of St. John the Baptist for the fruitful year spent. However, the activities meant at integrating Kasag Festival with the Feast of [[St. John the Baptist]] proved to be such a tedious endeavor for Banatenhons, requiring much of their time and effort. Most often, this results to distractions, if not deviations, from the original essence and spirit of the religious fiesta which is about the devotion to St. John the Baptist and thanksgiving to the Almighty God.\n\nWith the implementation of the DTI's One Town One Product (OTOP), Banate identified Kasag (Blue Crab) as the prevalent and flourishing fishery based industry thus making it Banate's OTOP. Promoting the new product and incorporating the product with the festival was conceptualized by the people in charge of OTOP.\n\nWith positive response from the Local Chief Executive, all systems go for the First Kasag Festival Celebration; with \"young blood\" from the newly elected public officials and the desire to promote Banate's One Town One Product as well as Banate's Tourism Development the First Kasag Festival came into celebration in December 2007.\n\nFood Courts of various mouth-watering and native delicacies were there to give justice to the ever-craving and discriminating taste of Ilonggos. A nightly Singing contest to entertain and showcase the singing prowess of Banatenhons was staged. Daily entertaining activities like Laro ng Lahi (old Filipino games), Basketball Tournament and search for Mutya sang Kasag were organized topped by the eagerly anticipated all new Street Dancing Competition based on the idea of Kasag's preservation for future generation and Kasag's nature and thanksgiving to the bountiful season of fishing.\n\n====''Participation in Other Festivals''====\n\nSelected Kasag performers regularly compete in other festivals. Banate is represented by Tribu Kasag in the Kasadyahan portion of the [[Dinagyang Festival]] every January in Iloilo City. The Kasag festival also competes in the [[Aliwan Fiesta]] held every April in Metro Manila. Both Tribu Kasag and the Kasag Festival have won several awards, including the Kasadyahan championship trophy in 2009<ref>{{cite news |last=Garcia |first=Jennifer |date=January 26, 2009 |title=Dinagyang Festival 2009 Draws Thousands of Tourists |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/01/26/09/dinagyang-festival-2009-draws-thousands-tourists |work=ABS-CBN |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> and 2010,<ref>{{cite news |last=Jumayao |first=Glen |title=Snapshots of Kasadyahan 2010 |url=http://www.thenewstoday.info/2010/01/27/snapshots.of.kasadyahan.2010.html |work=The News Today |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> and the second runner-up trophy at the Aliwan Fiesta in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mendoza |first=E. |date=April 26, 2010 |title=Dinagyang Festival Emerged as the Aliwan 2010 Grand Champion |url=http://www.gigsilonggo.com/dinagyang-festival-emerged-as-the-aliwan-2010-grand-champion.html |website=Gigs Ilonggo |accessdate=August 22, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829091515/http://www.gigsilonggo.com/dinagyang-festival-emerged-as-the-aliwan-2010-grand-champion.html |archive-date=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''Nota Bene: History of \"Tribu Kasag\" and its antecedent Tribes.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exploreiloilo.com/photoblog/category/iloilo-province/banate/ |title=Explore Iloilo Photoblog |publisher=Exploreiloilo.com |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722223047/http://www.exploreiloilo.com/photoblog/category/iloilo-province/banate/ |archive-date=2012-07-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSince 1987, Banate has participated the well-known Kasadyahan Festival which takes place before the Iloilo City's Dinagyang Festival. Tribu Kasway has represented the town from the year 1987 to 1993. After then, from 1995 to 1999, the town changed the group's name to Tribu Hugyaw. They won 2nd Place in 1999. Tribu Panagat, the newly adapted name, was Kasadyan Festival's winning groups in the year 2000. It continued to represent the town of Banate until 2003. From 2004 to 2005, the name \"Tribu Hugyaw\" was re-adapted by the group.\n\nLater and until the present, \"Tribu Kasag\" represents Banate at the Dinagyang Festival as well as at other festivals in the Province of Iloilo and national competitions of the same kind. This current \"cultural ambassadors of Banate\" are known for their merry and lively dance which depicts the townpeople's livelihood as fishermen, and the town's famed product: \"Kasag\" or crab(s).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2saYbvzMHA Kasag Festival 2015.]</ref>\n\nAwards (of Tribu Kasag):\n\n* Kasadyahan Competition 2008 - 1st Runner-up, Best in Demonstration, Best in Choreography.\n* Kasadyahan Competition 2009 - Grand Champion, Best in Production Design, Best in Choreography, Best in Performance.\n* Aliwan Festival 2009 (National Competition)- 2nd Place.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugTQxkTT0oo |title=Aliwan 2009 - Tribu Kasag (Banate, Iloilo) |publisher=YouTube |date=26 April 2009\n|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}</ref>\n* Kasadyahan Competition 2010 - Grand Champion, Best in Performance, Best in Choreography, Best in Music, Best in Costume.\n\n====Annual AD3 Karera de Paraw & Pinta Layag Competition====\n\nA mixture of art, entertainment and skills enhancement: that is Banate's ''Karera de Paraw''.\n\nHeld every Easter Sunday of the year, the ''Karera de Paraw'' is a sailboat racing competition participated by Banatenhon fisher folks. It is a four-day activity, which includes the ''Pinta Layag'' (sail painting competition involving the out of school youths), ''Mutya sang Paraw'' (a beauty pageant competition), ''Rakustik'' (an acoustical jam competition), and capped by the ''Karera de Paraw'' on the fourth and final day.\n\nIt aims to help boost Banate tourism together with Kasag Festival, to encourage the artistic ability of Banatenhon youth through the sail painting competition, and to give a good and fun-filled break for the fisherfolks while aiming to bag home prizes.\n\nOriginally conceived and financed by Alfonso \"Nonong\" Delicana III, the Annual AD3 Karera de Paraw & Pinta Layag competition is now on its 4th year. However, the expanding scope and number of activities of the event encourage at this point the involvement and participation also of supporters in and outside Banate.

First, the most northern part of Iloilo, Estancia, was settled. Some migrants moved to Batad, Balasan and Carles. Then, Ajuy was settled, and from there communities spread to inhabit the present Conception and San Dionisio area. In time, communities of Ajuy spread upland to populate the hamlet of Sara. The families of Sara spread to Lemery. Other families inhabited the coast of Bobog (Banate-Viejo), and traversed the mountain now called San Rafael. Some families settled near the River Jalaud. Others moved further South and settled in Irong-irong and finally stopped at Ogtong. These independent coastal settlements were engaged in fishing, and settled near rivers.<ref name=rci/>\n\nThe [[Maragtas]] of Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro mentions that the area near the Alakaygan River was among the first areas to be exploited by the early Malay settlers for agriculture. In these places they cultivated the land, planting ''kauayan, mabulo, hidiok, bagtikan, sibukao, buri, niog, kulo, kalamansi, paray, batad, kahangkugui'' and other seed, which they brought from Borneo.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015034052020;view=1up;seq=39 Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro, Maragtas.

It is a delicacy that can be found only in Banate.\n\n===Banate during the Spanish Regime===\n[[File:1774 map of the Philippine Islands.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Fr. Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map of the Philippines showing Banate as one of the ancient towns on the island of Panay.]]\n\n====Origin of the Town's Name====\nAt the beginning of the Christianisation of Panay, Bobog was a ''visita''<ref>Cf. Sub-section ''\"The Residencia and The Visita\"'' of the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)]].</ref> of the Augustinian parish and monastery of Dumangas. Gaspar de San Agustin mentioned the existence of the town in his book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565\u20131615)''.<ref name=\"Padre San Agust\u00edn 1615 pp. 374-375\"/> Another Augustinian historian Fray Juan Fernandez, in his ''Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay'', affirms that Banate was known in the ancient times as ''Bobog'' or ''Bog-og''. The Augustinian friar says that the modern name Banate might have been derived from some flora that abundantly thrive in the town. One possibility is the ''Butacea'', named by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Murraya exotica''. If the spelling and the pronunciation are corrupted, and instead of Banate what is written or pronounced is ''Bangate'', it would therefore be the leguminous papilion\u00e1cea called in botany as ''Abrus praecatorius''.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Cf. Fr. Juan Fernandez, O.S.A, ''Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay'' in ''Monographs of the Towns of Panay'', Jose Espinosa, Jr., trans., Iloilo City: University of San Augustine, 2006, pp. ---.</ref>\n\nTo the inhabitants, the town's modern name is commonly attributed to the presence of many ''Bangate'' trees in the area. According to a local legend, when the Spaniards arrived, all the inhabitants of Banate fled away for safety. An old man, however, failed to escape because he was of advanced age and was already so weak. It was raining then. So, the old man took shelter under the ''Bangate'' tree where a Spanish officer found him later on. The white man asked the native; ''\"Come se llama esto pueblo?\"'',  The old man, uncertain what to say, merely said \"''Bangate''\" thinking that the Spaniard was asking him about the name of the tree. Unable to understand clearly what the old man mumbled, the Spaniard thought the native had said \"''Banate''\". While such legend sounds too absurd to be true, it is the only explanation often given by people when asked why their town is called Banate. Indeed, ''''Bangate'''' trees still abound within the territorial limits of the municipality.\n\n====Banate at the Beginning of the Colonial Period====\n\n''Bobog'', in the early part of its history as a Christian settlement and a Visita of Dumangas, was placed under the advocation of St. John the Evangelist.<ref>Gaspar de San Agustin, O.S.A., ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas (1565\u20131615)'', Manuel Merino, O.S.A., ed., Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas: Madrid 1975, pp. 374-375.</ref> In the early part of the 1700s, it was called \"''Banate Viejo''\" by the Spaniards. A map of the Philippines, made by the Jesuit priest Fr. Murillo Velarde and published in Manila in 1734, shows Banate Viejo among the ancient towns of the island.<ref>The ancient towns and their visitas explicitly illustrated in the map are: Arevalo, Iloilo (extends to Pavia Santa Barbara , Cabatuan and Maasin), Molo, Jaro ( stretching to current Lapaz and Leganes), Guimbal, Tigbaun, Oton, Dumangas, Anilao, Banate, Barotac (Nuevo), Ajuy Dulano, Laglag, Pase, Alimodian. Cf. Inset for Fr. Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map.</ref> The appelative \"Viejo\", which the Spaniards attached to the early hispanized name of the town, indicates the ancient origin of Banate.\n\nFr. Juan Fernandez says that Banate was formally established as a municipality in 1763. By then, it acquired as its Visita the settlement of ''Sinaba-an''.<ref name=\"Smo 1922 p. 293\">Cf. ''Archivo Hist\u00f3rico Hispano-Agustiniano y Boletin Oficial de la Provincia del Smo. Nombre de Jes\u00fas de Filipinas'', 1922: Imprenta del Monasterio de El Escorial, Vol. XVII (Enero-Junio de 1922), p. 293.</ref><ref group=note>The logical location of \"Sinabaan\" would be what is now Barotac Viejo. The fact that this town had a history of being attached to Banate, also during the American period, as well as its proximity to Banate support to this theory. Besides, Fr. Murillo Velarde's 1734 Map shows the name \"Banate Viejo\" extending also over areas where the present Barotac Viejo is located. Another possibility could be San Rafael or San Enrique. However, in Banate's history, there seems to be no reference to this old town's close interaction during the previous centuries with the other two new towns in Iloilo.</ref> In a private definitory of the Augustinian Order, on 31 October 1763, Fr. Alejandro Arias was appointed as Vicar for the town.<ref>Cf. ''Libro de Gobierno de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jes\u00fas de Filipinas'', Augustinian Archives in Valladolid and Madrid, Spain, VI, fol. 75v.</ref><ref name=\"Juan Fernandez 2006, pp. 64\">Cf.

The houses were of simple construction, but the community had good defenses to protect itself against the frequent Moro incursions. People were engaged, however, in agriculture, which constituted their main occupation. Fishing was also a very important trade, because of the abundance of the harvest from Banate Bay. At this period, Banate and Anilao formed a single town, which was considerably important.<ref name=\"Buzeta y Felipe Bravo p. 339\">Cf. Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo, ''Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de las Islas Filipinas'', Madrid : [s.n.], 1850-1851 (Imprenta de Jos\u00e9 C. de la Pe\u00f1a), Vol. I, p. 339.</ref>\n\nBeing a coastal village with a rich fishing ground, Banate is naturally inclined to flourish. However, it was also a natural target to invaders. In 1764, many people would leave the town because of a disastrous incursion and pillage of the Moros from Mindanao. R. P. Fray Arias, O.S.A., the town's priest who was at the same time the parish priest of Guimbal,<ref>Cf. Elviro J. Perez, ''Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas'', Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 262.</ref> was escaping this raid when he was captured by Moro pirates in that year at the Port of Tayabas.

It later became a Visita with its own ''teniente de justicia'',  dependent to [[Barotac Nuevo]] for its civil and ecclesiastical government until 1843,<ref>Manuel Buzeta y Felipe Bravo, ''Diccionario geografico, estadistico, historico de las Islas Filipinas'', Madrid: 1850, Vol. I, p. 339.</ref>  when it was declared independent again.<ref name=\"Juan Fernandez 2006, p. 64\"/>\n\n====Erection as a Town and Parish====\n\nThere is no extant document or act of legislation recording the date of the formal reestablishment of Banate as a municipality in the year 1843. It could be noted, however, that the town had its first duly appointed Gobernadorcillo in the person of Don Felix Baviera, in 1837. Included within the territorial jurisdiction of the town of Banate during that time were Barotac Viejo and Anilao. The original site of the [[Poblacion]] of Banate was in what is now known as ''Bularan''. The small Church there, around which the town grew, was then situated near the shore. Nearby, towards the North, the town cemetery was located. For the market place, nipa and bamboo shacks were constructed near the area where the first Church used to be. During the later part of the 19th century the present [[Roman Catholic]] stone Church was constructed in the adjacent barangay which subsequently became the [[Poblacion]] or the capital of the town.<ref name=\"Juan Fernandez 2006, pp. 64\"/> \n{{multiple image\n| align = right| width =150\n| image1 =Blanco-Banate-Sulbod 1.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =Blanco-Banate-Sulbod 2.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 =\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = Decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] Antonio Blanco, dated 5 April 1850, separating the towns of Banate and Anilao from the jurisdiction of [[Barotac Nuevo]] in Iloilo ([[Philippines]]).

Agapito Lope, Augustinian, who was parish priest of the town of Banate, Province of Yloilo (Philippines) at the time of the Spanish Government declares the following: 1\u02da That time in this town of Banate, there was a parochial church of strong materials up to the tower, with zinc and galvanized iron cover; it had three naves with a transept and three altars. It had lands that could serve as an orchard and, in fact, a part of these was used for vegetables and for forage during the time when this writer held the honor of governing the said parish. They did not have any fence. These lands covered an extension of some two hundred meters long by a hundred and twenty wide, from the beach following a drain and outlet next to the house of Do\u00f1a Vicenta Baban and crossing the royal road until behind the church. The aforementioned parish house held a dozen molave harigues of extraordinary magnitude of eighty centimeters in diameter; the zinc cover. Up to the year one thousand eight hundred ninety and nine, there was a parish house by the beach made of strong materials (up to the upper floor) and wood, with Nipa roof. From this house the harigues or pillars were taken to raise the new parish house. 2\u02da There was no chapel in the neighborhoods. 3\u02da There was a fenced cemetery with a short wall about five hundred meters distant from the housing of the Poblacion, on the road that leads to the mountain near the hill called Cambang-bat\u00f3. 4\u02da That time, the church had no other known assets than those mentioned above. 5) There was above all (I say in order to inform if asked about the truth), the distinguished residents of the said town: Don Eugenio Badilla, Do\u00f1a Carmen Baban, Don Marcelo (La) Madrid, Don F. Villaluz, Do\u00f1a Nicolasa Badilla, Do\u00f1a Apolonia Baban. And in truth I sign in Cornago, on August 4, 1911. Fr.

In the colonial Philippine context, this phrase refers to the [[Principal\u00eda]].

However, as regards his memory of the names of distinguished town residents, the Report shows that he was beginning to forget certain details of information: He wrote the surname of Don Marcelo Madrid as \"Lamadrid\". He also forgot the first name of Don Florencio Villaluz, simply writing \"D. F. Villaluz\".

On October 27, 1899, General Diocno informed General Delgado of the docking at Iloilo of the [[USS Concord (PG-3)|USS Concord]]. On board were 3,000 troops and 200 horses. On November 2, two American gunboats bombarded the town of Banate. On the 5th, American forces began their advance outside the frontlines toward San Miguel. Landings were made in Banate on November 25, in Capiz and Calivo in December, and in San Jose de Buenavista in January 1900. Unable to resist the American advance, the Filipino revolutionaries retreated to the mountains of Panay. Delgado retreated to the mountains of Lambunao, Diocno to the hills of Aclan, and Fullon to the vicinity of Mt. Madia-as. By July 1, 1900, the Panay defenders had opted to shift to guerrilla tactics.<ref>''Folio 886/11'', Francisco Jalandoni describes formation of the guerrilla bands in Iloilo Province, July 1, 1900, Selected Documents, ''Philippine Revolutionary Records'' (PRR), National Library.</ref><ref name=\"cids.up.edu.ph\">[https://adventuresinpowercity.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/1409-1651-1-pb.pdf Cf.

In February, Delgado surrendered to the Americans. On March 1, Fullon followed suit, and on March 21, Diocno signed the Paz de Aclan. Colonel Salas continued the fight until October.<ref name=\"cids.up.edu.ph\"/>\n\nWhen the American rule was established, the town's population was 6,250 (2973 males and 3277 females).<ref>''Annual report of the Philippine Commission / Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department to the President of the United States'', Washington D.C.: 1901, Vol. I, p. 587.

The Administrative Act No. 2657 of the [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands]], dated 31 December 1916, shows Banate as one of the 24 Municipalities in Iloilo,<ref>''The Province of Iloilo consists of territory on the southeastern part of the Island of Panay and includes the Island of Guimaras and other adjacent islands.

On that occasion, the majority of the town Officials of Banate were Barotacnons. As a consequence, there came about a succession of appointed Presidents in Banate, until the time of the next election.<ref group=note>This section was transferred from what was before the introductory part for the section about the Presidents of Banate during the American Regime.</ref> During the term of Benjamin Buyco as President of the town (1936\u20131939), Anilao was separated from Banate. Afterwards, Benjamin Buyco also became the first Mayor of Anilao.\n\nDuring this period, a Banatenhon - [[Ludovico Arroyo Ba\u00f1as]] - was chosen as one of the ten personnel of the American government telegraph service in the Philippines to compose the first and only group of Filipino ''pensionados'' who, in 1919, underwent advanced training in wireless telegraphy (radio), at the US Naval Radio School in Cavite. The training of the ten Filipinos was made possible through a special arrangement between the U. S. Naval Authorities in the Philippines and the Insular Government. To select the trainees, a special examination was conducted among the 398 students of the Post-Telegraph School.<ref>[[:File:Filipino Telecom Pensionados 1919.jpg|''Telecom Standout'' in ''The Telecom News'', Philippines: 31 March 1959, p.2.]]</ref><ref>[[:File:Ludovico Arroyo Banas Biography.jpg|Policarpio Y.

However, if Fuentes is included, the total population would be 25,597. Banate has average annual population growth rate of 1.21% based on the population change within the years 1990\u20131995. In the year 2010, the town's population reached 29,543.\n\n=== The Natives of Banate ===\n[[File:Banate Bay, at the break of dawn.jpg|thumb|300px|Sunrise at Banate Bay.]]\n\nAs any other old Spanish town in the province of Iloilo, the natives of Banate were given surnames starting usually with the letter BA, BAL, BAS, etc. after the name of the town itself. This is also true for Barotac Viejo which was once a part of the pueblo which is why one can notice even up to the present that both towns share some families/clans with the same surnames.\n\n=== Municipal income ===\n\nBeing a very versatile town with livelihood income both coming from the sea and the farmlands, Banate has generated actual income from calendar year 1995 to calendar year 1999 reaching up to P82,167,999.30. The increase of the town's income was mainly due to the increase in revenue allotment, tax, and operating revenue of the municipality. It could be observed that Banate is increasingly growing in commerce and industry.\n\n=== Household ===\n[[File:Banate Countryside.JPG|thumb|300px|Barangay Carmelo, Banate]]\n\nThe 1995 Census of Population and Housing (which includes Fuentes) recorded a total of 4,761 households with an average household size of 6 person per household for the urban area, and 5 persons per household for the rural area. The urban area, comprising Poblacion, Alacaygan, Bularan, Carmelo, Talokgangan and Zona Sur, had a total household of 1,653. The 12 rural barangays had a total of 2,908 households with San Salvador having the highest number households (480).\n\nThe 12 barangays belonging to the rural area had a population of 15,772 or about 62% of the total population of Banate. Of the 12 barangays, San Salvador had the highest population (2,380 or 9.31%), while Fuentes, (a disputed barangay between Banate and Anilao) had the least population of only 621 persons or 4% of the rural population, since some residents considered themselves residents of Anilao.\n\n=== Population density ===\nBanate has an A & D area of 5,240.849 and a population of 25,597 as of 1995. The municipal gross density is 500 people/km\u00b2. [[Urban density]] is 1600 people/km\u00b2, of which Bularan is the highest having a density of 15,700 people/km\u00b2. In the rural area, population density is 300 people/km\u00b2. As projected, within the twelve (12) year period (1999\u20132010), the municipal gross population density will increase from 500 to 600 people/km\u00b2.\n\n=== Age-sex distribution ===\n\nOf the 25,597 (as of 1995), the male population has numbered 12,949 or 50.59% with those in the age bracket of 5 \u2013 9 years old having the highest population (1,743 or 13%). The age bracket with the lowest percentage are those with the age ranging from 85 years old and above (30 or 0.23%).On the other hand, female population has reached to 12,648 or 49.41% with those in the age range of 5 \u2013 9 years old having the highest number (1,649 or 13%). The female residents with age range of 85 and above number 48 or 0.38%. The date of the census of 1995 shows that the ratio of male and female residents is 102:100.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Inmaculada Concepcion de Banate.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] is popular among the Roman Catholics who compose the majority of the residents in Banate, as well as among the members of the Aglipayan denomination, which has a considerable number of followers in the town.]]\n\nBased on the 1990 record, the majority of the Banatenhon's are Roman Catholics (16,338 or 70%); the next religious denomination with the second highest number of adherence are the Aglipayans or the members of the Philippine Independent Church (5,057 or 22%); there are 750 Protestants who comprise 3% of the population; Iglesia ni Kristo has 203 churchgoers or 1% of the population; and members of other religious sects like United Church of Christ in the Philippines, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventist, Muslims, etc. number 1,012 or 4% of the local population.\n\n=== Statistics on marriage ===\n\nA greater percentage of the population 10 years old and over are single (49.32%) than married (45.75%). About 3.73% are widowed; 0.37% are separated; and 0.82% are common law partners and unknown. The number of unmarried persons is higher among the adult males (4,840) as compared with those who are married (4,174). Among adult females the proportion of married persons is higher (4,253 or 23.09%) than those who are unmarried (4,245 or 23.05%).\n\n=== Language ===\n\nMajority of the people living in Banate speak Hiligaynon or 99.54% and 0.46% of the population speaks other Visayan dialects. English and Tagalog are also understood and spoken, and are also used in school, business, and government day to day transactions.\n\nIt is notable that when Banatenhons speak Hiligaynon, people from other places could easily distinguish the accent, most of the time dismissing the Banatenhons as Dumangasanons. Among the towns in the surrounding area, only Banate and Dumangas speak pure Hiligaynon, as opposed to other towns whose native tongue is Kinaray-a.\n\n=== Economic dependency ratio ===\nAs of 1995, a total of 10,711 persons with ages below 15 and over 64 years old are considered dependents; 14,625 belong to the working population with ages 15\u201365 years old. Hence, there are 7 dependents out of 10 working persons.\n\n=== Labor force ===\n\nAs of 1990 the labor force numbered 13,643 persons or 57% of the total population. Of these, there are 6,747 or 49.45%  male and 6,896 or 50.55% female ranging the age 15 years old and above. Of the 13,643, 7,886 have stable employment. 5,239 of these are male and 2,647 are female. Population projection shows that from 1995 to the year 2010, the population growth rate is 1.21%. This means an additional potential work force for the municipality, which when properly exploited will generate a maximum income to the town of Banate.

Elviro Jorde Perez, ''Catalogo Bio-Bibliografico de los religiosos Agustinianos de la Provincia del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas'', Manila: Colegio de Santo Tomas, 1901, p. 535.</ref> This probably explains why there is no particular architectural style found in the edifice. Nevertheless, the church of Banate withstood the tests of time, from fires to the bombings of the war. Built in the shape of a Latin cross, it is one of the old churches in Iloilo, still intact and whole from the narthex to the apse and transepts unlike some churches which were either cut into half or damaged either by nature or war. It is made of corals, limestone and rocks and put together through a mixture of Apog and Eggs. The first detailed description of the church building can be found in the 1911 Report of Fray Agapito Lope, parish priest of Banate in 1893. It is also one of the widest, in terms of space, having three spacious naves all in all surpassing even that of Santa Barbara or Lambunao.<ref>[[:File:Banate-Fray Lope-1911 a.jpg|Fray Agapito Lope Manuscript 1911, p. 1.]]</ref><ref>[[:File:Banate-Fray Lope- 1911 b.jpg|Fray Agapito Lope Manuscript 1911, p. 2.]]</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right| height =200\n| image1 =Apolonia Baviera.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =Madrid-Brillantes Matrimonio.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 =\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| footer = Sample of entries in old Canonical Books of St. John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church.

Masses are held, in both Roman Catholic and Aglipayan Churches after which, devotees' carry in procession a decorated carroza containing the statue of the Patron saint through the main streets of the town. The townspeople cook typical delicious dishes for the guests to eat and, later in the afternoon, children as well as teenagers go to the plaza to enjoy the fun at the \"peryahan\". People would throw water to everyone roaming in the streets, as part of the celebration. In the evening, a \"search\" for Miss Banate is held in the municipal covered gymnasium, where the crowd would pack in the gym, in order to cheer for their respective candidates.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egdRjD2G5Ao Search for Miss Banate, Banate Town Fiesta 2015.

The town boasts of antique ivory religious images, which are only seen displayed during the Easter Triduum celebrations and processions. Both the Roman Catholic and the Aglipayan Communities in this town have preserved the Western and Catholic way of making the memory of the passion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ alive through the heritage received from the Spaniards, who evangelized the town for centuries. The meditation on the seven last words of Jesus and the re-enactment of his last moments on calvary attract devotees from neighboring towns on Good Fridays.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUYPNY1fPk Banate Holy Week Procession.]</ref>\n\n===Kasag Festival===\n\nFor over 17 years in the making, Kasag festival came as an offshoot of the Annual Street Dancing Competition as highlight of the Annual Town Fiesta, and the promotion of the town's famed product, the Blue Crabs  (scientific name: Portunus Pelagicus which translates to ''\u201csavory beautiful swimmer\u201d''), through as the Municipality's One Town One Product (OTOP) project. The idea of Kasag Festival as vessel of promotion and marketing of the town product sprung from the OTOP Coordinator during the OTOP presentation at Passi City,\n\nPrevious Street Dancing Competitions were held every 24th day of June, as one of the highlights of the final day of the Annual Town Fiesta honoring and thanking God through the intercession of St. John the Baptist for the fruitful year spent. However, the activities meant at integrating Kasag Festival with the Feast of [[St. John the Baptist]] proved to be such a tedious endeavor for Banatenhons, requiring much of their time and effort. Most often, this results to distractions, if not deviations, from the original essence and spirit of the religious fiesta which is about the devotion to St. John the Baptist and thanksgiving to the Almighty God.\n\nWith the implementation of the DTI's One Town One Product (OTOP), Banate identified Kasag (Blue Crab) as the prevalent and flourishing fishery based industry thus making it Banate's OTOP. Promoting the new product and incorporating the product with the festival was conceptualized by the people in charge of OTOP.\n\nWith positive response from the Local Chief Executive, all systems go for the First Kasag Festival Celebration; with \"young blood\" from the newly elected public officials and the desire to promote Banate's One Town One Product as well as Banate's Tourism Development the First Kasag Festival came into celebration in December 2007.\n\nFood Courts of various mouth-watering and native delicacies were there to give justice to the ever-craving and discriminating taste of Ilonggos. A nightly Singing contest to entertain and showcase the singing prowess of Banatenhons was staged. Daily entertaining activities like Laro ng Lahi (old Filipino games), Basketball Tournament and search for Mutya sang Kasag were organized topped by the eagerly anticipated all new Street Dancing Competition based on the idea of Kasag's preservation for future generation and Kasag's nature and thanksgiving to the bountiful season of fishing.\n\n====''Participation in Other Festivals''====\n\nSelected Kasag performers regularly compete in other festivals. Banate is represented by Tribu Kasag in the Kasadyahan portion of the [[Dinagyang Festival]] every January in Iloilo City. The Kasag festival also competes in the [[Aliwan Fiesta]] held every April in Metro Manila.

He fought against and gained numerous victories over the [[Moors|Muslims of al-Andalus]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alphonso|display=Alphonso s.v. Alphonso III.|volume=1|page=734}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first year of his reign, he had to contend with a usurper, Count [[Froila (usurper)|Fruela of Galicia]]. He was forced flee to [[County of Castile|Castile]], but after a few months Fruela was assassinated and Alfonso returned to [[Oviedo]].\n\nHe defeated a [[Basque people|Basque]] rebellion in 867 and, much later, a Galician one as well. He conquered [[Oporto]] and [[Coimbra]] in 868 and 878 respectively. In about 869, he formed an alliance with the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], and solidified this link by marrying Jimena, who is thought to have been daughter of king [[Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez of Pamplona|Garc\u00eda \u00cd\u00f1iguez]], or less likely, a member of the [[Jim\u00e9nez dynasty]], and also married his sister [[Leodegundia]] to a prince of Pamplona.\n\n===In the Reconquista===\nThe following year, 867, Alfonso had to attend to an uprising in the eastern part of the kingdom, in Alava, according to the Chronicle of Albeda. According to the Chronicle of Sampiro, the revolt was led by Count Eylo. Sampiro describes these events as follows:\n\n{{cita| A messenger arrived from \u00c1lava, announcing that their hearts had inflated against the king: hearing that, the monarch decided to march there.  Driven by the fear of their arrival, they quickly recognized their obligations and supplicants, lowered their heads before him and promised that they would remain faithful to his kingdom and authority, and that they would do what was commanded.  In this way he submitted to his power an Alava lying before him, and Eylo, who presented himself as his count, brought him to Oviedo loaded with iron. {{Harvp|Mart\u00ednez D\u00edez|2005|p=220}}}}\n\nHis father, Ordo\u00f1o, had begun the repopulation of the border territories and Alfonso continued with it.  His first successes were in Portuguese lands, where King Alfonso's troops succeeded in locating the southwestern frontier on the Mondego river.  Count [[Vimara Peres|Vimara Perez]] in 868 conquered Oporto and repopulated the district. In 878, the army of King Alfonso III, with Count Hermenegildo Guti\u00e9rrez in command, faced the Muslim forces led by the emir of Cordoba, Mohammad I, who had started an attack against Oporto. After defeating the emir's forces and expelling the Muslim inhabitants of Coimbra and Oporto, Guti\u00e9rrez' Christian troops occupied and repopulated other cities, such as Braga, Viseo and Lamego, with men taken from Galicia. Coimbra, Lamego and Viseo were conquered again in 987 by Almanzor and it was not until 1064 when they were finally reconquered by King Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n.\n\nAlfonso III had to face the offensive of the Umayyad prince al-Mundir, son of Mohamed I. Fighting occurred almost constantly between 875 and 883. The first Umayyad raids were aimed at Le\u00f3n and El Bierzo, but failed.  The Christian counteroffensive ended with the taking of Deza and Atienza.\n\nAbd al-Rahman ibn Marwan, the Galician, Lord of M\u00e9rida and rebel against the Emir of C\u00f3rdoba, sent him to ingratiate himself with him to the Minister of this, Hashim ibn Abd al-Aziz.{{clarify|date=March 2020}} Accordingly, in 878, Al-Mundir  directed his armies back to Leon and Astorga, while Salid ben Ganim reached the \u00d3rbigo.  Alfonso, hoping to prevent the union of both armies, went out to meet the second, which he defeated in the battle of Polvoraria, at the confluence of the \u00d3rbigo and Esla rivers.  Al-Mundir then withdrew, but Alfonso III intercepted him in the valley of Valdemora, where he defeated him.  Mohamed was forced to pay ransom and sign a three-year truce, the first time that C\u00f3rdoba had asked for peace.\n\nBoth kings considered the truce as a pause while preparing for the next assault: Mohamed raised a fleet to attack Galicia, but it was destroyed by a storm. Alfonso and Ibn Marwan descended through the Tagus Valley and defeated the Cordovan army on Mount Oxifer, next to the Guadiana River.\n\nAs revenge, Mohamed attacked the kingdom of Zaragoza in 882, where Alfonso had sent his son Ordo\u00f1o to be educated with the Banu Qasi, sons of Musa, advancing through the ancient Roman road to Leon.  There was an exchange of prisoners and the Cordovans withdrew.  They repeated the campaign in 883 with the same result.  In 884 Mohamed I and Alfonso III signed a peace, since both began to have serious internal problems.  The great king was met with a rising led by his brothers Fruela, Odoario and Bermudo, who became strong in Astorga, supported by several counts, but were quickly defeated and executed.  In 901 the Umayyad rebel Ibn al-Qitt proclaimed Mahdi, preached holy war and attacked Zamora - \"rebuilt and repopulated by Mozarabic Toledo [...] the most important advanced square of the Asturian kingdom\" - which he was able to resist.  The messianic leader, abandoned by his own, was defeated and killed in battle on what is known as the Day of Zamora. In those years, the emirate of Cordoba, wracked by civil disorder, stopped disturbing the kingdom of Asturias. Alonso faced off against his former allies in M\u00e9rida and the Ebro valley: allied with the Count of Pallars, he instigated a coup that managed to defeat the Banu Qasi and install a Navarrese, Sancho Garc\u00e9s I, on the throne of Pamplona.\n\nHe ordered the creation of three chronicles which presented the theory that the kingdom of Asturias was the rightful successor of the old [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom. He was also a patron of the arts, like his grandfather before him. He built the [[church of Santo Adriano de Tu\u00f1\u00f3n]]. According to a letter of disputed authenticity dated to 906, the ''[[Epistola Adefonsi Hispaniae regis]]'', Alfonso arranged to purchase an \"imperial crown\" from the [[cathedral of Tours]].<ref>[[R. A. Fletcher]], ''Saint James's Catapult: The Life and Times of Diego Gelm\u00edrez of Santiago de Compostela'' (Oxford, 1984), 317\u201323.</ref>\n\nIn 909, Alfonso relocated the seat of his government to Oviedo.  According to [[Sampiro]], his sons ([[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n|Garc\u00eda]], [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o]], Gonzalo, [[Fruela II of Le\u00f3n|Fruela]] and Ramiro) conspired against him, under the influence of Garc\u00eda's father-in-law.  Alfonso had Garc\u00eda imprisoned but the conspirators were able to free him and he fled to Boiges.  However, Alfonso later convinced Garc\u00eda to join him in a campaign against the Moors.  Alfonso died in Zamora of natural causes in 910, having reigned for 44 years.  [[Ibn Hayyan]] likewise tells of an uprising, but says that Alfonso himself was imprisoned.  Following his death, the kingdom was divided amongst his sons: his eldest son, Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n; the second son, Ordo\u00f1o, reigned in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]; and Fruela received [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] with Oviedo as his capital. These lands would be reunited when Garc\u00eda died childless and Le\u00f3n passed to Ordo\u00f1o, while on Ordo\u00f1o's death the lands were reunited under Fruela. However, Fruela's death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century.\n\n==Culture==\n# He convened the second Oviedo Council in 893.\n# He ordered the elaboration of the Cross of Victory, which is included in the current flag of Asturias, which has become a symbol of the Principality.  The jewel was made by goldsmiths from the Frankish kingdom.  It ordered its elaboration at the beginning of the tenth century, as a donation to the Cathedral of San Salvador.  Today it is kept in the Holy Chamber of the Cathedral of Oviedo and a copy hangs on the bridge of Cangas de On\u00eds\n# The discovery of the sepulcher of Santiago makes Compostela the second apostolic seat after Rome, with authority over clerics from other Christian counties and counties.  Santiago becomes a destination for pilgrims, true transmitters of culture.\n# With respect to the Asturian art, during the reign of Alfonso III the Great is given the so-called \u00abpost-Tramuntana stage\u00bb of Asturian pre-Romanesque architecture, with buildings of the importance of San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s, Santo Adriano de Tu\u00f1\u00f3n and the basilica of Santiago de Compostela  .\n# He ordered the writing of three chronicles in which he remakes history presenting the kingdom of Asturias as the heir of the Visigothic kingdom:\n::* The Albeldense Chronicle (c.881).\n::* The prophetic Chronicle.

According to [[Sampiro]], his sons ([[Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n|Garc\u00eda]], [[Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n|Ordo\u00f1o]], Gonzalo, [[Fruela II of Le\u00f3n|Fruela]] and Ramiro) conspired against him, under the influence of Garc\u00eda's father-in-law.  Alfonso had Garc\u00eda imprisoned but they were able to eject him and he fled to Boiges.  However, he returned and convinced Garc\u00eda to join him in a campaign against the Moors.  Alfonso died in Zamora of natural causes in 910, having reigned for 44 years.  [[Ibn Hayyan]] likewise tells of an uprising, but says that Alfonso himself had been imprisoned.  Following his death there was a partition of his realm: his eldest son, Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n. The second son, Ordo\u00f1o, reigned in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], while Fruela, received [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] with Oviedo as his capital. These lands would be reunited when Garc\u00eda died childless and Le\u00f3n passed to Ordo\u00f1o, while on his death the lands were reunited under Fruela. However, Fruela's death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century.\n\n==Culture==\n# He convened the second Oviedo Council in 893.\n# He ordered the elaboration of the Cross of Victory, which is included in the current flag of Asturias, which has become a symbol of the Principality.  The jewel was made by goldsmiths from the Frankish kingdom.  It ordered its elaboration at the beginning of the tenth century, as a donation to the Cathedral of San Salvador.  Today it is kept in the Holy Chamber of the Cathedral of Oviedo and a copy hangs on the bridge of Cangas de On\u00eds\n# The discovery of the sepulcher of Santiago makes Compostela the second apostolic seat after Rome, with authority over clerics from other Christian counties and counties.  Santiago becomes a destination for pilgrims, true transmitters of culture.\n# With respect to the Asturian art, during the reign of Alfonso III the Great is given the so-called \u00abpost-Tramuntana stage\u00bb of Asturian pre-Romanesque architecture, with buildings of the importance of San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s, Santo Adriano de Tu\u00f1\u00f3n and the basilica of Santiago de Compostela  .\n# He ordered the writing of three chronicles in which he remakes history presenting the kingdom of Asturias as the heir of the Visigothic kingdom:\n::* The Albeldense Chronicle (c.881).\n::* The prophetic Chronicle.

True Sam Tarry, a Corbyn supporter was backed by Momentum. But Athwal was the favourite, until Labour announced it had received \u201cextremely serious allegations\" and suspended him.\n\nLocal Labour members were outraged. Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, said \"suspension of the local frontrunner just 15 hours before the vote is politically motivated and biased in order to stitch up the selection\". Labour insisted it was behaving properly, and perhaps unsurprisingly Sam Tarry decided that suspending his rival and guaranteeing his victory was \u201cabsolutely the right thing to do\u201d\n\nCareer left in ruins\nAthwal\u2019s reputation had been trashed and career left in ruins. Labour revealed he had been referred to its \u201cSexual Harassment Panel\u201d as if he were an East London Harvey Weinstein. And then nothing until Athwal and his lawyers at Mishcon de Reya began to dig.\n\nLabour has not named the complainant or said anything about the case. But Athwal had no difficulty identifying him as former councillor Aziz Chowdhury. In 2014 Chowdhury accused Athwal of corruption, then admitted the charge was false, and later denied any knowledge of making the accusation. When Chowdhury failed a selection interview for councillors in 2017 he threatened to sue Labour unless it changed its mind. Alternatively he would accept a \u00a320,000 payment. In 2018 he accused Roy Emmett ,a Redbridge councillor, of bullying him, an allegation that was again dismissed.\n\nIn short Mishcon alleged Labour had believed a \u201cknown serial, vexatious accuser, who has an axe to grind against our client\u201d. To make matters worse, Mischon alleged three members of the panel that suspended Athwal, were \u201cfriends or supporters of Sam Tarry\u201d. One was Momentum\u2019s Jon Lansman, who was also involved in bringing down Sally Gimson, the Labour candidate is Bassetlaw (see Eyes passim) to clear the way for a Unite-backed nominee.\n\nWell worth investigating\nIf it truly believed Athwal were a sex pest, why hadn\u2019t Labour reported him to the police or Redbridge Council? Why, indeed had Labour not moved speedily to decide if the complaints were in fact true. Labour said that it was \u201ctaking steps to progress the case\u201d and claimed that Lansman would not have known he was doing Tarry a favour because the case had been \u2018anonymised\u201d Its main concern, inevitably, was to warn Athwal not to tell the press that the machinations in Ilford were well worth investigating. \u201cThe disclosure of confidential information relating to the Party is in itself conduct considered prejudicial to the Party contrary to Rule 2.1.8 of the Rulebook,\u201d it intoned in true Stalinist style.\n\nDespite it being more than five months since he was suspended, nothing has been settled. It\u2019s almost as if Labour was looking for an excuse to remove a politician who wasn't in the leader's faction, and now doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. Athwal is now threatening to go to court. If he does, he will join the former Labour staffers who alleged the party libelled them when they blew the whistle on anti-Semitism, and Panorama's John Ware who claims Labour libelled him too.\n\n\n\nThis constituency was created in 1945. The previous [[Member of Parliament|MP]] since 1992, [[Mike Gapes]], who before defecting to [[Change UK]], was the fourth [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP, each of whose tenures was interspersed or preceded by one of a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP serving the area. Despite its record of MPs elected, under Gapes's tenure Ilford South became a very [[safe seat]] for the Labour Party; in every election since 1997 it has been won by a majority of over 20% by Labour, and in 2017 they secured over 75% of the vote in the constituency. \n\nThe 2015 result made the seat the 38th safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/labour-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority]  UK Political.info.  Retrieved 2017-01-29</ref>  The narrowest result since 1997 (inclusive) was in 2005 at a majority of 21.6%; the 2017 majority is the greatest ever achieved in the seat, at 54.9%.\n\n== Boundaries

represented in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] since 2019 by [[Sam Tarry]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. {{#tag:ref|As with all constituencies, the constituency elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) by the [[first past the post]] system of election at least every five years.|group= n}}\n\n== Constituency profile==\n;Political history\n \nJas Athwal is the leader of Redbridge Council, but was suspended by the Labour Party just before the parliamentary candidate selection vote last year.\nIt\u2019s a good thing that Sir Keir Starmer is an eminent lawyer because Jeremy Corbyn is bequeathing his likely successor a Labour party that will be bombarded with lawsuits.\nThe allegedly \u201cStalinist\u201d tactics Corbyn\u2019s supporters used to ensure that their comrades received safe Labour seats could yet cost the party dear.\n\nIn the autumn of 2019, to take the latest case, Jas Athwal, the leader of Redbridge Council, seemed set to become Labour's candidate for the safe London seat of Ilford South. True Sam Tarry, a Corbyn supporter was backed by Momentum. But Athwal was the favourite, until Labour announced it had received \u201cextremely serious allegations\" and suspended him.\n\nLocal Labour members were outraged. Wes Streeting, the Labour MP for Ilford North, said \"suspension of the local frontrunner just 15 hours before the vote is politically motivated and biased in order to stitch up the selection\". Labour insisted it was behaving properly, and perhaps unsurprisingly Sam Tarry decided that suspending his rival and guaranteeing his victory was \u201cabsolutely the right thing to do\u201d\n\nCareer left in ruins\nAthwal\u2019s reputation had been trashed and career left in ruins. Labour revealed he had been referred to its \u201cSexual Harassment Panel\u201d as if he were an East London Harvey Weinstein. And then nothing until Athwal and his lawyers at Mishcon de Reya began to dig.\n\nLabour has not named the complainant or said anything about the case. But Athwal had no difficulty identifying him as former councillor Aziz Chowdhury. In 2014 Chowdhury accused Athwal of corruption, then admitted the charge was false, and later denied any knowledge of making the accusation. When Chowdhury failed a selection interview for councillors in 2017 he threatened to sue Labour unless it changed its mind. Alternatively he would accept a \u00a320,000 payment. In 2018 he accused Roy Emmett ,a Redbridge councillor, of bullying him, an allegation that was again dismissed.\n\nIn short Mishcon alleged Labour had believed a \u201cknown serial, vexatious accuser, who has an axe to grind against our client\u201d. To make matters worse, Mischon alleged three members of the panel that suspended Athwal, were \u201cfriends or supporters of Sam Tarry\u201d. One was Momentum\u2019s Jon Lansman, who was also involved in bringing down Sally Gimson, the Labour candidate is Bassetlaw (see Eyes passim) to clear the way for a Unite-backed nominee.\n\nWell worth investigating\nIf it truly believed Athwal were a sex pest, why hadn\u2019t Labour reported him to the police or Redbridge Council? Why, indeed had Labour not moved speedily to decide if the complaints were in fact true. Labour said that it was \u201ctaking steps to progress the case\u201d and claimed that Lansman would not have known he was doing Tarry a favour because the case had been \u2018anonymised\u201d It\u2019s main concern, inevitably, was to warn Athwal not to tell the press that the machinations in Ilford were well worth investigating. \u201cThe disclosure of confidential information relating to the Party is in itself conduct considered prejudicial to the Party contrary to Rule 2.1.8 of the Rulebook,\u201d it intoned in true Stalinist style.\n\nDespite it being more than five months since he was suspended, nothing has been settled. It\u2019s almost as if Labour was looking for an excuse to remove a politician who wasn't in the leader's faction, and now doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. Athwal is now threatening to go to court. If he does, he will join the former Labour staffers who alleged the party libelled them when they blew the whistle on anti-Semitism, and Panorama's John Ware who claims Labour libelled him too.\n\n\n\nThis constituency was created in 1945. The previous [[Member of Parliament|MP]] since 1992, [[Mike Gapes]], who before defecting to [[Change UK]], was the fourth [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP, each of whose tenures was interspersed or preceded by one of a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP serving the area. Despite its record of MPs elected, under Gapes's tenure Ilford South became a very [[safe seat]] for the Labour Party; in every election since 1997 it has been won by a majority of over 20% by Labour, and in 2017 they secured over 75% of the vote in the constituency. \n\nThe 2015 result made the seat the 38th safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/labour-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority]  UK Political.info.  Retrieved 2017-01-29</ref>  The narrowest result since 1997 (inclusive) was in 2005 at a majority of 21.6%; the 2017 majority is the greatest ever achieved in the seat, at 54.9%.\n\n== Boundaries

The majority of Canada's population is concentrated in the areas close to the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]]. Its four [[List of Canadian provinces and territories by area|largest]] provinces by area ([[Quebec]], [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]]) are also (with Quebec and Ontario, switched in order) its most populous; together they account for 86% of the country's population. The territories (the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Nunavut]] and [[Yukon]]) account for over a third of Canada's area but are home to only 0.3% of its population, which skews the national [[population density]] value.\n\nCanada's population grew by 5.0% between the [[Canada 2011 Census|2006]] and [[Canada 2016 Census|2011]] censuses.<ref name=2016census/> Except for [[New Brunswick]], all territories and provinces increased in population from 2011 to 2016. In terms of percent change, the fastest-growing province or territory was [[Nunavut]] with an increase of 12.7% between 2011 and 2016, followed by [[Alberta]] with 11.6% growth. New Brunswick's population decreased by 0.5% between 2011 and 2016.\n\nGenerally, Canadian Provinces steadily grew in population along with Canada. However, some provinces such as Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. Ontario and Quebec were always the two biggest provinces in Canada, with over 60% of the population to themselves at any given time. The demographic importance of [[Western Canada|the West]] steadily grew over time, while the importance of [[Atlantic Canada]] steadily slipped.\nCanada's population has increased every year since [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867: see [[List of population of Canada by years]].<div class=\"mw-stack stack-container stack-right mobile-float-reset\"><div style=\"overflow: hidden; margin: 1px;\"></div></div>\n\n== Ranking ==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | 2016 Population<br>Rank\n! rowspan=2 | Name<ref name=2016census>{{Cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T=101&S=50&O=A | title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, 2016 and 2011 censuses \u2013 100% data | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] | date=February 8, 2017 | accessdate=February 8, 2017}}</ref>\n! colspan=2 | Population,<br>[[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]\n! rowspan=2 | Growth,<br>2011\u201316\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:80px;\" | Land area<br>(km<sup>2</sup>)\n! rowspan=2 | Population<br>density<br>(per km<sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | [[House of Commons of Canada|House of<br>Commons]] seats\n! colspan=2 | 2020 population<br>(Q1&nbsp;est.)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=0510005&paSer=&pattern=&stByVal=1&p1=1&p2=31&tabMode=dataTable&csid= | title=Table 051-0005: Estimates of population, Canada, provinces and territories | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] | date=March 19, 2020 | accessdate=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Growth,\n2016\u201320\n|-\n!

However, some provinces  experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. After peaking in 1891, Prince Edward Island's population started to decline every year until 1941, after which the Province started growing again. In Saskatchewan, after rapid population explosion at the beginning of the century, its population declined during the [[Great Depression]], and it's growth had been slow ever since. From 1931 to 2016, Saskatchewan's population only raised by 19.2%, well below the national average. Newfoundland and Labrador, on the other hand, experienced slow but continuous growth until the 1990s, when the [[Cod fishing in Newfoundland#20th century fishing methods and the fishery collapse|cod fisheries collapsed]], and their population started to fall.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Canadian Birth rate, most provinces now sustain their population with immigration from the developing world.

In 1840, the [[Durham Report]] recommended that [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] be united into one province. The newly created Legislative Assembly of the [[Province of Canada]] was required to have equal representation from [[Canada East]] and [[Canada West]],<ref>''Union Act, 1840'', s. 12.</ref> even though the population of Canada East was considerably larger. In 1840, the population of Canada East was estimated at 670,000, while the population of Canada West was estimated to be 480,000.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/province-of-canada-1841-67 \"Province of Canada (1841-67)\", ''Canadian Encyclopedia''.]</ref>  Lord Durham had not recommended this approach, and had instead proposed that the representation should be based on the respective populations of the two regions.<ref>[[iarchive:lorddurhamsrepor02durhiala/page/324|''Lord Durham's Report'', pp. 323-324.]]</ref> The British government rejected that recommendation and instead implemented sectional equality, apparently to give the English-speaking population of the new province a dominant voice in the provincial government.\n\nHowever, the 1851 census revealed that Canada West's population had surpassed Canada East's. This fact fueled demands in Canada West for the end of sectional equality and the move toward allocating seats in the legislation on the basis of population, nicknamed \"rep by pop\". This was a hotly contested issues at the constitutional conferences leading up to confederation, and the colonies reached a comprise in which the seats in the federal lower house([[House of Commons of Canada|House of commons]]) would be allocated by population, and the seats in the federal upper house([[Senate of Canada|Senate]]) would be allocated on the basis of Regions \u2014Ontario, Quebec and [[the Maritimes]]\u2014 that would each have 24 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rep-by-pop|title=Rep by Pop {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThoughout Canada's history, Ontario and Quebec were always Canada's two biggest provinces. However, their combined demographic weight decreased from over 80% upon Confederation to just over 60% in 2016. The [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] also lost importance within Canada, from around 20% upon confederation to under 7% today. The West's importance, however, has only increased, from insignificant levels in 1971 to over 30% of the country in 2016. In the first half of the 20th century, the largest western province was Saskatchewan, but its population was later eclipsed by Alberta and British Columbia.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E|title=Census profiles, 2016 census|last=|first=|date=|website=Statistics Canada|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe issue of the demographic weight of each provinces came up during the negotiations for the [[Patriation of the Constitution]], and especially discussions around the [[Amending formula (Canada)|amending formula]] of the constitution. The final formula stipulates that minor changes to the constitution had to be approved by the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of 7 provinces representing at least 50% of the Canadian population. The essentially meant that either Ontario or Quebec had to agree to any constitutional amendments that affect all provinces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/patriation-of-the-constitution|title=Patriation of the Constitution {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>  \n\nQuebec had managed to maintain a stable demographic weight within to Canada during the first half of the 20th century due to its high birth rate.

In terms of percent change, the fastest-growing province or territory was [[Nunavut]] with an increase of 12.7% between 2011 and 2016, followed by [[Alberta]] with 11.6% growth. New Brunswick's population decreased by 0.5% between 2011 and 2016.\n\nGenerally, Canadian Provinces steadily grew in population along with Canada. However, some provinces such as Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. Ontario and Quebec were always the two biggest provinces in Canada, with over 60% of the population to themselves at any given time. The demographic importance of [[Western Canada|the West]] steadily grew over time, while the importance of [[Atlantic Canada]] steadily slipped.\nCanada's population has increased every year since [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867: see [[List of population of Canada by years]].<div class=\"mw-stack stack-container stack-right mobile-float-reset\"><div style=\"overflow: hidden; margin: 1px;\"></div></div>\n\n== Ranking ==\n<onlyinclude>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | 2016 Population<br>Rank\n! rowspan=2 | Name<ref name=2016census>{{Cite web | url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Table.cfm?Lang=Eng&T=101&S=50&O=A | title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, 2016 and 2011 censuses \u2013 100% data | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] | date=February 8, 2017 | accessdate=February 8, 2017}}</ref>\n! colspan=2 | Population,<br>[[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]\n! rowspan=2 | Growth,<br>2011\u201316\n! rowspan=2 style=\"width:80px;\" | Land area<br>(km<sup>2</sup>)\n! rowspan=2 | Population<br>density<br>(per km<sup>2</sup>)&nbsp;\n! colspan=2 | [[House of Commons of Canada|House of<br>Commons]] seats\n! colspan=2 | 2020 population<br>(Q1&nbsp;est.)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=0510005&paSer=&pattern=&stByVal=1&p1=1&p2=31&tabMode=dataTable&csid= | title=Table 051-0005: Estimates of population, Canada, provinces and territories | publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] | date=March 19, 2020 | accessdate=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Growth,\n2016\u201320\n|-\n!

However, some provinces  experienced long periods of stagnation or population decline. After peaking in 1891, Prince Edward Island's population started to decline every year until 1941, after which the Province started growing again. In Saskatchewan, after rapid population explosion at the beginning of the century, its population declined during the [[Great Depression]], and it's growth had been slow ever since. From 1931 to 2016, Saskatchewan's population only raised by 19.2%, well below the national average.

In 1840, the [[Durham Report]] recommended that [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] be united into one province. The newly created Legislative Assembly of the [[Province of Canada]] was required to have equal representation from [[Canada East]] and [[Canada West]],<ref>''Union Act, 1840'', s. 12.</ref> even though the population of Canada East was considerably larger. In 1840, the population of Canada East was estimated at 670,000, while the population of Canada West was estimated to be 480,000.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/province-of-canada-1841-67 \"Province of Canada (1841-67)\", ''Canadian Encyclopedia''.]</ref>  Lord Durham had not recommended this approach, and had instead proposed that the representation should be based on the respective populations of the two regions.<ref>[[iarchive:lorddurhamsrepor02durhiala/page/324|''Lord Durham's Report'', pp. 323-324.]]</ref> The British government rejected that recommendation and instead implemented sectional equality, apparently to give the English-speaking population of the new province a dominant voice in the provincial government.\n\nHowever, the 1851 census revealed that Canada West's population had surpassed Canada East's. This fact fueled demands in Canada West for the end of sectional equality and the move toward allocating seats in the legislation on the basis of population, nicknamed \"rep by pop\". This was a hotly contested issues at the constitutional conferences leading up to confederation, and the colonies reached a comprise in which the seats in the federal lower house([[House of Commons of Canada|House of commons]]) would be allocated by population, and the seats in the federal upper house([[Senate of Canada|Senate]]) would be allocated on the basis of Regions \u2014Ontario, Quebec and [[the Maritimes]]\u2014 that would each have 24 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/rep-by-pop|title=Rep by Pop {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThoughout Canada's history, Ontario and Quebec were always Canada's two biggest provinces. However, their combined demographic weight decreased from over 80% upon Confederation to just over 60% in 2016. The [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces]] also lost importance within Canada, from around 20% upon confederation to under 7% today. The West's importance, however, has only increased, from insignificant levels in 1971 to over 30% of the country in 2016. In the first half of the 20th century, the largest western province was Saskatchewan, but its population was later eclipsed by Alberta and British Columbia.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E|title=Census profiles, 2016 census|last=|first=|date=|website=Statistics Canada|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe issue of the demographic weight of each provinces came up during the negotiations for the [[Patriation of the Constitution]], and especially discussions around the [[Amending formula (Canada)|amending formula]] of the constitution. The final formula stipulates that minor changes to the constitution had to be approved by the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of 7 provinces representing at least 50% of the Canadian population. The essentially meant that either Ontario or Quebec had to agree to any constitutional amendments that affect all provinces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/patriation-of-the-constitution|title=Patriation of the Constitution {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>  \n\nQuebec had managed to maintain a stable demographic weight within to Canada during the first half of the 20th century due to its high birth rate.

Under the [[Charlottetown Accord]], in exchange for Quebec losing Senate seats under a [[Triple-E Senate]] (dropping from 24 to 6), Quebec was guaranteed never to be allotted less than 25% of the seats in the House of Commons.

The name \"Bambang\" is an [[Isinai language|Isinay]] word meaning \"to dig\".\n\nThe first mission that dared to penetrate the dangerous wilderness and insect-infested jungles of what is southern [[Nueva Vizcaya province|Nueva Vizcaya]] today was by the [[Dominican Order]] in 1607. However, it was only two years later (1609) when a Dominican missionary come from [[Pangasinan province|Pangasinan]]. Father Tomas Gutierez arrived to establish the first missionary settlement. This settlement was subsequently called ''Ytuy'' which today actually comprises the towns of [[Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya|Aritao]], [[Dupax del Norte|Dupax]], Bambang and a part of the [[Igorot]] tribal lands to the west (now [[Kayapa, Nueva Vizcaya|Kayapa]]). Originally these places were inhabited by the [[Igorot peoples|Igorot]] and Panuypuyes ([[Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya|Aritao]]), the [[Ilongot people|Ilongots]] (Dupax and Bambang) and the [[Igorot|lgorot]] in the area west from the present native population of Dupax, Aritao, and Bambang came about by the inter-marriages of the tribes mentioned above.\n\n===Recent development and progress===\nIn 2012, Bambang became open to big dealers and businessmen as part of its  progress.

The name \"Bambang\" is an [[Isinai language|Isinay]] word meaning \"to dig\".\n\nThe first mission that dared to penetrate the dangerous wilderness and insect-infested jungles of what is southern [[Nueva Vizcaya province|Nueva Vizcaya]] today was by the [[Dominican Order]] in 1607. However, it was only two years later (1609) when a Dominican missionary come from [[Pangasinan province|Pangasinan]]. Father Tomas Gutierez arrived to establish the first missionary settlement. This settlement was subsequently called ''Ytuy'' which today actually comprises the towns of [[Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya|Aritao]], [[Dupax del Norte|Dupax]], Bambang and a part of the [[Igorot]] tribal lands to the west (now [[Kayapa, Nueva Vizcaya|Kayapa]]). Originally these places were inhabited by the [[Igorot peoples|Igorot]] and Panuypuyes ([[Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya|Aritao]]), the [[Ilongot people|Ilongots]] (Dupax and Bambang) and the [[Igorot|lgorot]] in the area west from the present native population of Dupax, Aritao, and Bambang came about by the inter-marriages of the tribes mentioned above.\n\n===Recent development and progress===\nIn 2012, Bambang became open to big dealers and businessmen as part of its  progress.
