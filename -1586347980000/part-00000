Episodes regularly featured music by Danny Thomas, guest stars and occasionally other cast members as part of the plot.\n\nIn March 1953, [[Danny Thomas]] first signed the contract for the show with ABC and chose [[Desilu Productions|Desilu Studios]] to film it using its [[Multiple-camera setup|three-camera method]].<ref name=andrews>''The I Love Lucy Book'' by Bart Andrews (revised and updated Broadway Books trade paperback edition, 2001), {{ISBN|0-385-19033-6}}, p. 116</ref> Two proposed titles during preproduction were ''The Children's Hour''<ref>{{cite book |title=The TV Guide TV Book: 40 Years of the All-Time Greatest Television Facts, Fads, Hits, and History |url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein |url-access=registration |last=Weiner |first=Ed |author2=Editors of TV Guide  |year=1992 |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-096914-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidetvbook40y00wein/page/173 173] }}</ref> and ''Here Comes Daddy''.<ref name=\"andrews\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Danny thomas sherry jackson.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Thomas with television daughter Terry ([[Sherry Jackson]])]]\nThomas played the role of Danny Williams, a successful comedian and nightclub entertainer at the Copa Club, based on the iconic New York City nightclub the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. [[Jean Hagen]] played his serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson, and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show's premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with his family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on her own. She often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved her family. \n\n[[Louise Beavers]] made several appearances during this era as the Williams' maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple's arguments. [[Nana Bryant]] often appeared as Margaret's kind mother, of whom Danny and the children were fond, but Margaret, who had been raised by her aunt and uncle because of her mother often being away on stage tours, was not as warm to her mother. (Bryant died in late 1955, and rather than the character being recast, she simply disappeared. When Louise Beavers became ill in 1955, [[Amanda Randolph]] assumed the role of Louise.)\n\n===Series changes===\nFor its first four years, ''Make Room For Daddy'on ABC (retitled ''The Danny Thomas Show' starting in the Fall of 1957 on CBS) garnered decent ratings, but failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. Shortly after the third season finished filming, Jean Hagen left the show over dissatisfaction with her role and frequent clashes with Danny Thomas. Thomas was upset with her for leaving, and felt the show would not last without her. However, he decided to push on. At the start of the fourth season, Both Thomas and producer [[Sheldon Leonard]] were faced with a serious dilemma\u2014how to explain Hagen's absence. To have \"Danny\" and \"Margaret\" divorce in that era would have been unacceptable to television audiences, so it was explained that Margaret had died suddenly off-screen. It was a risky move because until this time, no character on a TV situation comedy had died.\n\nDanny now was a widower juggling a performing career while raising two children on his own. He had Louise and his friends often looking after the children while he was touring. He decided to move them to a boarding school, but later relented and the family moved into a new apartment. During the fourth season, Danny dated a few other women and nearly got engaged to a widowed singer until he found out she did not like children. By season's end, the ratings had suffered and it was decided that a wife and mother was needed to complete the family unit.\n\nIn a four-part story arc that began airing in April 1957, son Rusty fell ill with the [[measles]] and Danny hired Kathy O'Hara ([[Marjorie Lord]]), a young Irish nurse, to look after him. Kathy was a widow with a little girl (played by Lelani Sorenson). Danny and Kathy became fast friends and, not surprisingly, Danny quickly fell in love with her, as did the kids. In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series, which proved to be fortunate. In the spring of 1957, ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling the series, CBS picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.\n\nThe show, now titled \"The Danny Thomas Show\" made its CBS debut on Monday, October 7, 1957 at 9:00 inheriting the time slot vacated by ''I Love Lucy''. The fifth-season premiere episode, \"Lose Me In Las Vegas,\" had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy's daughter. Lelani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show's ratings dramatically increased.<ref>[http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm ClassicTVHits.com TV Ratings: 1957-1958]</ref> At the end of its fifth season, ''The Danny Thomas Show'' posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.\n\nIn the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14\u201316.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.\n\nIn the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Danny Thomas Jean Hagen Make Room for Daddy 1953.JPG|thumb|150px|Danny and Margaret Williams]]\n[[File:Milton berle angela cartright rusty hamer.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Milton Berle]] spends some time with Linda and Rusty after  Danny and he quit show business.]]\n* [[Danny Thomas]] as Danny Williams\n* [[Jean Hagen]] as Margaret Williams (1953&ndash;1956)\n* [[Marjorie Lord]] as Kathy \"Clancey\" O'Hara Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Rusty Hamer]] as Rusty Williams\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sherry Jackson]] as Terry Williams (1953&ndash;1958)\n* Penney Parker as Terry Williams (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Louise (1953&ndash;1955)\n* [[Amanda Randolph]] as Louise (1955&ndash;1964)\n\n===Supporting===\n[[File:Danny Thomas show hans conried 1964.jpg|thumb|150px|Uncle Tonoose (Hans Conried) gets a lecture from his older brother, Tufik (played by Danny Thomas).]]\nThe supporting cast included:\n* [[Sid Melton]] as Charlie Halper\n* [[Pat Carroll]] as Bunny Halper (1961&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sheldon Leonard]] as Phil Brokaw (1957&ndash;1961)\n* [[Ben Lessy]] as Benny (1953&ndash;1959)\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Liz O'Neal (1955&ndash;1957)\n* [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]] as Pat Hannigan (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] as Jesse Leeds (1953&ndash;1957)\n\n===Notable guest stars===\n[[Hans Conried]] had frequent guest appearances as Danny's eccentric [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] \"Uncle Tonoose\".

Other notable guest stars included band leader and musician [[Harry James]], who appeared in the episode \"The Trumpet Player\", child pianist [[Ginny Tiu]] playing Li Chow in \"The Chinese Doll\" and the legendary [[Jimmy Durante]], who appeared as himself in the episode \"Danny and Durante\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Danny Thomas Show episodes}}\n{{:List of The Danny Thomas Show episodes}}\n\n==Theme song==\nThe theme music was various versions (changing over the years) of the traditional Irish song, \"[[Danny Boy]]\".\n\n==Spin-off and crossovers==\nThe series was responsible for the creation of another long-running sitcom, ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. In the seventh season, Danny Thomas is arrested by [[Sheriff Andy Taylor]] (Andy Griffith) and detained in the small town of [[Mayberry]] in an episode titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\". The episode aired on February 15, 1960, and ''The Andy Griffith Show'' premiered later that year on October 3.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639971/ ''The Danny Thomas Show'', \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\"]</ref>\n\nThe series also [[Fictional crossover|crossed over]] to several other series, including ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''<ref>[http://www.poobala.com/lucyanddanny.html ''The Danny Thomas Show/Make Room For Daddy and I Love Lucy/The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour'']</ref> and ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0616273/ ''The Joey Bishop Show'',\"This Is Your Life\"]</ref>\n\n[[Morey Amsterdam]] guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' in the episode \"The Women Behind the Jokes\".\n\nSome episodes featured [[Bill Dana]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez (character)|Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez]], which led to the spin-off series ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''. Danny Thomas played himself in one episode.\n\n==Sequel==\n[[File:Make Room for Granddaddy cast 1970.JPG|thumb|180px|The cast for ''Make Room for Granddaddy'']]\n[[File:Diana Ross Roosevelt Grier Danny Thomas Make Room for Granddaddy 1971.JPG|thumb|180px|Guest star [[Diana Ross]] with Roosevelt Grier and Thomas in 1971]]\n\nThe show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.\n\nABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>\n<!-- \n===Episode list for ''Make Room for Granddaddy''===\n# \"Make Room for Grandson\" / 1970.09.23\n# \"The Return of Barney Shaker\" / 1970.09.30\n# \"This Granddaddy Is Rated X\" / 1970.10.07\n# \"'''The Great Emancipator'''\" / 1970.10.14\n# \"'''A Time for Loving'''\" / 1970.10.21\n# \"'''Is This Trip Necessary?'''\" / 1970.10.28\n# \"'''Teaching Linda to Drive'''\" / 1970.11.04\n# \"'''Tonoose the Exile'''\" / 1970.11.11\n# \"'''A Hamburger for Frank'''\" / 1970.11.18\n# \"'''The Arrangement'''\" / 1970.11.25\n# \"'''He Did It His Way'''\" / 1970.12.02\n# \"'''Women of the World, Unite'''\" / 1970.12.16\n# \"'''The Teen Idol'''\" / 1970.12.30\n# \"'''Cheating the Cheater'''\" / 1971.01.06\n# \"'''The Horrible Horoscope'''\" / 1971.01.13\n# \"'''Lucy and the Lecher'''\" / 1971.01.21\n# \"'''Of Mice and Mini'''\" / 1971.01.28\n# \"'''Will the Real Diana Please Stand Up?'''\" / 1971.02.04\n# \"'''Over Thirty Is Out'''\" / 1971.02.11\n# \"'''Karate Kate'''\" / 1971.02.18\n# \"'''The Greatest Ear in the Business'''\" / 1971.02.25\n# \"'''The Big Hang-Up'''\" / 1971.03.04\n# \"'''The Arm Wrestle'''\" / 1971.03.11\n# \"'''Monument for Uncle Tonoose'''\" / 1971.03.18\n -->\n\n== Reruns ==\nReruns of the show( Using the original title \"Make Room For Daddy) were aired weekdays on NBC from October 4, 1960 to March 26, 1965.The episodes shown were from season one through season nine).CBS aired primetime repeats April 19 through September 6, 1965, on Monday nights at 9:30 p.m ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]]).

During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.\n\nIn the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series, saying, \"The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the ''Make Room for Daddy'' cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn't want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn't want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn't let me leave, but gave me less to do; that's why I'm in fewer shows from ages 14\u201316.\"{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan ([[Pat Harrington, Jr.]]), a nightclub friend of Danny's. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.\n\nIn the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny's manager, Charlie Halper ([[Sid Melton]]) and his wife Bunny ([[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]]). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Danny Thomas Jean Hagen Make Room for Daddy 1953.JPG|thumb|150px|Danny and Margaret Williams]]\n[[File:Milton berle angela cartright rusty hamer.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Milton Berle]] spends some time with Linda and Rusty after  Danny and he quit show business.]]\n* [[Danny Thomas]] as Danny Williams\n* [[Jean Hagen]] as Margaret Williams (1953&ndash;1956)\n* [[Marjorie Lord]] as Kathy \"Clancey\" O'Hara Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Rusty Hamer]] as Rusty Williams\n* [[Angela Cartwright]] as Linda Williams (1957&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sherry Jackson]] as Terry Williams (1953&ndash;1958)\n* Penney Parker as Terry Williams (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Louise Beavers]] as Louise (1953&ndash;1955)\n* [[Amanda Randolph]] as Louise (1955&ndash;1964)\n\n===Supporting===\n[[File:Danny Thomas show hans conried 1964.jpg|thumb|150px|Uncle Tonoose (Hans Conried) gets a lecture from his older brother, Tufik (played by Danny Thomas).]]\nThe supporting cast included:\n* [[Sid Melton]] as Charlie Halper\n* [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as Bunny Halper (1961&ndash;1964)\n* [[Sheldon Leonard]] as Phil Brokaw (1957&ndash;1961)\n* [[Ben Lessy]] as Benny (1953&ndash;1959)\n* [[Mary Wickes]] as Liz O'Neal (1955&ndash;1957)\n* [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]] as Pat Hannigan (1959&ndash;1960)\n* [[Jesse White (actor)|Jesse White]] as Jesse Leeds (1953&ndash;1957)\n\n===Notable guest stars===\n[[Hans Conried]] had frequent guest appearances as Danny's eccentric [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] \"Uncle Tonoose\".

Other notable guest stars included band leader and musician [[Harry James]], who appeared in the episode \"The Trumpet Player\", child pianist [[Ginny Tiu]] playing Li Chow in \"The Chinese Doll\" and the legendary [[Jimmy Durante]], who appeared as himself in the episode \"Danny and Durante\".\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Danny Thomas Show episodes}}\n{{:List of The Danny Thomas Show episodes}}\n\n==Theme song==\nThe theme music was various versions (changing over the years) of the traditional Irish song, \"[[Danny Boy]]\".\n\n==Spin-off and crossovers==\nThe series was responsible for the creation of another long-running sitcom, ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''. In the seventh season, Danny Thomas is arrested by [[Sheriff Andy Taylor]] (Andy Griffith) and detained in the small town of [[Mayberry]] in an episode titled \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\". The episode aired on February 15, 1960, and ''The Andy Griffith Show'' premiered later that year on October 3.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0639971/ ''The Danny Thomas Show'', \"Danny Meets Andy Griffith\"]</ref>\n\nThe series also [[Fictional crossover|crossed over]] to several other series, including ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''<ref>[http://www.poobala.com/lucyanddanny.html ''The Danny Thomas Show/Make Room For Daddy and I Love Lucy/The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour'']</ref> and ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0616273/ ''The Joey Bishop Show'',\"This Is Your Life\"]</ref>\n\n[[Morey Amsterdam]] guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell of ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' in the episode \"The Women Behind the Jokes\".\n\nSome episodes featured [[Bill Dana]] as [[Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez (character)|Jos\u00e9 Jim\u00e9nez]], which led to the spin-off series ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]''. Danny Thomas played himself in one episode.\n\n==Sequel==\n[[File:Make Room for Granddaddy cast 1970.JPG|thumb|180px|The cast for ''Make Room for Granddaddy'']]\n[[File:Diana Ross Roosevelt Grier Danny Thomas Make Room for Granddaddy 1971.JPG|thumb|180px|Guest star [[Diana Ross]] with Roosevelt Grier and Thomas in 1971]]\n\nThe show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long \"reunion\" special on [[NBC]], ''The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion'', considered the first TV reunion show, and ''Make More Room for Daddy'', which aired as an episode of ''[[The Danny Thomas Hour]]'' in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, ''Make Room for Granddaddy'', was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.\n\nABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in ''Make Room for Granddaddy''. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry's husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by [[Stanley Myron Handelman]] and former [[American football|football]] player [[Rosey Grier|Roosevelt Grier]]. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were [[rural purge|purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers]] after the [[Prime Time Access Rule|loss of a half-hour of daily program time]] in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.<ref>Geoffrey Mark Fidelman,''The Lucy Book'', Renaissance Books, page 269.)</ref>\n<!-- \n===Episode list for ''Make Room for Granddaddy''===\n# \"Make Room for Grandson\" / 1970.09.23\n# \"The Return of Barney Shaker\" / 1970.09.30\n# \"This Granddaddy Is Rated X\" / 1970.10.07\n# \"'''The Great Emancipator'''\" / 1970.10.14\n# \"'''A Time for Loving'''\" / 1970.10.21\n# \"'''Is This Trip Necessary?'''\" / 1970.10.28\n# \"'''Teaching Linda to Drive'''\" / 1970.11.04\n# \"'''Tonoose the Exile'''\" / 1970.11.11\n# \"'''A Hamburger for Frank'''\" / 1970.11.18\n# \"'''The Arrangement'''\" / 1970.11.25\n# \"'''He Did It His Way'''\" / 1970.12.02\n# \"'''Women of the World, Unite'''\" / 1970.12.16\n# \"'''The Teen Idol'''\" / 1970.12.30\n# \"'''Cheating the Cheater'''\" / 1971.01.06\n# \"'''The Horrible Horoscope'''\" / 1971.01.13\n# \"'''Lucy and the Lecher'''\" / 1971.01.21\n# \"'''Of Mice and Mini'''\" / 1971.01.28\n# \"'''Will the Real Diana Please Stand Up?'''\" / 1971.02.04\n# \"'''Over Thirty Is Out'''\" / 1971.02.11\n# \"'''Karate Kate'''\" / 1971.02.18\n# \"'''The Greatest Ear in the Business'''\" / 1971.02.25\n# \"'''The Big Hang-Up'''\" / 1971.03.04\n# \"'''The Arm Wrestle'''\" / 1971.03.11\n# \"'''Monument for Uncle Tonoose'''\" / 1971.03.18\n -->\n\n== Reruns ==\nReruns of the show( Using the original title \"Make Room For Daddy) were aired weekdays on NBC from October 4, 1960 to March 26, 1965.The episodes shown were from season one through season nine).CBS aired primetime repeats April 19 through September 6, 1965, on Monday nights at 9:30 p.m ([[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]]).

However, as a condition for his involvement, the live rounds of the competition were moved from their venue in Los Angeles to a new site in [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox43.com/news/wpmt-howard-stern-got-talent-121511,0,4906110.story |title=Howard Stern to judge 'America's Got Talent', which will move to New York |last=Boedeker |first=Hal |publisher=www.fox43.com/news |date=December 16, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=NJPAC>{{cite web |author=Kuperinsky, Amy |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2012/07/americas_got_talent_top_48_beg.html |title=''America's Got Talent'': Top 48 begin performances at NJPAC |website=NJ.com |date=July 3, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/americas_got_talent_to_film_at.html |title= 'America's Got Talent' to film at NJPAC in Newark|last= McGlone|first= Peggy |website=NJ.com |date= April 8, 2012| accessdate = April 8, 2012}}</ref>  Alongside a change of judge, the show also underwent a visual makeover to improve its presentation, as well as making use of its new live round venue to attract a larger audience.\n\nThe seventh season was won by dog tricks act [[Olate Dogs]], with stand-up comedian [[Tom Cotter (comedian)|Tom Cotter]] finishing in second, and earth harpist William Close placing third. During its broadcast, the season averaged around 10.02 million viewers. The involvement of an army sergeant in this year's competition caused controversy after their appearance was broadcast, over a claim they made that was later refuted by their superiors and the media.\n\n==Season Overview==\n[[File:Howard Stern.jpg|thumb|190px|left|[[Howard Stern]] was brought in a month after Piers Morgan's departure.]]\nAuditions for the seventh season's competition took place across Winter - mid-Spring 2012, with production staff holding the main auditions that would be filmed within the cities of New York, Los Angeles, [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], and [[San Francisco]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/americas-got-talent/auditions/ |title=America's Got Talent Season 7 Audition Cities |website=NBC.com |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-05-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426003715/http://www.nbc.com/americas-got-talent/auditions/ |archive-date=2012-04-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://americasgottalentauditions.com/audition-cities/ |title=Audition Cities \u00ab Official America's Got Talent Audition Site 2011-2012 |publisher=Americasgottalentauditions.com |accessdate=2012-05-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806054548/http://www.americasgottalentauditions.com/audition-cities/ |archive-date=2013-08-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> additional auditions were held in [[Washington, D.C.]]and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], though were not filmed.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the sixth season's broadcast, [[Piers Morgan]] began contemplating his involvement with ''America's Got Talent'', due to his increasing work schedule on other projects by that time. In November 2011, despite having signed a three-year contract the previous year,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialpiersmorgan.com/2010/07/28/piers-on-the-tonight-show-with-jay-leno/|title=Piers Morgan Interview with Jay Leno|publisher=Officialpiersmorgan.com|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}</ref> Morgan was forced to quit the program in order to focus on his commitment to producing ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]'' for [[CNN]].<ref>[http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/11/09/piers-morgan-leaving-americas-got-talent/ Piers Morgan leaving 'America's Got Talent']</ref> His departure meant that production staff had to seek out his replacement before work on the seventh season could begin, with radio personality [[Howard Stern]] chosen in December to replace Morgan. However, as Stern had commitments to his [[SiriusXM]] radio show in New York that he could not abandon, the producers agreed that as a condition for his involvement, the live round venue would be relocated from its original site in Los Angeles, to the [[New Jersey Performing Arts Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], thus ensuring his work schedule was manageable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boedeker |first=Hal |url=http://www.fox43.com/news/wpmt-howard-stern-got-talent-121511,0,4906110.story |title=Howard Stern to judge 'America's Got Talent', which will move to New York |publisher=fox43.com |accessdate=December 16, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nWhile the use of the Performing Arts Center meant that audiences attending live rounds could be much larger than in previous years, the change in venue also allowed executive producer [[Simon Cowell]] to have the program undergo a significant \"top-to-bottom makeover\" of its presentation - amongst these included new graphics, a new intro, and a new theme song for ''America's Got Talent'', alongside an update to set pieces. A significant change was the appearance of the judges' desk, which was re-modeled to appear similar in design to that used on ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=McGlone |first=Peggy |title='America's Got Talent' to film at NJPAC in Newark |newspaper=The Star-Ledger |date=April 8, 2012 |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/americas_got_talent_to_film_at.html |accessdate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref> Despite the change in live round venue, Stern gave clearance to the producers that he could work on the \"Vegas Verdicts\" segment within Las Vegas without any issue. Alongside these changes, the producers also had to take into account the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] that year - as the sporting event would receive live coverage from the network, the episode scheduling had to include a two week hiatus between 27 July to 12 August, so as to avoid ''America's Got Talent'' clashing with this. \n\nOf the participants who auditioned for this season, 62 secured a place in the live quarter-finals, with twelve quarter-finalists in each one - ten of these would later be given a second chance in the Wildcard quarter-final, after losing their initial quarter-final. Around 23 of these advanced to and were split between the two semi-finals - an additional semi-finalist was added in at the last minute - with 6 semi-finalists securing a place in the finals, which consisted of a single stage and not multiple rounds.

However, as Stern had commitments to his [[SiriusXM]] radio show in New York that he could not abandon, the producers agreed that as a condition for his involvement, the live round venue would be relocated from its original site in Los Angeles, to the [[New Jersey Performing Arts Center]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], thus ensuring his work schedule was manageable.<ref>{{cite web|last=Boedeker |first=Hal |url=http://www.fox43.com/news/wpmt-howard-stern-got-talent-121511,0,4906110.story |title=Howard Stern to judge 'America's Got Talent', which will move to New York |publisher=fox43.com |accessdate=December 16, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nWhile the use of the Performing Arts Center meant that audiences attending live rounds could be much larger than in previous years, the change in venue also allowed executive producer [[Simon Cowell]] to have the program undergo a significant \"top-to-bottom makeover\" of its presentation - amongst these included new graphics, a new intro, and a new theme song for ''America's Got Talent'', alongside an update to set pieces. A significant change was the appearance of the judges' desk, which was re-modeled to appear similar in design to that used on ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=McGlone |first=Peggy |title='America's Got Talent' to film at NJPAC in Newark |newspaper=The Star-Ledger |date=April 8, 2012 |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/americas_got_talent_to_film_at.html |accessdate=April 6, 2012 }}</ref> Despite the change in live round venue, Stern gave clearance to the producers that he could work on the \"Vegas Verdicts\" segment within Las Vegas without any issue. Alongside these changes, the producers also had to take into account the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] that year - as the sporting event would receive live coverage from the network, the episode scheduling had to include a two week hiatus between 27 July to 12 August, so as to avoid ''America's Got Talent'' clashing with this. \n\nOf the participants who auditioned for this season, 62 secured a place in the live quarter-finals, with twelve quarter-finalists in each one - ten of these would later be given a second chance in the Wildcard quarter-final, after losing their initial quarter-final. Around 23 of these advanced to and were split between the two semi-finals - an additional semi-finalist was added in at the last minute - with 6 semi-finalists securing a place in the finals, which consisted of a single stage and not multiple rounds.

When NHL teams do not have an AHL affiliate, players are assigned to AHL teams affiliated with other NHL teams. Twenty-seven AHL teams are located in the United States and the remaining four are in Canada. The league offices are located in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and its current president is [[David Andrews (ice hockey)|David Andrews]].\n\nIn general, a player must be at least 18 years of age to play in the AHL or not currently be beholden to a [[junior ice hockey]] team. The league limits the number of experienced professional players on a team's active roster during any given game; only five skaters can have accumulated four full seasons of play or more at the professional level (goaltenders are exempt from this rule and can stay in the AHL indefinitely without being subject to this cap).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theahl.com/faq|title=FAQ|website=Theahl.com|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> The AHL allows for [[practice squad]] contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wivb.com/2017/10/09/gionta-to-skate-with-amerks-prepare-for-international-competition/|title=Gionta to skate with Amerks, prepare for international competition|first=Nick|last=Filipowski|publisher=WIVB-TV|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe annual playoff champion is awarded the [[Calder Cup]], named for [[Frank Calder]], the first President (1917\u20131943) of the NHL. The reigning champions are the [[Charlotte Checkers]].\n\n==History==\n===Predecessor leagues===\nThe AHL traces its origins directly to two predecessor professional leagues: the [[Canadian-American Hockey League]] (the \"Can-Am\" League), founded in 1926, and the first [[International Hockey League (1929\u201336)|International Hockey League]], established in 1929. Although the Can-Am League never operated with more than six teams, the departure of the [[Boston Tigers (CAHL)|Boston Bruin Cubs]] after the 1935\u201336 season reduced it down to just four member clubs \u2013 the [[Springfield Indians]], [[Philadelphia Ramblers]], [[Providence Reds]], and [[New Haven Eagles]] \u2013 for the first time in its history. At the same time, the then-rival IHL lost half of its eight members after the 1935\u201336 season, also leaving it with just four member teams: the [[Buffalo Bisons (IHL)|Buffalo Bisons]], [[Syracuse Stars]], [[Pittsburgh Hornets]], and [[Cleveland Falcons]].\n\n===1936\u201338===\nWith both leagues down to the bare minimum number of teams to be viable, the governors of both leagues recognized the need for action to assure their member clubs' long-term survival. Their solution was to play an interlocking schedule.  While the Can-Am was based in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and the IHL in the [[Great Lakes Region (North America)|Great Lakes]], their footprints were close enough for this to be a viable option. The two leagues' eight surviving clubs began joint play in November 1936 as a new two-division \"circuit of mutual convenience\" known as the '''International-American Hockey League'''.  The four Can-Am teams became the I-AHL East Division, with the IHL quartet playing as the West Division. The IHL also contributed its former championship trophy, the [[F. G. \"Teddy\" Oke Trophy]], which would go to the regular-season winners of the merged league's West Division until 1952. The Oke Trophy is now awarded to the regular-season winners of the AHL's Northeast Division.\n\nA little more than a month into that first season, the balance and symmetry of the new combined circuit suffered a setback when its membership unexpectedly fell to seven teams. The West's Buffalo Bisons were forced to cease operations on December 6, 1936, after playing just 11 games, because of what proved to be insurmountable financial problems and lack of access to a suitable arena; the Bisons' original arena, [[Peace Bridge Arena]], had collapsed the previous season (a new [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] team would return to the league in 1940 after [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium|a new arena]] was constructed for them). The makeshift new I-AHL played out the rest of its first season (as well as all of the next) with just seven teams.\n\nAt the end of the 1936\u201337 season, a modified three-round playoff format was devised and a new championship trophy, the [[Calder Cup]], was established. The Syracuse Stars defeated the Philadelphia Ramblers in the final, three-games-to-one, to win the first-ever Calder Cup championship. The Calder Cup continues on today as the AHL's playoff championship trophy.\n\n===Formal consolidation of the I-AHL===\n[[File:\"Hershey in Hockey League\" (from The Philadelphia Record, 6-29-1938).jpg|thumb|right]]After two seasons of interlocking play, the governors of the two leagues' seven active teams met in New York City on June 28, 1938, and agreed that it was time to formally consolidate. [[Maurice Podoloff]] of New Haven, the former head of the Can-Am League, was elected the I-AHL's first president. The former IHL president, John Chick of [[Windsor, Ontario]], became vice-president in charge of officials.\n\nThe new I-AHL also added an eighth franchise at the 1938 meeting to fill the void in its membership left by the loss of Buffalo two years earlier with the admission of the then two-time defending [[Eastern Hockey League|Eastern Amateur Hockey League]] (EAHL) champion [[Hershey Bears]].<ref>[http://hockeyscoop.net/hpa/#clip \"Hershey In Hockey League: Admitted to Circuit as American-International Loops Unite\"] The Philadelphia ''Record'', June 29, 1938</ref> The Bears remain the only one of these eight original I-AHL/AHL franchises to have been represented in the league without interruption since the 1938\u201339 season. The newly merged circuit also increased its regular-season schedule for each team by six games from 48 to 54.\n\n===Contraction, resurrection, and expansion===\nAfter the 1939\u201340 season the I-AHL renamed itself the '''American Hockey League'''. It generally enjoyed both consistent success on the ice and relative financial stability over its first three decades of operation. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, the cost of doing business in professional ice hockey began to rise sharply with NHL expansion and relocation (the NHL placed teams in Pittsburgh and Buffalo, forcing two long-time AHL clubs, the Pittsburgh Hornets and Buffalo Bisons, to fold) and especially the 1972 formation of the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA), which forced the relocation and subsequent folding of the [[Cleveland Barons (1937\u201373)|Cleveland Barons]], [[Baltimore Clippers]], and [[Quebec Aces]]. The number of major-league teams competing for players rose from six to thirty in just seven years. Player salaries at all levels shot up dramatically with the increased demand and competition for their services.\n\nThis did not seem to affect the AHL at first, as it expanded to 12 teams by 1970.  However, to help compensate for the rise in player salaries, many NHL clubs cut back on the number of players they kept under contract for development, and players under AHL contracts could now also demand much higher paychecks to remain with their clubs. As a result, half of the AHL's teams folded from 1974 to 1977. The league bottomed out in the summer of 1977, with news that the Rhode Island (formerly Providence) Reds \u2013 the last remaining uninterrupted franchise from the 1936\u201337 season, and the oldest continuously operating minor league franchise in North America \u2013 had decided to cease operations after 51 years in Rhode Island.\n\nThe AHL appeared in serious danger of folding altogether if this downward trend was not reversed. However, two events in the fall of 1977 helped reverse the trend. The first of these was the decision of the NHL's [[Philadelphia Flyers]] to return to the league as a team owner, and the second was the unexpected collapse of the [[North American Hockey League (1973\u201377)|North American Hockey League]] just weeks before the start of the 1977\u201378 season.\n\n[[File:AHL 50 Jahre.png|thumb|left|American Hockey League 50th anniversary logo]]\n\nThe Flyers' new AHL franchise became the immediately successful [[Maine Mariners]], which brought the new AHL city of [[Portland, Maine]] both the regular-season and Calder Cup playoff titles in each of that club's first two seasons of operation. The folding of the NAHL, meanwhile, suddenly left two of its stronger teams, the [[Philadelphia Firebirds (ice hockey)|Philadelphia Firebirds]] and [[Binghamton, New York]]-based [[Broome Dusters]], without a league to play in.  The owners of the Dusters solved their problem by buying the Reds franchise and moving it to Binghamton as the [[Binghamton Dusters]], while the Firebirds crossed over to the AHL from the NAHL. The Dusters and Firebirds, together with the [[Hampton Gulls]] (who had joined the league from the [[Southern Hockey League (1973\u201377)|Southern Hockey League]]), boosted the AHL to nine member clubs as the 1977\u201378 season opened. Hampton folded on February 10, 1978, but was replaced the next year by the [[New Brunswick Hawks]].  With franchise stability improving after the demise of the WHA in 1979, the league continued to grow steadily over the years, reaching 20 clubs by the 2000\u201301 season.\n\n===Absorption of the IHL===\nIn 2001\u201302, the AHL's membership jumped dramatically to 27 teams, mostly by the absorption of six teams\u2014[[Milwaukee Admirals|Milwaukee]], [[Chicago Wolves|Chicago]], [[Houston Aeros (1994\u20132013)|Houston]], [[Utah Grizzlies (1995\u20132005)|Utah]], [[Manitoba Moose|Manitoba]], and [[Grand Rapids Griffins|Grand Rapids]]\u2014from the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]].  The IHL had established itself as the second top-level minor league circuit in North America, but folded in 2001 due to financial problems. One oddity caused by the AHL's 2001 expansion was that the league had two teams with the same nickname: the Milwaukee Admirals and the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. The latter team transferred to the league from the mid-level [[ECHL]] in 2000. This situation lasted until the end of the 2014\u201315 season when the Norfolk team moved to San Diego and was replaced by another ECHL team with the same name.\n\nThe Utah Grizzlies suspended operations after the 2004\u201305 season (the franchise was sold in 2006 and returned to the ice in Cleveland in [[2007\u201308 AHL season|2007]] as the Lake Erie Monsters, now known as the [[Cleveland Monsters]]). The Chicago Wolves ([[2002 Calder Cup playoffs|2002]], [[2008 Calder Cup playoffs|2008]]), Houston Aeros ([[2003 Calder Cup playoffs|2003]]), Milwaukee Admirals ([[2004 Calder Cup playoffs|2004]]), and Grand Rapids Griffins ([[2013 Calder Cup playoffs|2013]], [[2017 Calder Cup playoffs|2017]]) have all won Calder Cup titles since joining the AHL from the IHL. Chicago and Milwaukee have also made multiple trips to the Calder Cup Finals, and Houston made their second Finals appearance in 2011.\n\nThe Manitoba Moose moved to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 2011 and were renamed the [[St. John's IceCaps]] after the NHL's [[Atlanta Thrashers]] moved to Winnipeg as the second incarnation of the [[Winnipeg Jets]]. In 2013, Houston moved to Des Moines, Iowa to become the [[Iowa Wild]]. This left Chicago, Grand Rapids and Milwaukee as the only ex-IHL teams still in their original cities until the 2015 relocations when the IceCaps moved back to Winnipeg as the Manitoba Moose.\n\n===Relocations and western shift===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width =335\n | image1 = American Hockey League 2014-15 map zoomed.svg\n | caption1 = Team locations and divisional alignment in the 2014\u201315 season prior to the franchise relocations\n | image2 = American Hockey League 2015-16 map zoomed.svg\n | caption2 = Team locations and divisions after the 2015\u201316 relocation and realignment\n}}\nBeginning with the [[2015\u201316 AHL season|2015\u201316 season]], eleven franchises have since relocated due to NHL parent clubs' influence on their development teams and players. Of the eleven relocated franchises, eight were relocated because they were directly owned by NHL teams and the NHL parent club wished to make call-ups from the AHL more practical by having closer affiliates.\n\nIn January 2015, the AHL announced the relocation of five existing AHL franchises\u2014[[Adirondack Flames|Adirondack]], [[Manchester Monarchs (AHL)|Manchester]], [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk]], [[Oklahoma City Barons|Oklahoma City]], and [[Worcester Sharks|Worcester]]\u2014to California as the basis for a new \"Pacific Division\" becoming [[Stockton Heat|Stockton]], [[Ontario Reign|Ontario]], [[San Diego Gulls|San Diego]], [[Bakersfield Condors|Bakersfield]], and [[San Jose Barracuda|San Jose]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=AHL |date=January 29, 2015 |title=AHL approves formation of Pacific Division |url=http://theahl.com/ahl-approves-formation-of-pacific-division-p196033}}</ref> The relocated teams were all affiliated and owned or purchased by teams in the NHL's [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]]. The franchise movements continued with two more relocations involving Canadian teams<ref>{{cite web |publisher=AHL |date=March 12, 2015 |title=AHL announces franchise transactions |url=http://theahl.com/ahl-announces-franchise-transactions-p196769}}</ref> with the [[St. John's IceCaps]] going back to [[Winnipeg]] as the [[Manitoba Moose]] and the [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]] becoming another iteration of the IceCaps to fulfill the arena contract in St. John's.\n\nIn the following seasons, more NHL organizations influenced league membership. In 2016, the [[Springfield Falcons]] franchise was purchased by the [[Arizona Coyotes]] and relocated to become the [[Tucson Roadrunners]] and join the one-year-old Pacific Division. The Falcons were subsequently replaced by the [[Springfield Thunderbirds]], the relocated [[Portland Pirates]] franchise under a new ownership group. The [[Montreal Canadiens]]-owned IceCaps relocated to the Montreal suburb of [[Laval, Quebec]], and became the [[Laval Rocket]] in 2017.<ref name=\"The Compass\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cbncompass.ca/Sports/IceCaps/2015-03-12/article-4074843/Montreal-Canadiens-farm-team-relocating-to-St.%E2%80%88John%26rsquo%3Bs-next-season/1 | title=Montreal Canadiens' farm team relocating to St. John's next season | publisher=The Compass | date=March 12, 2015 | accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> The [[Binghamton Senators]] were also purchased by the [[Ottawa Senators]] and were relocated to [[Belleville, Ontario]], to become the [[Belleville Senators]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nhl.com/senators/news/ottawa-senators-owner-eugene-melnyk-purchases-ahl-team-and-partners-with-city-of-belleville/c-282137476 |title=Sens Owner Purchases AHL Team Partners W/ Belleville |publisher=Ottawa Senators |date=September 26, 2016}}</ref> while the [[New Jersey Devils]]' owned [[Albany Devils]] were relocated to become the [[Binghamton Devils]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://binghamtonsenators.com/news/?article_id=2322|title=NEW JERSEY DEVILS TO RELOCATE AHL AFFILIATE TO BINGHAMTON N.Y.

The event was not played again until the 1954\u201355 season, and was then held annually until the 1959\u201360 season. In the 1994\u201395 season, the AHL revived the events again, and has been played every season since. The skills competition was first introduced for the 1995\u201396 season. From 1996 to 2010, the game took place between a team of players born outside of Canada and a team of players born within Canada. The All-Star Game was replaced by an all-star challenge between the league's divisions from the 2015\u201316 season onward. The challenge consists of six round-robin games between the league's divisions; the top two divisions in the challenge's round-robin phase advance to a six-minute championship game. The winning division of the championship game is declared the winner of the all-star challenge.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

at the 2012 AHL Winter Classic at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.]]\n{{main|AHL Outdoor Classic}}\nSince the 2009\u201310 season, at least one team in the AHL has hosted an [[list of outdoor ice hockey games|outdoor ice hockey game]] each year. The Syracuse Crunch was the first organization to put on an outdoor game in the AHL on February 20, 2010, building a rink at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse, New York, and packing a record 21,508 fans in for the [[Mirabito Outdoor Classic]] against the Binghamton Senators. The contest, which was also televised to an international audience on [[NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|NHL Network]], was won by the Crunch, 2\u20131.\n\nThe Connecticut Whale hosted the [[Whale Bowl]]\u2014the AHL's second outdoor game\u2014on February 19, 2011, as part of a 10-day Whalers Hockey Fest at [[Rentschler Field (stadium)|Rentschler Field]] in East Hartford, Conn. Attendance for Connecticut's game against the Providence Bruins was announced at 21,673, the largest in AHL history to that point. Providence won, 5\u20134, in a shootout.\n\nOn January 6, 2012, the largest crowd in AHL history saw the Adirondack Phantoms defeat the Hershey Bears, 4\u20133, in overtime before 45,653 fans at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the final event of the week-long activities associated with the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic]], which also included a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the [[New York Rangers]] on Jan 2 and an alumni game between retired players (including eight honored members of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]) of those two clubs on December 31, 2011. The contest was the third outdoor game in AHL history and it more than doubled the league's previous single-game attendance mark.\n\nOn January 21, 2012, the Steeltown Showdown between Ontario rivals the [[Toronto Marlies]] and [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]] was held at [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]] in Hamilton, Ont., with the Marlies winning 7\u20132 in front of 20,565 fans, the largest crowd ever for an AHL game in Canada. The AHL game was preceded the previous night by a game between [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]] alumni.\n\nTwo outdoor games were announced for the 2012\u201313 AHL season, but a meeting between the Grand Rapids Griffins and Toronto Marlies at [[Comerica Park]] in Detroit as part of the festivities surrounding the [[2013 NHL Winter Classic|NHL Winter Classic]] was not held because of the cancellation of the NHL Winter Classic. On January 20, 2013, the Hershey Bears and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins met outdoors at [[Hersheypark Stadium]] in Hershey, Pa. The Penguins earned a 2\u20131 overtime victory in front of 17,311 fans.\n\nThe [[Rochester Americans]] hosted an outdoor game in 2013\u201314, the [[Frozen Frontier]], which was held at [[Frontier Field]] in Rochester on December 13, 2013. The Americans took a 5\u20134 decision in a shootout against the Lake Erie Monsters before a standing-room crowd of 11,015 fans. A year after their originally scheduled date, the Griffins and Marlies played at Comerica Park on December 30, 2013, and Toronto prevailed in a shootout, 4\u20133, becoming the first AHL team ever with two outdoor wins. Attendance in Detroit was 20,337.\n\nAs part of the recent addition of the Pacific Division the AHL played its first outdoor hockey game in California during the 2015\u201316 season called the Golden State Hockey Rush. On December 18, 2015, the [[Stockton Heat]] hosted the [[Bakersfield Condors]] at [[Raley Field]] in [[West Sacramento, California]]. Stockton defeated Bakersfield 3\u20132 in front of 9,357 fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stocktonheat.com/news/grant-kylington-and-shore-lead-heat-to-3-2-win-at-raley-field/ |title=Grant, Kylington and Shore Lead Heat to 3-2 Win at Raley Field |publisher=Stockton Heat |date=December 19, 2015 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the second consecutive season the AHL played an outdoor game in California. The Bakersfield Condors were named as hosts for their second outdoor game against the [[Ontario Reign]] to be held on January 7, 2017, at Bakersfield College's [[Memorial Stadium (Bakersfield)|Memorial Stadium]] and was called the Condorstown Outdoor Classic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bakersfield.com/Sports/2016/08/23/Condors-bringing-outdoor-hockey-to-Memorial-Stadium.html |title=Condors bringing outdoor hockey to Memorial Stadium |publisher=Bakersfield.com |date=August 23, 2016}}</ref> Despite sometimes heavy rain during the first period, the game went on as scheduled and the Condors defeated the Reign 3\u20132 in overtime.\n\nAlthough technically not an outdoor game, the [[Syracuse Crunch]] defeated the [[Utica Comets]] 2\u20131 on November 22, 2014 at the [[Carrier Dome]], normally a college football stadium.\n\n==AHL Hall of Fame==\n{{Main|AHL Hall of Fame}}\nThe formation of an American Hockey League Hall of Fame was announced by the league on December 15, 2005, created to recognize, honor and celebrate individuals for their outstanding achievements and contributions specifically in the AHL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theahl.com/ahl-hall-of-fame-p135901|title=AHL Hall of Fame announces Class of '15|website=Theahl.com|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Trophies and awards==\nThe following is a list of awards of the American Hockey League.

When NHL teams do not have an AHL affiliate, players are assigned to AHL teams affiliated with other NHL teams. Twenty-seven AHL teams are located in the United States and the remaining four are in Canada. The league offices are located in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and its current president is [[David Andrews (ice hockey)|David Andrews]].\n\nIn general, a player must be at least 18 years of age to play in the AHL or not currently be beholden to a [[junior ice hockey]] team. The league limits the number of experienced professional players on a team's active roster during any given game; only five skaters can have accumulated four full seasons of play or more at the professional level (goaltenders are exempt from this rule and can stay in the AHL indefinitely without being subject to this cap).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theahl.com/faq|title=FAQ|website=Theahl.com|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref> The AHL allows for [[practice squad]] contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wivb.com/2017/10/09/gionta-to-skate-with-amerks-prepare-for-international-competition/|title=Gionta to skate with Amerks, prepare for international competition|first=Nick|last=Filipowski|publisher=WIVB-TV|date=October 9, 2017|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe annual playoff champion is awarded the [[Calder Cup]], named for [[Frank Calder]], the first President (1917\u20131943) of the NHL. The reigning champions are the [[Charlotte Checkers]].\n\n==History==\n===Predecessor leagues===\nThe AHL traces its origins directly to two predecessor professional leagues: the [[Canadian-American Hockey League]] (the \"Can-Am\" League), founded in 1926, and the first [[International Hockey League (1929\u201336)|International Hockey League]], established in 1929. Although the Can-Am League never operated with more than six teams, the departure of the [[Boston Tigers (CAHL)|Boston Bruin Cubs]] after the 1935\u201336 season reduced it down to just four member clubs \u2013 the [[Springfield Indians]], [[Philadelphia Ramblers]], [[Providence Reds]], and [[New Haven Eagles]] \u2013 for the first time in its history. At the same time, the then-rival IHL lost half of its eight members after the 1935\u201336 season, also leaving it with just four member teams: the [[Buffalo Bisons (IHL)|Buffalo Bisons]], [[Syracuse Stars]], [[Pittsburgh Hornets]], and [[Cleveland Falcons]].\n\n===1936\u201338===\nWith both leagues down to the bare minimum number of teams to be viable, the governors of both leagues recognized the need for action to assure their member clubs' long-term survival. Their solution was to play an interlocking schedule.  While the Can-Am was based in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and the IHL in the [[Great Lakes Region (North America)|Great Lakes]], their footprints were close enough for this to be a viable option. The two leagues' eight surviving clubs began joint play in November 1936 as a new two-division \"circuit of mutual convenience\" known as the '''International-American Hockey League'''.  The four Can-Am teams became the I-AHL East Division, with the IHL quartet playing as the West Division. The IHL also contributed its former championship trophy, the [[F. G. \"Teddy\" Oke Trophy]], which would go to the regular-season winners of the merged league's West Division until 1952. The Oke Trophy is now awarded to the regular-season winners of the AHL's Northeast Division.\n\nA little more than a month into that first season, the balance and symmetry of the new combined circuit suffered a setback when its membership unexpectedly fell to seven teams. The West's Buffalo Bisons were forced to cease operations on December 6, 1936, after playing just 11 games, because of what proved to be insurmountable financial problems and lack of access to a suitable arena; the Bisons' original arena, [[Peace Bridge Arena]], had collapsed the previous season (a new [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]] team would return to the league in 1940 after [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium|a new arena]] was constructed for them). The makeshift new I-AHL played out the rest of its first season (as well as all of the next) with just seven teams.\n\nAt the end of the 1936\u201337 season, a modified three-round playoff format was devised and a new championship trophy, the [[Calder Cup]], was established. The Syracuse Stars defeated the Philadelphia Ramblers in the final, three-games-to-one, to win the first-ever Calder Cup championship. The Calder Cup continues on today as the AHL's playoff championship trophy.\n\n===Formal consolidation of the I-AHL===\n[[File:\"Hershey in Hockey League\" (from The Philadelphia Record, 6-29-1938).jpg|thumb|right]]After two seasons of interlocking play, the governors of the two leagues' seven active teams met in New York City on June 28, 1938, and agreed that it was time to formally consolidate. [[Maurice Podoloff]] of New Haven, the former head of the Can-Am League, was elected the I-AHL's first president. The former IHL president, John Chick of [[Windsor, Ontario]], became vice-president in charge of officials.\n\nThe new I-AHL also added an eighth franchise at the 1938 meeting to fill the void in its membership left by the loss of Buffalo two years earlier with the admission of the then two-time defending [[Eastern Hockey League|Eastern Amateur Hockey League]] (EAHL) champion [[Hershey Bears]].<ref>[http://hockeyscoop.net/hpa/#clip \"Hershey In Hockey League: Admitted to Circuit as American-International Loops Unite\"] The Philadelphia ''Record'', June 29, 1938</ref> The Bears remain the only one of these eight original I-AHL/AHL franchises to have been represented in the league without interruption since the 1938\u201339 season. The newly merged circuit also increased its regular-season schedule for each team by six games from 48 to 54.\n\n===Contraction, resurrection, and expansion===\nAfter the 1939\u201340 season the I-AHL renamed itself the '''American Hockey League'''. It generally enjoyed both consistent success on the ice and relative financial stability over its first three decades of operation. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, the cost of doing business in professional ice hockey began to rise sharply with NHL expansion and relocation (the NHL placed teams in Pittsburgh and Buffalo, forcing two long-time AHL clubs, the Pittsburgh Hornets and Buffalo Bisons, to fold) and especially the 1972 formation of the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA), which forced the relocation and subsequent folding of the [[Cleveland Barons (1937\u201373)|Cleveland Barons]], [[Baltimore Clippers]], and [[Quebec Aces]]. The number of major-league teams competing for players rose from six to thirty in just seven years. Player salaries at all levels shot up dramatically with the increased demand and competition for their services.\n\nThis did not seem to affect the AHL at first, as it expanded to 12 teams by 1970.  However, to help compensate for the rise in player salaries, many NHL clubs cut back on the number of players they kept under contract for development, and players under AHL contracts could now also demand much higher paychecks to remain with their clubs. As a result, half of the AHL's teams folded from 1974 to 1977. The league bottomed out in the summer of 1977, with news that the Rhode Island (formerly Providence) Reds \u2013 the last remaining uninterrupted franchise from the 1936\u201337 season, and the oldest continuously operating minor league franchise in North America \u2013 had decided to cease operations after 51 years in Rhode Island.\n\nThe AHL appeared in serious danger of folding altogether if this downward trend was not reversed. However, two events in the fall of 1977 helped reverse the trend. The first of these was the decision of the NHL's [[Philadelphia Flyers]] to return to the league as a team owner, and the second was the unexpected collapse of the [[North American Hockey League (1973\u201377)|North American Hockey League]] just weeks before the start of the 1977\u201378 season.\n\n[[File:AHL 50 Jahre.png|thumb|left|American Hockey League 50th anniversary logo]]\n\nThe Flyers' new AHL franchise became the immediately successful [[Maine Mariners]], which brought the new AHL city of [[Portland, Maine]] both the regular-season and Calder Cup playoff titles in each of that club's first two seasons of operation. The folding of the NAHL, meanwhile, suddenly left two of its stronger teams, the [[Philadelphia Firebirds (ice hockey)|Philadelphia Firebirds]] and [[Binghamton, New York]]-based [[Broome Dusters]], without a league to play in.  The owners of the Dusters solved their problem by buying the Reds franchise and moving it to Binghamton as the [[Binghamton Dusters]], while the Firebirds crossed over to the AHL from the NAHL. The Dusters and Firebirds, together with the [[Hampton Gulls]] (who had joined the league from the [[Southern Hockey League (1973\u201377)|Southern Hockey League]]), boosted the AHL to nine member clubs as the 1977\u201378 season opened. Hampton folded on February 10, 1978, but was replaced the next year by the [[New Brunswick Hawks]].  With franchise stability improving after the demise of the WHA in 1979, the league continued to grow steadily over the years, reaching 20 clubs by the 2000\u201301 season.\n\n===Absorption of the IHL===\nIn 2001\u201302, the AHL's membership jumped dramatically to 27 teams, mostly by the absorption of six teams\u2014[[Milwaukee Admirals|Milwaukee]], [[Chicago Wolves|Chicago]], [[Houston Aeros (1994\u20132013)|Houston]], [[Utah Grizzlies (1995\u20132005)|Utah]], [[Manitoba Moose|Manitoba]], and [[Grand Rapids Griffins|Grand Rapids]]\u2014from the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]].  The IHL had established itself as the second top-level minor league circuit in North America, but folded in 2001 due to financial problems. One oddity caused by the AHL's 2001 expansion was that the league had two teams with the same nickname: the Milwaukee Admirals and the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. The latter team transferred to the league from the mid-level [[ECHL]] in 2000. This situation lasted until the end of the 2014\u201315 season when the Norfolk team moved to San Diego and was replaced by another ECHL team with the same name.\n\nThe Utah Grizzlies suspended operations after the 2004\u201305 season (the franchise was sold in 2006 and returned to the ice in Cleveland in [[2007\u201308 AHL season|2007]] as the Lake Erie Monsters, now known as the [[Cleveland Monsters]]). The Chicago Wolves ([[2002 Calder Cup playoffs|2002]], [[2008 Calder Cup playoffs|2008]]), Houston Aeros ([[2003 Calder Cup playoffs|2003]]), Milwaukee Admirals ([[2004 Calder Cup playoffs|2004]]), and Grand Rapids Griffins ([[2013 Calder Cup playoffs|2013]], [[2017 Calder Cup playoffs|2017]]) have all won Calder Cup titles since joining the AHL from the IHL. Chicago and Milwaukee have also made multiple trips to the Calder Cup Finals, and Houston made their second Finals appearance in 2011.\n\nThe Manitoba Moose moved to [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 2011 and were renamed the [[St. John's IceCaps]] after the NHL's [[Atlanta Thrashers]] moved to Winnipeg as the second incarnation of the [[Winnipeg Jets]]. In 2013, Houston moved to Des Moines, Iowa to become the [[Iowa Wild]]. This left Chicago, Grand Rapids and Milwaukee as the only ex-IHL teams still in their original cities until the 2015 relocations when the IceCaps moved back to Winnipeg as the Manitoba Moose.\n\n===Relocations and western shift===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width =335\n | image1 = American Hockey League 2014-15 map zoomed.svg\n | caption1 = Team locations and divisional alignment in the 2014\u201315 season prior to the franchise relocations\n | image2 = American Hockey League 2015-16 map zoomed.svg\n | caption2 = Team locations and divisions after the 2015\u201316 relocation and realignment\n}}\nBeginning with the [[2015\u201316 AHL season|2015\u201316 season]], eleven franchises have since relocated due to NHL parent clubs' influence on their development teams and players. Of the eleven relocated franchises, eight were relocated because they were directly owned by NHL teams and the NHL parent club wished to make call-ups from the AHL more practical by having closer affiliates.\n\nIn January 2015, the AHL announced the relocation of five existing AHL franchises\u2014[[Adirondack Flames|Adirondack]], [[Manchester Monarchs (AHL)|Manchester]], [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk]], [[Oklahoma City Barons|Oklahoma City]], and [[Worcester Sharks|Worcester]]\u2014to California as the basis for a new \"Pacific Division\" becoming [[Stockton Heat|Stockton]], [[Ontario Reign|Ontario]], [[San Diego Gulls|San Diego]], [[Bakersfield Condors|Bakersfield]], and [[San Jose Barracuda|San Jose]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=AHL |date=January 29, 2015 |title=AHL approves formation of Pacific Division |url=http://theahl.com/ahl-approves-formation-of-pacific-division-p196033}}</ref> The relocated teams were all affiliated and owned or purchased by teams in the NHL's [[Pacific Division (NHL)|Pacific Division]]. The franchise movements continued with two more relocations involving Canadian teams<ref>{{cite web |publisher=AHL |date=March 12, 2015 |title=AHL announces franchise transactions |url=http://theahl.com/ahl-announces-franchise-transactions-p196769}}</ref> with the [[St. John's IceCaps]] going back to [[Winnipeg]] as the [[Manitoba Moose]] and the [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]] becoming another iteration of the IceCaps to fulfill the arena contract in St. John's.\n\nIn the following seasons, more NHL organizations influenced league membership. In 2016, the [[Springfield Falcons]] franchise was purchased by the [[Arizona Coyotes]] and relocated to become the [[Tucson Roadrunners]] and join the one-year-old Pacific Division. The Falcons were subsequently replaced by the [[Springfield Thunderbirds]], the relocated [[Portland Pirates]] franchise under a new ownership group. The [[Montreal Canadiens]]-owned IceCaps relocated to the Montreal suburb of [[Laval, Quebec]], and became the [[Laval Rocket]] in 2017.<ref name=\"The Compass\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cbncompass.ca/Sports/IceCaps/2015-03-12/article-4074843/Montreal-Canadiens-farm-team-relocating-to-St.%E2%80%88John%26rsquo%3Bs-next-season/1 | title=Montreal Canadiens' farm team relocating to St. John's next season | publisher=The Compass | date=March 12, 2015 | accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> The [[Binghamton Senators]] were also purchased by the [[Ottawa Senators]] and were relocated to [[Belleville, Ontario]], to become the [[Belleville Senators]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nhl.com/senators/news/ottawa-senators-owner-eugene-melnyk-purchases-ahl-team-and-partners-with-city-of-belleville/c-282137476 |title=Sens Owner Purchases AHL Team Partners W/ Belleville |publisher=Ottawa Senators |date=September 26, 2016}}</ref> while the [[New Jersey Devils]]' owned [[Albany Devils]] were relocated to become the [[Binghamton Devils]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://binghamtonsenators.com/news/?article_id=2322|title=NEW JERSEY DEVILS TO RELOCATE AHL AFFILIATE TO BINGHAMTON N.Y.

The event was not played again until the 1954\u201355 season, and was then held annually until the 1959\u201360 season. In the 1994\u201395 season, the AHL revived the events again, and has been played every season since. The skills competition was first introduced for the 1995\u201396 season. From 1996 to 2010, the game took place between a team of players born outside of Canada and a team of players born within Canada. The All-Star Game was replaced by an all-star challenge between the league's divisions from the 2015\u201316 season onward. The challenge consists of six round-robin games between the league's divisions; the top two divisions in the challenge's round-robin phase advance to a six-minute championship game. The winning division of the championship game is declared the winner of the all-star challenge.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

at the 2012 AHL Winter Classic at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.]]\n{{main|AHL Outdoor Classic}}\nSince the 2009\u201310 season, at least one team in the AHL has hosted an [[list of outdoor ice hockey games|outdoor ice hockey game]] each year. The Syracuse Crunch was the first organization to put on an outdoor game in the AHL on February 20, 2010, building a rink at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse, New York, and packing a record 21,508 fans in for the [[Mirabito Outdoor Classic]] against the Binghamton Senators. The contest, which was also televised to an international audience on [[NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|NHL Network]], was won by the Crunch, 2\u20131.\n\nThe Connecticut Whale hosted the [[Whale Bowl]]\u2014the AHL's second outdoor game\u2014on February 19, 2011, as part of a 10-day Whalers Hockey Fest at [[Rentschler Field (stadium)|Rentschler Field]] in East Hartford, Conn. Attendance for Connecticut's game against the Providence Bruins was announced at 21,673, the largest in AHL history to that point. Providence won, 5\u20134, in a shootout.\n\nOn January 6, 2012, the largest crowd in AHL history saw the Adirondack Phantoms defeat the Hershey Bears, 4\u20133, in overtime before 45,653 fans at [[Citizens Bank Park]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the final event of the week-long activities associated with the [[2012 NHL Winter Classic]], which also included a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the [[New York Rangers]] on Jan 2 and an alumni game between retired players (including eight honored members of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]) of those two clubs on December 31, 2011. The contest was the third outdoor game in AHL history and it more than doubled the league's previous single-game attendance mark.\n\nOn January 21, 2012, the Steeltown Showdown between Ontario rivals the [[Toronto Marlies]] and [[Hamilton Bulldogs (AHL)|Hamilton Bulldogs]] was held at [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]] in Hamilton, Ont., with the Marlies winning 7\u20132 in front of 20,565 fans, the largest crowd ever for an AHL game in Canada. The AHL game was preceded the previous night by a game between [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Montreal Canadiens]] alumni.\n\nTwo outdoor games were announced for the 2012\u201313 AHL season, but a meeting between the Grand Rapids Griffins and Toronto Marlies at [[Comerica Park]] in Detroit as part of the festivities surrounding the [[2013 NHL Winter Classic|NHL Winter Classic]] was not held because of the cancellation of the NHL Winter Classic. On January 20, 2013, the Hershey Bears and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins met outdoors at [[Hersheypark Stadium]] in Hershey, Pa. The Penguins earned a 2\u20131 overtime victory in front of 17,311 fans.\n\nThe [[Rochester Americans]] hosted an outdoor game in 2013\u201314, the [[Frozen Frontier]], which was held at [[Frontier Field]] in Rochester on December 13, 2013. The Americans took a 5\u20134 decision in a shootout against the Lake Erie Monsters before a standing-room crowd of 11,015 fans. A year after their originally scheduled date, the Griffins and Marlies played at Comerica Park on December 30, 2013, and Toronto prevailed in a shootout, 4\u20133, becoming the first AHL team ever with two outdoor wins. Attendance in Detroit was 20,337.\n\nAs part of the recent addition of the Pacific Division the AHL played its first outdoor hockey game in California during the 2015\u201316 season called the Golden State Hockey Rush. On December 18, 2015, the [[Stockton Heat]] hosted the [[Bakersfield Condors]] at [[Raley Field]] in [[West Sacramento, California]]. Stockton defeated Bakersfield 3\u20132 in front of 9,357 fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stocktonheat.com/news/grant-kylington-and-shore-lead-heat-to-3-2-win-at-raley-field/ |title=Grant, Kylington and Shore Lead Heat to 3-2 Win at Raley Field |publisher=Stockton Heat |date=December 19, 2015 |accessdate=January 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFor the second consecutive season the AHL played an outdoor game in California.

{"title_page": "Endgame tablebase", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{good article}}\n[[File:Chess tablebase query.png|thumb|380px|A typical interface for querying a tablebase]]\n\nAn '''endgame tablebase''' is a computerized [[database]] that contains precalculated exhaustive analysis of  [[chess]] [[Chess endgame|endgame]] positions.  It is typically used by a computer chess engine during play, or by a human or computer that is retrospectively analysing a game that has already been played.\n\nThe tablebase contains the [[game theory|game-theoretical]] value (win, loss, or [[draw (chess)|draw]]) of each possible move in each possible position, and how many moves it would take to achieve that result with [[perfect play]]. Thus, the tablebase acts as an [[oracle machine|oracle]], always providing the optimal moves. Typically the database records each possible position with certain [[chess piece|pieces]] remaining on the board, and the best moves with [[White and Black in chess|White]] to move and with [[White and Black in chess|Black]] to move.\n\nTablebases are generated by [[retrograde analysis]], working backwards from a [[checkmate]]d position. By 2005, all chess positions with up to six pieces (including the two [[king (chess)|kings]]) had been solved. By August 2012, tablebases had solved chess for every position with up to seven pieces (the positions with a lone king versus a king and five pieces were omitted because they were considered to be \"rather obvious\").<ref>[https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Endgame+Tablebases#x7-man EGTBs Chessprogramming website]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lomonosov Endgame Tablebases|work=ChessOK|url=http://chessok.com/?page_id=27966}}</ref>\n\nThe solutions have profoundly advanced the chess community's understanding of [[Chess endgame#Effect of tablebases on endgame theory|endgame theory]].  Some positions which humans had analyzed as draws were proven to be winnable; the tablebase analysis could find a mate in more than five hundred moves, far beyond the [[horizon effect|horizon]] of humans, and beyond the capability of a computer during play. For this reason, they have also called into question the [[Fifty-move rule|50-move rule]] since many positions are now seen to exist that are a win for one side but would be drawn because of the 50-move rule. Tablebases have enhanced competitive play and facilitated the composition of [[endgame studies]]. They provide a powerful analytical tool.\n\nWhile endgame tablebases for other board games like [[checkers]],<ref>[http://edgilbert.org/Checkers/KingsRow.htm Website] of [[KingsRow]] about the creation of a tablebases for 8x8 and 10x10 checkers</ref> [[chess variant]]s<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114510/http://www.gothicchess.com/javascript_endings.html gothicchess.com]; examples of long endings for [[Capablanca chess]]</ref> or [[nine men's morris]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.msri.org/books/Book29/files/gasser.pdf|title=Solving nine men's morris|author=Ralpf Gasser|year=1996}}</ref> exist, when a game is not specified, it is assumed to be chess.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=tocleft}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Computer chess}}\nPhysical limitations of [[personal computer hardware|computer hardware]] aside, in principle it is possible to [[solved game|solve any game]] under the condition that the [[Perfect information|complete state is known]] and there is no [[Game of chance|random chance]].

[[Weak solution]]s exist for somewhat more complex games, such as [[English draughts|checkers]] (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and [[Go (game)|Go]], have not been solved because their [[game complexity]] is far too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.\n\n[[Computer chess]] is one of the oldest domains of [[artificial intelligence]], having begun in the early 1930s.  [[Claude Shannon]] proposed formal criteria for evaluating chess moves in 1949.  In 1951, [[Alan Turing]] designed a primitive chess playing program, which assigned values for material and [[mobility (chess)|mobility]]; the program \"played\" chess based on Turing's manual calculations.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 25-38</ref>  However, even as competent chess programs began to develop, they exhibited a glaring weakness in playing the endgame.  Programmers added specific [[heuristic]]s for the endgame \u2013 for example, the [[king (chess)|king]] should move to the center of the board.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 129-30</ref>  However, a more comprehensive solution was needed.\n\nIn 1965, [[Richard Bellman]] proposed the creation of a database to solve chess and [[checkers]] endgames using [[retrograde analysis]].<ref>Stiller, p. 84</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=R. E. Bellman | title=On the application of dynamic programming to the determination of optimal play in chess and checkers | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=53 | issue=2 | pages=244\u2013246 |date=February 1965 | doi=10.1073/pnas.53.2.244| pmid=16591252 | pmc=219499 }}</ref> Instead of analyzing ''forward'' from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze ''backward'' from positions where one player was [[checkmate]]d or [[stalemate]]d. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.\n\nIn 1970, Thomas Str\u00f6hlein published a doctoral thesis<ref>{{cite book | author=T.

Every position can be defined by its distance (i.e. the number of moves) from the desired endpoint.  Two metrics are generally used:\n* '''Depth to mate''' (DTM). A checkmate is the only way to win a game.\n* '''Depth to conversion''' (DTC). The stronger side can also win by capturing material, thus converting to a simpler endgame.  For example, in KQKR, conversion occurs when White captures the Black rook.\nHaworth has discussed two other metrics, namely \"depth to zeroing-move\" (DTZ) and \"depth by the rule\" (DTR). A zeroing-move is a move which resets the move count to zero under the fifty-move rule, i.e. mate, a capture, or a pawn move.<ref name=\"haworthoptimisation\">{{cite journal\n | author=G. McC.

How White should proceed depends on which metric is used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metric\n! Play\n! DTC\n! DTM\n|-\n| DTC\n| 1. Qxd1 Kc8 2. Qd2 Kb8 3. Qd8#\n| 1\n| 3\n|-\n| DTM\n| 1. Qc7+ Ka8 2. Qa7#\n| 2\n| 2\n|}\n\nAccording to the DTC metric, White should capture the rook because that leads immediately to a position which will certainly win (DTC = 1), but it will take two more moves actually to checkmate (DTM = 3). In contrast according to the DTM metric, White mates in two moves, so DTM = DTC = 2.\n\nThis difference is typical of many endgames. Usually DTC is smaller than DTM, but the DTM metric leads to the quickest checkmate. Exceptions occur where the weaker side has only a king, and in the unusual endgame of [[Two knights endgame#Troitsky line|two knights versus one pawn]]; then DTC = DTM because either there is no defending material to capture or capturing the material does no good. (Indeed, capturing the defending pawn in the latter endgame results in a draw, unless it results in immediate mate.)\n\n=== Step 1: Generating all possible positions ===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| David Levy, ''How Computers Play Chess''\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n| The ten unique squares (with symmetry)\n}}\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| The twenty four unique pawn squares (with symmetry)\n}}\nOnce a metric is chosen, the first step is to generate all the positions with a given material.  For example, to generate a DTM tablebase for the endgame of king and queen versus king (KQK), the computer must describe approximately 40,000 unique legal positions.\n\nLevy and Newborn explain that the number 40,000 derives from a [[symmetry]] argument.  The Black king can be placed on any of ten squares: a1, b1, c1, d1, b2, c2, d2, c3, d3, and d4 (see diagram).  On any other square, its position can be considered equivalent by symmetry of rotation or reflection.  Thus, there is no difference whether a Black king in a corner resides on a1, a8, h8, or h1.  Multiply this number of 10 by at most 60 (legal remaining) squares for placing the White king and then by at most 62 squares for the White queen.  The product 10\u00d760\u00d762 = 37,200.  Several hundred of these positions are illegal, impossible, or symmetrical reflections of each other, so the actual number is somewhat smaller.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 140-43</ref><ref>See also Stiller 1995:93-98.</ref>\n\nFor each position, the tablebase evaluates the situation separately for White-to-move and Black-to-move.  Assuming that White has the queen, almost all the positions are White wins, with checkmate forced in no more than ten moves.  Some positions are draws because of [[stalemate]] or the unavoidable loss of the queen.\n\nEach additional piece added to a [[pawnless chess endgame|pawnless endgame]] multiplies the number of unique positions by about a factor of sixty which is the approximate number of squares not already occupied by other pieces.\n\nEndgames with one or more pawns increase the complexity because the symmetry argument is reduced. Since pawns can move forward but not sideways, rotation and vertical reflection of the board produces a fundamental change in the nature of the position.<ref name=\"MullerEGTB\">{{cite web|title=EGTB generator|author=Muller, H.G.|url=http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/EGTB.html|accessdate=2009-05-03|quote=Pawns would break the front-back and diagonal symmetries, because they care about direction in their moves.}}</ref> The best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in the rectangle a2-a7-d7-d2.  All other pieces and pawns may be located in any of the 64 squares with respect to the pawn.  Thus, an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24/10 = 2.4 times a pawnless endgame with the same number of pieces.\n\n=== Step 2: Evaluating positions using retrograde analysis ===\n[[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] explains the process of generating a tablebase as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"The idea is that a database is made with all possible positions with a given material [note: as in the preceding section]. Then a subdatabase is made of all positions where Black is mated. Then one where White can give mate. Then one where Black cannot stop White giving mate next move. Then one where White can always reach a position where Black cannot stop him from giving mate next move. And so on, always a ply further away from mate until all positions that are thus connected to mate have been found. Then all of these positions are linked back to mate by the shortest path through the database. That means that, apart from 'equi-optimal' moves, all the moves in such a path are perfect: White's move always leads to the quickest mate, Black's move always leads to the slowest mate.\"<ref name=\"stillermonsters\">{{cite web | author=Tim Krabb\u00e9. | title=Stiller's Monsters or Perfection in Chess. | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess/perfect.htm | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[retrograde analysis]] is only necessary from the [[checkmate]]d positions, because every position that cannot be reached by moving backwards from a checkmated position must be a draw.<ref name=\"tay\">{{cite web\n | url=http://horizonchess.com/FAQ/Winboard/egtb.html\n | title=A guide to Endgames Tablebase\n | author=Aaron Tay\n | accessdate=2009-05-02\n}}</ref>\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the idea of retrograde analysis. White can force mate in two moves by playing 1. Kc6, leading to the position in Figure 2. There are only two legal moves for black from this position, both of which lead to checkmate: if 1...Kb8 2. Qb7#, and if 1...Kd8 2. Qd7# (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3, before White's second move, is defined as \"mate in one [[ply (game theory)|ply]].\" Figure 2, after White's first move, is \"mate in two ply,\" regardless of how Black plays. Finally, the initial position in Figure 1 is \"mate in three ply\" (i.e., two moves) because it leads directly to Figure 2, which is already defined as \"mate in two ply.\" This process, which links a current position to another position that could have existed one ply earlier, can continue indefinitely.\n\nEach position is evaluated as a win or loss in a certain number of moves. At the end of the retrograde analysis, positions which are not designated as wins or losses are necessarily draws.\n\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 1\n\n|  |  |kd|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to move: mate in three ply (Kc6)}}\n|}\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 2\n\n|  |  |kd|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |kl|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| Black to move: mate in two ply (Kd8 or Kb8)}}\n|}\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 3\n\n|  |  |  |kd|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |kl|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to move: mate in one ply (Qd7)}}\n|}\n{{-}}\n\n=== Step 3: Verification ===\nAfter the tablebase has been generated, and every position has been evaluated, the result must be verified independently.  The purpose is to check the [[Consistency|self-consistency]] of the tablebase results.<ref name=\"Bourzutschky7man\">{{cite web | author=M. Bourzutschky | title=7-man endgames with pawns | publisher=[[CCRL]] Discussion Board | date=2006-08-27 | url=http://kirill-kryukov.com/chess/discussion-board/viewtopic.php?t=805 | accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in Figure 1 above, the verification program sees the evaluation \"mate in three ply (Kc6).\"  It then looks at the position in Figure 2, ''after'' Kc6, and sees the evaluation \"mate in two ply.\"  These two evaluations are consistent with each other.  If the evaluation of Figure 2 were anything else, it would be inconsistent with Figure 1, so the tablebase would need to be corrected.{{Clarify|reason=if there were a problem and position 1 were actually mate in a lesser number (in this case mate) this verification process would miss it.|date=May 2012}}\n\n=== Captures, pawn promotion, and special moves ===\nA four-piece tablebase must rely on three-piece tablebases that could result if one piece is captured. Similarly, a tablebase containing a pawn must be able to rely on other tablebases that deal with the new set of material after [[promotion (chess)|pawn promotion]] to a queen or other piece.  The retrograde analysis program must account for the possibility of a capture or pawn promotion on the previous move.<ref>Stiller, pp. 99-100</ref>\n\nTablebases assume that [[castling]] is not possible for two reasons.  First, in practical endgames, this assumption is almost always correct. (However, castling is allowed by convention in [[Chess problem|composed problems]] and [[Endgame study|studies]].) Second, if the king and rook are on their original squares, castling may or may not be allowed. Because of this ambiguity, it would be necessary to make separate evaluations for states in which castling is or is not possible.\n\nThe same ambiguity exists for the ''[[en passant]]'' capture, since the possibility of ''en passant'' depends on the opponent's previous move.  However, practical applications of ''en passant'' occur frequently in pawn endgames, so tablebases account for the possibility of ''en passant'' for positions where both sides have at least one pawn.\n\n=== Using ''a priori'' information ===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |kl\n|rl|  |  |  |bd|kd|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pd|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| An example of the KRP(a2)KBP(a3) endgame.

Other White moves draw.\n}}\nAccording to the method described above, the tablebase must allow the possibility that a given piece might occupy any of the 64 squares.  In some positions, it is possible to restrict the search space without affecting the result.  This saves computational resources and enables searches which would otherwise be impossible.\n\nAn early analysis of this type was published in 1987, in the endgame {{abbr|KRP(a2)KBP(a3)|a king, a rook and a pawn on a2 versus a king, a bishop and a pawn on a3}}, where the Black bishop moves on the dark squares (see example position at right).<ref>{{cite journal | author=H.

For example, if the Black pawn is captured, look up the newly created position in KRPKB.\n# The White pawn stays on a2; capture moves are handled by the 1st rule.\n# The Black pawn stays on a3; capture moves are handled by the 1st rule.<ref>{{cite web | author=E.

Reducing the search space by a factor of 2,256 facilitates a much quicker calculation.\n\nBleicher has designed a commercial program called \"Freezer,\" which allows users to build new tablebases from existing Nalimov tablebases with ''a priori'' information.  The program could produce a tablebase for positions with seven or more pieces with blocked pawns, even before tablebases for seven pieces became available.<ref>{{cite web | author=K.

According to that rule, if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move, either player may claim a draw.  [[FIDE]] changed the rules several times, starting in 1974, to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win. In 1988, FIDE allowed seventy-five moves for KBBKN, KNNKP, KQKBB, KQKNN, KRBKR, and KQPKQ with the pawn on the seventh rank, because tablebases had uncovered positions in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win. In 1992, FIDE canceled these exceptions and restored the fifty-move rule to its original standing.<ref name=\"haworthoptimisation\"/> Thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost, when it is in fact drawn by the fifty-move rule. In 2013, [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]] changed the rules for correspondence chess tournaments starting from 2014; a player may claim a win or draw based on six-man tablebases.<ref>[http://www.iccf.com/message?message=624 The introduction of table base claims] by Eric Ruch - [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]] President</ref> In this case the fifty-move rule is not applied, and the number of moves to mate is not taken into consideration.\n\nHaworth has designed a tablebase that produces results consistent with the fifty-move rule. However most tablebases search for the theoretical limits of forced mate, even if it requires several hundred moves.\n\n=== Computer chess ===\nThe knowledge contained in tablebases affords the computer a tremendous advantage in the endgame. Not only can computers play perfectly within an endgame, but they can simplify to a winning tablebase position from a more complicated endgame.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3314\n | author=Steven A.

The adverse effect could be a premature resignation, or an inferior line of play that loses with less resistance than a play without tablebase might offer.\n\nAnother drawback is that tablebases require a lot of [[computer memory|memory]] to store the many thousands of positions.

Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e., without suffering from the [[horizon effect]]). It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.\n\nSyzygy tablebases were developed by Ronald de Man, released in April 2013, in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search.  This variety consists of two tables per endgame: a smaller WDL (win/draw/loss) table which contains knowledge of the 50-move rule, and a larger DTZ table (distance to zero ply, i.e., pawn move or capture).  The WDL tables were designed to be small enough to fit on a [[solid-state drive]] for quick access during search, whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game-theoretically quickest distance to resetting the 50-move rule while retaining a winning position, instead of performing a search.

The composer intended 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! as the main line of the solution, but a tablebase revealed that 1. h4 wins without castling.\n}}\n\nSince many composed [[endgame studies]] deal with positions that exist in tablebases, their soundness can be checked using the tablebases.  Some studies have been proved unsound by the tablebases.  That can be either because the composer's solution does not work, or else because there is an equally effective alternative that the composer did not consider.  Another way tablebases [[Glossary_of_chess_problems#cook|cook]] studies is a change in the evaluation of an endgame.  For instance, the endgame with a queen and bishop versus two rooks was thought to be a draw, but tablebases proved it to be a win for the queen and bishop, so almost all studies based on this endgame are unsound.<ref>Nunn, pp. 367-68</ref>\n\nFor example, Erik Pogosyants composed the study at right, with White to play and win. His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! A tablebase discovered that 1. h4 also wins for White in 33 moves, even though Black can capture the pawn (which is not the best move \u2013 in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves, while Kh1-g2 loses in 32 moves). Incidentally, the tablebase does not recognize the composer's solution because it includes castling.<ref>{{cite web | author=Tim Krabb\u00e9 | work=Open chess diary | title=324.

Composers can search tablebases for interesting positions, such as [[zugzwang]], using a method called [[Examples of data mining#Games|data mining]].  For all three- to five-piece endgames and pawnless six-piece endgames, a complete list of [[Zugzwang#Reciprocal zugzwang|mutual zugzwangs]] has been tabulated and published.<ref>{{cite journal | author=G.

In 2003, the endgame composer and expert [[John Roycroft]] summarized the debate:\n\n<blockquote>[N]ot only do opinions diverge widely, but they are frequently adhered to strongly, even vehemently: at one extreme is the view that since we can never be certain that a computer has been used it is pointless to attempt a distinction, so we should simply evaluate a 'study' on its content, without reference to its origins; at the other extreme is the view that using  a 'mouse' to lift an interesting position from a ready-made computer-generated list is in no sense composing, so we should outlaw every such position.<ref name=\"EG194editorial\">{{cite journal | author=A.

He continues, \"One thing alone is clear to us: the distinction between classical composing and computer composing should be preserved for as long as possible: if there is a name associated with a study diagram that name is a claim of authorship.\"<ref name=\"EG194editorial\"/>\n\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| Harold van der Heijden, 2001\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |pl\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|kl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |kd|rd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to play and draw\n}}\n[[Mark Dvoretsky]], an [[International Master]], chess trainer, and author, took a more permissive stance.  He was commenting in 2006 on a study by [[Harold van der Heijden]], published in 2001, which reached the position at right after three introductory moves.  The drawing move for White is 4. Kb4!! (and not 4. Kb5), based on a mutual zugzwang that may occur three moves later.\n\nDvoretsky comments: <blockquote>Here, we should touch on one delicate question. I am sure that this unique endgame position was discovered with the help of Thompson\u2019s famous computer database. Is this a 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? <p> Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no doubt, we could probably extract yet more unique positions \u2013 there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.<ref>{{cite web | author=M.

This name appeared in both ''[[EG (chess)|EG]]'' and the ''[[ICCA Journal]]'' starting in the 1970s, and is sometimes used today. According to Haworth, the ''ICCA Journal'' first used the word \"tablebase\" in connection with chess endgames in 1995.<ref>{{cite journal\n | journal=EG\n | issue=137\n | year=1995\n | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg137.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=Tablebases and Tables\n | author=Guy Haworth\n | accessdate=2007-05-04\n | pages=151\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206235341/http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg137.pdf\n | archive-date=6 February 2012\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref> According to that source, a tablebase contains a complete set of information, but a database might lack some information.\n\nHaworth prefers the term \"Endgame Table\", and has used it in the articles he has authored.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/view/creators/90000763.html\n | publisher=The University of Reading\n | work=Information Systems at Reading\n | title=Publications for Mr Guy Haworth\n | accessdate=2009-06-20\n}}</ref> Roycroft has used the term \"oracle database\" throughout his magazine, ''EG''.<ref>For example, in {{cite journal\n | journal=EG\n | issue=135\n | pages=9\n | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg135.pdf\n | title=Proposal For The Guidance Of Tourney Organisers, Composers And Judges: 0.

tablebase''' is a computerized [[database]] that contains precalculated exhaustive analysis of  [[chess]] [[Chess endgame|endgame]] positions.  It is typically used by a computer chess engine during play, or by a human or computer that is retrospectively analysing a game that has already been played.\n\nThe tablebase contains the [[game theory|game-theoretical]] value (win, loss, or [[draw (chess)|draw]]) of each possible move in each possible position, and how many moves it would take to achieve that result with [[perfect play]]. Thus, the tablebase acts as an [[oracle machine|oracle]], always providing the optimal moves. Typically the database records each possible position with certain [[chess piece|pieces]] remaining on the board, and the best moves with [[White and Black in chess|White]] to move and with [[White and Black in chess|Black]] to move.\n\nTablebases are generated by [[retrograde analysis]], working backwards from a [[checkmate]]d position. By 2005, all chess positions with up to six pieces (including the two [[king (chess)|kings]]) had been solved. By August 2012, tablebases had solved chess for every position with up to seven pieces (the positions with a lone king versus a king and five pieces were omitted because they were considered to be \"rather obvious\").<ref>[https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Endgame+Tablebases#x7-man EGTBs Chessprogramming website]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Lomonosov Endgame Tablebases|work=ChessOK|url=http://chessok.com/?page_id=27966}}</ref>\n\nThe solutions have profoundly advanced the chess community's understanding of [[Chess endgame#Effect of tablebases on endgame theory|endgame theory]].  Some positions which humans had analyzed as draws were proven to be winnable; the tablebase analysis could find a mate in more than five hundred moves, far beyond the [[horizon effect|horizon]] of humans, and beyond the capability of a computer during play. For this reason, they have also called into question the [[Fifty-move rule|50-move rule]] since many positions are now seen to exist that are a win for one side but would be drawn because of the 50-move rule. Tablebases have enhanced competitive play and facilitated the composition of [[endgame studies]]. They provide a powerful analytical tool.\n\nWhile endgame tablebases for other board games like [[checkers]],<ref>[http://edgilbert.org/Checkers/KingsRow.htm Website] of [[KingsRow]] about the creation of a tablebases for 8x8 and 10x10 checkers</ref> [[chess variant]]s<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114510/http://www.gothicchess.com/javascript_endings.html gothicchess.com]; examples of long endings for [[Capablanca chess]]</ref> or [[nine men's morris]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.msri.org/books/Book29/files/gasser.pdf|title=Solving nine men's morris|author=Ralpf Gasser|year=1996}}</ref> exist, when a game is not specified, it is assumed to be chess.\n{{algebraic notation|pos=tocleft}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Computer chess}}\nPhysical limitations of [[personal computer hardware|computer hardware]] aside, in principle it is possible to [[solved game|solve any game]] under the condition that the [[Perfect information|complete state is known]] and there is no [[Game of chance|random chance]].

[[Weak solution]]s exist for somewhat more complex games, such as [[English draughts|checkers]] (with perfect play on both sides the game is known to be a draw, but it is not known for every position created by less-than-perfect play what the perfect next move would be). Other games, such as chess (from the starting position) and [[Go (game)|Go]], have not been solved because their [[game complexity]] is far too vast for computers to evaluate all possible positions. To reduce the game complexity, researchers have modified these complex games by reducing the size of the board, or the number of pieces, or both.\n\n[[Computer chess]] is one of the oldest domains of [[artificial intelligence]], having begun in the early 1930s.  [[Claude Shannon]] proposed formal criteria for evaluating chess moves in 1949.  In 1951, [[Alan Turing]] designed a primitive chess playing program, which assigned values for material and [[mobility (chess)|mobility]]; the program \"played\" chess based on Turing's manual calculations.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 25-38</ref>  However, even as competent chess programs began to develop, they exhibited a glaring weakness in playing the endgame.  Programmers added specific [[heuristic]]s for the endgame \u2013 for example, the [[king (chess)|king]] should move to the center of the board.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 129-30</ref>  However, a more comprehensive solution was needed.\n\nIn 1965, [[Richard Bellman]] proposed the creation of a database to solve chess and [[checkers]] endgames using [[retrograde analysis]].<ref>Stiller, p. 84</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=R. E. Bellman | title=On the application of dynamic programming to the determination of optimal play in chess and checkers | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=53 | issue=2 | pages=244\u2013246 |date=February 1965 | doi=10.1073/pnas.53.2.244| pmid=16591252 | pmc=219499 }}</ref> Instead of analyzing ''forward'' from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze ''backward'' from positions where one player was [[checkmate]]d or [[stalemate]]d. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.\n\nIn 1970, Thomas Str\u00f6hlein published a doctoral thesis<ref>{{cite book | author=T.

Every position can be defined by its distance (i.e. the number of moves) from the desired endpoint.  Two metrics are generally used:\n* '''Depth to mate''' (DTM). A checkmate is the only way to win a game.\n* '''Depth to conversion''' (DTC). The stronger side can also win by capturing material, thus converting to a simpler endgame.  For example, in KQKR, conversion occurs when White captures the Black rook.\nHaworth has discussed two other metrics, namely \"depth to zeroing-move\" (DTZ) and \"depth by the rule\" (DTR). A zeroing-move is a move which resets the move count to zero under the fifty-move rule, i.e. mate, a capture, or a pawn move.<ref name=\"haworthoptimisation\">{{cite journal\n | author=G. McC.

How White should proceed depends on which metric is used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Metric\n! Play\n! DTC\n! DTM\n|-\n| DTC\n| 1. Qxd1 Kc8 2. Qd2 Kb8 3. Qd8#\n| 1\n| 3\n|-\n| DTM\n| 1. Qc7+ Ka8 2. Qa7#\n| 2\n| 2\n|}\n\nAccording to the DTC metric, White should capture the rook because that leads immediately to a position which will certainly win (DTC = 1), but it will take two more moves actually to checkmate (DTM = 3). In contrast according to the DTM metric, White mates in two moves, so DTM = DTC = 2.\n\nThis difference is typical of many endgames. Usually DTC is smaller than DTM, but the DTM metric leads to the quickest checkmate. Exceptions occur where the weaker side has only a king, and in the unusual endgame of [[Two knights endgame#Troitsky line|two knights versus one pawn]]; then DTC = DTM because either there is no defending material to capture or capturing the material does no good. (Indeed, capturing the defending pawn in the latter endgame results in a draw, unless it results in immediate mate.)\n\n=== Step 1: Generating all possible positions ===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| David Levy, ''How Computers Play Chess''\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n| The ten unique squares (with symmetry)\n}}\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|xx|xx|xx|xx|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| The twenty four unique pawn squares (with symmetry)\n}}\nOnce a metric is chosen, the first step is to generate all the positions with a given material.  For example, to generate a DTM tablebase for the endgame of king and queen versus king (KQK), the computer must describe approximately 40,000 unique legal positions.\n\nLevy and Newborn explain that the number 40,000 derives from a [[symmetry]] argument.  The Black king can be placed on any of ten squares: a1, b1, c1, d1, b2, c2, d2, c3, d3, and d4 (see diagram).  On any other square, its position can be considered equivalent by symmetry of rotation or reflection.  Thus, there is no difference whether a Black king in a corner resides on a1, a8, h8, or h1.  Multiply this number of 10 by at most 60 (legal remaining) squares for placing the White king and then by at most 62 squares for the White queen.  The product 10\u00d760\u00d762 = 37,200.  Several hundred of these positions are illegal, impossible, or symmetrical reflections of each other, so the actual number is somewhat smaller.<ref>Levy & Newborn, pp. 140-43</ref><ref>See also Stiller 1995:93-98.</ref>\n\nFor each position, the tablebase evaluates the situation separately for White-to-move and Black-to-move.  Assuming that White has the queen, almost all the positions are White wins, with checkmate forced in no more than ten moves.  Some positions are draws because of [[stalemate]] or the unavoidable loss of the queen.\n\nEach additional piece added to a [[pawnless chess endgame|pawnless endgame]] multiplies the number of unique positions by about a factor of sixty which is the approximate number of squares not already occupied by other pieces.\n\nEndgames with one or more pawns increase the complexity because the symmetry argument is reduced. Since pawns can move forward but not sideways, rotation and vertical reflection of the board produces a fundamental change in the nature of the position.<ref name=\"MullerEGTB\">{{cite web|title=EGTB generator|author=Muller, H.G.|url=http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/EGTB.html|accessdate=2009-05-03|quote=Pawns would break the front-back and diagonal symmetries, because they care about direction in their moves.}}</ref> The best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in the rectangle a2-a7-d7-d2.  All other pieces and pawns may be located in any of the 64 squares with respect to the pawn.  Thus, an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24/10 = 2.4 times a pawnless endgame with the same number of pieces.\n\n=== Step 2: Evaluating positions using retrograde analysis ===\n[[Tim Krabb\u00e9]] explains the process of generating a tablebase as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"The idea is that a database is made with all possible positions with a given material [note: as in the preceding section]. Then a subdatabase is made of all positions where Black is mated. Then one where White can give mate. Then one where Black cannot stop White giving mate next move. Then one where White can always reach a position where Black cannot stop him from giving mate next move. And so on, always a ply further away from mate until all positions that are thus connected to mate have been found. Then all of these positions are linked back to mate by the shortest path through the database. That means that, apart from 'equi-optimal' moves, all the moves in such a path are perfect: White's move always leads to the quickest mate, Black's move always leads to the slowest mate.\"<ref name=\"stillermonsters\">{{cite web | author=Tim Krabb\u00e9. | title=Stiller's Monsters or Perfection in Chess. | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess/perfect.htm | accessdate=2007-04-01}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[retrograde analysis]] is only necessary from the [[checkmate]]d positions, because every position that cannot be reached by moving backwards from a checkmated position must be a draw.<ref name=\"tay\">{{cite web\n | url=http://horizonchess.com/FAQ/Winboard/egtb.html\n | title=A guide to Endgames Tablebase\n | author=Aaron Tay\n | accessdate=2009-05-02\n}}</ref>\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the idea of retrograde analysis. White can force mate in two moves by playing 1. Kc6, leading to the position in Figure 2. There are only two legal moves for black from this position, both of which lead to checkmate: if 1...Kb8 2. Qb7#, and if 1...Kd8 2. Qd7# (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3, before White's second move, is defined as \"mate in one [[ply (game theory)|ply]].\" Figure 2, after White's first move, is \"mate in two ply,\" regardless of how Black plays. Finally, the initial position in Figure 1 is \"mate in three ply\" (i.e., two moves) because it leads directly to Figure 2, which is already defined as \"mate in two ply.\" This process, which links a current position to another position that could have existed one ply earlier, can continue indefinitely.\n\nEach position is evaluated as a win or loss in a certain number of moves. At the end of the retrograde analysis, positions which are not designated as wins or losses are necessarily draws.\n\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 1\n\n|  |  |kd|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |kl|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to move: mate in three ply (Kc6)}}\n|}\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 2\n\n|  |  |kd|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |kl|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| Black to move: mate in two ply (Kd8 or Kb8)}}\n|}\n{| style=\"float:left;display:inline;\" |\n|{{Chess diagram small\n| tleft\n| Figure 3\n\n|  |  |  |kd|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |ql\n|  |  |kl|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to move: mate in one ply (Qd7)}}\n|}\n{{-}}\n\n=== Step 3: Verification ===\nAfter the tablebase has been generated, and every position has been evaluated, the result must be verified independently.  The purpose is to check the [[Consistency|self-consistency]] of the tablebase results.<ref name=\"Bourzutschky7man\">{{cite web | author=M. Bourzutschky | title=7-man endgames with pawns | publisher=[[CCRL]] Discussion Board | date=2006-08-27 | url=http://kirill-kryukov.com/chess/discussion-board/viewtopic.php?t=805 | accessdate=2010-06-14}}</ref>\n\nFor example, in Figure 1 above, the verification program sees the evaluation \"mate in three ply (Kc6).\"  It then looks at the position in Figure 2, ''after'' Kc6, and sees the evaluation \"mate in two ply.\"  These two evaluations are consistent with each other.  If the evaluation of Figure 2 were anything else, it would be inconsistent with Figure 1, so the tablebase would need to be corrected.{{Clarify|reason=if there were a problem and position 1 were actually mate in a lesser number (in this case mate) this verification process would miss it.|date=May 2012}}\n\n=== Captures, pawn promotion, and special moves ===\nA four-piece tablebase must rely on three-piece tablebases that could result if one piece is captured. Similarly, a tablebase containing a pawn must be able to rely on other tablebases that deal with the new set of material after [[promotion (chess)|pawn promotion]] to a queen or other piece.  The retrograde analysis program must account for the possibility of a capture or pawn promotion on the previous move.<ref>Stiller, pp. 99-100</ref>\n\nTablebases assume that [[castling]] is not possible for two reasons.  First, in practical endgames, this assumption is almost always correct. (However, castling is allowed by convention in [[Chess problem|composed problems]] and [[Endgame study|studies]].) Second, if the king and rook are on their original squares, castling may or may not be allowed. Because of this ambiguity, it would be necessary to make separate evaluations for states in which castling is or is not possible.\n\nThe same ambiguity exists for the ''[[en passant]]'' capture, since the possibility of ''en passant'' depends on the opponent's previous move.  However, practical applications of ''en passant'' occur frequently in pawn endgames, so tablebases account for the possibility of ''en passant'' for positions where both sides have at least one pawn.\n\n=== Using ''a priori'' information ===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |kl\n|rl|  |  |  |bd|kd|  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pd|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| An example of the KRP(a2)KBP(a3) endgame.  White mates in 72 moves, starting with 1.Kh7!  Other White moves draw.\n}}\nAccording to the method described above, the tablebase must allow the possibility that a given piece might occupy any of the 64 squares.  In some positions, it is possible to restrict the search space without affecting the result.  This saves computational resources and enables searches which would otherwise be impossible.\n\nAn early analysis of this type was published in 1987, in the endgame {{abbr|KRP(a2)KBP(a3)|a king, a rook and a pawn on a2 versus a king, a bishop and a pawn on a3}}, where the Black bishop moves on the dark squares (see example position at right).<ref>{{cite journal | author=H.

For example, if the Black pawn is captured, look up the newly created position in KRPKB.\n# The White pawn stays on a2; capture moves are handled by the 1st rule.\n# The Black pawn stays on a3; capture moves are handled by the 1st rule.<ref>{{cite web | author=E.

Reducing the search space by a factor of 2,256 facilitates a much quicker calculation.\n\nBleicher has designed a commercial program called \"Freezer,\" which allows users to build new tablebases from existing Nalimov tablebases with ''a priori'' information.  The program could produce a tablebase for positions with seven or more pieces with blocked pawns, even before tablebases for seven pieces became available.<ref>{{cite web | author=K.

According to that rule, if fifty moves have passed without a capture or a pawn move, either player may claim a draw.  [[FIDE]] changed the rules several times, starting in 1974, to allow one hundred moves for endgames where fifty moves were insufficient to win. In 1988, FIDE allowed seventy-five moves for KBBKN, KNNKP, KQKBB, KQKNN, KRBKR, and KQPKQ with the pawn on the seventh rank, because tablebases had uncovered positions in these endgames requiring more than fifty moves to win. In 1992, FIDE canceled these exceptions and restored the fifty-move rule to its original standing.<ref name=\"haworthoptimisation\"/> Thus a tablebase may identify a position as won or lost, when it is in fact drawn by the fifty-move rule. In 2013, [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]] changed the rules for correspondence chess tournaments starting from 2014; a player may claim a win or draw based on six-man tablebases.<ref>[http://www.iccf.com/message?message=624 The introduction of table base claims] by Eric Ruch - [[International Correspondence Chess Federation|ICCF]] President</ref> In this case the fifty-move rule is not applied, and the number of moves to mate is not taken into consideration.\n\nHaworth has designed a tablebase that produces results consistent with the fifty-move rule. However most tablebases search for the theoretical limits of forced mate, even if it requires several hundred moves.\n\n=== Computer chess ===\nThe knowledge contained in tablebases affords the computer a tremendous advantage in the endgame. Not only can computers play perfectly within an endgame, but they can simplify to a winning tablebase position from a more complicated endgame.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3314\n | author=Steven A.

Sometimes even this data is compressed and the bitbase reveals only whether a position is won or not, making no difference between a lost and a drawn game.<ref name=\"tay\" /> Shredderbases, for example, used by the [[Shredder (chess)|Shredder]] program, are a type of bitbase,<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Eiko+Bleicher\n | title=Profile of Eiko Bleicher, co-developer of shredderbase\n | accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> which fits all 3-, 4- and 5-piece bitbases in 157&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]].

The adverse effect could be a premature resignation, or an inferior line of play that loses with less resistance than a play without tablebase might offer.\n\nAnother drawback is that tablebases require a lot of [[computer memory|memory]] to store the many thousands of positions.

Modern engines analyze far enough ahead conventionally to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e., without suffering from the [[horizon effect]]). It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.\n\nSyzygy tablebases were developed by Ronald de Man, released in April 2013, in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search.  This variety consists of two tables per endgame: a smaller WDL (win/draw/loss) table which contains knowledge of the 50-move rule, and a larger DTZ table (distance to zero ply, i.e., pawn move or capture).  The WDL tables were designed to be small enough to fit on a [[solid-state drive]] for quick access during search, whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game-theoretically quickest distance to resetting the 50-move rule while retaining a winning position, instead of performing a search.

The composer intended 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! as the main line of the solution, but a tablebase revealed that 1. h4 wins without castling.\n}}\n\nSince many composed [[endgame studies]] deal with positions that exist in tablebases, their soundness can be checked using the tablebases.  Some studies have been proved unsound by the tablebases.  That can be either because the composer's solution does not work, or else because there is an equally effective alternative that the composer did not consider.  Another way tablebases [[Glossary_of_chess_problems#cook|cook]] studies is a change in the evaluation of an endgame.  For instance, the endgame with a queen and bishop versus two rooks was thought to be a draw, but tablebases proved it to be a win for the queen and bishop, so almost all studies based on this endgame are unsound.<ref>Nunn, pp. 367-68</ref>\n\nFor example, Erik Pogosyants composed the study at right, with White to play and win. His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! A tablebase discovered that 1. h4 also wins for White in 33 moves, even though Black can capture the pawn (which is not the best move \u2013 in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves, while Kh1-g2 loses in 32 moves). Incidentally, the tablebase does not recognize the composer's solution because it includes castling.<ref>{{cite web | author=Tim Krabb\u00e9 | work=Open chess diary | title=324. A cooked, correct study | date=2006-09-15 | url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diarytxt.htm | accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile tablebases have cooked some studies, they have assisted in the creation of other studies.  Composers can search tablebases for interesting positions, such as [[zugzwang]], using a method called [[Examples of data mining#Games|data mining]].  For all three- to five-piece endgames and pawnless six-piece endgames, a complete list of [[Zugzwang#Reciprocal zugzwang|mutual zugzwangs]] has been tabulated and published.<ref>{{cite journal | author=G.

In 2003, the endgame composer and expert [[John Roycroft]] summarized the debate:\n\n<blockquote>[N]ot only do opinions diverge widely, but they are frequently adhered to strongly, even vehemently: at one extreme is the view that since we can never be certain that a computer has been used it is pointless to attempt a distinction, so we should simply evaluate a 'study' on its content, without reference to its origins; at the other extreme is the view that using  a 'mouse' to lift an interesting position from a ready-made computer-generated list is in no sense composing, so we should outlaw every such position.<ref name=\"EG194editorial\">{{cite journal | author=A.

He continues, \"One thing alone is clear to us: the distinction between classical composing and computer composing should be preserved for as long as possible: if there is a name associated with a study diagram that name is a claim of authorship.\"<ref name=\"EG194editorial\"/>\n\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n| Harold van der Heijden, 2001\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |pl\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|kl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |kd|rd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to play and draw\n}}\n[[Mark Dvoretsky]], an [[International Master]], chess trainer, and author, took a more permissive stance.  He was commenting in 2006 on a study by [[Harold van der Heijden]], published in 2001, which reached the position at right after three introductory moves.  The drawing move for White is 4. Kb4!! (and not 4. Kb5), based on a mutual zugzwang that may occur three moves later.\n\nDvoretsky comments: <blockquote>Here, we should touch on one delicate question. I am sure that this unique endgame position was discovered with the help of Thompson\u2019s famous computer database. Is this a 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? <p> Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no doubt, we could probably extract yet more unique positions \u2013 there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.<ref>{{cite web | author=M.

It's a sort of chess that has nothing to do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers.

This name appeared in both ''[[EG (chess)|EG]]'' and the ''[[ICCA Journal]]'' starting in the 1970s, and is sometimes used today. According to Haworth, the ''ICCA Journal'' first used the word \"tablebase\" in connection with chess endgames in 1995.<ref>{{cite journal\n | journal=EG\n | issue=137\n | year=1995\n | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg137.pdf\n | format=PDF\n | title=Tablebases and Tables\n | author=Guy Haworth\n | accessdate=2007-05-04\n | pages=151\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206235341/http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg137.pdf\n | archive-date=6 February 2012\n | url-status=dead\n }}</ref> According to that source, a tablebase contains a complete set of information, but a database might lack some information.\n\nHaworth prefers the term \"Endgame Table\", and has used it in the articles he has authored.<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/view/creators/90000763.html\n | publisher=The University of Reading\n | work=Information Systems at Reading\n | title=Publications for Mr Guy Haworth\n | accessdate=2009-06-20\n}}</ref> Roycroft has used the term \"oracle database\" throughout his magazine, ''EG''.<ref>For example, in {{cite journal\n | journal=EG\n | issue=135\n | pages=9\n | url=http://www.gadycosteff.com/eg/eg135.pdf\n | title=Proposal For The Guidance Of Tourney Organisers, Composers And Judges: 0.

His 22,895 career receiving yards are 5,812 yards ahead of the second place spot held by [[Larry Fitzgerald]] as of the conclusion of the [[2019 NFL season]]. His 197 career touchdown receptions are 41 scores more than the second place record of 156 touchdown receptions by [[Randy Moss]], and his 208 total touchdowns (197 receiving, 10 rushing, and one fumble recovery) are 33 scores ahead of [[Emmitt Smith]]'s second place total of 175.

During a career spanning two decades, Rice averaged 75.6 receiving yards per game.\n\nRice is remembered also as one of the best clutch players in football history. He was a crucial part of the 49ers victory in Super Bowl XXIII. Down 16\u201313 with less than three minutes to play, quarterback [[Joe Montana]] led the 49ers in the game-winning drive with 36 seconds left on the clock. Rice was instrumental in that drive, catching three passes, and was voted the Super Bowl MVP. Rice often made game winning catches throughout his career. Known as one of the best blockers at his position, there was no aspect of playing wide receiver at which Rice did not excel.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nRice is also remembered for his work ethic and dedication to the game. In his 20 NFL seasons, Rice missed only 17 regular season games, 14 of them in the 1997 season, and the other 3 in the strike-shortened season of 1987. His 303 games are by far the most ever played by an NFL wide receiver. In addition to staying on the field, his work ethic showed in his dedication to conditioning and running precise routes, with coach [[Dennis Green]] calling him \"the best route runner I've ever seen.\" One of the best known examples of his dedication and ethic may be \"The Hill\", a long and steep hill in [[Edgewood County Park|Edgewood County Park & Natural Preserve]], that is \"two and a half miles up\". Rice would sprint across the hill literally every day to improve his abilities. \"The Hill\" has served as an inspiration for many other players in the 49ers organization, among them former first-round pick wide receiver A.J. Jenkins, who neglected to train with Rice on \"The Hill\", and was subsequently traded.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn 1999, Rice was ranked number two on the ''[[Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, behind only [[Jim Brown]], and was 35 places ahead of the next-highest-ranked player then active, [[Deion Sanders]].<ref name=SN100/> In 2000, Rice won the ESPY Award for Pro Football Player of the Decade for the 1990s.

San Francisco finished the year with an NFL-best 14\u20132 record, but failed to \"3-peat\" as Super Bowl champions, losing to the [[New York Giants]] 15\u201313 in the NFC title game.\n\nAfter seasons of 80 catches for 1,206 yards and 14 touchdowns in 1991, 84 catches for 1,201 yards and 10 touchdowns in 1992 (during which he broke the record for receiving touchdowns with his 101st, exceeding the then-record 100 set by [[Steve Largent]]), and 98 catches for 1,503 yards and 15 touchdowns in 1993, Rice made it back to the Super Bowl with the 49ers in the [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|1994 season]], recording a career-high 112 receptions for 1,499 yards and 13 touchdowns. During the 49ers' first game of that season against the [[Los Angeles Raiders]], he caught 7 passes for a season-high 169 yards and two touchdowns (and rushed for one more), moving into first place in the NFL records for career touchdowns, with 127. In Week 3, his 147 receiving yards moved him past [[Art Monk]] as the NFL's active leader, and also past [[Charlie Joiner]] for 3rd all-time. He would pass [[Steve Largent]] for 2nd place in Week 16.<ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_career_1993.htm Career receiving yards, 1993 leaderboard] vs. [https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_career_1994.htm Career receiving yards, 1994 leaderboard]</ref> Although he only caught 6 passes in San Francisco's 2 playoff games that year, he proved to be a vital component in their 49\u201326 victory over the [[San Diego Chargers]] in [[Super Bowl XXIX]], recording 10 receptions for 149 yards and 3 touchdowns\u2014despite playing with a separated shoulder for much of the game.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Freeman|first1=Mike|title=Pro Football; Rice Works for Hours And Defies the Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/sports/pro-football-rice-works-for-hours-and-defies-the-years.html?pagewanted=all&mcubz=2|accessdate=June 14, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=July 2, 1995}}</ref><ref name=Kindred>{{cite news|last1=Kindred|first1=Dave|title=Commentary: There's No One More Super Than Jerry Rice|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-05/sports/sp-28188_1_jerry-rice|accessdate=June 14, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 5, 1995}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Rice caught a career-high 122 passes for a then-NFL record 1,848 receiving yards and 15 touchdowns (along with 1 touchdown each by way of running, passing, and recovering a fumble). However, the 49ers lost in the divisional playoffs to the [[Green Bay Packers]], despite Rice's impressive 11-catch, 117-yard performance. The following year, he recorded 108 receptions (again leading the NFL) for 1,254 yards and eight touchdowns. San Francisco won in the wild card round, but once more lost to the Packers in the divisional playoffs. In his three seasons between 1994 and 1996, Rice had racked up 342 catches for 4,601 yards and 36 touchdowns.\n\nDuring the 49ers' opening game of the 1997 season, he tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his left knee on a reverse. [[Warren Sapp]] of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] grabbed Rice by the face-mask and wrenched him to the ground with it, drawing a 15-yard personal foul.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pierson|first1=Don|title=1st Injury Of Career Puts 49ers' Rice Out For '97|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-09-02/sports/9709020138_1_george-seifert-jerry-rice-49ers-coach-steve-mariucci|accessdate=June 14, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=September 2, 1997}}</ref> The injury broke his streak of 189 consecutive games played.

The same thing happened in 2000, his final season in San Francisco.\n\n===Oakland Raiders===\nWith the emergence of [[Terrell Owens]] in San Francisco, and because of their desire to rebuild the team and clear salary, Rice left the 49ers and signed with the [[Oakland Raiders]], following the conclusion of the 2000 season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/It-s-official-Rice-is-a-Raider-1056433.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first=Anne | last=Peterson | title=It's official: Rice is a Raider | date=April 6, 2001 | accessdate=April 2, 2017}}</ref> He joined a Raiders team coming off a loss in the AFC playoffs, to form one of the oldest receiver duos with [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]].\n\nThe two played well together, as Rice caught 83 passes for 1,139 yards and nine touchdowns.

His team lost 48\u201321 to the Buccaneers in the Super Bowl, with Rice recording five receptions for 77 yards and a touchdown. His 48-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter made him the first player to catch a touchdown pass in four Super Bowls.\n\nOn November 11, 2002, against the [[Denver Broncos]], Rice scored his 200th career touchdown, and surpassed [[Walter Payton]] to become the NFL's career leader in total yardage. Oakland dropped from an 11\u20135 record in 2002 to a 4\u201312 record in 2003, leading to frustration from Rice about his role on the team.

His 1,549 career receptions are 171 receptions ahead of the second place record held by [[Larry Fitzgerald]] as of the conclusion of the [[2019 NFL season]]. His 22,895 career receiving yards are 5,812 yards ahead of the second place spot held by [[Larry Fitzgerald]] as of the conclusion of the [[2019 NFL season]]. His 197 career touchdown receptions are 41 scores more than the second place record of 156 touchdown receptions by [[Randy Moss]], and his 208 total touchdowns (197 receiving, 10 rushing, and one fumble recovery) are 33 scores ahead of [[Emmitt Smith]]'s second place total of 175.  He also threw a touchdown pass against the Atlanta Falcons in a 1995 regular season game. His 1,256 career points scored make him the highest-scoring non-[[placekicker|kicker]] in NFL history. During a career spanning two decades, Rice averaged 75.6 receiving yards per game.\n\nRice is remembered also as one of the best clutch players in football history. He was a crucial part of the 49ers victory in Super Bowl XXIII. Down 16-13 with less than three minutes to play, quarterback [[Joe Montana]] led the 49ers in the game-winning drive with 36 seconds left on the clock. Rice was instrumental in that drive, catching three passes, and was voted the Super Bowl MVP. Rice often made game winning catches throughout his career. Known as one of the best blockers at his position, there was no aspect of playing wide receiver at which Rice did not excel.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nRice is also remembered for his work ethic and dedication to the game. In his 20 NFL seasons, Rice missed only 17 regular season games, 14 of them in the 1997 season, and the other 3 in the strike-shortened season of 1987. His 303 games are by far the most ever played by an NFL wide receiver. In addition to staying on the field, his work ethic showed in his dedication to conditioning and running precise routes, with coach [[Dennis Green]] calling him \"the best route runner I've ever seen.\" One of the best known examples of his dedication and ethic may be \"The Hill\", a long and steep hill in [[Edgewood County Park|Edgewood County Park & Natural Preserve]], that is \"two and a half miles up\". Rice would sprint across the hill literally every day to improve his abilities. \"The Hill\" has served as an inspiration for many other players in the 49ers organization, among them former first-round pick wide receiver A.J. Jenkins, who neglected to train with Rice on \"The Hill\", and was subsequently traded.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn 1999, Rice was ranked number two on the ''[[Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players, behind only [[Jim Brown]], and was 35 places ahead of the next-highest-ranked player then active, [[Deion Sanders]].<ref name=SN100/> In 2000, Rice won the ESPY Award for Pro Football Player of the Decade for the 1990s.

Historically, the women's teams and athletes were referred to as the \"Lady Kats\", but all athletic squads adopted the \"Wildcats\" nickname in 1995. Collectively, the fans of the Kentucky Wildcats are often referred to as the [[Big Blue Nation]].  Their main and most intense rival is the [[University of Louisville]].\n\n==Background==\nThe nickname \"Wildcats\" became synonymous with UK shortly after a 6\u20132 football road victory over Illinois on October 9, 1909. Commandant Philip W. Corbusier, then head of the military department at old State University, told a group of students in a chapel service following the game that the Kentucky football team had \"fought like Wildcats.\" Later the name Wildcats became more and more popular among UK followers as well as with members of the media. As a result, the nickname was adopted by the university.<ref name=\"University of Kentucky Traditions and Songs\">{{cite web|title=University of Kentucky Traditions|url=http://www.uky.edu/UKHome/subpages/traditions.html|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711073947/http://www.uky.edu/UKHome/subpages/traditions.html|archive-date=July 11, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe university adopted blue and white as its official colors in 1892. Originally, however, UK students had decided on blue and light yellow prior to the Kentucky-[[Centre College]] football game on December 19, 1887. The shade of blue, which is close to a royal blue, was chosen when a student asked the question, \"What color blue?\" At the time, Richard C. Stoll (who lettered in football at UK in 1889\u201394) pulled off his necktie and held it up. The students then adopted that particular shade of blue. A year later, UK students officially dropped the light yellow color for white because the two colors did not look good together.<ref name=\"University of Kentucky Traditions and Songs\" />\n\n==Sports sponsored==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Kentucky Wildcats|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|-\n| [[Kentucky Wildcats baseball|Baseball]] || [[Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Basketball]] || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country ||  Golf\n|-\n| [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Football]] || Gymnastics\n|-\n| Golf || [[Kentucky Wildcats softball|Softball]]\n|-\n| [[Kentucky Wildcats men's soccer|Soccer]] || Soccer\n|-\n| Swimming & diving || Swimming and Diving\n|-\n| Tennis || Tennis \n|-\n| Track & field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Track & Field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Kentucky Wildcats}}; text-align:center\" | '''Co-ed sports'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | Rifle\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|Kentucky Wildcats}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor.}}\n|}\n\nUK has won 12 national championships including the 2012 men's basketball title.

The team was given the nickname \"Lady Kats\" and was coached by Debbie Yow.<ref>{{cite web| title = Women's Basketball Timeline| publisher = [[University of Kentucky]]| year = 2005| url = http://www.ukathletics.com/doc_lib/wbb_history_timeline.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-05-05| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070704200130/http://www.ukathletics.com/doc_lib/wbb_history_timeline.pdf| archivedate = 2007-07-04}}</ref>\n\nLed by UK all-time leading scorer [[Valerie Still]], Patty Jo Hedges, and Lea Wise, the Lady Kats won the [[1982 SEC Women's Basketball Tournament|SEC Tournament in 1982]]. The following year, the same trio led the team to a #4 ranking in the country, the highest in the team's history.\n\nThe team is currently coached by [[Matthew Mitchell (basketball coach)|Matthew Mitchell]], named as the SEC Coach of the Year in 2010 after leading the [[2009\u201310 Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball team|2009\u201310 team]] to a surprising 28\u20138 season in which they set school records for best start, most consecutive SEC wins, best SEC finish, and most wins in a season, culminating in their first [[2010 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA regional final]] since [[1982 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|1982]]. The team also had the conference Player of the Year in [[Victoria Dunlap]] and Freshman of the Year in A'dia Mathies.\n\n===Football===\n{{main article|Kentucky Wildcats football}}\n{{See also|2018 Kentucky Wildcats football team}}\nKentucky plays at [[Kroger Field]] (formerly Commonwealth Stadium from 1973-2017), which replaced [[Stoll Field]] in 1973.\n\n;Paul \"Bear\" Bryant era\n[[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]] was Kentucky's head football coach for eight seasons. Under Bryant the Wildcats won the 1947 [[Great Lakes Bowl]], lost the 1950 [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], won the 1951 [[Sugar Bowl]] and the 1952 [[Cotton Bowl Classic]].  In final AP polls, the Wildcats were ranked #11 in 1949, #7 in 1950, #15 in 1951, #20 in 1952 and #16 in 1953.\n\nAt the time of the 1951 Sugar Bowl win over #1 Oklahoma, the final polls were taken before the bowl games.  The NCAA has never officially recognized a national champion from among the bowl coalition institutions, but in 2004 the NCAA commissioned Jeff Sagarin to use his computer model to retroactively determine the highest ranked teams for the years prior to the BCS. His champion for the 1950 season is Kentucky.\n\n;Fran Curci era\nThe 1976 Wildcats retroactively claimed a share of the [[Southeastern Conference]] championship under coach [[Fran Curci]] via a loss later forfeited by Mississippi State (and despite losing at home to conference champion Georgia) and won the [[Peach Bowl]], finishing #18 in the final AP poll.  The 1977 Kentucky team went 10\u20131 and was undefeated in SEC play but, despite finishing the season ranked #6 in the AP poll, did not play in a bowl game due to NCAA sanctions.  Kentucky finished at #6 and Penn State at #5 despite the fact that Kentucky defeated Penn State at Penn State during the regular season.\n\n;Jerry Claiborne era\nCoach [[Jerry Claiborne]] led the Wildcats to the 1983 [[Hall of Fame Bowl]].  In 1984 Kentucky returned to the Hall of Fame Bowl and defeated a ranked Wisconsin team to finish the season with a 9\u20133 record and a #19 ranking in the final AP poll.\n\n;Bill Curry era\nThe Wildcats played in the 1993 Peach Bowl under coach [[Bill Curry]].\n\n;Hal Mumme era\nCoach [[Hal Mumme]] led the Wildcats to the 1998 [[Outback Bowl]] and the 1999 [[Music City Bowl]] but the program was hit with severe sanctions for infractions during Mumme's tenure.\n\n;Guy Morriss era\nUnder coach [[Guy Morriss]] the Wildcats posted a 7\u20135 record in 2002 but were not eligible for postseason play due to NCAA sanctions.\n\n;Rich Brooks era\nCoach [[Rich Brooks]] led the team to an 8\u20135 regular season record in [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]], including a memorable upset over the defending SEC champion Georgia, snapping a nine-game losing streak to the Bulldogs.  Brooks also led the football team to its first bowl game since 1999 and its first bowl game victory since 1984, as Kentucky defeated the [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson University Tigers]] 28\u201320 in the [[2006 Music City Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 - Kentucky vs. Clemson|url=http://www.musiccitybowl.com/bowl-game/2006-kentucky-vs-clemson/|publisher=Music City Bowl|date=December 29, 2006|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}</ref> On September 15, 2007. Brooks led UK to a 40\u201334 win over number 9 ranked [[2007 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]]. This marked UK's first win over a top 10 team since #4 Penn State in 1977. The Wildcats were ranked 8th in the nation before a loss to South Carolina on October 4. After the loss to South Carolina, Kentucky bounced back on October 13 to defeat #1 LSU in an historic triple overtime game.\n\nThe 2007 Kentucky Wildcats football defeated the [[2007 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]] 35\u201328 in the [[2007 Music City Bowl]] in Nashville, Tennessee, on December 31, 2007.  It was the Wildcats second straight bowl appearance.  Quarterback [[Andre' Woodson]] was named the Music City Bowl MVP for the second year in a row. The last three bowl appearances for the Cats have been in the Music City Bowl, which they have appeared in more than any other SEC team in the conference's affiliation with the game, which dates back to the inaugural game in 1998.\n\nOn January 2, 2009 Kentucky football set a record with the school's first back to back to back bowl games. After a bad start in the Liberty Bowl Kentucky made a comeback from a 16\u20133 deficit at halftime to beat East Carolina 25\u201319. After a fumble by the East Carolina running back, UK Defensive Tackle Ventrell Jenkins returned the ball over 50 yards for the score that gave Kentucky their first lead of the game.\n\n;Joker Phillips era\nFormer Wildcat [[wide receiver]] and longtime assistant coach [[Joker Phillips]] was formally named head coach January 6, 2010 after Brooks' retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/80804502.html|title=Phillips introduced as UK football coach|author=|first=|date=January 6, 2010|website=[[WKYT]] (via The Associated Press)|publisher=Gray Television|location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  Phillips took Kentucky to the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama in his first season as a head coach, losing to Big East Conference co-champion Pittsburgh 27\u201310. However, the Wildcats would not return to a bowl in either of the next two seasons. The main highlight of those years came in 2011, when Kentucky defeated Tennessee for the first time since 1984. Phillips was fired in November 2012, effective at season's end.\n\n;Mark Stoops era\nPhillips was replaced by [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] defensive coordinator [[Mark Stoops]], younger brother of [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] head coach [[Bob Stoops]].\n\n===Baseball===\n{{main article|Kentucky Wildcats baseball}}\n{{See also|2019 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team}}\n\nThe Wildcats baseball team began play in their new stadium, [[Kentucky Proud Park]], in fall 2018, replacing [[Cliff Hagan Stadium]], where they had played since 1969.\n\nThe baseball program, partly hampered by being the northernmost school in the heavily warm-weather SEC{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2015}}, has historically achieved only modest success at best. Wildcats baseball hit bottom at the turn of the 21st century, with only one winning season from 1997 through 2004, and last-place finishes in the SEC East division in every season from 2001 through 2005. In 2003, after the retirement of longtime coach Keith Madison, Kentucky hired Florida assistant [[John Cohen (baseball coach)|John Cohen]] as head coach. Cohen was able to lead the Cats to a winning overall season in 2005, despite another SEC cellar finish.  In 2008, Cohen left Kentucky to accept the coaching position at [[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|Mississippi State University]].  He was replaced by former Kentucky assistant [[Gary Henderson (baseball coach)|Gary Henderson]].\n\nFew could have expected the [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] season the Cats would have in 2006. They literally went from worst to first in the SEC, winning a regular-season conference title for the first time in three decades, and being ranked as high as fourth in the country by one major baseball poll during the season{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2015}}. However, the newly energized Kentucky baseball faithful saw the Cats crash out of the SEC tournament early and fail to make it out of the regionals of the NCAA tournament [[Cliff Hagan Stadium|at home]].\n\nIn [[2012 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team|2012]], Kentucky garnered its most successful season ever in program history. Henderson was voted SEC Coach of the Year by the league coaches. Henderson directed the Wildcats to a school-record 45-win season, with UK completing its best finishes in the SEC and NCAA Tournaments in school annals. The 2012 season also marked the first time that UK had ever been ranked No. 1. UK finished the season with a No. 11 ranking by Baseball America. UK also achieved a program record by winning seven of ten series in SEC play. UK also ran up a school-record 22-game winning streak, which is the second longest in SEC history.\n\nIn [[2014 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team|2014]], Kentucky produced its first ever College Baseball National Player of the Year in [[A. J. Reed]].  During the regular season Reed was 11\u20132 with a 2.10 earned-run average on the mound and at the plate led the nation in home runs (23)\u2014more than 193 entire Division I teams{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2015}} \u2014 slugging percentage (.768) and OPS (1.259).  Reed also won SEC Player of the Year honors.  The Wildcats made it to the Semifinals of the SEC Tournament and played in the Louisville regional of the [[2014 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2014 NCAA Tournament]].\n\nIn [[2017 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team|2017]], Henderson had resigned and was replaced by [[Nick Mingione]], who had been an assistant in the 2006 season.  Mingione brought a new attitude to the team and they had a 43\u201323 record with 19\u201311 in the SEC.  They went on to host an NCAA regional [[2017 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#Louisville Super Regional|NCAA Regional]] <ref>{{cite news|title=Kentucky Named NCAA Tournament Regional Host Site|publisher=UK Athletics|accessdate=May 30, 2017|date=May 28, 2017|url=http://www.ukathletics.com/news/kentucky-named-ncaa-tournament-regional-host-site-05-28-2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170601040613/http://www.ukathletics.com/news/kentucky-named-ncaa-tournament-regional-host-site-05-28-2017|archive-date=June 1, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>.

UK also finished 2016 in the top 14 of both collegiate softball rankings for the third time in school history with eleven wins over ranked teams.\n\nAnother accomplishment since Lawson's hire in 2007 is the integration of John Cropp Stadium.  The facility cost $9.5 million, and debuted for the 2013 season.  UK hosted the 2013 SEC Tournament as well as an NCAA regional, another first for the program.

The \"coolcats\" play their home games at the Lexington Ice Center.  Traditionally the team ranks as the 3rd most popular spectator sport behind Football and Basketball.  The hockey program is funded by private funds outside of the athletic department.  In 1998 the cats released their first poster featuring actress and UK alum [[Ashley Judd]].  Since the debut of the first poster, the cats have issued an annual poster featuring a celebrity with ties to the bluegrass.  The program has achieved great success including 3 national tournament appearances, 1992 national runner-up, and 18 winning seasons.\n\nRecently, the Cool Cats simply became the Wildcats. The Wildcats have enjoyed a regional bid in the 06\u201307 season. In the 2007\u201308 season the cats finished in the national tournament failing to make it out of pool play.

Since its inception the size and success of the club has grown. Kentucky has been named SEC champion three times, first in 1979 then again in 1986 and 1987, along with numerous runner-up honors.\n\nThe program currently plays [[college rugby]] in Division I in the [[Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference]]. This conference is made up of the traditional SEC teams, and divided into East and West.\n\nThe program has an internationally experienced head coach (Tony Vince), and two other full-time coaches. While rugby at UK is not considered a varsity sport and does not have the budget of football or basketball, the program includes three full-time coaches, travel throughout the SEC, and recruiting. The program also offers a limited amount of scholarship funding to rugby players.<ref>[http://www.goffrugbyreport.com/news/kentucky-players-earn-scholarships \"Kentucky Players Earn Scholarships\"], Goff Rugby Report, February 18, 2015.</ref> The UK staff spends a lot of their time recruiting at the high school level.

This is capped off each year with an Alumni Game where the old boys play against the present UK squad.\n\n==Mascots==\nThe University of Kentucky has [https://web.archive.org/web/20121119015528/http://www.ukathletics.com/trads/mascot.html three official mascots]:\n*'''''Blue''''' \u2014 A live [[bobcat]] (note that in [[American English]], \"wildcat\" generally refers to this particular mammal). He lives at the [[Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources|state]]-operated Salato Wildlife Education Center near [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]]. Unlike the school's two costumed mascots, he never attends games, because bobcats are very shy by nature and do not react well with large crowds.\n*'''''The Wildcat''''' \u2014 A costumed student, he made his debut in the 1976\u201377 school year.<ref name=\"University of Kentucky Traditions and Songs\" />\n*'''''Scratch''''' \u2014 A later addition, he is a more child-friendly version of The Wildcat.  Scratch wears his hat backwards, drinks [[Coca-Cola]], and loves to have fun. \n\nThe true name of the university's costumed mascot has often been disputed &ndash; even amongst sports industry executives.  Some argue for \"Wildcat\", while others vehemently contend it's \"Scratch\".

Historically, the women's teams and athletes were referred to as the \"Lady Kats\", but all athletic squads adopted the \"Wildcats\" nickname in 1995. Collectively, the fans of the Kentucky Wildcats are often referred to as the [[Big Blue Nation]].  Their main and most intense rival is the [[University of Louisville]].\n\n==Background==\nThe nickname \"Wildcats\" became synonymous with UK shortly after a 6\u20132 football road victory over Illinois on October 9, 1909. Commandant Philip W. Corbusier, then head of the military department at old State University, told a group of students in a chapel service following the game that the Kentucky football team had \"fought like Wildcats.\" Later the name Wildcats became more and more popular among UK followers as well as with members of the media. As a result, the nickname was adopted by the university.<ref name=\"University of Kentucky Traditions and Songs\">{{cite web|title=University of Kentucky Traditions|url=http://www.uky.edu/UKHome/subpages/traditions.html|publisher=[[University of Kentucky]]|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711073947/http://www.uky.edu/UKHome/subpages/traditions.html|archive-date=July 11, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe university adopted blue and white as its official colors in 1892. Originally, however, UK students had decided on blue and light yellow prior to the Kentucky-[[Centre College]] football game on December 19, 1887. The shade of blue, which is close to a royal blue, was chosen when a student asked the question, \"What color blue?\" At the time, Richard C. Stoll (who lettered in football at UK in 1889\u201394) pulled off his necktie and held it up. The students then adopted that particular shade of blue. A year later, UK students officially dropped the light yellow color for white because the two colors did not look good together.<ref name=\"University of Kentucky Traditions and Songs\" />\n\n==Sports sponsored==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Kentucky Wildcats|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|-\n| [[Kentucky Wildcats baseball|Baseball]] || [[Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Basketball]] || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country ||  Golf\n|-\n| [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Football]] || Gymnastics\n|-\n| Golf || [[Kentucky Wildcats softball|Softball]]\n|-\n| [[Kentucky Wildcats men's soccer|Soccer]] || Soccer\n|-\n| Swimming & diving || Swimming and Diving\n|-\n| Tennis || Tennis \n|-\n| Track & field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Track & Field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA color cell|Kentucky Wildcats}}; text-align:center\" | '''Co-ed sports'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | Rifle\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|Kentucky Wildcats}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor.}}\n|}\n\nUK has won 12 national championships including the 2012 men's basketball title.

Under Bryant the Wildcats won the 1947 [[Great Lakes Bowl]], lost the 1950 [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], won the 1951 [[Sugar Bowl]] and the 1952 [[Cotton Bowl Classic]].  In final AP polls, the Wildcats were ranked #11 in 1949, #7 in 1950, #15 in 1951, #20 in 1952 and #16 in 1953.\n\nAt the time of the 1951 Sugar Bowl win over #1 Oklahoma, the final polls were taken before the bowl games.  The NCAA has never officially recognized a national champion from among the bowl coalition institutions, but in 2004 the NCAA commissioned Jeff Sagarin to use his computer model to retroactively determine the highest ranked teams for the years prior to the BCS. His champion for the 1950 season is Kentucky.\n\n;Fran Curci era\nThe 1976 Wildcats retroactively claimed a share of the [[Southeastern Conference]] championship under coach [[Fran Curci]] via a loss later forfeited by Mississippi State (and despite losing at home to conference champion Georgia) and won the [[Peach Bowl]], finishing #18 in the final AP poll.  The 1977 Kentucky team went 10\u20131 and was undefeated in SEC play but, despite finishing the season ranked #6 in the AP poll, did not play in a bowl game due to NCAA sanctions.  Kentucky finished at #6 and Penn State at #5 despite the fact that Kentucky defeated Penn State at Penn State during the regular season.\n\n;Jerry Claiborne era\nCoach [[Jerry Claiborne]] led the Wildcats to the 1983 [[Hall of Fame Bowl]].

Brooks also led the football team to its first bowl game since 1999 and its first bowl game victory since 1984, as Kentucky defeated the [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson University Tigers]] 28\u201320 in the [[2006 Music City Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|title=2006 - Kentucky vs. Clemson|url=http://www.musiccitybowl.com/bowl-game/2006-kentucky-vs-clemson/|publisher=Music City Bowl|date=December 29, 2006|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}</ref> On September 15, 2007.

The Wildcats were ranked 8th in the nation before a loss to South Carolina on October 4. After the loss to South Carolina, Kentucky bounced back on October 13 to defeat #1 LSU in an historic triple overtime game.\n\nThe 2007 Kentucky Wildcats football defeated the [[2007 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]] 35\u201328 in the [[2007 Music City Bowl]] in Nashville, Tennessee, on December 31, 2007.  It was the Wildcats second straight bowl appearance.  Quarterback [[Andre' Woodson]] was named the Music City Bowl MVP for the second year in a row. The last three bowl appearances for the Cats have been in the Music City Bowl, which they have appeared in more than any other SEC team in the conference's affiliation with the game, which dates back to the inaugural game in 1998.\n\nOn January 2, 2009 Kentucky football set a record with the school's first back to back to back bowl games. After a bad start in the Liberty Bowl Kentucky made a comeback from a 16\u20133 deficit at halftime to beat East Carolina 25\u201319. After a fumble by the East Carolina running back, UK Defensive Tackle Ventrell Jenkins returned the ball over 50 yards for the score that gave Kentucky their first lead of the game.\n\n;Joker Phillips era\nFormer Wildcat [[wide receiver]] and longtime assistant coach [[Joker Phillips]] was formally named head coach January 6, 2010 after Brooks' retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wkyt.com/home/headlines/80804502.html|title=Phillips introduced as UK football coach|author=|first=|date=January 6, 2010|website=[[WKYT]] (via The Associated Press)|publisher=Gray Television|location=[[Lexington, Kentucky]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  Phillips took Kentucky to the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama in his first season as a head coach, losing to Big East Conference co-champion Pittsburgh 27-10.

Wildcats baseball hit bottom at the turn of the 21st century, with only one winning season from 1997 through 2004, and last-place finishes in the SEC East division in every season from 2001 through 2005. In 2003, after the retirement of longtime coach Keith Madison, Kentucky hired Florida assistant [[John Cohen (baseball coach)|John Cohen]] as head coach. Cohen was able to lead the Cats to a winning overall season in 2005, despite another SEC cellar finish.  In 2008, Cohen left Kentucky to accept the coaching position at [[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|Mississippi State University]].  He was replaced by former Kentucky assistant [[Gary Henderson (baseball coach)|Gary Henderson]].\n\nFew could have expected the [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella]] season the Cats would have in 2006. They literally went from worst to first in the SEC, winning a regular-season conference title for the first time in three decades, and being ranked as high as fourth in the country by one major baseball poll during the season{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2015}}. However, the newly energized Kentucky baseball faithful saw the Cats crash out of the SEC tournament early and fail to make it out of the regionals of the NCAA tournament [[Cliff Hagan Stadium|at home]].\n\nIn [[2012 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team|2012]], Kentucky garnered its most successful season ever in program history. Henderson was voted SEC Coach of the Year by the league coaches. Henderson directed the Wildcats to a school-record 45-win season, with UK completing its best finishes in the SEC and NCAA Tournaments in school annals. The 2012 season also marked the first time that UK had ever been ranked No. 1. UK finished the season with a No. 11 ranking by Baseball America. UK also achieved a program record by winning seven of ten series in SEC play. UK also ran up a school-record 22-game winning streak, which is the second longest in SEC history.\n\nIn [[2014 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team|2014]], Kentucky produced its first ever College Baseball National Player of the Year in [[A. J. Reed]].  During the regular season Reed was 11-2 with a 2.10 earned-run average on the mound and at the plate led the nation in home runs (23)\u2014more than 193 entire Division I teams{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2015}} \u2014 slugging percentage (.768) and OPS (1.259).  Reed also won SEC Player of the Year honors.  The Wildcats made it to the Semifinals of the SEC Tournament and played in the Louisville regional of the [[2014 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2014 NCAA Tournament]].\n\nIn [[2017 Kentucky Wildcats baseball team|2017]], Henderson had resigned and was replaced by [[Nick Mingione]], who had been an assistant in the 2006 season.  Mingione brought a new attitude to the team and they had a 43\u201323 record with 19-11 in the SEC.

The \"coolcats\" play their home games at the Lexington Ice Center.  Traditionally the team ranks as the 3rd most popular spectator sport behind Football and Basketball.  The hockey program is funded by private funds outside of the athletic department.  In 1998 the cats released their first poster featuring actress and UK alum [[Ashley Judd]].  Since the debut of the first poster, the cats have issued an annual poster featuring a celebrity with ties to the bluegrass.  The program has achieved great success including 3 national tournament appearances, 1992 national runner-up, and 18 winning seasons.\n\nRecently, the Cool Cats simply became the Wildcats. The Wildcats have enjoyed a regional bid in the 06-07 season. In the 2007\u201308 season the cats finished in the national tournament failing to make it out of pool play. All home games are played at the Lexington Ice Center at midnight.\n\n===Rugby program===\nThe University of Kentucky Rugby Club was founded in 1970.<ref>[http://www.kentuckyrugby.org/?cat=1 \"Presenting your UKRFC for Spring 2014\"], University of Kentucky Rugby Football Club, January 21, 2013. Retrieved February 18, 2015.</ref> The club was organized by an engineering professor Dr. Roy Elmore and two of his students Larry Sonnifield and Rick Wunderlich.\nThe team began competing in the fall of 1971 and quickly become a power in the newly formed SEC Conference. Since its inception the size and success of the club has grown. Kentucky has been named SEC champion three times, first in 1979 then again in 1986 and 1987, along with numerous runner-up honors.\n\nThe program currently plays [[college rugby]] in Division I in the [[Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference]]. This conference is made up of the traditional SEC teams, and divided into East and West.\n\nThe program has an internationally experienced head coach (Tony Vince), and two other full-time coaches. While rugby at UK is not considered a varsity sport and does not have the budget of football or basketball, the program includes three full-time coaches, travel throughout the SEC, and recruiting. The program also offers a limited amount of scholarship funding to rugby players.<ref>[http://www.goffrugbyreport.com/news/kentucky-players-earn-scholarships \"Kentucky Players Earn Scholarships\"], Goff Rugby Report, February 18, 2015.</ref> The UK staff spends a lot of their time recruiting at the high school level.  The program funds itself with the support of an alumni base that puts together many events throughout the year.  This is capped off each year with an Alumni Game where the old boys play against the present UK squad.\n\n==Mascots==\nThe University of Kentucky has [https://web.archive.org/web/20121119015528/http://www.ukathletics.com/trads/mascot.html three official mascots]:\n*'''''Blue''''' \u2014 A live [[bobcat]] (note that in [[American English]], \"wildcat\" generally refers to this particular mammal). He lives at the [[Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources|state]]-operated Salato Wildlife Education Center near [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]]. Unlike the school's two costumed mascots, he never attends games, because bobcats are very shy by nature and do not react well with large crowds.\n*'''''The Wildcat''''' \u2014 A costumed student, he made his debut in the 1976\u201377 school year.<ref name=\"University of Kentucky Traditions and Songs\" />\n*'''''Scratch''''' \u2014 A later addition, he is a more child-friendly version of The Wildcat.  Scratch wears his hat backwards, drinks [[Coca-Cola]], and loves to have fun. \n\nThe true name of the university's costumed mascot has often been disputed &ndash; even amongst sports industry executives.  Some argue for \"Wildcat\", while others vehemently contend it's \"Scratch\". In the absence of a definitive position by the university, fans, pundits and executives alike are left to decide for themselves.\n\n==All-time records by sport==\n''Men's and Women's Basketball, Volleyball, Football, Men's Soccer, Men's Tennis, Women's Tennis, and Baseball all updated as of 6/26/17.''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Sport\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|First<br />season\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Win\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Loss\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Tie\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Win Pct.\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[College baseball|Baseball]]\n|1896 || 1839||1776||26 || .508\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[College basketball|Basketball]] (men)\n|1903\u201304 || 2237||688|| || .765\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[College basketball|Basketball]] (women)\n|1974\u201375 || 773||515|| || .586\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[College football|Football]]\n|1881 || 599||612||44 || .477\n|-align=center\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[College soccer|Soccer]] (men)\n|1991 || 275||197||67 || .506\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[College soccer|Soccer]] (women)\n|1992 || 167||114||25 || .546\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[College softball|Softball]]\n|1997 || 518||604||1 || .461\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[Tennis]] (men)\n|1916 || 1045||611||8 || .628\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[Tennis]] (women)\n|1974 || 579||341|| || .629\n|-align=center\n|align=left | [[Volleyball]]\n|1977 || 854||496||1 || .628\n|-align=center \n|align=left | '''Overall Record'''\n|     || 8604||5785||171 || .589\n|-align=center\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Bill Keightley]]\n*[[Cawood Ledford]]\n*[[C.
