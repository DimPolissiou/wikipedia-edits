{"title_page": "Sankore Madrasah", "text_new": "{{short description|Ancient center of learning in Timbuktu, Mali}}\n{{update|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Sankore Moske Timboektoe.JPG|thumb|Sankore Madrasah]]\n\n'''Sankor\u00e9 Madrasah''' (also called the '''University of Sankor\u00e9''', or '''Sankore Masjid''') is one of three ancient centers of learning located in [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]]. The three [[mosque]]s of Sankor\u00e9, [[Djinguereber Mosque|Djinguereber]] and [[Sidi Yahya Mosque|Sidi Yahya]] compose the [[University of Timbuktu]]. Madrasah (\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629) means school/university in Arabic and also in other languages that have been influenced by Islam.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fortier 368 Timbuktu Sankore Mosque.jpg|thumb|Postcard published by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Edmond Fortier|Edmond Fortier]] showing the mosque in 1905-06]] \nThe University of Sankore has its roots in the Sankore Mosque which was founded in 989 AD by [[Al-Qadi Aqib ibn Mahmud ibn Umar]], the Supreme Judge of Timbuktu. The Sankore University prospered and became a very significant seat of learning in the Muslim world, especially under the reign of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]] (1307\u20131332) and the Askia Dynasty (1493\u20131591).<ref>{{cite book |last=Woods |first=Michael |title=Seven Wonders of Ancient Africa |page=61 |publisher=Lerner |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7613-4320-2 }}</ref>\n\n===Growth as a center of learning===\n\nTimbuktu had long been a destination or stop for merchants from the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. It wasn't long before ideas as well as merchandise began passing through the fabled city. Since most if not all these traders were [[Muslim]], the mosque would see visitors constantly. The temple accumulated a wealth of books from throughout the Muslim world becoming not only a center of worship but a center of learning. Books became more valuable than any other commodity in the city, and private libraries sprouted up in the homes of local scholars.\n\n===Apex===\n\nBy the end of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]]'s reign (early 14th century CE), the Sankor\u00e9 Masjid had been converted into a fully staffed [[Madrassa]] (Islamic school or in this case university) with the largest collections of books in Africa since the [[Library of Alexandria]]. The level of learning at Timbuktu's Sankor\u00e9 University was superior to that of many other Islamic centers in the world. The Sankor\u00e9 Masjid was capable of housing 25,000 students and had one of the largest libraries in the world with between 400,000 and 700,000 manuscripts.<ref>See {{cite book |editor-first=Said |editor-last=Hamdun |editor2-first=No\u00ebl |editor2-last=King |title=Ibn Battuta in Black Africa |location=London |publisher=Rex Collins |year=1975 |isbn=0-901720-57-7 |pages=52\u201353 }}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nAs the center of an [[Islam]]ic scholarly community, the University was very different in organization from the universities of [[medieval]] [[Europe]]. It had no central administration other than the Emperor. It had no student registers but kept copies of its students' publishing. It was composed of several entirely independent schools or colleges, each run by a single master or [[imam]]. Students associated themselves with a single teacher, and courses took place in the open courtyard of the mosque or at private residences.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe curriculum of Sankor\u00e9 and other masjids in the area had four levels of schooling or \"degrees\". On graduating from each level, students would receive a turban symbolizing their mastery. The schooling was not secular as arguments that could not be backed by the [[Qur'an]] were inadmissible in debates.  However, secular teaching ([[geometry]], [[mathematics]]) were included and stressed to develop well-rounded individuals.\n\n===Qur'anic School===\nThe first or primary degree (Qur'anic school) required a mastery of [[Arabic]] and certain African languages and writing along with complete memorization of the Qur'an.  Students were also introduced to basic sciences at this level.\n\n===General Studies===\nThe secondary degree or General Studies degree focused on full immersion in the basic sciences.  Students learned grammar, mathematics, geography, history, physics, astronomy, chemistry alongside more advanced learnings of the Qur'an.

The three [[mosque]]s of Sankor\u00e9, [[Djinguereber Mosque|Djinguereber]] and [[Sidi Yahya Mosque|Sidi Yahya]] compose the [[University of Timbuktu]]. Madrasah (\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u0629) means school/university in Arabic and also in other languages that have been influenced by Islam.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fortier 368 Timbuktu Sankore Mosque.jpg|thumb|Postcard published by [[Fran\u00e7ois-Edmond Fortier|Edmond Fortier]] showing the mosque in 1905-06]] \nThe University of Sankore has its roots in the Sankore Mosque which was founded in 989 AD by [[Al-Qadi Aqib ibn Mahmud ibn Umar]], the Supreme Judge of Timbuktu. The Sankore University prospered and became a very significant seat of learning in the Muslim world, especially under the reign of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]] (1307\u20131332) and the Askia Dynasty (1493\u20131591).<ref>{{cite book |last=Woods |first=Michael |title=Seven Wonders of Ancient Africa |page=61 |publisher=Lerner |location=London |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7613-4320-2 }}</ref>\n\n===Growth as a center of learning===\n\nTimbuktu had long been a destination or stop for merchants from the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. It wasn't long before ideas as well as merchandise began passing through the fabled city. Since most if not all these traders were [[Muslim]], the mosque would see visitors constantly. The temple accumulated a wealth of books from throughout the Muslim world becoming not only a center of worship but a center of learning. Books became more valuable than any other commodity in the city, and private libraries sprouted up in the homes of local scholars.\n\n===Apex===\n\nBy the end of [[Musa I of Mali|Mansa Musa]]'s reign (early 14th century CE), the Sankor\u00e9 Masjid had been converted into a fully staffed [[Madrassa]] (Islamic school or in this case university) with the largest collections of books in Africa since the [[Library of Alexandria]]. The level of learning at Timbuktu's Sankor\u00e9 University was superior to that of many other Islamic centers in the world. The Sankor\u00e9 Masjid was capable of housing 25,000 students and had one of the largest libraries in the world with between 400,000 and 700,000 manuscripts.<ref>See {{cite book |editor-first=Said |editor-last=Hamdun |editor2-first=No\u00ebl |editor2-last=King |title=Ibn Battuta in Black Africa |location=London |publisher=Rex Collins |year=1975 |isbn=0-901720-57-7 |pages=52\u201353 }}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nAs the center of an [[Islam]]ic scholarly community, the University was very different in organization from the universities of [[medieval]] [[Europe]]. It had no central administration other than the Emperor. It had no student registers but kept copies of its students' publishing. It was composed of several entirely independent schools or colleges, each run by a single master or [[imam]]. Students associated themselves with a single teacher, and courses took place in the open courtyard of the mosque or at private residences.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe curriculum of Sankor\u00e9 and other masjids in the area had four levels of schooling or \"degrees\". On graduating from each level, students would receive a turban symbolizing their mastery. The schooling was not secular as arguments that could not be backed by the [[Qur'an]] were inadmissible in debates.  However, secular teaching ([[geometry]], [[mathematics]]) were included and stressed to develop well-rounded individuals.\n\n===Qur'anic School===\nThe first or primary degree (Qur'anic school) required a mastery of [[Arabic]] and certain African languages and writing along with complete memorization of the Qur'an.  Students were also introduced to basic sciences at this level.\n\n===General Studies===\nThe secondary degree or General Studies degree focused on full immersion in the basic sciences.  Students learned grammar, mathematics, geography, history, physics, astronomy, chemistry alongside more advanced learnings of the Qur'an.  At this level they learned ''Hadiths'', jurisprudence and the sciences of spiritual purification according to Islam.  Finally, they began an introduction to trade school and business ethics. On graduation day, students were given turbans symbolizing Divine light, wisdom, knowledge and excellent moral conduct. After receiving their diplomas the students would gather outside the examination building or the main campus library and throw their turbans high into the air cheering and holding each other's hands to show that they were all brothers and sisters.<ref>See {{cite journal |first=S\u00e9k\u00e9n\u00e9 Mody |last=Cissoko |title=L\u2019intelligentsia de Tombouctou aux 15e et 16e si\u00e8cles |journal=[[Pr\u00e9sence Africaine]] |volume=72 |year=1969 |pages=48\u201372 |postscript=, }} and {{cite book |first=Jean-Louis |last=Triaud |title=Islam et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s soudanaises au Moyen-\u00c2ge: \u00c9tude historique |series=\u00c9tdues volta\u00efques |volume=vol. 16 |location=Paris \u2013 Adidjan \u2013 Niamey |year=1973 |pages=167 sq. }}</ref>\n\n===Superior Degree===\nThe Superior degree required students to study under specialized professors doing research work.

A lot of writers who are considered good I consider strange\", he said.<ref name= nytint/>\n\n[[Oprah Winfrey]] selected McCarthy's 2006 novel ''[[The Road]]'' as the April 2007 selection for her [[Oprah's Book Club|Book Club]].<ref name= oprahbookclub >{{cite news|title=Your Reader's Guide to The Road|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahsbookclub/road/road_book_synopsis| publisher=Oprah.com}}</ref> As a result, McCarthy agreed to his first television interview, which aired on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on June 5, 2007. The interview took place in the library of the [[Santa Fe Institute]]. McCarthy told Winfrey that he does not know any writers and much prefers the company of scientists. During the interview, he related several stories illustrating the degree of outright poverty he endured at times during his career as a writer. He also spoke about the experience of fathering a child at an advanced age, and how his son was the inspiration for ''The Road''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nRegarding his own literary constraints when writing novels, McCarthy said he is \"not a fan of some of the Latin American writers, [[magical realism]]. You know, it's hard enough to get people to believe what you're telling them without making it impossible. It has to be vaguely plausible.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1673269-2,00.html|title=A conversation between author Cormac McCarthy and the Coen Brothers, about the new movie No Country for Old Men|website=Time.com|date=October 18, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs reported in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, McCarthy's [[Olivetti Lettera 32]] typewriter, which he had owned since buying it in a Knoxville pawnshop for $50 in 1963, was put up for auction at [[Christie's]] in 2009.

Common elements are the principle of an all-embracing, universal and omniscient [[Great Spirit]], a connection to the Earth and its landscapes, a belief in a parallel world in the sky (sometimes also underground and / or below the water), diverse creation narratives, visits to the 'land of the dead', and collective memories of ancient sacred ancestors\n\nA characteristic of many of the myths is the close relationship between human beings and animals (including birds and reptiles).
