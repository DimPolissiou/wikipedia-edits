As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed Ordinance Number 060107 to \"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article\u2026if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\"  This was the first ordinance of its time. The goal of the ordinance was to place pressure on the California State Legislature and national government to follow suit.  As a California State Legislator, she continued her work, passing A.B. 1108, which also banned toxic chemicals from children's toys.  Her language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Hepatitis B awareness and prevention===\nAt the age of 22, Fiona Ma learned that she had Hepatitis B (HBV), a virus that causes 80 percent of all liver cancer if left untreated and often shows no symptoms until it is almost too late.  Almost 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half are Asian Pacific Islander Americans.  An estimated one in ten are chronically infected with the virus.  As a result of its high Asian population, San Francisco has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men in California.\n  \nFiona Ma assumed a leading role in the fight against Hepatitis B, serving as a spokesperson for San Francisco Hep B Free - the largest and most intensive healthcare campaign for APIs in the United States.  It is widely considered a model for the nation in eliminating HBV in a regional area.\n\nIn 2008, Fiona Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158, which would have required the Department of Health Care Services to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic Hepatitis B.  She also introduced a resolution declaring May 2009 as Hepatitis B Awareness Month in California.\n\n===High-speed rail===\nAssemblymember Ma is a longtime advocate of transportation solutions, the Joint author of Proposition 1-A and the convener of the High Speed Rail Caucus. Ma was one of the leading advocates of high-speed trains in California and one of its main campaigners traveling statewide promoting its environmental benefits and job creating effects . The proposition ultimately was approved by the voters in November 2008 maintaining critical funding after the Governor Schwarzenegger had proposed a major defunding of high-speed rail.\n\n===Incarcerated survivors of domestic violence===\nAs the chair of the Domestic Violence Select Committee, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma has worked diligently to shed light on the challenges that incarcerated victims of domestic violence experience while in the judicial system.  A California prison study found that 93% of the women who had killed their significant others had been battered; 67% of these women attempted to protect themselves or their children. She has attended parole hearings to ensure survivors who have spent decades behind bars receive suitability; and also spearheaded the first legislation of its kind in the entire country, when Governor Brown signed [http://legislation.sinbysilence.com/ \"The Sin by Silence Bills\"], inspired by the documentary [[Sin by Silence]], into law on September 30, 2012 that ensures the path to freedom for over 7,000 domestic violence survivors currently serving time in California prisons. AB 593 allows victims of domestic violence whose expert testimony was limited at their trial court proceedings to re-file for a writ of habeas corpus to allow this expert testimony to weigh in on their defense and it will also give victims more time to receive legal representation by deleting the sunset date currently in statute.  AB 1593 gives victims who have suffered Intimate Partner Battering (IPB) a chance to present their evidence in an effective way during the parole process by giving great weight to any information or evidence that proves the prisoner experienced IPB and its effects at the time the crime was committed. This bill will also require that the information delivered to the Legislature relating to IPB, will be in specific and detailed reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Non-profit and community involvement===\nMa serves on the Board of Directors, and was a past Treasurer, for Curry Without Worry, a non-profit based in San Francisco. Since 2006, this organization has fed over 45,000 people.[8] She is also currently on the Board of Directors of CA Women Lead and Asian Inc.  She is the Honorary Chair and spokesperson of the San Francisco Hep B Free Campaign; Honorary California Chair of the New Leaders Council, Board Advisory Committee for the James L. Brady Riding Program for Children with Disabilities, Board Advisory Committee for Family Connections, President of Board of Asian American Donor Program, and Board Advisory Committee of the SF Ethnic Dance Festival.\n\n===State and national outreach===\nAssemblymember Ma has been active in promoting trade and fostering relationships between California and the Nation.  As an Executive Board Member of the National Conference of State Legislators, she worked to keep California competitive with other states.  She also served as the Western Region Director of Women in Government, the State Legislative Leaders Council, and was an Executive Board Member of the California Democratic Party.\n\n===International outreach===\nSince 1998, Ma has been on the forefront in promoting trade and commerce between California and Asia, leading legislative delegations to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. She has been a frequent speaker in the region promoting US interests in high-speed rail, agriculture, entertainment and education.

The Assembly voted 75-0 to support AB 74. The bill establishes safety guidelines for electronic-music concerts when they are held on publicly owned properties such as the Cow Palace, which is located in Ma's 12th Assembly District. \"California needs to better monitor and control events occurring on state properties,\" Ma said in a news release. \"AB 74 is intended to prevent the loss of life and make safety a top priority at events on state property.\" The law requires the state agency intending to host any rave expected to draw 10,000 people or more to assess potential problems, the need for law enforcement and medical personnel, and other related issues. If the agency concludes there's a strong possibility for loss of life or harm to participants, the show's promoter would be required to prepare a plan to provide an adequate law-enforcement presence, control drug use and potentially prohibit minors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county/ci_18151243?nclick_check=1 |title=Ma's bill targeting raves passes Assembly - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>\n\n'''AB 183 (2011) Alcoholic beverage licenses: self-service checkout'''<br/>\nThis bill prohibits off-sale licensees from selling alcoholic beverages using a customer-operated checkout stand located on the licensee's physical premises.

Approximately 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half of them are Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Americans.  It is estimated that 1 in 10 APIs are chronically infected with HBV.  Like most APIs, Ma contracted HBV from her mother at birth via perinatal exposure. San Francisco has the highest rate of liver cancer in the nation because of its high API population, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men living in California. Ma works to remove the stigma of the disease in the Asian community by actively speaking out about the importance of testing and vaccination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |title=Fighting to eliminate hepatitis |author=Mike Aldax |date=May 13, 2010 |work=The San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=2010-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524153519/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 }}</ref> In 2008, Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158 which requires the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic hepatitis B.

As a Supervisor in San Francisco, she authored and passed Ordinance Number 060107 to \"prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in commerce of any toy or child-care article\u2026if it contains bisphenol-A or other specified chemicals.\"  This was the first ordinance of its time. The goal of the ordinance was to place pressure on the California State Legislature and national government to follow suit.  As a California State Legislator, she continued her work, passing A.B. 1108, which also banned toxic chemicals from children's toys.  Her language was later used by Senator Dianne Feinstein in the federal Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, signed into law in 2008.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Hepatitis B awareness and prevention===\nAt the age of 22, Fiona Ma learned that she had Hepatitis B (HBV), a virus that causes 80 percent of all liver cancer if left untreated and often shows no symptoms until it is almost too late.  Almost 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half are Asian Pacific Islander Americans.  An estimated one in ten are chronically infected with the virus.  As a result of its high Asian population, San Francisco has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men in California.\n  \nFiona Ma assumed a leading role in the fight against Hepatitis B, serving as a spokesperson for San Francisco Hep B Free - the largest and most intensive healthcare campaign for APIs in the United States.  It is widely considered a model for the nation in eliminating HBV in a regional area.\n\nIn 2008, Fiona Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158, which would have required the Department of Health Care Services to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic Hepatitis B.  She also introduced a resolution declaring May 2009 as Hepatitis B Awareness Month in California.\n\n===High-speed rail===\nAssemblymember Ma is a longtime advocate of transportation solutions, the Joint author of Proposition 1-A and the convener of the High Speed Rail Caucus. Ma was one of the leading advocates of high-speed trains in California and one of its main campaigners traveling statewide promoting its environmental benefits and job creating effects . The proposition ultimately was approved by the voters in November 2008 maintaining critical funding after the Governor Schwarzenegger had proposed a major defunding of high-speed rail.\n\n===Incarcerated survivors of domestic violence===\nAs the chair of the Domestic Violence Select Committee, Assemblywoman Fiona Ma has worked diligently to shed light on the challenges that incarcerated victims of domestic violence experience while in the judicial system.  A California prison study found that 93% of the women who had killed their significant others had been battered; 67% of these women attempted to protect themselves or their children. She has attended parole hearings to ensure survivors who have spent decades behind bars receive suitability; and also spearheaded the first legislation of its kind in the entire country, when Governor Brown signed [http://legislation.sinbysilence.com/ \"The Sin by Silence Bills\"], inspired by the documentary [[Sin by Silence]], into law on September 30, 2012 that ensures the path to freedom for over 7,000 domestic violence survivors currently serving time in California prisons. AB 593 allows victims of domestic violence whose expert testimony was limited at their trial court proceedings to re-file for a writ of habeas corpus to allow this expert testimony to weigh in on their defense and it will also give victims more time to receive legal representation by deleting the sunset date currently in statute.  AB 1593 gives victims who have suffered Intimate Partner Battering (IPB) a chance to present their evidence in an effective way during the parole process by giving great weight to any information or evidence that proves the prisoner experienced IPB and its effects at the time the crime was committed. This bill will also require that the information delivered to the Legislature relating to IPB, will be in specific and detailed reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Non-profit and community involvement===\nMa serves on the Board of Directors, and was a past Treasurer, for Curry Without Worry, a non-profit based in San Francisco. Since 2006, this organization has fed over 45,000 people.[8] She is also currently on the Board of Directors of CA Women Lead and Asian Inc.  She is the Honorary Chair and spokesperson of the San Francisco Hep B Free Campaign; Honorary California Chair of the New Leaders Council, Board Advisory Committee for the James L. Brady Riding Program for Children with Disabilities, Board Advisory Committee for Family Connections, President of Board of Asian American Donor Program, and Board Advisory Committee of the SF Ethnic Dance Festival.\n\n===State and national outreach===\nAssemblymember Ma has been active in promoting trade and fostering relationships between California and the Nation.  As an Executive Board Member of the National Conference of State Legislators, she worked to keep California competitive with other states.  She also served as the Western Region Director of Women in Government, the State Legislative Leaders Council, and was an Executive Board Member of the California Democratic Party.\n\n===International outreach===\nSince 1998, Ma has been on the forefront in promoting trade and commerce between California and Asia, leading legislative delegations to China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. She has been a frequent speaker in the region promoting US interests in high-speed rail, agriculture, entertainment and education.  She has also taken the lead to welcome foreign dignitaries visiting California in her elected capacities.\n \nShe has participated in various California trade delegations and has met with legislative leaders and decision-makers in India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, France, Israel, Ireland and Iceland.\n\n==Legislative Session 2011\u201312==\nIn the 2011-2012 legislative session, Assemblywoman Ma had 25 bills chaptered into law, 4 Assembly Concurrent Resolutions and 1 Assembly Joint Resolution signed by Governor Brown.\n\nA few of the Assemblywoman's bills are as follows:\n\n'''AB 74 Public event action plans and cooperative management'''<br> \nIn response to substance abuse-related deaths, injuries and arrests involving electronic-music shows at San Francisco's Cow Palace and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The Assembly voted 75-0 to support AB 74. The bill establishes safety guidelines for electronic-music concerts when they are held on publicly owned properties such as the Cow Palace, which is located in Ma's 12th Assembly District. \"California needs to better monitor and control events occurring on state properties,\" Ma said in a news release. \"AB 74 is intended to prevent the loss of life and make safety a top priority at events on state property.\" The law requires the state agency intending to host any rave expected to draw 10,000 people or more to assess potential problems, the need for law enforcement and medical personnel, and other related issues. If the agency concludes there's a strong possibility for loss of life or harm to participants, the show's promoter would be required to prepare a plan to provide an adequate law-enforcement presence, control drug use and potentially prohibit minors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/san-mateo-county/ci_18151243?nclick_check=1 |title=Ma's bill targeting raves passes Assembly - San Jose Mercury News |publisher=Mercurynews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-30}}</ref>\n\n'''AB 183 (2011) Alcoholic beverage licenses: self-service checkout'''<br/>\nThis bill prohibits off-sale licensees from selling alcoholic beverages using a customer-operated checkout stand located on the licensee's physical premises.

Approximately 1.4 million Americans are infected with HBV, and more than half of them are Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Americans.  It is estimated that 1 in 10 APIs are chronically infected with HBV.  Like most APIs, Ma contracted HBV from her mother at birth via perinatal exposure. San Francisco has the highest rate of liver cancer in the nation because of its high API population, and HBV-related liver cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among API men living in California. Ma works to remove the stigma of the disease in the Asian community by actively speaking out about the importance of testing and vaccination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |title=Fighting to eliminate hepatitis |author=Mike Aldax |date=May 13, 2010 |work=The San Francisco Examiner |accessdate=2010-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524153519/http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/Fighting-to-eliminate-hepatitis-93624149.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 }}</ref> In 2008, Ma introduced Assembly Bill 158 which requires the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) to apply for a federal waiver to expand Medi-Cal eligibility for individuals with chronic hepatitis B.

The caucus worked to protect and restore budget funding for the High Speed Rail Authority and fought to keep the High Speed Rail bond on the November 2008 ballot. Assemblywoman Ma joint-authored AB 3034, the Safe Reliable, High-Speed Train Bond Act for the 21st Century\u2014Prop 1-A on the November 2008 ballot.

When asked about the genesis of his Liszt biography he wrote:  \u201cI had always been immensely attracted to Liszt\u2019s magnetic personality, and in my childhood I was drawn to the legend of his piano playing as to few other topics. They say that in every biography is an autobiography trying to get out.  The idea would be diverting if it were not so sobering.  I have come to believe that the best biographies choose their biographers, not vice versa.  The lucky biographers write their work not because they have a choice but because they have no choice at all.\u201d <ref>The Hungarian Quarterly.

The temnospondyl hunted invertebrates and fish during the late stage [[Triassic]] epoch, and somewhat resembles the only other species of the eastern [[Gondwana]]n genus ''[[Deltasaurus]]''.

Cosgriff]], recognised as a second species of a new genus.<ref name=\"fossilworks\" /> The [[type species]], described in the same study, was found at [[Blina Shale]] in the northwest of Australia, whereas this species described fossil material obtained from the [[Kockatea Formation]] in the southwest of the continent, near [[Geraldton, Western Australia]].<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\" /><ref name=\"Kear2011\" /> The type locality of ''D. pustulatus'' is named Beagle Ridge Bore, where the partial remains of a skull with its impression were extracted in a 86&nbsp;mm [[core sample]] of grey-green [[shale]].<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\" />\n\n==Description ==\nA species of ''[[Deltasaurus]]'', distinguished by the bone structure and longer, narrower skull from ''D. kimberleyensis'', the type and only other known species of the genus.<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\" />\nThe skull length of the specimen was approximately 110 millimetres.\nThe diet is assumed to be small invertebrates and fish species.<ref name=\"Kear2011\" />\n\nThe type material, the right side of a skull,<ref name=\"Chure2016\" /> appears to be a section of a more complete fossil and that an edge of that section was lost in the process of returning the [[well drilling]] core to the surface; the impression of the lost material remains on facing surface of the broken core. The grey-green shale of the extracted sample is otherwise uniform in its composition.<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\" />\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe species is only temnospondyl to have been identified at the Kockatea shale. The fine grey shale where the skull was located is likely to be a marine deposition, and there is a high degree of certainty that the remains were washed in from a terrestrial habitat at a nearby location.<ref name=\"Easton1974\" />\n\nThe collection of vertebrate fossils in drill cores is a rare event, but greater than the earlier expectations of finds\u2014which had been close to zero\u2014by workers in the field of palaeontology.

The only known evidence of the species was discovered in a drill core in [[Southwest Australia (ecoregion)|Southwest Australia]], near [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]], a seemingly improbable event that produced the only known example of Triassic vertebrate fauna in the ecologically exceptional region's [[Kockatea Formation]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe description of ''Deltasaurus pustulatus'' was published in 1965 by [[John W. Cosgriff]], recognised as a second species of a new genus.<ref name=\"fossilworks\" /> The [[type species]], described in the same study, was found at [[Blina Shale]] in the northwest of Australia, whereas this species described fossil material obtained from the [[Kockatea Formation]] in the southwest of the continent, near [[Geraldton, Western Australia]].<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\" /><ref name=\"Kear2011\" /> The type locality of ''D. pustulatus'' is named Beagle Ridge Bore, where the partial remains of a skull with its impression were extracted in a 86&nbsp;mm [[core sample]] of grey-green [[shale]].<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\" />\n\n==Description ==\nA species of ''[[Deltasaurus]]'', distinguished by the bone structure and longer, narrower skull from ''D. kimberleyensis'', the type and only other known species of the genus.<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\" />\nThe skull length of the specimen was approximately 110 millimetres.\nThe diet is assumed to be small invertebrates and fish species.<ref name=\"Kear2011\" />\n\nThe type material, the right side of a skull,<ref name=\"Chure2016\" /> appears to be a section of a more complete fossil and that an edge of that section was lost in the process of returning the [[well drilling]] core to the surface; the impression of the lost material remains on facing surface of the broken core. The grey-green shale of the extracted sample is otherwise uniform in its composition.<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\" />\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe species is only temnospondyl to have been identified at the Kockatea shale. The fine grey shale where the skull was located is likely to be a marine deposition, and there is a high degree of certainty that the remains were washed in from a terrestrial habitat at a nearby location.<ref name=\"Easton1974\" /> \n\nThe collection of vertebrate fossils in drill cores is a rare event, but greater than the earlier expectations of finds\u2014which had been close to zero\u2014by workers in the field of palaeontology. The depth of the sample that produced the species type and only  fossil material was between 797 and 800 metres, revealed during an examination of a drill core made in a state survey of mineral resources.<ref name=\"Chure2016\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Chure2016\">{{cite journal |last1=Chure |first1=D.J. |last2=Engelmann |first2=G.F. |title=Fossil vertebrates in drill cores, a rare but surprisingly diverse record |journal=Fossil Record |date=1 January 2016 |volume=5 |issue=74 |pages=51\u201359 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bMJQDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA51 |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science |language=en}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Cosgriff1965\">{{cite journal |last1=Cosgriff |first1=J.W. |authorlink1=J.

An individual may or may not be aware that the degree they have obtained is not wholly legitimate. In either case, legal issues can arise if the qualification is used in [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"diploma mill\" originally denotes an institution providing diplomas on an intensive and profit-making basis, like a [[factory]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118469?redirectedFrom=diploma+mill#eid36876996\n |title      = mill 1 n.\n |work       = [[Oxford English Dictionary]]\n |edition    = 3rd\n |accessdate = November 30, 2012\n}}\n</ref> More broadly, it describes any institution that offers qualifications which are not accredited nor based on proper academic assessment.\n\nWhile the terms \"degree mill\" and \"diploma mill\" are commonly used interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is sometimes drawn.<ref>[http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/March-April%202009/abstract-real-and-fake.html \"The Real and the Fake: Degree and Diploma Mills\"],  [[Alan Contreras]] and [[George Gollin]], ''Change'', March\u2013April 2009</ref> A \"degree mill\" issues diplomas from unaccredited institutions which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate, while a \"diploma mill\" issues counterfeit diplomas bearing the names of real universities.\n\nAcademic diplomas may be legitimately awarded without any study as a recognition of authority or experience. When given extraordinarily, such degrees are called [[honorary degree]]s or ''honoris causa'' degrees. Also, in some universities, holders of a lower degree (such as a [[bachelor's degree]]) may be routinely awarded honorary higher degrees (such as a [[master's degree]]) without study.\n\nThe term \"diploma mill\" may also be used pejoratively to describe a legitimate institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate, such as [[for-profit school]]s.<ref name=\"Lantero\"/>\n\nRelated practices are direct [[document forgery]] of certificates and corrupt buying of degrees from otherwise legitimate universities, although neither require a separate \"mill\".\n\n==Characteristics==\nDiploma mills share a number of features that differentiate them from respected institutions, although some legitimate institutions may exhibit some of the same characteristics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/alerts/article.asp?ID=185 | title=Is the U.S. becoming a haven for diploma mills? | author=BBB | work=bbb.org | publisher=Council of Better Business Bureaus | date=July 12, 2000 |accessdate=2010-07-01| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031032931/http://www.bbb.org/alerts/article.asp?ID=185 | archivedate = 2003-10-31}}</ref>\n\n===Accreditation and authenticity===\n{{See also|Accreditation mill}}\nThe most notable feature of diploma mills is that they lack [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] by a nationally recognized accrediting agency. (Note, however, that not all [[unaccredited institutions of higher learning]] are diploma mills.) Diploma mills therefore employ various tactics in an attempt to appear more legitimate to potential students.\n\nSome diploma mills claim accreditation by an accreditation mill while referring to themselves as being \"fully accredited\".  Accreditation mills based in the United States may model their websites after real accrediting agencies overseen by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). Another typical ploy is for mills to claim to be internationally recognized by organizations such as [[UNESCO]]. UNESCO has no authority to recognize or accredit higher education institutions or agencies, and has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation.<ref name=\"Lantero\"/>\n\nSome diploma and degree mills have played a role in creating unrecognized accrediting bodies as well.  These diploma and degree mills may further confuse matters by claiming to consider work history, professional education, and previous learning, and may even require the submission of a [[dissertation]] or [[thesis]] in order to give an added appearance of legitimacy.<ref name=\"transcriptresearch.com\"/>\n\nAs diploma mills are typically [[Business license|licensed to do business]], it is common practice within the industry to misrepresent their business license as indicating government approval of the institution.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Promotional materials may use words denoting a legal status such as \"licensed\", \"state authorized\", or \"state-approved\" to suggest an equivalence to accreditation.\n\nSome advertise other indicators of authenticity that are not relevant to academic credentials. For example, the University of Northern Washington advertises that its degrees are \"attested and sealed for authenticity by a government appointed [[notary public|notary]]\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm |title=University of Northern Washington Accreditation | publisher=University of Northern Washington |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523172454/http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm| archivedate=2008-05-23 |accessdate= 2010-07-01 }}</ref> In reality notarization only certifies that the document was signed by the person named.\n\nDiploma mills are frequently named to sound confusingly similar to those of prestigious [[educational accreditation|accredited]] academic institutions.<ref name=foxnews2009>[[Associated Press|AP]] (January 28, 2009). [http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2009Jan28/0,4675,OnlineEducationGlance,00.html \"5 signs your school might be a diploma mill\"]. ''foxnews.com''; [[News Corp (2013\u2013present)|News Corp]]. Retrieved 2010-07-01.</ref>  Despite the fact that [[trademark law]] is intended to prevent this situation, diploma mills continue to employ various methods to avoid [[legal recourse]]. Several diploma mills have adopted British-sounding names, similar but not identical to the names of legitimate universities, apparently to take advantage of the United Kingdom's reputation for educational quality in other parts of the world.<ref name=UKallure>Melanie Newman, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208627&sectioncode=26 Degree mills bank on allure of UK names], ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', 20 April 2007</ref>  Some examples of British-sounding names used by diploma mills are \"Shaftesbury University\", \"University of Dunham\", \"Redding University\", and \"Suffield University\".<ref name=UKallure/>\n\nThe school's website may well not have an [[.edu]] domain, or other country-specific equivalent, since registration of such names is typically restricted.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/show_faq.asp?code=EDUELIGIBILITY\n |title        = EduCause eligibility\n |accessdate   = 2012-11-30\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609102127/http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/show_faq.asp?code=EDUELIGIBILITY\n |archive-date = 2012-06-09\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> However, enforcement has sometimes been less restrictive, and an .edu domain cannot be taken as verification of school quality or reputation. Some diploma mills use an [[.ac]] top-level domain name, which resembles genuine second-level academic domain names like [[ac.uk]] but is in fact the [[ccTLD]] for [[Ascension Island]]. To prevent misuse of their names in this way, some legitimate academic institutions have registered .ac domains.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Teaching===\nCompared to legitimate institutions, diploma mills tend to have drastically lowered academic requirements, if any at all. Depending on the institution, students may be required to purchase textbooks, take tests, and submit homework, but degrees are commonly conferred after little or no study.\n\nInstead of \"[[hard sciences]]\", where competence is easier to verify, the subjects offered by a diploma mill are often [[esoteric]] and may be based on a [[pseudoscience]] like [[astrology]] or [[naturopathy]]. Such subjects are only vaguely defined, making external verification of educational standards difficult.\n\nDegree mills typically offer little or no interaction with professors. Even if comments and corrections to coursework are given, they may have no bearing on the degree which is awarded. In other cases professors may serve only to write compliments to the student that can be given as references.\n\n===Facilities===\nSince diploma mills provide little in the way of teaching, there is usually no need for teaching facilities. The school tends to have no library, personnel, publications or research. In short, very little that is tangible can be found about the institution.<ref name=\"military\">{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/education/finding-a-school/fraudulent-degrees-are-big-business.html|title=Fraudulent Degrees Are Big Business|work=Military.com}}</ref><ref name=\"classbase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/News/beware-of-diploma-mill-degrees-8|title=Beware of Diploma Mill Degrees|work=classbase.com}}</ref><ref name=\"getb\">{{cite web|url=http://getbschooled.typepad.com/getbschooled/2012/04/diploma-and-accreditation-mills-what-to-watch-for.html|title=Warning Signs of Possible Diploma Mills - Get B-Schooled|work=typepad.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031085709/http://getbschooled.typepad.com/getbschooled/2012/04/diploma-and-accreditation-mills-what-to-watch-for.html|archivedate=2015-10-31}}</ref> If teaching is offered, the professors may themselves hold advanced degrees from the diploma mill itself or from other unaccredited institutions. They may also sport legitimate qualifications that are unrelated to the subject they teach.\n\nDoctoral theses and dissertations from the institution will not be available from [[University Microfilms International]], a national repository, or even the institution's own library, if it has one. The address given by a diploma mill is often a postal box, mail forwarding service or suite number.<ref name=foxnews2009/> There are legitimate distance learning institutions with limited facilities, however, but legitimate universities make their authority clear.<ref name=\"getb\" /> For academics, publications in [[Scientific journal|peer-reviewed scientific journals]] are important for establishing scientific credentials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://validatingmichael.com/Michael_Teachings/2010/07/30/diploma-mills|title=Diploma Mills|work=Validating Michael|access-date=2014-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006075030/http://validatingmichael.com/Michael_Teachings/2010/07/30/diploma-mills|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, in diploma mills, the research is either absent, fake or purely self-published without any external review.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/clayton.html|title=Clayton College of Natural Health: Be Wary of the School and Its Graduates|website=www.quackwatch.org}}</ref> This may be unfortunately hard to spot, since fake journals also exist.

For example, a [[schoolteacher]] might buy a degree from a diploma mill in order to advance to [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]]. Degrees from a diploma mill can be obtained within a few days, weeks or months from the time of enrollment, and back-dating is possible.<ref name=foxnews2009/> Academic credit may be offered for \"life experience,\" a point often featured heavily in the selling points of the institution.<ref>{{cite news |first=Christine |last=Lagorio |title=Diploma Mill Calling: Continuing Ed Without the Ed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/education/edlife/diplomamill.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 6, 2006}}</ref> This should not be confused with legitimate programs offering [[recognition of prior learning]], which allow students to gain academic credit based on past training, experience or independent study. This will usually require a test that the student can fail; a diploma mill will grant the degree regardless of results.\n\nTuition and fees are charged on a per-degree basis rather than by term or by course.<ref name=foxnews2009/> Diploma mills are often advertised using [[e-mail spam]] or other questionable methods. Legitimate institutions use traditional advertising and high school recruitment. Prospective students are encouraged to \"enroll now\" before tuition or fees are increased. They may be told that they qualify for a fellowship, scholarship or grant, or offered deals to sign up for multiple degrees at the same time.<ref name=foxnews2009/> Promotional literature might contain grammatical and spelling errors, words in Latin, extravagant or pretentious language, and sample diplomas. The school's website may look amateurish or unprofessionally made.\n\n==Legal considerations==\nDegrees and diplomas issued by diploma mills have been used to obtain employment, raises, or clients. Even if issuing or receiving a diploma mill qualification is legal, passing it off as an accredited one for personal gain is a [[crime]] in many jurisdictions. In some cases the diploma mill may itself be guilty of an [[offense (law)|offense]], if it knew or ought to have known that the qualifications it issues are used for fraudulent purposes. Diploma mills could also be guilty of [[fraud]] if they mislead customers into believing that the qualifications they issue are accredited or recognized, or make false claims that they will lead to career advancement, and accept money on the basis of these claims.\n\nSimilar to [[tax havens]], diploma mills frequently employ [[jurisdiction shopping]], operating in another country or legal jurisdiction where running diploma mills is legal, standards are lax or prosecution is unlikely. Splitting the business across jurisdictions can be a way to avoid authorities. A school might operate in one jurisdiction but use a mailing address in a different jurisdiction, for example.<ref>Navarrete, Erika and Wilson, Jaryd (May 26, 2009).

Many of the public universities are established by provincial legislation which also confers degree granting authority upon the institution. However, private postsecondary institutions are also required to comply with applicable legislation in order to confer degrees and diplomas. For example, in Ontario the ''Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000'' regulates degree-granting authority. Any institution that wishes to offer a degree or use the term \"university\" must be authorized to do so under an Act of the Legislature or by the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.<ref>[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_00p36_e.htm \"Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000 : S.O. 2000, CHAPTER 36 : Schedule\"].

Accreditation is conferred by the Conference of University Rectors of Switzerland (CRUS) and the Swiss Center of Accreditation and Quality Assurance in Higher Education (OAQ). Under Swiss law, it is a criminal offense, under [[unfair competition]] legislation, to profit by any unfounded academic or occupational qualifications.

Some institutions do not have degree-awarding powers but provide complete courses leading to recognised UK degrees that are validated by institutions which have degree-awarding powers. The UK authorities recognise those institutions which have been granted degree-awarding powers by either a [[Royal charter]], an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] or the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. These degree-awarding institutions are known as \"recognised bodies.\" All UK universities and some higher education colleges are \"recognised bodies.\" If an institution is not a \"recognised body\" or makes degree awards not validated by such a body, it is likely to be a degree mill.

An individual may or may not be aware that the degree they have obtained is not wholly legitimate. In either case, legal issues can arise if the qualification is used in [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"diploma mill\" originally denotes an institution providing diplomas on an intensive and profit-making basis, like a [[factory]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/118469?redirectedFrom=diploma+mill#eid36876996\n |title      = mill 1 n.\n |work       = [[Oxford English Dictionary]]\n |edition    = 3rd\n |accessdate = November 30, 2012\n}}\n</ref> More broadly, it describes any institution that offers qualifications which are not accredited nor based on proper academic assessment.\n\nWhile the terms \"degree mill\" and \"diploma mill\" are commonly used interchangeably, within the academic community a distinction is sometimes drawn.<ref>[http://www.changemag.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/March-April%202009/abstract-real-and-fake.html \"The Real and the Fake: Degree and Diploma Mills\"],  [[Alan Contreras]] and [[George Gollin]], ''Change'', March\u2013April 2009</ref> A \"degree mill\" issues diplomas from unaccredited institutions which may be legal in some states but are generally illegitimate, while a \"diploma mill\" issues counterfeit diplomas bearing the names of real universities.\n\nAcademic diplomas may be legitimately awarded without any study as a recognition of authority or experience. When given extraordinarily, such degrees are called [[honorary degree]]s or ''honoris causa'' degrees. Also, in some universities, holders of a lower degree (such as a [[bachelor's degree]]) may be routinely awarded honorary higher degrees (such as a [[master's degree]]) without study.\n\nThe term \"diploma mill\" may also be used pejoratively to describe a legitimate institution with low academic admission standards and a low job placement rate, such as [[for-profit school]]s.<ref name=\"Lantero\"/>\n\nRelated practices are direct [[document forgery]] of certificates and corrupt buying of degrees from otherwise legitimate universities, although neither require a separate \"mill\".\n\n==Characteristics==\nDiploma mills share a number of features that differentiate them from respected institutions, although some legitimate institutions may exhibit some of the same characteristics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbb.org/alerts/article.asp?ID=185 | title=Is the U.S. becoming a haven for diploma mills? | author=BBB | work=bbb.org | publisher=Council of Better Business Bureaus | date=July 12, 2000 |accessdate=2010-07-01| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031032931/http://www.bbb.org/alerts/article.asp?ID=185 | archivedate = 2003-10-31}}</ref>\n\n===Accreditation and authenticity===\n{{See also|Accreditation mill}}\nThe most notable feature of diploma mills is that they lack [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] by a nationally recognized accrediting agency. (Note, however, that not all [[unaccredited institutions of higher learning]] are diploma mills.) Diploma mills therefore employ various tactics in an attempt to appear more legitimate to potential students.\n\nSome diploma mills claim accreditation by an accreditation mill while referring to themselves as being \"fully accredited\".  Accreditation mills based in the United States may model their websites after real accrediting agencies overseen by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). Another typical ploy is for mills to claim to be internationally recognized by organizations such as [[UNESCO]]. UNESCO has no authority to recognize or accredit higher education institutions or agencies, and has published warnings against education organizations that claim UNESCO recognition or affiliation.<ref name=\"Lantero\"/>\n\nSome diploma and degree mills have played a role in creating unrecognized accrediting bodies as well.  These diploma and degree mills may further confuse matters by claiming to consider work history, professional education, and previous learning, and may even require the submission of a [[dissertation]] or [[thesis]] in order to give an added appearance of legitimacy.<ref name=\"transcriptresearch.com\"/>\n\nAs diploma mills are typically [[Business license|licensed to do business]], it is common practice within the industry to misrepresent their business license as indicating government approval of the institution.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Promotional materials may use words denoting a legal status such as \"licensed\", \"state authorized\", or \"state-approved\" to suggest an equivalence to accreditation.\n\nSome advertise other indicators of authenticity that are not relevant to academic credentials. For example, the University of Northern Washington advertises that its degrees are \"attested and sealed for authenticity by a government appointed [[notary public|notary]]\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm |title=University of Northern Washington Accreditation | publisher=University of Northern Washington |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523172454/http://www.unw.edu/Accred.htm| archivedate=2008-05-23 |accessdate= 2010-07-01 }}</ref> In reality notarization only certifies that the document was signed by the person named.\n\nDiploma mills are frequently named to sound confusingly similar to those of prestigious [[educational accreditation|accredited]] academic institutions.<ref name=foxnews2009>[[Associated Press|AP]] (January 28, 2009). [http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2009Jan28/0,4675,OnlineEducationGlance,00.html \"5 signs your school might be a diploma mill\"]. ''foxnews.com''; [[News Corp (2013\u2013present)|News Corp]]. Retrieved 2010-07-01.</ref>  Despite the fact that [[trademark law]] is intended to prevent this situation, diploma mills continue to employ various methods to avoid [[legal recourse]]. Several diploma mills have adopted British-sounding names, similar but not identical to the names of legitimate universities, apparently to take advantage of the United Kingdom's reputation for educational quality in other parts of the world.<ref name=UKallure>Melanie Newman, [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=208627&sectioncode=26 Degree mills bank on allure of UK names], ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', 20 April 2007</ref>  Some examples of British-sounding names used by diploma mills are \"Shaftesbury University\", \"University of Dunham\", \"Redding University\", and \"Suffield University\".<ref name=UKallure/>\n\nThe school's website may well not have an [[.edu]] domain, or other country-specific equivalent, since registration of such names is typically restricted.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/show_faq.asp?code=EDUELIGIBILITY\n |title        = EduCause eligibility\n |accessdate   = 2012-11-30\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120609102127/http://net.educause.edu/edudomain/show_faq.asp?code=EDUELIGIBILITY\n |archive-date = 2012-06-09\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> However, enforcement has sometimes been less restrictive, and an .edu domain cannot be taken as verification of school quality or reputation. Some diploma mills use an [[.ac]] top-level domain name, which resembles genuine second-level academic domain names like [[ac.uk]] but is in fact the [[ccTLD]] for [[Ascension Island]]. To prevent misuse of their names in this way, some legitimate academic institutions have registered .ac domains.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Teaching===\nCompared to legitimate institutions, diploma mills tend to have drastically lowered academic requirements, if any at all. Depending on the institution, students may be required to purchase textbooks, take tests, and submit homework, but degrees are commonly conferred after little or no study.\n\nInstead of \"[[hard sciences]]\", where competence is easier to verify, the subjects offered by a diploma mill are often [[esoteric]] and may be based on a [[pseudoscience]] like [[astrology]] or [[naturopathy]]. Such subjects are only vaguely defined, making external verification of educational standards difficult.\n\nDegree mills typically offer little or no interaction with professors. Even if comments and corrections to coursework are given, they may have no bearing on the degree which is awarded. In other cases professors may serve only to write compliments to the student that can be given as references.\n\n===Facilities===\nSince diploma mills provide little in the way of teaching, there is usually no need for teaching facilities. The school tends to have no library, personnel, publications or research. In short, very little that is tangible can be found about the institution.<ref name=\"military\">{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/education/finding-a-school/fraudulent-degrees-are-big-business.html|title=Fraudulent Degrees Are Big Business|work=Military.com}}</ref><ref name=\"classbase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/News/beware-of-diploma-mill-degrees-8|title=Beware of Diploma Mill Degrees|work=classbase.com}}</ref><ref name=\"getb\">{{cite web|url=http://getbschooled.typepad.com/getbschooled/2012/04/diploma-and-accreditation-mills-what-to-watch-for.html|title=Warning Signs of Possible Diploma Mills - Get B-Schooled|work=typepad.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031085709/http://getbschooled.typepad.com/getbschooled/2012/04/diploma-and-accreditation-mills-what-to-watch-for.html|archivedate=2015-10-31}}</ref> If teaching is offered, the professors may themselves hold advanced degrees from the diploma mill itself or from other unaccredited institutions. They may also sport legitimate qualifications that are unrelated to the subject they teach.\n\nDoctoral theses and dissertations from the institution will not be available from [[University Microfilms International]], a national repository, or even the institution's own library, if it has one. The address given by a diploma mill is often a postal box, mail forwarding service or suite number.<ref name=foxnews2009/> There are legitimate distance learning institutions with limited facilities, however, but legitimate universities make their authority clear.<ref name=\"getb\" /> For academics, publications in [[Scientific journal|peer-reviewed scientific journals]] are important for establishing scientific credentials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://validatingmichael.com/Michael_Teachings/2010/07/30/diploma-mills|title=Diploma Mills|work=Validating Michael|access-date=2014-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006075030/http://validatingmichael.com/Michael_Teachings/2010/07/30/diploma-mills|archive-date=2014-10-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, in diploma mills, the research is either absent, fake or purely self-published without any external review.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/Nonrecorg/clayton.html|title=Clayton College of Natural Health: Be Wary of the School and Its Graduates|website=www.quackwatch.org}}</ref> This may be unfortunately hard to spot, since fake journals also exist. Faculty pages with bios and research may even be stolen from legitimate universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gradschool.about.com/od/distanceeducation/a/How-To-Spot-A-Diploma-Mill.htm|title=How to Spot a Diploma Mill: 12 Signs|author=Tara Kuther|work=About.com Education}}</ref>\n\n===Promotion and fees===\nBuyers often use the diplomas to claim academic credentials for use in securing employment. For example, a [[schoolteacher]] might buy a degree from a diploma mill in order to advance to [[Superintendent (education)|superintendent]]. Degrees from a diploma mill can be obtained within a few days, weeks or months from the time of enrollment, and back-dating is possible.<ref name=foxnews2009/> Academic credit may be offered for \"life experience,\" a point often featured heavily in the selling points of the institution.<ref>{{cite news |first=Christine |last=Lagorio |title=Diploma Mill Calling: Continuing Ed Without the Ed |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/education/edlife/diplomamill.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 6, 2006}}</ref> This should not be confused with legitimate programs offering [[recognition of prior learning]], which allow students to gain academic credit based on past training, experience or independent study. This will usually require a test that the student can fail; a diploma mill will grant the degree regardless of results.\n\nTuition and fees are charged on a per-degree basis rather than by term or by course.<ref name=foxnews2009/> Diploma mills are often advertised using [[e-mail spam]] or other questionable methods. Legitimate institutions use traditional advertising and high school recruitment. Prospective students are encouraged to \"enroll now\" before tuition or fees are increased. They may be told that they qualify for a fellowship, scholarship or grant, or offered deals to sign up for multiple degrees at the same time.<ref name=foxnews2009/> Promotional literature might contain grammatical and spelling errors, words in Latin, extravagant or pretentious language, and sample diplomas. The school's website may look amateurish or unprofessionally made.\n\n==Legal considerations==\nDegrees and diplomas issued by diploma mills have been used to obtain employment, raises, or clients. Even if issuing or receiving a diploma mill qualification is legal, passing it off as an accredited one for personal gain is a [[crime]] in many jurisdictions. In some cases the diploma mill may itself be guilty of an [[offense (law)|offense]], if it knew or ought to have known that the qualifications it issues are used for fraudulent purposes. Diploma mills could also be guilty of [[fraud]] if they mislead customers into believing that the qualifications they issue are accredited or recognized, or make false claims that they will lead to career advancement, and accept money on the basis of these claims.\n\nSimilar to [[tax havens]], diploma mills frequently employ [[jurisdiction shopping]], operating in another country or legal jurisdiction where running diploma mills is legal, standards are lax or prosecution is unlikely. Splitting the business across jurisdictions can be a way to avoid authorities. A school might operate in one jurisdiction but use a mailing address in a different jurisdiction, for example.<ref>Navarrete, Erika and Wilson, Jaryd (May 26, 2009).

Many of the public universities are established by provincial legislation which also confers degree granting authority upon the institution. However, private postsecondary institutions are also required to comply with applicable legislation in order to confer degrees and diplomas. For example, in Ontario the ''Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000'' regulates degree-granting authority. Any institution that wishes to offer a degree or use the term \"university\" must be authorized to do so under an Act of the Legislature or by the Minister of Training, Colleges and Universities.<ref>[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_00p36_e.htm \"Post-secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000 : S.O. 2000, CHAPTER 36 : Schedule\"].

Any institution, public or private, which wishes to name itself after a geographic region larger than a province (e.g. \"South China ... University\") must go through the Ministry of Education.

These degree-awarding institutions are known as \"recognised bodies.\" All UK universities and some higher education colleges are \"recognised bodies.\" If an institution is not a \"recognised body\" or makes degree awards not validated by such a body, it is likely to be a degree mill.

The '''early life of Shivaji''' is a topic of great interest in the popular culture of [[India]], especially in the [[Maharashtra]] state, where he spent most of his life. This article describes Shivaji's life from his birth until the age of 19 years (1630-1649).\n\nShivaji was born at the hill fort of [[Shivneri]] on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the [[Julian calendar]] used by the contemporary English traders in India. At the time of his birth, the families of his father [[Shahaji]] and his mother [[Jijabai]] both served the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]] in military and administrative capacities, although they subsequently transferred their allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] at different times.\n\nAs a servant of Bijapur, Shahaji was deputed in southern [[Deccan]] after 1636, and did not see Shivaji for several years. Shivaji and his mother remained in Pune in northern Deccan, where Shahaji's subordinate [[Dadoji Kondadeo]] administered the family's ''[[jagir]]'' (feudal land grant) in Shivaji's name. As a teenager, Shivaji started acting independently of the Bijapur government, against the advice of Shahaji and Dadoji. He captured several hill forts at the expense of other vassals of Bijapur, and by the age of 15, started calling himself a ''[[raja]]'' (king).\n\nAfter Dadoji's death in 1647, Shivaji assumed full control of his father's ''jagir'' in the Pune region, and eliminated local challenges to his authority. He then invaded the northern [[Konkan]] region, making inroads into the territory of the [[Janjira State|Siddis of Janjira]]. He subsequently tried to form an alliance with Mughals against Bijapur, and ultimately ended up fighting both these powers to establish a kingdom that evolved into the [[Maratha Empire]].\n\n== Birth ==\n[[File:Shivneri Shiv Mandir.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Shivaji's birthplace on Shivneri Fort]]\n\nMost of the earliest surviving records of Shivaji's childhood were composed around 150 years after his birth. These records, especially the Marathi-language ''[[bakhar]]s'', contain several stories that are historically unreliable.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=19-20}}\n\nShivaji was born to [[Shahaji]] and [[Jijabai]],{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} at the time of the severe Mahadurga famine in the Maharashtra region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=46}} He had an elder brother named [[Sambhaji (brother of Shivaji)|Sambhaji]], and his parents had lost several other children in infancy.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}} Shivaji was born at the hill fort of [[Shivneri]],{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} and his mother named him after Shivai, a local goddess.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nShivaji was born on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the [[Julian calendar]]. The British records in India used the Julian calendar until 1752 CE, when it was replaced by the [[Gregorian calendar]]; as a result, several historical records and books mention his birthdate as 19 February instead of 1 March.{{sfn|Mohan Apte et al.|2003|pp=21-22}} Historically, there was some debate about this date, because the ''[[Jedhe Shakawali|Jedhe chronology]]'' - records maintained by the Jedhe family, whose ancestors served as [[Deshmukh]]s of Kari - places Shivaji's birth in 1627. However, the 1630 date is corroborated by a copy of his birth horoscope found in Rajasthan,{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} and a poem composed by his courtier Parmanand.{{sfn|D. F. Karaka|1969|p=viii}}\n\n''Shiva-bharata'', a poem by Shivaji's court poet Paramananda, presents Shivaji as a divine incarnation, stating that the god [[Vishnu]] visited Jijabai in a dream, and then \"a portion\" of Vishnu entered her womb as Shivaji.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|pp=31-32}} The poem also claims that during her pregnancy, Jijabai had cravings indicative of a child with royal and martial characteristics, such as to sit on a golden throne, and to lead men to battle victories.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=33}}\n\n== Ancestry and self-identity ==\n[[File:Shivaji jijamata.JPG|thumb|right|A statue of Shivaji and Jijabai installed at [[Shivneri]] in the 1960s]]\nShivaji's father [[Shahji]] belonged to the [[Bhonsle]] clan, which traced its patrilinear ancestry to the [[Sisodia]] [[Rajput]] royal family of [[Mewar]].{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|p=35}} His mother Jijabai came from the aristocratic [[Lakhuji Jadhav|Jadhav]] family, which traced its lineage to the [[Yadavas of Devagiri]].{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nAlthough characterized as a [[Maratha (caste)|Maratha]] in modern times, Shivaji probably identified himself as a Rajput, as suggested by contemporary Rajput newsletters, and a letter of his father [[Shahaji]] which calls his family Rajput.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=88}} An English letter by the [[East India Company]] [[factor (agent)|factor]] Henry Revington, dated 10 December 1659, also calls Shivaji a \"Great Rajput\".{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|p=53}} During his coronation in 1674, Shivaji's royal priest [[Gaga Bhatta]] presented him as a member of the [[Kshatriya]] [[solar dynasty]], counting the Sisodia Rajputs among his ancestors. The claim is also supported by ''Shiva-bharata'', a text composed at Shivaji's court.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=33}}\n\nHistorian Bal Krishna, relying on some ''[[firman]]s'' in possession of the chiefs of [[Mudhol]] (who claimed a shared ancestry with Shivaji), traced the ancestry of Shivaji to the Sisodia chief Lakshmasimha, who died at the [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1303)]] against [[Alauddin Khalji]].{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|pp=37-42}} However, these documents are of doubtful authenticity, and considered spurious by other historians.{{sfn|A.

During Shivaji's childhood, the present-day Maharashtra area in Deccan saw constant warfare between the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Deccan Sultanates]], and suffered from famine.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} When his parents married, both their families served the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]]. By the time of Shivaji's birth, Jijabai's family had deserted Ahemdnagar, transferring its allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], thus becoming an opponent of Shahaji. A few years later, Shahaji also deserted Ahmednagar;{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=4}} he briefly served the Mughal Empire, but later rebelled against them, supported by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]]. Meanwhile, Jijabai's family remained loyal to the Mughals;{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} her father was later assassinated by the nobles of Ahmadnagar.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nDuring the Mughal invasion of Ahmadnagar in the 1630s, Shahaji fought against the Mughals.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=46-47}} He was pursued by a Mughal force, and therefore, Shivaji and his mother moved from fort to fort, and Shivaji rarely saw his father.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} After the fall of Ahmadnagar in 1636, the Mughals concluded a peace treaty with Bijapur. As part of this treaty, Bijapur agreed to help the Mughals subjugate Shahaji, or to depute him away from the Mughal frontier if he chose to join the Bijapuri service.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=205}} Shahaji joined the Bijapuri service: he was allowed to retain his jagir in the Pune region, but was barred from living in that area as part of the treaty. He was deputed in southern India, and his ''jagir'' in the Pune region was placed under the nominal administration of his minor son Shivaji, with his subordinate [[Dadoji Kondadeo]] as its manager.{{sfn|Sumit Guha|2011|p=57}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}}\n\n== In Pune ==\n\nAs part of the peace treaty with the Mughals, Shahaji ceded six forts, including Shivneri, to them in October 1636.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=22}} He directed Dadoji Kondadeo to bring Jijabai and Shivaji from Shivneri to Pune, and take care of their expenses.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Shivaji spent his formative years at Pune.{{sfn|Nicholas F. Gier|2014|p=16}} Meanwhile, Shahaji departed for south, and did not see Shivaji for several years. In absence of his father, Shivaji grew very close to his mother.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Neglected by her husband, Jijabai led a deeply religious - almost ascetic - life, and this religious environment had a profound influence on Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=21, 29}}\n\nShahaji's land grant in the [[Pune district|Pune]] region included the ''[[patil (title)|patil]]'' (village chief) rights to three villages, the ''[[deshmukh]]'' rights of [[Indapur]], and the ''[[jagir|mokasa]]'' (revenue collection in exchange for military service) rights of Pune region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|pp=59-60}} The ''mokasa'' land granted to Shahaji was a triangular region bounded by the [[Western Ghats]] in the west, the [[Bhima River]] in the north-east, and the [[Nira River]] in the south.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} This region had been devastated by constant warfare between Shahaji, Bijapur, and the Mughals in the 1630s.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=23-24}} Dadoji tried to increase the regional revenue yield by offering cheap land leases and rewards to kill wolves, so that more land could be brought under agricultural use.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=24}} He organized a group of local soldiers to maintan law and order.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=25}} According to the ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'', Dadoji took possession of lands controlled by twelve ''deshmukhs'' of the [[Maval|Mawal]] region, and had those who resisted killed.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'', Shivaji captured and killed Krishnaji Nayak Bandal, a ''deshmukh'' of Hirdas Maval area whom Dadoji had failed to subjugate. Historian Jadunath Sarkar believes this to be incorrect, and states that it was Dadoji who completed the subjugatation of the Maval ''deshmukhs''.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}}\n\n== Education and training ==\n\nShivaji's early training probably included what was expected of the son of a ''[[jagirdar]]'': some reading and writing, horse-riding, martial arts, and religious practice.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} According to ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'', Dadoji personally trained Shivaji, and also appointed a good teacher for him.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=25}} As a result, Shivaji became skilled in \"fighting, riding, and other accomplishments\".{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\n''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'' does not mention anything about Shivaji being taught to read and write. The ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'' (c. 1811) states that Shivaji had become \"very learned\" by the age of 10 years. ''Shiva-digivjaya'' claims that he mastered several arts and sciences as a boy.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}} Historian Jadunath Sarkar notes that several Europeans visited Shivaji's court, and their accounts do not mention any reading or writing by Shivaji. Whenever these Europeans presented any letter to Shivaji, he would pass it on to his ministers for reading. Therefore, Sarkar concludes that Shivaji was illiterate like many other rulers of medieval India, such as [[Akbar]], [[Hyder Ali]], and [[Ranjit Singh]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\nWhether or not Shivaji was literate, he listened to the recitations of the Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The political and moral lessions from these epics greatly impressed his young mind. He was deeply interested in religious teachings, and sought the society of Hindu and Muslim saints wherever he went.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\n== Alienation from father ==\n\nEven when Shahaji was in northern Deccan, Shivaji and his mother Jijabai rarely saw him, because of Shahaji's military preoccupations.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} After Shahaji was deputed in the south, the father and son did not see each other for several years.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Shahaji became Bijapur's governor of [[Bangalore]] in the south, and married another woman - Tukabai.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=4}} Shivaji's elder brother Sambhaji moved to Bangalore,{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}} but Shivaji and Jijabai were called to Bangalore only in 1640. Meanwhile, Shivaji married [[Sai Bhosale|Saibai]], a member of the prominent Nimbalkar Maratha family. In 1642, Shivaji and his mother returned to Pune, after a formal presentation at the Bijapur court.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}}\n\nAccording to a doubtful narrative in ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'', Shahaji had developed a deep dislike for Jijabai's father Lakhuji Jadhav. After the death of his eldest son Sambhaji (or Shambhuji) at Kanakagiri in 1654, he declared that Shivaji - his surviving son from Lakhuji's daughter - would be no good. He then deserted Jijabai and Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=20}} Whatever the accuracy of this account, it is known from other texts that Shahji's wealth and affection were directed to [[Vyankoji]] alias Ekoji, his son from his younger wife Tukabai.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}}\n\n== Early conquests ==\n\nShivaji's earliest comrades and followers, called the Mavales, came from the [[Maval]] region around his Pune ''jagir''.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}} As a teenager, Shivaji explored the hilly area surrounding his ''jagir'' and became familiar with the [[Western Ghats]] region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} [[Mohammed Adil Shah, Sultan of Bijapur|Muhammad Adil Shah]], the king of Bijapur, remained ill during the last decade of his life (1646-1656). During this time, the administration was largely handled by his queen, titled ''Bari Sahiba''. Taking advantage of the instability, Shivaji captured several forts in the Bijapur territory.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\nBy the time he was 15 years old, Shivaji called himself a \"king\" (''raja''). By this time, he commanded over a thousand soldiers,  In a letter to a Hindu official, dated 17 April 1645, he wrote that the God wished them to be independent under a self-ruled state.{{sfn|Nicholas F. Gier|2014|p=16}}\n\nEven before Dadoji's death, during 1645-1647, Shivaji captured several hill forts around Pune, including Rajgarh, Kondana (later [[Sinhagad]]) and Torna.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=318}}\n\nIn 1646, he sent an infantry led by Baji Pasalkar, Yesaji Kank, and Tanaji Malusare to take control of the [[Torna Fort]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}} According to different historical texts, Shivaji's army captured the fort after tricking or bribing the local Bijapuri commander.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} Shivaji seized the local government treasury worth 200,000 ''hon'' ([[Vijayanagara coinage|gold coins]]), and renamed the fort Prachandagarh, although this name did not stick for long.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}} He built the [[Rajgad Fort]] near Torna, with three walled [[redoubt]]s.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n\nThe local ''jagirdars'' whom Shivaji had dispossessed complained to the Bijapur court against him. According to Khafi Khan's ''[[Muntakhab-al Lubab]]'', Shivaji bribed some court ministers to get these complaints dismissed. According to the ''Chitnis Bakhar'', Shahaji assured the king of Shivaji's loyalty, and justified Shivaji's control of Torna fort by arguing that the earlier administrator of the fort was negligient. Meanwhile, in secretly reprimanded Shivaji in a letter, and ordered Dadoji to keep him under control.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=33}}\n\n== After Dadoji's death ==\n\nDadoji advised Shivaji to rise in rank and wealth an obedient vassal of the Deccan Sultanates, but Shivaji wanted to act independently. Dadoji was greatly concerned about Shivaji's associations with hill brigands and his plans to rob forts. Dadoji complained to Shahaji, but did not succeed in changing Shivaji's behavior.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}} The ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'' states that Dadoji committed suicide by poison, because he was disgusted with Shivaji's waywardness.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n\nShivaji probably participated in Dadoji Kondadeo's administration of Shahji's Pune ''[[jagir]]''.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} During his last years, Dadoji had started issuing administrative orders in Shivaji's name.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}} When Dadoji died in 1647, Shivaji assumed the full control of his father's ''jagir''.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=318}}\n\nHis officers included:\n\n* Appointed by Shahaji around 1639:\n** Shyamraj Nilkanth Ranjhekar (or Rozekar), ''peshwa'' (Chancellor){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n** Balkrishna Dikshit, ''majumdar'' (Accountant-General){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n** Somaji Pant, ''dabir'' (Secretary){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n** Raghunath Ballal Korde, ''sabnis'' (Paymaster){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n* Appointed by Shivaji\n** Tukoji Chor Maratha, ''sar-i-naubat'' (Commander-in-Chief){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n** Narayan Pant, divisional paymaster{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n\n=== Consolidation of power in Pune region ===\n\nAfter Dadoji's death, Shivaji started consolidating his control over Shahaji's ''jagir'' around the Pune region. Dadoji had assigned the administration of the Supe ''mahal'' (subdivision) to Shambhuji (or Sambhaji) Mohite, the brother of Shahaji's second wife Tukabai. After Dadoji's death, Shambhuji refused to take orders from Shivaji, declaring that he would report directly to Shahaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=33}} According to the ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'', Shivaji visited Shambhuji during the [[Holi|Shimga]] festival on the pretext of asking for a post, and imprisoned him. Shivaji confiscated all his property, including 300 horses, personal belongings including clothes, and other wealth.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} When Sambhaji still refused recognize Shivaji's authority, Shivaji forcibly annexed Supe and sent Shambhuji to Shahaji with his personal property.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=33-34}}\n\nShortly after the annexation of Supe, Shivaji raided [[Junnar]], where he captured 300 horses, goods worth 300 ''hons'' ([[Vijayanagara coinage|gold coins]]), clothes, and jewels.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\n[[Firangoji Narsala]], who had been appointed as the administrator of the [[Chakan Fort]], accepted Shivaji's authority.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}} The commanders of [[Baramati]] and [[Indapur]] also recognized his authority.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\nThe ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'' states that Shivaji took control of the [[Kondana]] Fort by bribing its Bijapuri governor.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}}\n\nThe Purandar Fort of Bijapur Sultante was administered by Nilo Nilkanth Nayak, a Brahmin whose family had controlled the fort and its surrounding area for several years. His younger brothers Pilaji and Shankaraji resented being excluded from their hereditary rights to the fort, and requested Shivaji to arbitrate. Shivaji entered the fort as a guest during the [[Diwali]] celebrations, and three days later, the younger brothers imprisoned Nilo and brought him before Shivaji. Shivaji imprisoned all three brothers, and took control of the fort himself.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}} According to the ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'' and ''[[Shiva Digvijaya]]'', he later granted estates at other places to the younger brothers as compensation.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=34-35}} He expelled Nilo Nayak's subordinates from the fort, and replaced them with his own men.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}}\n\nSubsequently, Shivaji also acquired control of several other forts around Pune, including [[Rohida fort|Rohira]], [[Tikona]], [[Rajmachi]], and [[Lohagad]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=35}}\n\n=== Invasion of Konkan ===\n\nAfter consolidating his control over Pune, Shivaji crossed the [[Western Ghats]], and entered the [[Konkan]] region on the western coast of India. The [[Kalyan]] ''jagir'' in this region was under the control of by Mulla Ahmad, a [[Nawaiyat]] Muslim of [[Arabs|Arab]] origin. The region had been recently acquired by the Bijapur Sultanate after the decline of the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]], and Mulla Ahmad - who was considered a foreigner by the locals - remained away at [[Bijapur]]. Because of this, the administration of the ''jagir'' had become inefficient.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=35}} Shivaji sent a cavalry led by Abaji Sondev to conquer the Kalyan ''jagir''. The cavalry plundered much wealth and merchandise from the non-fortified towns of Kalyan and [[Bhiwandi]], and captured the [[Mahuli]] fort which was once under the control of Shahaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}}\n\nOver the next year (1648), Shivaji consolidated his control in northern Konkan, establishing authority over local chiefs and capturing territories from the [[Siddi]]s of [[Janjira State|Janjira]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}} The Siddis had become practically independent after the fall of their former overlords - the kings of [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], although they recognized the nominal suzerainty of Bijapur.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=293-294}} From Kalyan, Shivaji moved southwards towards [[Kolaba Fort|Kolaba]]: several local Hindu chiefs invited him to their territories. He captured [[Surgad]], [[Birwadi]], [[Tala, Raigad|Tala]], [[Ghosale gad|Ghosalegad]], [[Sudhagad]], [[Kangori]], and [[Raigad Fort|Rairi]] (Raigad, his future capital). He built new forts at [[Birwadi fort|Birwadi]] and [[Lingana]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}} Shivaji appointed Abaji Sondev as the viceroy of this newly-conquered territory in northern Konkan.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=37}}\n\nSometime in 1648, the Siddis inflicted a crushing defeat on Shivaji's forces led by the ''[[Peshwa]]'' Shyamraj Nilkanth Ranjhekar. According to the ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'', a displeased Shivaji removed Ranjhekar from his post, and appointed [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle]] as the new Peshwa. He also sent a large army led by Raghunath Ballal Korde against the Siddis.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=37}}\n\nIn late 1648, the Bijapuri government imprisoned Shivaji's father Shahaji.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=37-39}} According to Zahur's ''Muhammad-namah'' (the official court history of Bijapur) and ''Basatin-i-Salatin'' (a later history), Shahaji was arrested for insubordination during the siege of [[Gingee Fort|Jinji]] against the [[Golconda Sultanate]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=38-39}} However, ''Chitnis Bakhar'', a Maratha chronicle written over 150 years after the event, states that Shahaji was arrested because the Bijapuri court suspected him to be involved in the rebellious activities of his son Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=37-38}}\n\nWhile his father was imprisoned at Bijapur, Bijapuri government sent an army to recapture Purandar from Shivaji, but this force was unable to dislodge Shivaji from the fort.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=62}} Meanwhile, Shivaji unsuccessfully attempted to forge an alliance with the Mughals against Bijapur.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=39-40}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lal Mahal]], the residential palace where Shivaji stayed during his early life\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n{{ref begin}}\n* {{cite book |author=A.

The '''early life of Shivaji''' is a topic of great interest in the popular culture of [[India]], especially in the [[Maharashtra]] state, where he spent most of his life. This article describes Shivaji's life from his birth until the age of 19 years (1630-1649).\n\nShivaji was born at the hill fort of [[Shivneri]] on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the [[Julian calendar]] used by the contemporary English traders in India. At the time of his birth, the families of his father [[Shahaji]] and his mother [[Jijabai]] both served the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]] in military and administrative capacities, although they subsequently transferred their allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] at different times.\n\nAs a servant of Bijapur, Shahaji was deputed in southern [[Deccan]] after 1636, and did not see Shivaji for several years. Shivaji and his mother remained in Pune in northern Deccan, where Shahaji's subordinate [[Dadoji Kondadeo]] administered the family's ''[[jagir]]'' (feudal land grant) in Shivaji's name. As a teenager, Shivaji started acting independently of the Bijapur government, against the advice of Shahaji and Dadoji. He captured several hill forts at the expense of other vassals of Bijapur, and by the age of 15, started calling himself a ''[[raja]]'' (king).\n\nAfter Dadoji's death in 1647, Shivaji assumed full control of his father's ''jagir'' in the Pune region, and eliminated local challenges to his authority. He then invaded the northern [[Konkan]] region, making inroads into the territory of the [[Janjira State|Siddis of Janjira]]. He subsequently tried to form an alliance with Mughals against Bijapur, and ultimately ended up fighting both these powers to establish a kingdom that evolved into the [[Maratha Empire]].\n\n== Birth ==\n[[File:Shivneri Shiv Mandir.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Shivaji's birthplace on Shivneri Fort]]\n\nMost of the earliest surviving records of Shivaji's childhood were composed around 150 years after his birth. These records, especially the Marathi-language ''[[bakhar]]s'', contain several stories that are historically unreliable.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=19-20}}\n\nShivaji was born to [[Shahaji]] and [[Jijabai]],{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} at the time of the severe Mahadurga famine in the Maharashtra region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=46}} He had an elder brother named [[Sambhaji (brother of Shivaji)|Sambhaji]], and his parents had lost several other children in infancy.{{sfn|James W.

Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nShivaji was born on 1 March 1630, which corresponds to 19 February 1630 of the [[Julian calendar]]. The British records in India used the Julian calendar until 1752 CE, when it was replaced by the [[Gregorian calendar]]; as a result, several historical records and books mention his birthdate as 19 February instead of 1 March.{{sfn|Mohan Apte et al.|2003|pp=21-22}} Historically, there was some debate about this date, because the ''[[Jedhe Shakawali|Jedhe chronology]]'' - records maintained by the Jedhe family, whose ancestors served as [[Deshmukh]]s of Kari - places Shivaji's birth in 1627. However, the 1630 date is corroborated by a copy of his birth horoscope found in Rajasthan,{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} and a poem composed by his courtier Parmanand.{{sfn|D. F. Karaka|1969|p=viii}}\n\n''Shiva-bharata'', a poem by Shivaji's court poet Paramananda, presents Shivaji as a divine incarnation, stating that the god [[Vishnu]] visited Jijabai in a dream, and then \"a portion\" of Vishnu entered her womb as Shivaji.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|pp=31-32}} The poem also claims that during her pregnancy, Jijabai had cravings indicative of a child with royal and martial characteristics, such as to sit on a golden throne, and to lead men to battle victories.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=33}}\n\n== Ancestry and self-identity ==\n[[File:Shivaji jijamata.JPG|thumb|right|A statue of Shivaji and Jijabai installed at [[Shivneri]] in the 1960s]]\nShivaji's father [[Shahji]] belonged to the [[Bhonsle]] clan, which traced its patrilinear ancestry to the [[Sisodia]] [[Rajput]] royal family of [[Mewar]].{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|p=35}} His mother Jijabai came from the aristocratic [[Lakhuji Jadhav|Jadhav]] family, which traced its lineage to the [[Yadavas of Devagiri]].{{sfn|James W.

The claim is also supported by ''Shiva-bharata'', a text composed at Shivaji's court.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=33}}\n\nHistorian Bal Krishna, relying on some ''[[firman]]s'' in possession of the chiefs of [[Mudhol]] (who claimed a shared ancestry with Shivaji), traced the ancestry of Shivaji to the Sisodia chief Lakshmasimha, who died at the [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1303)]] against [[Alauddin Khalji]].{{sfn|Bal Krishna II|1932|pp=37-42}} However, these documents are of doubtful authenticity, and considered spurious by other historians.{{sfn|A. G. Pawar|1976|p=160}}{{sfn|Krishna Swaroop Gupta|1971|p=18}}\n\n== Before Pune ==\n\nShivaji's father Shahaji was a military leader in the [[Deccan]] region. During Shivaji's childhood, the present-day Maharashtra area in Deccan saw constant warfare between the [[Mughal Empire]] and the [[Deccan Sultanates]], and suffered from famine.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} When his parents married, both their families served the [[Ahmednagar Sultanate]]. By the time of Shivaji's birth, Jijabai's family had deserted Ahemdnagar, transferring its allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], thus becoming an opponent of Shahaji. A few years later, Shahaji also deserted Ahmednagar;{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=4}} he briefly served the Mughal Empire, but later rebelled against them, supported by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]]. Meanwhile, Jijabai's family remained loyal to the Mughals;{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} her father was later assassinated by the nobles of Ahmadnagar.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}}\n\nDuring the Mughal invasion of Ahmadnagar in the 1630s, Shahaji fought against the Mughals.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=46-47}} He was pursued by a Mughal force, and therefore, Shivaji and his mother moved from fort to fort, and Shivaji rarely saw his father.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} After the fall of Ahmadnagar in 1636, the Mughals concluded a peace treaty with Bijapur. As part of this treaty, Bijapur agreed to help the Mughals subjugate Shahaji, or to depute him away from the Mughal frontier if he chose to join the Bijapuri service.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=205}} Shahaji joined the Bijapuri service: he was allowed to retain his jagir in the Pune region, but was barred from living in that area as part of the treaty. He was deputed in southern India, and his ''jagir'' in the Pune region was placed under the nominal administration of his minor son Shivaji, with his subordinate [[Dadoji Kondadeo]] as its manager.{{sfn|Sumit Guha|2011|p=57}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}}\n\n== In Pune ==\n\nAs part of the peace treaty with the Mughals, Shahaji ceded six forts, including Shivneri, to them in October 1636.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=22}} He directed Dadoji Kondadeo to bring Jijabai and Shivaji from Shivneri to Pune, and take care of their expenses.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Shivaji spent his formative years at Pune.{{sfn|Nicholas F. Gier|2014|p=16}} Meanwhile, Shahaji departed for south, and did not see Shivaji for several years. In absence of his father, Shivaji grew very close to his mother.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Neglected by her husband, Jijabai led a deeply religious - almost ascetic - life, and this religious environment had a profound influence on Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=21, 29}}\n\nShahaji's land grant in the [[Pune district|Pune]] region included the ''[[patil (title)|patil]]'' (village chief) rights to three villages, the ''[[deshmukh]]'' rights of [[Indapur]], and the ''[[jagir|mokasa]]'' (revenue collection in exchange for military service) rights of Pune region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|pp=59-60}} The ''mokasa'' land granted to Shahaji was a triangular region bounded by the [[Western Ghats]] in the west, the [[Bhima River]] in the north-east, and the [[Nira River]] in the south.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} This region had been devastated by constant warfare between Shahaji, Bijapur, and the Mughals in the 1630s.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=23-24}} Dadoji tried to increase the regional revenue yield by offering cheap land leases and rewards to kill wolves, so that more land could be brought under agricultural use.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=24}} He organized a group of local soldiers to maintan law and order.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=25}} According to the ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'', Dadoji took possession of lands controlled by twelve ''deshmukhs'' of the [[Maval|Mawal]] region, and had those who resisted killed.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}}\n\nAccording to ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'', Shivaji captured and killed Krishnaji Nayak Bandal, a ''deshmukh'' of Hirdas Maval area whom Dadoji had failed to subjugate. Historian Jadunath Sarkar believes this to be incorrect, and states that it was Dadoji who completed the subjugatation of the Maval ''deshmukhs''.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}}\n\n== Education and training ==\n\nShivaji's early training probably included what was expected of the son of a ''[[jagirdar]]'': some reading and writing, horse-riding, martial arts, and religious practice.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} According to ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'', Dadoji personally trained Shivaji, and also appointed a good teacher for him.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=25}} As a result, Shivaji became skilled in \"fighting, riding, and other accomplishments\".{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\n''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'' does not mention anything about Shivaji being taught to read and write. The ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'' (c. 1811) states that Shivaji had become \"very learned\" by the age of 10 years. ''Shiva-digivjaya'' claims that he mastered several arts and sciences as a boy.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}} Historian Jadunath Sarkar notes that several Europeans visited Shivaji's court, and their accounts do not mention any reading or writing by Shivaji. Whenever these Europeans presented any letter to Shivaji, he would pass it on to his ministers for reading. Therefore, Sarkar concludes that Shivaji was illiterate like many other rulers of medieval India, such as [[Akbar]], [[Hyder Ali]], and [[Ranjit Singh]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\nWhether or not Shivaji was literate, he listened to the recitations of the Hindu epics [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. The political and moral lessions from these epics greatly impressed his young mind. He was deeply interested in religious teachings, and sought the society of Hindu and Muslim saints wherever he went.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=26}}\n\n== Alienation from father ==\n\nEven when Shahaji was in northern Deccan, Shivaji and his mother Jijabai rarely saw him, because of Shahaji's military preoccupations.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=59}} After Shahaji was deputed in the south, the father and son did not see each other for several years.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}} Shahaji became Bijapur's governor of [[Bangalore]] in the south, and married another woman - Tukabai.{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=4}} Shivaji's elder brother Sambhaji moved to Bangalore,{{sfn|James W. Laine|2003|p=5}} but Shivaji and Jijabai were called to Bangalore only in 1640. Meanwhile, Shivaji married [[Sai Bhosale|Saibai]], a member of the prominent Nimbalkar Maratha family. In 1642, Shivaji and his mother returned to Pune, after a formal presentation at the Bijapur court.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}}\n\nAccording to a doubtful narrative in ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'', Shahaji had developed a deep dislike for Jijabai's father Lakhuji Jadhav. After the death of his eldest son Sambhaji (or Shambhuji) at Kanakagiri in 1654, he declared that Shivaji - his surviving son from Lakhuji's daughter - would be no good. He then deserted Jijabai and Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=20}} Whatever the accuracy of this account, it is known from other texts that Shahji's wealth and affection were directed to [[Vyankoji]] alias Ekoji, his son from his younger wife Tukabai.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=21}}\n\n== Early conquests ==\n\nShivaji's earliest comrades and followers, called the Mavales, came from the [[Maval]] region around his Pune ''jagir''.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}} As a teenager, Shivaji explored the hilly area surrounding his ''jagir'' and became familiar with the [[Western Ghats]] region.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} [[Mohammed Adil Shah, Sultan of Bijapur|Muhammad Adil Shah]], the king of Bijapur, remained ill during the last decade of his life (1646-1656). During this time, the administration was largely handled by his queen, titled ''Bari Sahiba''. Taking advantage of the instability, Shivaji captured several forts in the Bijapur territory.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\nBy the time he was 15 years old, Shivaji called himself a \"king\" (''raja''). By this time, he commanded over a thousand soldiers,  In a letter to a Hindu official, dated 17 April 1645, he wrote that the God wished them to be independent under a self-ruled state.{{sfn|Nicholas F. Gier|2014|p=16}}\n\nEven before Dadoji's death, during 1645-1647, Shivaji captured several hill forts around Pune, including Rajgarh, Kondana (later [[Sinhagad]]) and Torna.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=318}}\n\nIn 1646, he sent an infantry led by Baji Pasalkar, Yesaji Kank, and Tanaji Malusare to take control of the [[Torna Fort]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}} According to different historical texts, Shivaji's army captured the fort after tricking or bribing the local Bijapuri commander.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} Shivaji seized the local government treasury worth 200,000 ''hon'' ([[Vijayanagara coinage|gold coins]]), and renamed the fort Prachandagarh, although this name did not stick for long.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}} He built the [[Rajgad Fort]] near Torna, with three walled [[redoubt]]s.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n\nThe local ''jagirdars'' whom Shivaji had dispossessed complained to the Bijapur court against him. According to Khafi Khan's ''[[Muntakhab-al Lubab]]'', Shivaji bribed some court ministers to get these complaints dismissed. According to the ''Chitnis Bakhar'', Shahaji assured the king of Shivaji's loyalty, and justified Shivaji's control of Torna fort by arguing that the earlier administrator of the fort was negligient. Meanwhile, in secretly reprimanded Shivaji in a letter, and ordered Dadoji to keep him under control.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=33}}\n\n== After Dadoji ==\n\nDadoji advised Shivaji to rise in rank and wealth an obedient vassal of the Deccan Sultanates, but Shivaji wanted to act independently. Dadoji was greatly concerned about Shivaji's associations with hill brigands and his plans to rob forts. Dadoji complained to Shahaji, but did not succeed in changing Shivaji's behavior.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=28}} The ''Tarikh-i-Shivaji'' states that Dadoji committed suicide by poison, because he was disgusted with Shivaji's waywardness.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n\nShivaji probably participated in Dadoji Kondadeo's administration of Shahji's Pune ''[[jagir]]''.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=60}} During his last years, Dadoji had started issuing administrative orders in Shivaji's name.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}} When Dadoji died in 1647, Shivaji assumed the full control of his father's ''jagir''.{{sfn|Satish Chandra|2005|p=318}}\n\nHis officers included:\n\n* Appointed by Shahaji around 1639:\n** Shyamraj Nilkanth Ranjhekar (or Rozekar), ''peshwa'' (Chancellor){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n** Balkrishna Dikshit, ''majumdar'' (Accountant-General){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=31}}\n** Somaji Pant, ''dabir'' (Secretary){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n** Raghunath Ballal Korde, ''sabnis'' (Paymaster){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n* Appointed by Shivaji\n** Tukoji Chor Maratha, ''sar-i-naubat'' (Commander-in-Chief){{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n** Narayan Pant, divisional paymaster{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=32}}\n\n=== Consolidation of control around Pune ===\n\nAfter Dadoji's death, Shivaji started consolidating his control over Shahaji's ''jagir'' around the Pune region. Dadoji had assigned the administration of the Supe ''mahal'' (subdivision) to Shambhuji (or Sambhaji) Mohite, the brother of Shahaji's second wife Tukabai. After Dadoji's death, Shambhuji refused to take orders from Shivaji, declaring that he would report directly to Shahaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=33}} According to the ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'', Shivaji visited Shambhuji during the [[Holi|Shimga]] festival on the pretext of asking for a post, and imprisoned him. Shivaji confiscated all his property, including 300 horses, personal belongings including clothes, and other wealth.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}} When Sambhaji still refused recognize Shivaji's authority, Shivaji forcibly annexed Supe and sent Shambhuji to Shahaji with his personal property.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=33-34}}\n\nShortly after the annexation of Supe, Shivaji raided [[Junnar]], where he captured 300 horses, goods worth 300 ''hons'' ([[Vijayanagara coinage|gold coins]]), clothes, and jewels.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\n[[Firangoji Narsala]], who had been appointed as the administrator of the [[Chakan Fort]], accepted Shivaji's authority.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}} The commanders of [[Baramati]] and [[Indapur]] also recognized his authority.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\nThe ''[[Sabhasad Bakhar]]'' states that Shivaji took control of the [[Kondana]] Fort by bribing its Bijapuri governor.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}}\n\nThe Purandar Fort of Bijapur Sultante was administered by Nilo Nilkanth Nayak, a Brahmin whose family had controlled the fort and its surrounding area for several years. His younger brothers Pilaji and Shankaraji resented being excluded from their hereditary rights to the fort, and requested Shivaji to arbitrate. Shivaji entered the fort as a guest during the [[Diwali]] celebrations, and three days later, the younger brothers imprisoned Nilo and brought him before Shivaji. Shivaji imprisoned all three brothers, and took control of the fort himself.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}} According to the ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'' and ''[[Shiva Digvijaya]]'', he later granted estates at other places to the younger brothers as compensation.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=34-35}} He expelled Nilo Nayak's subordinates from the fort, and replaced them with his own men.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=34}}\n\nSubsequently, Shivaji also acquired control of several other forts around Pune, including [[Rohida fort|Rohira]], [[Tikona]], [[Rajmachi]], and [[Lohagad]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=35}}\n\n=== In Konkan ===\n\nAfter consolidating his control over Pune, Shivaji crossed the [[Western Ghats]], and entered the [[Konkan]] region on the western coast of India. The [[Kalyan]] ''jagir'' in this region was under the control of by Mulla Ahmad, a [[Nawaiyat]] Muslim of [[Arabs|Arab]] origin. The region had been recently acquired by the Bijapur Sultanate after the decline of the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]], and Mulla Ahmad - who was considered a foreigner by the locals - remained away at [[Bijapur]]. Because of this, the administration of the ''jagir'' had become inefficient.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=35}} Shivaji sent a cavalry led by Abaji Sondev to conquer the Kalyan ''jagir''. The cavalry plundered much wealth and merchandise from the non-fortified towns of Kalyan and [[Bhiwandi]], and captured the [[Mahuli]] fort which was once under the control of Shahaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}}\n\nOver the next year (1648), Shivaji consolidated his control in northern Konkan, establishing authority over local chiefs and capturing territories from the [[Siddi]]s of [[Janjira State|Janjira]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}} The Siddis had become practically independent after the fall of their former overlords - the kings of [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], although they recognized the nominal suzerainty of Bijapur.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=293-294}} From Kalyan, Shivaji moved southwards towards [[Kolaba Fort|Kolaba]]: several local Hindu chiefs invited him to their territories. He captured [[Surgad]], [[Birwadi]], [[Tala, Raigad|Tala]], [[Ghosale gad|Ghosalegad]], [[Sudhagad]], [[Kangori]], and [[Raigad Fort|Rairi]] (Raigad, his future capital). He built new forts at [[Birwadi fort|Birwadi]] and [[Lingana]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=36}} Shivaji appointed Abaji Sondev as the viceroy of this newly-conquered territory in northern Konkan.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=37}}\n\nSometime in 1648, the Siddis inflicted a crushing defeat on Shivaji's forces led by the ''[[Peshwa]]'' Shyamraj Nilkanth Ranjhekar. According to the ''[[Chitnis Bakhar]]'', a displeased Shivaji removed Ranjhekar from his post, and appointed [[Moropant Trimbak Pingle]] as the new Peshwa. He also sent a large army led by Raghunath Ballal Korde against the Siddis.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|p=37}}\n\nIn late 1648, the Bijapuri government imprisoned Shivaji's father Shahaji.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=37-39}} According to Zahur's ''Muhammad-namah'' (the official court history of Bijapur) and ''Basatin-i-Salatin'' (a later history), Shahaji was arrested for insubordination during the siege of [[Gingee Fort|Jinji]] against the [[Golconda Sultanate]].{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=38-39}} However, ''Chitnis Bakhar'', a Maratha chronicle written over 150 years after the event, states that Shahaji was arrested because the Bijapuri court suspected him to be involved in the rebellious activities of his son Shivaji.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=37-38}}\n\nWhile his father was imprisoned at Bijapur, Bijapuri government sent an army to recapture Purandar from Shivaji, but this force was unable to dislodge Shivaji from the fort.{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=62}} Meanwhile, Shivaji unsuccessfully attempted to forge an alliance with the Mughals against Bijapur.{{sfn|Jadunath Sarkar|1920|pp=39-40}}{{sfn|Stewart Gordon|1993|p=61}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lal Mahal]], the residential palace where Shivaji stayed during his early life\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n{{ref begin}}\n* {{cite book |author=A.
