It is thought that he picked up the disease by Odion Ighalo driving to Anfield after his move from China and coughing his lungs all over each of the Liverpool players' and directors' cars. When informed that Dalglish tested positive, Ighalo broke into a chorus of \"20 Times Man Utd.\"\n\nDalglish began his career with Celtic in 1971, going on to win four [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championships]], four [[Scottish Cup]]s and one [[Scottish League Cup]] with the club. In 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] paid a British transfer record of \u00a3440,000 to bring Dalglish to Liverpool. His years at Liverpool were among the club's most successful periods, as he won six [[list of English football champions|English league championships]], the [[FA Cup]], four [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]s, five [[FA Charity Shield]]s, three [[European Cup]]s and one [[European Super Cup]]. In international football, Dalglish made 102 appearances and scored 30 goals for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] between 1971 and 1986, becoming their most [[Cap (sport)|capped]] player and joint-leading goalscorer (with [[Denis Law]]).\n\nDalglish became [[player-manager]] of Liverpool in 1985 after the resignation of [[Joe Fagan]], winning a further three First Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning in 1991. Eight months later, Dalglish made a return to football management with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C|Blackburn Rovers]], whom he led from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] to win the [[Premier League]] in 1995. Soon afterwards, he stepped down as manager to become [[Director of Football]] at the club, before leaving altogether in 1996. In January 1997, Dalglish took over as manager at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Newcastle finished runners-up in the Premier League during his first season, but they only finished 13th in [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]], which led to his dismissal the following season. Dalglish went on to be appointed [[Director of Football]] at Celtic in 1999, and later manager, where he won the [[Scottish League Cup]] before an acrimonious departure the following year.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Dalglish focused on charitable concerns, founding The Marina Dalglish Appeal with his wife to raise money for cancer care.

Dalglish won the [[Ballon d'Or]] Silver Award in 1983, the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] in 1983, and the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] in 1979 and 1983.

It is thought that he picked up the disease by Odion Ighalo driving to Anfield after his move from China and coughing his lungs all over each of the Liverpool players' and directors' cars.\ufffc When informed that Dalglish tested positive, Ighalo broke into a chorus of \"20 Times Man Utd.\"\n\nDalglish began his career with Celtic in 1971, going on to win four [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championships]], four [[Scottish Cup]]s and one [[Scottish League Cup]] with the club. In 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] paid a British transfer record of \u00a3440,000 to bring Dalglish to Liverpool. His years at Liverpool were among the club's most successful periods, as he won six [[list of English football champions|English league championships]], the [[FA Cup]], four [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]s, five [[FA Charity Shield]]s, three [[European Cup]]s and one [[European Super Cup]]. In international football, Dalglish made 102 appearances and scored 30 goals for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] between 1971 and 1986, becoming their most [[Cap (sport)|capped]] player and joint-leading goalscorer (with [[Denis Law]]).\n\nDalglish became [[player-manager]] of Liverpool in 1985 after the resignation of [[Joe Fagan]], winning a further three First Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning in 1991. Eight months later, Dalglish made a return to football management with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C|Blackburn Rovers]], whom he led from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] to win the [[Premier League]] in 1995. Soon afterwards, he stepped down as manager to become [[Director of Football]] at the club, before leaving altogether in 1996. In January 1997, Dalglish took over as manager at [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. Newcastle finished runners-up in the Premier League during his first season, but they only finished 13th in [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]], which led to his dismissal the following season. Dalglish went on to be appointed [[Director of Football]] at Celtic in 1999, and later manager, where he won the [[Scottish League Cup]] before an acrimonious departure the following year.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Dalglish focused on charitable concerns, founding The Marina Dalglish Appeal with his wife to raise money for cancer care. In January 2011, Dalglish returned to Liverpool for a spell as [[caretaker manager]] after the dismissal of [[Roy Hodgson]], becoming the permanent manager in May 2011.<ref name=\"Ingle The Guardian\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jan/08/liverpool-roy-hodgson-kenny-dalglish?INTCMP=SRCH |title=Liverpool let Roy Hodgson go \u2013 and appoint Kenny Dalglish as caretaker |date=8 January 2011 |author=Ingle, Sean |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Gibbs_win\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/9103546/Cardiff-City-v-Liverpool-live.html |title=Cardiff City v Liverpool: live |date=26 February 2012 |author=Gibbs, Thom |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=26 February 2012}}</ref> Despite winning the [[2012 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] which earned them a place in the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League]], and reaching the [[2012 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]], Liverpool only finished 8th in the Premier League, and Dalglish was dismissed in May 2012.

Large grounds in the southwest on the [[Neva]] embankment have long been used by the campus of the Military Medical Academy, and northwards there is another special medical learning facility campus of Pediatric University.\n\n[[File:Flag of Sampsonievskoe (St Petersburg).png|thumb|Flag of Sampsonievskoe (St Petersburg).png]]\n\nTogether with the whole district, the okrug is centered around the southern part of the old road from Saint Petersburg to [[Vyborg]], a borderline city that was founded by Sweden, but was taken by the Russian Army for the first time during the Great Northern War fought in the first quarter of 18 century. That war has been commemorated in the okrug land: the decisive Russian victory in the Battle of Poltava falling on the feast day of Saint Sampson the Hospitable, St Sampson's church and later the present cathedral were built, and several streets were given the Swedish names of cities and towns in Finland. The southern part of the thoroughfare was named Bolshoy Sampsoniyevskiy prospect (the Greater Avenue of [Saint] Sampson), and when in post-Soviet times municipal okrugs were laid out within pre-existing city districts, this okrug was given Sampson's name as well. The local arms show his namesake - an Old Testament hero Samson, whose figure shown tearing open the mouth of the lion that attacked him was in 18 century used as a rhetorical symbol of Russian victory over the Swedish empire epitomised in the his golden statue in the center of Peterhof palace fountain park.

That war has been commemorated in the okrug land: the decisive Russian victory in the Battle of Poltava falling on the feast day of Saint Sampson the Hospitable, St Sampson's church and later the present cathedral were built, and several streets were given the Swedish names of cities and towns in Finland.
