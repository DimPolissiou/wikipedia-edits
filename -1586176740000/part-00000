His father [[Boris Parygin]] was a [[Social psychology|social psychologist]]. Alexey studied at the Graphics Faculty of the [[Herzen University]] from 1982\u20131989. He organized the art group \u201cUnion \u2116 0\u201d in Leningrad in 1986-1989 and created the art squatters\u2019 studio \u201cNevsky 25\u201d in Leningrad in 1987\u20131990. Joined the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Professional Artists\u2019 Union of Russia]] in 1994, the Art Critics Association (ACA) member since 2003.\n[[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Art History with the thesis \u201c[[Screen printing|Silk Screening]] as a phenomenon of the 20th Century art\u201d (2002).\n\n===The nature of creativity===\nIn 1980-1990 Parygin concentrated on easel [[oil painting]] outside and using  models at the studio, experimented with various paint foundations such as canvas, plywood, glass and other media and used texture and relief techniques. \nFrom [[Aleksandr Kamensky]]\u2019s article:\n{{quote|\n\u201cThe works create new poetry, which involuntarily rivals with habitual esthetic stereotypes. For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

Moreover, the artist prefers options on a particular plastic theme, as he himself puts it. He uses various in techniques, and revisits it in different periods of creativity.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.

For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

Moreover, the artist prefers options on a particular plastic theme, as he himself puts it. He uses various in techniques, and revisits it in different periods of creativity.

An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.

One day they decide to travel the world together with their two horses and two dogs but at some point they separate from each other.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=411\u2013439}}\n\n==Story==\n===Twins' birth===\nThere was a king who had lost his kingdom. Of all his wealth, he retained only two gold rings each adorned with a gem, a mare, a brave female dog, and a vegetable garden, where he lived with his wife. He used to spend the days hoeing the earth, his wife spinning linen and wool. They were happy in the quiet of the fields and in the tranquility of a solitary life. The only thing missing them was a son.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=426}} One morning the king went to the seashore and caught a big red fish, which resulted magic as it began to speak and told the king to divide it into four pieces, giving his wife the part that was on the side of the head, eating the middle part himself, giving a piece from the part of the tail to the mare and another to the dog, and burying the bones in the garden. The king fulfilled the instructions of the fish. Time passed and his wife gave birth to two male twins, Zjerma{{efn|The term ''zjerma'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''zjarm'', which means \"fire\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=47}}}} and Handa,{{efn|The term ''handa'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''hana'', which means \"moon\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=20}}}} the one with the Sun and the other with the Moon in their forehead; while the mare gave birth to two foals, the dog to two puppies, and two silver swords appeared in the garden. The mother raised her twins with care, and the father taught them to ride even without a saddle, to use the spear and the bow, the sword and the dagger, and to hunt in the mountains and forests.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=427}}\n\n===King's death and Twins' departure===\nWhen the twins became nineteen, the old man fell ill and realized he was joined by the black [[ora (mythology)|ora]]. He called his sons in front of the bed, he recommended them never to forget that in their veins pure king's blood flowed, to love each other as they had done until that day, to take care of their old mother, and to leave a good name, doing good to everyone, wherever they happened to pass. Before dying he gave each of them one of his gold [[Magic ring|rings]]. They buried him with all his weapons and [[Vajtim|mourned]] him for nine days and for nine nights. The queen suffered a lot for her husband's death, but she was comforted by her two sons. So she went back to spinning linen and wool all day. A farmer started to work in the garden, while his wife took care of the housework.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=427\u2013428}}\n\nAfter a year Zjerma told Handa that he intended to leave and travel the world in order to gain fame and conquer some kingdom, so they could rise again in the high glory of their ancestors. He proposed to gird their silver swords, to mount on their steeds, to take with them the two dogs who were not afraid to attack even a [[drangue]], and to depart. As for their mother, although old, she was healthy and there was already someone who could help her. Handa accepted his brother's proposal, so the two greeted their mother and left with the horses and dogs.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\nOn their journey they came to a water source that was at the foot of a flowering almond tree, where the road split. There they decided to separate and follow their own [[fate]], according to the choice of the horses, [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swearing]] to be in that place every year on the same day. In the event that one of the two had found himself in danger and had thus needed the help of the other, the gem of the ring would have lost its radiance, darkening and eventually becoming completely black, so the other would have rushed to the rescue. The two brothers hug each other, subsequently the horse of Zjerma went towards the way on the right and that of Handa towards the other on the left.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\n===Zjerma's journey===\n====Kulshedra: the seven-headed dragon====\nAfter a few days, Zjerma arrived in a city where he noticed that all the streets were empy and the houses were closed. At some point he arrived in front of the great temple of the Sun, where he saw an old man crying, thus Zjerma asked him for informations about that mysterious situation.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}} The old man answered that the [[kulshedra]] appeared about a month before at the sources of the river and blocked the waters causing drought in the region. All the valiant heroes who tried to slay the monster were defeated and perished. So the elders suggested to the king to find an agreement with the monster if she was willing to release the waters. She accepted only on the condition of receiving daily the offering of one of the most beautiful maidens. The old man told Zjerma that his daughter was sent the day before, while king's daughter Bardhakuqja (\"Whitered\") was sent that day, and the king had promised his daughter in marriage to whatever man succeeded in slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nZjerma then promised the old man that he would avenge his daughter and departed immediately with his animal companions.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}} The hero soon reached a dark valley, in the midst of high mountains, where the head of the river consisted of a deep and wide abyss, at the bottom of which the monster lived. There the wretched maiden was tied to a boulder, almost lifeless. Seeing the [[Princess and dragon|princess]], still radiant in her great beauty, Zjerma felt all his blood stirring in his veins. Her big blue eyes saw Zjerma, and immediately she told him to go away to save his life. But the hero was there to save her and free the city, thus he dismounted and freed the princess. Because he was very tired, he wanted to rest holding his head on her knees before the arrival of the monster, so he lay down on the ground and soon fell asleep.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nAt noon the water began to move and the beauty realized that the [[kulshedra]] was about to come out, however she did not have the courage to wake Zjerma up, and began to cry, but a tear woke him up. Zjerma mounted his horse and brandished the silver sword, waiting for the monster. The water was boiling and from its waves the seven heads of the kulshedra emerged, of which, the central one was horned and with a seven-pointed crown. Poison was flowing between her teeth and forked tongues were hissing, while her mouths were spitting fire. When the kulshedra jumped to the ground Zjerma saw that her body was similar to that of a giant lizard, but equipped with a segmented armor, made of bone hard as steel. In the back there was a serpentine tail with nine knots and covered with hard scales. Her legs were short, but large and robust, with curved claws as hard as iron. On her back she had a kind of fish fin that dilated and narrowed by means of certain mobile antennas that ended like boar tusks. She had wings like those of a bat, but nine times larger than those of a large hawk.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}}\n\n====Dragon Slayer====\nWhen the kulshedra was about to pounce, Zjerma attacked her together with the horse and went up to the monster, while the dog bit her behind. The kulshedra writhed spitting flames and hissing from her mouths, striving to bite the enemies and crush them with her tail, but the horse trampled on her with its paws denting the bony armor and breaking the scales that protected her body, while the hero uninterruptedly wounded her with the sword, cutting off her heads, in vain because they leapt from the ground and sticked to the bloody necks again. He realized that he would have to cut off her central head to kill her. Meanwhile, a thick black cloud covered the valley, full of thunders and lightning.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}} Finally Zjerma's sword struck and cut off the central head, and a torrent of boiling black blood erupted along with flames from the neck, accompanied by a very loud screech. The cloud cleared and the Sun shone. The waters began to flow again into the river renewing life in the region.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=431}}\n\nZjerma cut off kulshedra's tongues and put them in the saddlebag along with the crowned head. He washed himself in the river with the horse and the dog. Then he helped the princess to mount on horseback and brought her into the city, where the hero was greeted with celebrations and honors. Meanwhile, [[False hero|Barkulku]] (\"Wolfbelly\") passed near the source of the river and noticed the dead kulshedra. Not knowing what had happened, he cut off the remaining heads and put them in a sack hoping to get some reward. He arrived in the city at the same time Zjerma and Bardhakuqja were getting married. Then Barkulku approached the foot of the throne, and in the presence of all the people he shouted that he had killed the kulshedra, consequently the reward had to be his. The king asked him to prove what he claimed. So Barkulku pulled out the heads of the kulshedra, but Zjerma pointed out that the crowned head was missing along with the tongues, thus he took them out of his saddlebag and showed them to everyone.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=431\u2013432}} The king [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swore]] by the Sun that if Barkulku had no other arguments to defend himself, he would have given the order to burn him. Thus Barkulku attacked Zjerma, but during the battle he was wounded and finally killed by the real [[Dragonslayer|dragon slayer]].{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=432}}\n\nWhen Zjerma and Bardhakuqja were about to put garlands on their heads, Zjerma realized that the gem of his ring lost its radiance and began darkening. Suddenly Zjerma stopped the ceremony saying that he had to leave urgently. He kissed the bride and told her to wait for him for a year, a month and a day. If he hadn't come back in time, she would have been free to remarry. He greeted everyone and departed to rescue his brother with his horse and dog.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=432\u2013433}}\n\n===Handa's journey===\nAfter separating from his brother, Handa and his animal companions crossed plains, hills and mountains, and finally arrived in a thick forest. He proceeded with difficulty often cutting the plants to make his way. When the forest became thinner, the young man noticed a hut near a stream, at the entrance of which an old man was resting. They greeted each other and the elder immediately advised Handa not to continue on the direction he had taken because he would face many risks, even worse than death, but the young man replied that he had to follow his [[fate]], thus he continued on his way.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=433}} After a while he arrived in the garden of the [[Zana (mythology)|Zanas]]. There, white dressed nymphs welcomed him with laughs, songs and dances. They charmed the young man with kisses and caresses, then they informed him that [[e Bukura e Dheut]] (\"the Earthly Beauty\") lived in the cave at the foot of the mountain, where that plain ended. It was easy to convince the inebriated Handa to go and find her in order to achieve his complete happiness.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=434}}\n\nHe left the Zanas and arrived with the horse and the dog at the entrance of a garden surrounded by a hedge of brambles and briars. An old woman appeared and asked him what he was looking for. He replied that he wanted to meet the Earthly Beauty and then to marry her. The old woman allowed him to enter only after a test of intelligence, of the ability to wield his sword and to ride his horse. The test consisted of solving a riddle, cutting a woolen bow in two pieces and climbing over the hedge on the horse's back without touching it. Handa failed all of them, and when he was in the garden, the [[shtriga|evil old woman]] sprayed him, the horse and the dog with an herbal ointment [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|transforming them into stone]]. It was then that Zjerma noticed the darkening of the gem of his ring.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=435}}\n\n====Brother's rescue====\nZjerma reached the source under the flowering almond tree, walked towards the way that Handa had taken before him, and finally arrived at the old man's hut. Once they greeted each other, the elder told the young man that his brother followed the path that led to the garden of the Earthly Beauty, that he unsuccessfully tried to convince him not to go, but his brother didn't listen him. The old man said that before him he saw many other men try that feat without ever going back. The [[wise old man]] invited Zjerma to enter the hut, where he gave him many secret teachings that could have helped him to save his brother. Later Zjerma greeted the old man and departed. In the garden of the Zanas the bright nymphs tried to entertain him with their songs and dances, but he did not stop, saying that they were very beautiful, but they were not for him.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=436}}\n\nAt the entrance of the garden of the Earthly Beauty he solved the riddle of the evil old woman, with the silver sword he cut the woolen bow in two pieces, then he jumped the hedge with his horse, but before the witch sprayed the herbal ointment on him, he captured her and tied her to a tree ordering her to show him his brother, otherwise he would kill her. Trembling, she showed him a great number of petrified brave men, among whom was also Handa. Thus he asked the witch to tell him what to do to get his brother back to life, she replied that he should anointed Handa's eyes and lips with the [[dew]] that he could have found inside the calyx of the [[white lily]]. Not finding the flower by himself, he ordered the witch to tell him its location, she obeyed.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=436}} The young man took the flower and with the dew sprinkled Handa's eyes and lips making him come back to life. Zjerma embraced Handa, thus he sprinkled also the horse and dog with the dew, and when he started waking up everyone else, the witch yelled at him to stop, but he paid no attention to her, so she [[Shapeshifting|transformed]] herself to a black [[bolla]] and tried to free herself by twisting, then she clung to a nearby tree trying to uproot the tree on which she was tied, but her body split into two pieces causing her death.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=437}}\n\nWhen all the petrified men came back to life, the twins realized that they were all young brave men of noble origins. Handa proposed to them, since they were all there for the [[E Bukura e Dheut|Earthly Beauty]]'s hand, to compete in a tournament. The brave men showed gratitude to his brother Zjerma who had saved their lives, thus they granted to Handa to marry her without having to fight. Zjerma begged everyone to follow him and his brother to visit the Beauty, they accepted.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=437}} At the head of that group of brave heroes, the twins arrived at the cave where the Earthly Beauty lived. There they found the immortal maiden in the shade of a cypress and vine, surrounded by her maids. She greeted the heroes and offered her hand to Handa. Earthly Beauty's eyes were lighter than Moon and she looked like the bright of Venus. Zjerma made two laurel wreaths and placed them on the head of Earthly Beauty and Handa. Nine-day celebrations followed.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}}\n\n===Twins' kingdoms===\nZjerma gathered all his brave companions in assembly and invited them to take part in the liberation of the kingdom of twins' ancestors from the foreign domination. Everyone approved his proposal and left for the war.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}} The twin's army was composed of a few men, but their value combined with the strength of Zjerma and Handa \u2013 comparable to that of a [[drangue]] \u2013 allowed them to win the battles for several months. When the foreign king realized that he no longer had hope of victory or of salvation, he joined his army in combat, but found death by Handa's silver sword. Being heir to his father-in-law's throne, Zjerma left Handa the part he owed of his ancestor's crown and recognized his brother as king. Then the two heroes took their mother back to her own kingdom. Afterwards Zjerma went with his army to Earthly Beauty's cave to bring her to his brother. After such a journey Zjerma became ill. Soon came the last day of the expiration of the time by which he should have returned to Bardhakuqja, but he had no strength to get out of bed, so he sent Handa to his beloved.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}}\n\nWhen Handa arrived in the city freed by his brother, everyone mistaken him for Zjerma. People there spent all day celebrating. At night Handa had to go to bed with her sister-in-law. He revealed the truth to her, then he placed the sword between them. In the morning Zjerma arrived unexpectedly, entered the room and saw the two sleeping in the same bed. At first he would have killed them both in their sleep, but he noticed Handa's silver sword which separated them better than a wall, he realized how the matter had gone and laughed waking them up.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=439}} The twins later went with Bardhakuqja to Handa's kingdom, where she met their mother and Handa's wife. After three months Zjerma and his wife returned home. There, since the king was very old and would have liked to rest, he gave his throne to Zjerma and placed the golden crown on his head.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=439}}\n\n==Classification==\nThe tale is [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] type 303, \"The Twins or Blood Brothers\" including also the ATU type 300, \"The Dragon Slayer\".<ref name=\"Gonzenbach\"/>{{sfn|Thompson|1977|pp=27, 29}} Instead of the theme of the social rise of a young man of humble conditions \u2013 son of a fisherman \u2013 who is found in different variations of other traditions, in the Albanian version there is the theme of two brothers \u2013 sons of a king who has lost his throne, born one with the sun and the other with the moon in their forehead \u2013 who restore the initial order, regaining the former kingdom of their father.

One day they decide to travel the world together with their two horses and two dogs but at some point they separate from each other.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=411\u2013439}}\n\n==Story==\n===Twins' birth===\nThere was a king who had lost his kingdom. Of all his wealth, he retained only two gold rings each adorned with a gem, a mare, a brave female dog, and a vegetable garden, where he lived with his wife. He used to spend the days hoeing the earth, his wife spinning linen and wool. They were happy in the quiet of the fields and in the tranquility of a solitary life. The only thing missing them was a son.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=426}} One morning the king went to the seashore and caught a big red fish, which resulted magic as it began to speak and told the king to divide it into four pieces, giving his wife the part that was on the side of the head, eating the middle part himself, giving a piece from the part of the tail to the mare and another to the dog, and burying the bones in the garden. The king fulfilled the instructions of the fish. Time passed and his wife gave birth to two male twins, Zjerma{{efn|The term ''zjerma'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''zjarm'', which means \"fire\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=47}}}} and Handa,{{efn|The term ''handa'' is the archaic form of Albanian ''hana'', which means \"moon\".{{sfn|Demiraj|1997|p=20}}}} the one with the Sun and the other with the Moon in their forehead; while the mare gave birth to two foals, the dog to two puppies, and two silver swords appeared in the garden. The mother raised her twins with care, and the father taught them to ride even without a saddle, to use the spear and the bow, the sword and the dagger, and to hunt in the mountains and forests.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=427}}\n\n===King's death and Twins' departure===\nWhen the twins became nineteen, the old man fell ill and realized he was joined by the black [[ora (mythology)|ora]]. He called his sons in front of the bed, he recommended them never to forget that in their veins pure king's blood flowed, to love each other as they had done until that day, to take care of their old mother, and to leave a good name, doing good to everyone, wherever they happened to pass. Before dying he gave each of them one of his gold [[Magic ring|rings]]. They buried him with all his weapons and [[Vajtim|mourned]] him for nine days and for nine nights. The queen suffered a lot for her husband's death, but she was comforted by her two sons. So she went back to spinning linen and wool all day. A farmer started to work in the garden, while his wife took care of the housework.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=427\u2013428}}\n\nAfter a year Zjerma told Handa that he intended to leave and travel the world in order to gain fame and conquer some kingdom, so they could rise again in the high glory of their ancestors. He proposed to gird their silver swords, to mount on their steeds, to take with them the two dogs who were not afraid to attack even a [[drangue]], and to depart. As for their mother, although old, she was healthy and there was already someone who could help her. Handa accepted his brother's proposal, so the two greeted their mother and left with the horses and dogs.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\nOn their journey they came to a water source that was at the foot of a flowering almond tree, where the road split. There they decided to separate and follow their own [[fate]], according to the choice of the horses, [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swearing]] to be in that place every year on the same day. In the event that one of the two had found himself in danger and had thus needed the help of the other, the gem of the ring would have lost its radiance, darkening and eventually becoming completely black, so the other would have rushed to the rescue. The two brothers hug each other, subsequently the horse of Zjerma went towards the way on the right and that of Handa towards the other on the left.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}}\n\n===Zjerma's journey===\n====Kulshedra: the seven-headed dragon====\nAfter a few days, Zjerma arrived in a city where he noticed that all the streets were empy and the houses were closed. At some point he arrived in front of the great temple of the Sun, where he saw an old man crying, thus Zjerma asked him for informations about that mysterious situation.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=428}} The old man answered that the [[kulshedra]] appeared about a month before at the sources of the river and blocked the waters causing drought in the region. All the valiant heroes who tried to slay the monster were defeated and perished. So the elders suggested to the king to find an agreement with the monster if she was willing to release the waters. She accepted only on the condition of receiving daily the offering of one of the most beautiful maidens. The old man told Zjerma that his daughter was sent the day before, while king's daughter Bardhakuqja (\"Whitered\") was sent that day, and the king had promised his daughter in marriage to whatever man succeeded in slaying the dragon.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nZjerma then promised the old man that he would avenge his daughter and departed immediately with his animal companions.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}} The hero soon reached a dark valley, in the midst of high mountains, where the head of the river consisted of a deep and wide abyss, at the bottom of which the monster lived. There the wretched maiden was tied to a boulder, almost lifeless. Seeing the [[Princess and dragon|princess]], still radiant in her great beauty, Zjerma felt all his blood stirring in his veins. Her big blue eyes saw Zjerma, and immediately she told him to go away to save his life. But the hero was there to save her and free the city, thus he dismounted and freed the princess. Because he was very tired, he wanted to rest holding his head on her knees before the arrival of the monster, so he lay down on the ground and soon fell asleep.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=429}}\n\nAt noon the water began to move and the beauty realized that the [[kulshedra]] was about to come out, however she did not have the courage to wake Zjerma up, and began to cry, but a tear woke him up. Zjerma mounted his horse and brandished the silver sword, waiting for the monster. The water was boiling and from its waves the seven heads of the kulshedra emerged, of which, the central one was horned and with a seven-pointed crown. Poison was flowing between her teeth and forked tongues were hissing, while her mouths were spitting fire. When the kulshedra jumped to the ground Zjerma saw that her body was similar to that of a giant lizard, but equipped with a segmented armor, made of bone hard as steel. In the back there was a serpentine tail with nine knots and covered with hard scales. Her legs were short, but large and robust, with curved claws as hard as iron. On her back she had a kind of fish fin that dilated and narrowed by means of certain mobile antennas that ended like boar tusks. She had wings like those of a bat, but nine times larger than those of a large hawk.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}}\n\n====Dragon Slayer====\nWhen the kulshedra was about to pounce, Zjerma attacked her together with the horse and went up to the monster, while the dog bit her behind. The kulshedra writhed spitting flames and hissing from her mouths, striving to bite the enemies and crush them with her tail, but the horse trampled on her with its paws denting the bony armor and breaking the scales that protected her body, while the hero uninterruptedly wounded her with the sword, cutting off her heads, in vain because they leapt from the ground and sticked to the bloody necks again. He realized that he would have to cut off her central head to kill her. Meanwhile, a thick black cloud covered the valley, full of thunders and lightning.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=430}} Finally Zjerma's sword struck and cut off the central head, and a torrent of boiling black blood erupted along with flames from the neck, accompanied by a very loud screech. The cloud cleared and the Sun shone. The waters began to flow again into the river renewing life in the region.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=431}}\n\nZjerma cut off kulshedra's tongues and put them in the saddlebag along with the crowned head. He washed himself in the river with the horse and the dog. Then he helped the princess to mount on horseback and brought her into the city, where the hero was greeted with celebrations and honors. Meanwhile, [[False hero|Barkulku]] (\"Wolfbelly\") passed near the source of the river and noticed the dead kulshedra. Not knowing what had happened, he cut off the remaining heads and put them in a sack hoping to get some reward. He arrived in the city at the same time Zjerma and Bardhakuqja were getting married. Then Barkulku approached the foot of the throne, and in the presence of all the people he shouted that he had killed the kulshedra, consequently the reward had to be his. The king asked him to prove what he claimed. So Barkulku pulled out the heads of the kulshedra, but Zjerma pointed out that the crowned head was missing along with the tongues, thus he took them out of his saddlebag and showed them to everyone.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=431\u2013432}} The king [[Besa (Albanian culture)|swore]] by the Sun that if Barkulku had no other arguments to defend himself, he would have given the order to burn him. Thus Barkulku attacked Zjerma, but during the battle he was wounded and finally killed by the real [[Dragonslayer|dragon slayer]].{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=432}}\n\nWhen Zjerma and Bardhakuqja were about to put garlands on their heads, Zjerma realized that the gem of his ring lost its radiance and began darkening. Suddenly Zjerma stopped the ceremony saying that he had to leave urgently. He kissed the bride and told her to wait for him for a year, a month and a day. If he hadn't come back in time, she would have been free to remarry. He greeted everyone and departed to rescue his brother with his horse and dog.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|pp=432\u2013433}}\n\n===Handa's journey===\nAfter separating from his brother, Handa and his animal companions crossed plains, hills and mountains, and finally arrived in a thick forest. He proceeded with difficulty often cutting the plants to make his way. When the forest became thinner, the young man noticed a hut near a stream, at the entrance of which an old man was resting. They greeted each other and the elder immediately advised Handa not to continue on the direction he had taken because he would face many risks, even worse than death, but the young man replied that he had to follow his [[fate]], thus he continued on his way.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=433}} After a while he arrived in the garden of the [[Zana (mythology)|Zanas]]. There, white dressed nymphs welcomed him with laughs, songs and dances. They charmed the young man with kisses and caresses, then they informed him that [[e Bukura e Dheut]] (\"the Earthly Beauty\") lived in the cave at the foot of the mountain, where that plain ended. It was easy to convince the inebriated Handa to go and find her in order to achieve his complete happiness.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=434}}\n\nHe left the Zanas and arrived with the horse and the dog at the entrance of a garden surrounded by a hedge of brambles and briars. An old woman appeared and asked him what he was looking for. He replied that he wanted to meet the Earthly Beauty and then to marry her. The old woman allowed him to enter only after a test of intelligence, of the ability to wield his sword and to ride his horse. The test consisted of solving a riddle, cutting a woolen bow in two pieces and climbing over the hedge on the horse's back without touching it. Handa failed all of them, and when he was in the garden, the [[shtriga|evil old woman]] sprayed him, the horse and the dog with an herbal ointment [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|transforming them into stone]]. It was then that Zjerma noticed the darkening of the gem of his ring.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=435}}\n\n====Brother's rescue====\nZjerma reached the source under the flowering almond tree, walked towards the way that Handa had taken before him, and finally arrived at the old man's hut. Once they greeted each other, the elder told the young man that his brother followed the path that led to the garden of the Earthly Beauty, that he unsuccessfully tried to convince him not to go, but his brother didn't listen him. The old man said that before him he saw many other men try that feat without ever going back. The [[wise old man]] invited Zjerma to enter the hut, where he gave him many secret teachings that could have helped him to save his brother. Later Zjerma greeted the old man and departed. In the garden of the Zanas the bright nymphs tried to entertain him with their songs and dances, but he did not stop, saying that they were very beautiful, but they were not for him.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=436}}\n\nAt the entrance of the garden of the Earthly Beauty he solved the riddle of the evil old woman, with the silver sword he cut the woolen bow in two pieces, then he jumped the hedge with his horse, but before the witch sprayed the herbal ointment on him, he captured her and tied her to a tree ordering her to show him his brother, otherwise he would kill her. Trembling, she showed him a great number of petrified brave men, among whom was also Handa. Thus he asked the witch to tell him what to do to get his brother back to life, she replied that he should anointed Handa's eyes and lips with the [[dew]] that he could have found inside the calyx of the [[white lily]]. Not finding the flower by himself, he ordered the witch to tell him it's location, she obeyed.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=436}} The young man took the flower and with the dew sprinkled Handa's eyes and lips making him come back to life. Zjerma embraced Handa, thus he sprinkled also the horse and dog with the dew, and when he started waking up everyone else, the witch yelled at him to stop, but he paid no attention to her, so she [[Shapeshifting|transformed]] herself to a black [[bolla]] and tried to free herself by twisting, then she clung to a nearby tree trying to uproot the tree on which she was tied, but her body split into two pieces causing her death.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=437}}\n\nWhen all the petrified men came back to life, the twins realized that they were all young brave men of noble origins. Handa proposed to them, since they were all there for the [[E Bukura e Dheut|Earthly Beauty]]'s hand, to compete in a tournament. The brave men showed gratitude to his brother Zjerma who had saved their lives, thus they granted to Handa to marry her without having to fight. Zjerma begged everyone to follow him and his brother to visit the Beauty, they accepted.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=437}} At the head of that group of brave heroes, the twins arrived at the cave where the Earthly Beauty lived. There they found the immortal maiden in the shade of a cypress and vine, surrounded by her maids. She greeted the heroes and offered her hand to Handa. Earthly Beauty's eyes were lighter than Moon and she looked like the bright of Venus. Zjerma made two laurel wreaths and placed them on the head of Earthly Beauty and Handa. Nine-day celebrations followed.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}}\n\n===Twins' kingdoms===\nZjerma gathered all his brave companions in assembly and invited them to take part in the liberation of the kingdom of twins' ancestors from the foreign domination. Everyone approved his proposal and left for the war.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}} The twin's army was composed of a few men, but their value combined with the strength of Zjerma and Handa \u2013 comparable to that of a [[drangue]] \u2013 allowed them to win the battles for several months. When the foreign king realized that he no longer had hope of victory or of salvation, he joined his army in combat, but found death by Handa's silver sword. Being heir to his father-in-law's throne, Zjerma left Handa the part he owed of his ancestor's crown and recognized his brother as king. Then the two heroes took their mother back to her own kingdom. Afterwards Zjerma went with his army to Earthly Beauty's cave to bring her to his brother. After such a journey Zjerma became ill. Soon came the last day of the expiration of the time by which he should have returned to Bardhakuqja, but he had no strength to get out of bed, so he sent Handa to his beloved.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=438}}\n\nWhen Handa arrived in the city freed by his brother, everyone mistaken him for Zjerma. People there spent all day celebrating. At night Handa had to go to bed with her sister-in-law. He revealed the truth to her, then he placed the sword between them. In the morning Zjerma arrived unexpectedly, entered the room and saw the two sleeping in the same bed. At first he would have killed them both in their sleep, but he noticed Handa's silver sword which separated them better than a wall, he realized how the matter had gone and laughed waking them up.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=439}} The twins later went with Bardhakuqja to Handa's kingdom, where she met their mother and Handa's wife. After three months Zjerma and his wife returned home. There, since the king was very old and would have liked to rest, he gave his throne to Zjerma and placed the golden crown on his head.{{sfn|Schir\u00f2|1923|p=439}}\n\n==Classification==\nThe tale is [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] type 303, \"The Twins or Blood Brothers\" including also the ATU type 300, \"The Dragon Slayer\".<ref name=\"Gonzenbach\"/>{{sfn|Thompson|1977|pp=27, 29}} Instead of the theme of the social rise of a young man of humble conditions \u2013 son of a fisherman \u2013 who is found in different variations of other traditions, in the Albanian version there is the theme of two brothers \u2013 sons of a king who has lost his throne, born one with the sun and the other with the moon in their forehead \u2013 who restore the initial order, regaining the former kingdom of their father.

{"title_page": "Hotels in London", "text_new": "This article describes the '''hotels in London, England'''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:StPancrasMidlandHotel.jpg|thumb|St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel at [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]]]]\nBefore the 19th century there were few if any large hotels in London. British country landowners often lived in London for part of the year but they usually rented a house, if the family did not have [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|their own townhouse]]. Numbers of business and foreign visitors were very small by modern standards, before the Industrial Revolution. The accommodation available to them included [[gentlemen's club]] accommodations, lodging houses and [[coaching inn]]s. Lodging houses were more like private homes with rooms to let than commercial hotels, and were often run by widows. Coaching inns served passengers from the [[stage coach]]es which were the main means of long-distance passenger transport before railways began to develop in the 1830s. The last surviving galleried coaching inn in London is the [[The George Inn, Southwark|George Inn]], which now belongs to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].\n \t\nA few hotels of a more modern variety began to be built in the early 19th century. For example, Mivart's, the precursor of [[Claridge's]], opened its doors in 1812 but, up to the mid-19th century, London hotels were generally small. In his travel book ''North America'' (1862), the novelist [[Anthony Trollope]] remarked on how much larger American hotels were than British ones. But by this time the railways had already begun to bring far more short-term visitors to London, and the railway companies themselves took the lead in accommodating them by building a series of \"railway hotels\" near to their London termini. These buildings were seen as status symbols by the railway companies, the largest businesses in the country at the time, and some of them were very grand. They included:\n\n* The [[Hilton London Paddington|Great Western Hotel]] at [[Paddington station|Paddington]] (now the [[Hilton London Paddington]] and the first of Britain's railway hotels, built in 1854)\n* The [[St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel|Midland Grand Hotel]] at [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] (closed from 1935\u20132011; now the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel.)\n* The [[Great Northern Hotel]] at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] (recently restored as a boutique hotel)\n* The [[Andaz Liverpool Street London Hotel|Great Eastern Hotel]] at [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] (Now the [[Andaz Liverpool Street London Hotel]])\n* The [[Charing Cross Hotel]] at [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross station]]\n* The [[The Landmark London|Great Central Hotel]] at [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]] (now [[The Landmark London]])\n* The [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] at [[London Victoria station|Victoria]]\n\nMany other large hotels were built in London in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] period. The [[Westminster Palace Hotel]] (1858), named after its neighbour the [[Palace of Westminster]], i.e. Parliament, was the location of many political meetings. The [[Langham Hotel]] was the largest in the city when it opened in 1865.  The [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]], perhaps London's most famous hotel, opened in 1889, the first London hotel with en-suite bathrooms to every room.  Nine years later [[Claridge's]] was rebuilt in its current form.  Another famous hotel, the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz]], based on its even more celebrated namesake in Paris, opened in 1906.\n\nThe upper end of the London hotel business continued to flourish between the two World Wars, boosted by the fact that many landowning families could no longer afford to maintain a London house and therefore began to stay at hotels instead, and by an increasing number of foreign visitors, especially Americans. Famous hotels which opened their doors in this era include the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] and the [[Dorchester Hotel|Dorchester]].\n\nThe rate of hotel construction in London was fairly low in the quarter century after [[World War II]] and the famous old names retained their dominance of the top end of the market. The most notable hotel of this era was probably the [[London Hilton on Park Lane|London Hilton]], a controversial concrete tower overlooking [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Advances in air travel increased the number of overseas visitors to London from 1.6 million in 1963 to 6 million in 1974. In order to provide hotels to meet the extra demand a Hotel Development Incentive Scheme was introduced and a building boom ensued. This led to overcapacity in the London hotel market from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Construction then picked up again, but it was soon curtailed by the recession of the early 1990s and the reduction in international travel caused by the 1991 [[Gulf War]].\n\nThe 1980s saw London (along with [[New York City|New York]]) start the trend of smaller boutique-style hotels. In the mid-1990s many new hotels being opened, including different types from [[English country house|country-house-style]] hotels in Victorian houses to ultra-trendy minimalist premises. At this time some of London's grandest early-20th-century office buildings were converted into hotels because their layouts, with long corridors and numerous separate offices, were incompatible with the preference for open-plan working, but their [[listed building|listed status]] made it hard to get permission to demolish them. This period also saw the opening of the first five-star hotel in London south of the [[River Thames]], the [[Marriott County Hall Hotel]], and the first two in East London, the Four Seasons Canary Wharf and the Marriott [[West India Quay]], which is also close to the [[Canary Wharf]] development. For many years there were no hotels at all in the [[City of London]] even though the financial firms of the City were one of the London hotel sector's most lucrative sources of custom. But in recent years over a thousand hotel rooms have opened in the City. Budget hotel chains such as [[Travel Inn]] and [[Travelodge]] have also been expanding rapidly in London since the mid-1990s.\n\nOne of the most expensive hotels in London is [[The Lanesborough]]. Originally a private address (Lanesborough House), in 1733 it was converted into [[St George's Hospital]], and began life as a hotel in 1991.\n\n==Hotels in modern London==\n[[File:Waldorf Hotel 2.jpg|thumb|[[The Waldorf Hilton Hotel London]] in [[Aldwych]]]]\n[[File:Grange Holborn Hotel.jpg|thumb|[[Grange Holborn Hotel]] in [[Holborn]]]]\nThere is no official registry of hotel rooms in London, but the estimated number of hotel rooms in Greater London in 2010 was put at 123,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/329273/hotel-rooms-in-london-to-grow-by-12-by-2012|title=growth of hotel rooms in London}}</ref> According to figures produced in support of [[London 2012 Olympic bid|London's 2012 Olympic bid]], there were more than 70,000 three to five star hotel rooms within 10 kilometres of [[Central London]] in 2003. The main growth was a huge rise in the number of rooms within the [[City of London]], while Kensington and Chelsea actually had a small fall. This is comparing figures since 1981.\nThe main concentration of luxury hotels is in the [[West End of London|West End]], especially in [[Mayfair]] and [[Soho]]. London's five star hotels are quite small on average by international standards. The largest, [[Grosvenor House Hotel]], has only 494 rooms, and eighteen of them have fifty or fewer. The range is very wide, including:\n* Traditional purpose-built grand hotels such as the Ritz, the Savoy and the Dorchester.\n* Recent conversions of grand late 19th and early 20th century office buildings into hotels such as One Aldwych and the Renaissance Chancery Court.\n* Townhouse hotels.\n* Modern purpose-built chain hotels.\n\n'''List of Four-Star Hotels in London'''\n\n[https://www.grandroyalelondon.co.uk/ Grand Royale London Hyde Park],  [https://www.parkgrandlondon.com/ Park Grand London], [https://www.parkinternationalhotel.com/en Park International Hotel], [https://www.shaftesburyhotels.com/ Shaftesbury Hotels] \n\n===List of Five-Star Hotels in London===\nThere are no official bodies that rate hotels.

However this was not as steep as might have been expected since figures were compared to the previous years figures which were themselves affected by the [[July 7th London bombings]] of 2005. It is thought without those circumstances the real drop would have been something in the region of 20-30%. Strangely while figures showed a drop in bookings some major chains such as Intercontinental reported strong demand for hotel rooms in London as passengers became stranded in London unable to get a flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2006/08/17/308354/Hoteliers+optimistic+despite+terror+scare.htm|title=drop in passenger numbers}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2006, several hotels were subject to checks for radiation after former Russian spy [[Alexander Litvinenko]] was poisoned with [[Polonium|Polonium-210]].

British country landowners often lived in London for part of the year but they usually rented a house, if the family did not have [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|their own townhouse]]. Numbers of business and foreign visitors were very small by modern standards, before the Industrial Revolution. The accommodation available to them included [[gentlemen's club]] accommodations, lodging houses and [[coaching inn]]s. Lodging houses were more like private homes with rooms to let than commercial hotels, and were often run by widows. Coaching inns served passengers from the [[stage coach]]es which were the main means of long-distance passenger transport before railways began to develop in the 1830s. The last surviving galleried coaching inn in London is the [[The George Inn, Southwark|George Inn]], which now belongs to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].\n \t\nA few hotels of a more modern variety began to be built in the early 19th century. For example, Mivart's, the precursor of [[Claridge's]], opened its doors in 1812 but, up to the mid-19th century, London hotels were generally small. In his travel book ''North America'' (1862), the novelist [[Anthony Trollope]] remarked on how much larger American hotels were than British ones. But by this time the railways had already begun to bring far more short-term visitors to London, and the railway companies themselves took the lead in accommodating them by building a series of \"railway hotels\" near to their London termini. These buildings were seen as status symbols by the railway companies, the largest businesses in the country at the time, and some of them were very grand. They included:\n\n* The [[Hilton London Paddington|Great Western Hotel]] at [[Paddington station|Paddington]] (now the [[Hilton London Paddington]] and the first of Britain's railway hotels, built in 1854)\n* The [[St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel|Midland Grand Hotel]] at [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras]] (closed from 1935\u20132011; now the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel.)\n* The [[Great Northern Hotel]] at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] (recently restored as a boutique hotel)\n* The [[Andaz Liverpool Street London Hotel|Great Eastern Hotel]] at [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] (Now the [[Andaz Liverpool Street London Hotel]])\n* The [[Charing Cross Hotel]] at [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross station]]\n* The [[The Landmark London|Great Central Hotel]] at [[Marylebone station|Marylebone]] (now [[The Landmark London]])\n* The [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] at [[London Victoria station|Victoria]]\n\nMany other large hotels were built in London in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] period. The [[Westminster Palace Hotel]] (1858), named after its neighbour the [[Palace of Westminster]], i.e. Parliament, was the location of many political meetings. The [[Langham Hotel]] was the largest in the city when it opened in 1865.  The [[Savoy Hotel|Savoy]], perhaps London's most famous hotel, opened in 1889, the first London hotel with en-suite bathrooms to every room.  Nine years later [[Claridge's]] was rebuilt in its current form.  Another famous hotel, the [[The Ritz London Hotel|Ritz]], based on its even more celebrated namesake in Paris, opened in 1906.\n\nThe upper end of the London hotel business continued to flourish between the two World Wars, boosted by the fact that many landowning families could no longer afford to maintain a London house and therefore began to stay at hotels instead, and by an increasing number of foreign visitors, especially Americans. Famous hotels which opened their doors in this era include the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] and the [[Dorchester Hotel|Dorchester]].\n\nThe rate of hotel construction in London was fairly low in the quarter century after [[World War II]] and the famous old names retained their dominance of the top end of the market. The most notable hotel of this era was probably the [[London Hilton on Park Lane|London Hilton]], a controversial concrete tower overlooking [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. Advances in air travel increased the number of overseas visitors to London from 1.6 million in 1963 to 6 million in 1974. In order to provide hotels to meet the extra demand a Hotel Development Incentive Scheme was introduced and a building boom ensued. This led to overcapacity in the London hotel market from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Construction then picked up again, but it was soon curtailed by the recession of the early 1990s and the reduction in international travel caused by the 1991 [[Gulf War]].\n\nThe 1980s saw London (along with [[New York City|New York]]) start the trend of smaller boutique-style hotels. In the mid-1990s many new hotels being opened, including different types from [[English country house|country-house-style]] hotels in Victorian houses to ultra-trendy minimalist premises. At this time some of London's grandest early-20th-century office buildings were converted into hotels because their layouts, with long corridors and numerous separate offices, were incompatible with the preference for open-plan working, but their [[listed building|listed status]] made it hard to get permission to demolish them. This period also saw the opening of the first five-star hotel in London south of the [[River Thames]], the [[Marriott County Hall Hotel]], and the first two in East London, the Four Seasons Canary Wharf and the Marriott [[West India Quay]], which is also close to the [[Canary Wharf]] development. For many years there were no hotels at all in the [[City of London]] even though the financial firms of the City were one of the London hotel sector's most lucrative sources of custom. But in recent years over a thousand hotel rooms have opened in the City. Budget hotel chains such as [[Travel Inn]] and [[Travelodge]] have also been expanding rapidly in London since the mid-1990s.\n\nOne of the most expensive hotels in London is [[The Lanesborough]]. Originally a private address (Lanesborough House), in 1733 it was converted into [[St George's Hospital]], and began life as a hotel in 1991.\n\n==Hotels in modern London==\n[[File:Waldorf Hotel 2.jpg|thumb|[[The Waldorf Hilton Hotel London]] in [[Aldwych]]]]\n[[File:Grange Holborn Hotel.jpg|thumb|[[Grange Holborn Hotel]] in [[Holborn]]]]\nThere is no official registry of hotel rooms in London, but the estimated number of hotel rooms in Greater London in 2010 was put at 123,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/329273/hotel-rooms-in-london-to-grow-by-12-by-2012|title=growth of hotel rooms in London}}</ref> According to figures produced in support of [[London 2012 Olympic bid|London's 2012 Olympic bid]], there were more than 70,000 three to five star hotel rooms within 10 kilometres of [[Central London]] in 2003. The main growth was a huge rise in the number of rooms within the [[City of London]], while Kensington and Chelsea actually had a small fall. This is comparing figures since 1981.\nThe main concentration of luxury hotels is in the [[West End of London|West End]], especially in [[Mayfair]] and [[Soho]]. London's five star hotels are quite small on average by international standards. The largest, [[Grosvenor House Hotel]], has only 494 rooms, and eighteen of them have fifty or fewer. The range is very wide, including:\n* Traditional purpose-built grand hotels such as the Ritz, the Savoy and the Dorchester.\n* Recent conversions of grand late 19th and early 20th century office buildings into hotels such as One Aldwych and the Renaissance Chancery Court.\n* Townhouse hotels.\n* Modern purpose-built chain hotels.\n\n'''List of Four-Star Hotels in London'''\n\n[https://www.grandroyalelondon.co.uk/ Grand Royale London Hyde Park],  [https://www.parkgrandlondon.com/ Park Grand London], [https://www.parkinternationalhotel.com/en Park International Hotel], [https://www.shaftesburyhotels.com/ Shaftesbury Hotels] \n\n===List of Five-Star Hotels in London===\nThere are no official bodies that rate hotels.

During the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]], since around 2,000 BC up until the Roman conquests, a large number of necropolises with tumuli, as well as fortified settlements rose along the \u0106ehotina valley, especially around villages of Mataruge, Kakmu\u017ea, Ho\u0107evina and Gotovu\u0161a. The tumuli found in Ljuti\u0107i, Gotovu\u0161a and Borovica have been archeologically researched.\n\n=== Roman era===\nThe first attested tribe in the region was called the [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria#Pirustae|Pirustae]], an Illyrian Pannonian tribe, existed until the Roman invasion in the 1st century AD.{{citation needed|reason=Rome invaded and occupied Illyria in the 2nd century BC, following the Third Illyrian War|date=July 2015}} The Romans had a town built on the ruins of their town, and it was called ''Municipium S'',{{cn|date=August 2017}} located in the Komini neighbourhood.Several hundred artifacts from the Komini necropolis including a unique not damaged  Pljevlja diatreta are kept in the [[Heritage Museum Pljevlja]] the richest museum in Montenegro.The Roman house was found in the necropolis Within the borders of present-day Montenegro, Municipium S \nwas located in the [[ Byzantine Empire ]] it's clear indicates the Pljevlja diatreta inscription \"VIVAS PANELLENI BONA\".The most valuable object is the ''diatreta'' or [[cage cup]], a glass vase trimmed with blue glass threads which is considered to be priceless.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the Middle Ages, the region of Pljevlja was also a part of nucleus of the [[Serbia|Serbian]] state under the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], until the end of the rule of the Emperor [[Stefan Du\u0161an]]. After his death, Pljevlja was under the rule of Serbian autonomous rulers Vojislav Vojinovi\u0107 and [[Nikola Altomanovi\u0107]]. After the defeat of Altomanovi\u0107 1373 by the joint forces of Serbian lord [[Lazar of Serbia|Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]] and [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Bosnian Ban Tvrtko I]], the region of Pljevlja became part of the eastern section of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]], subsequently part of [[Sandalj Hrani\u0107]]'s province and later the [[Duchy of Saint Sava]].\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:Sanjak of Novibazar.png|thumb|Pljevlja was located within the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]]. In 1880 the town became the capital of the Pljevaljski Sanjak (''Sanjak of Ta\u015fl\u0131ca'') of the Ottoman Empire, which existed until the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912.]]\n\nIn 1465, the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered Pljevlja. During the Ottoman offensive, the fortress of Kukanj, the residence of [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]], was destroyed. Fearing an onslaught, many merchants, almost all feudal land owners and wealthier population fled from Pljevlja, seeking refuge in the [[Republic of Venice]], [[Republic of Ragusa]], or further north into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] or [[Austrian Empire]]. In Turkish, the town was known as '''Ta\u015fl\u0131ca''' (\"rocky\").\n\nIn the Ottoman ''[[defter]]'' (census book) of 1475/76, the majority of local inhabitants were [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]], numbering some 101 households. The town was expanded into a ''kasaba'', a larger Ottoman city without a fortress. The 15th and 16th centuries were a period of much construction in the city: in 1465 the [[Holy Trinity Monastery (Pljevlja)|Holy Trinity Monastery]] was founded, in 1569 Husein-pa\u0161a's [[mosque]] was built and during the 16th century the city got a sewage system. When the center of [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] was moved to Pljevlja from Fo\u010da in 1572, the city started to change rapidly: urban housing increased: 72 houses in 1468, 150 in 1516, 300 in 1570; in the 17th century Pljevlja had around 650 houses in the city center and over 400 in the surrounding area. The first Muslim religious school (madrasa), was built in the 17th century; water-works were constructed in the 18th century. The Russian consul visited Pljevlja in the 19th century and wrote that Pljevlja was a very beautiful oriental city with gardens and fountains, mosques and churches and over 800 houses in the city center (7,000 citizens) which made Pljevlja the second largest city in the Herzegovina Sanjak besides [[Mostar]]. After two big fires that burned the city center to the ground, the city's economy was ruined. That was the reason for displacing the center of Herzegovina to [[Mostar]] in 1833. After 1833 the city stagnated in both an economic and cultural sense.\n\nIn 1875, after a failed uprising, mass emigration took place around Pljevlja in the direction of U\u017eice, Valjevo and the Drina river basin.<ref>Jovan Cviji\u0107, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju\u017enoslovenske zemlje, Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud\u017ebenika, 1966, pp. 151-152.</ref>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman control after the Berlin Congress===\nAs a result of the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, Pljevlja and the rest of the [[Sand\u017eak]] region were given to [[Austria-Hungary]], interrupting Ottoman rule in the area for the first time in four centuries. However, by 1879, a special convention between [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] transferred western parts of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] into dual jurisdiction between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. In 1880, Pljevlja was named the capital of the newly formed Sanjak of Pljevlja (in Turkish: ''Ta\u015fl\u0131ca Sanca\u011f\u0131''). Administration remained in Turkish hands, with Austro-Hungarian military presence in the cities of Pljevlja, [[Prijepolje]] and [[Priboj]]. Some 5,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers and their families came to Pljevlja. As a result, Austro-Hungarian businesses expanded in Pljevlja; the first modern drug store was opened in 1879, a photo store in 1892, and a hospital in 1880. The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] built the first brewery in Pljevlja in 1889.<ref name=\"VPP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/drustvo/od-pljevaljskog-ne-ostade-ni-pjena|author=Goran Malid\u017ean|work=[[Vijesti]]|title=''Od \"pljevaljskog\" ne ostade ni pjena''|language=Serbian|date=March 10, 2013|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> The Pljevlja brewery's annual production was limited to 2,000 hectoliters, and demand was greater than what the brewery could produce.<ref name=\"VPP\"/> As a result, the Austro-Hungarian garrison in Pljevlja consumed most of the beer produced there.<ref name=\"VPP\"/> \n\nIn 1901, the [[Pljevlja Gymnasium]] was built by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], with the approval of the Ottoman administration. As a result of the [[Bosnian crisis]], Austria-Hungary withdrew its forces from Pljevlja in 1908. From 1908 to 1912, Pljevlja remained under the control of [[Young Turks]].\nIn the first days of the [[First Balkan War]] Pljevlja was freed on October 26, 1912.\n\n===Incorporation into Montenegro and Yugoslavia===\nOn October 8, 1912, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] was the first of the Balkan states to declare war on the Ottoman Empire, starting the First Balkan War. As a result, territories with significant populations of Serbs and Montenegrins were subject to conflict between the Ottoman occupation and incoming armies of Serbia and Montenegro. This was particularly the case with Sand\u017eak, in which Pljevlja had been wedged in an Ottoman Sanjak between Montenegro and Serbia. By October 28, 1912, Ottoman forces had been completely removed from Pljevlja when the [[Royal Serbian Army]]'s ''Javorska'' brigade arrived, which was accompanied by 150 soldiers from Montenegro.<ref name=\"PCGP\">{{cite web|url=https://adnanprekic.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/politika-crne-gore-u-pljevaljskom-kraju-191213-godine-u-izvjestajima-ministarstava-kraljevine-crne-gore/|author=Adnan Preki\u0107|title=''Politika Crne Gore u pljevaljskom kraju 1912/13 godine u izvje\u0161tajima ministarstava Kraljevine Crne Gore''|language=Serbian|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> With the departure of Ottoman forces, Montenegro and Serbia eliminated the Ottoman \"wedge\" in the Sand\u017eak and now shared a border. On November 13, 1913, a formal border agreement between Serbia and Montenegro was signed by Serbian general Milo\u0161 Bo\u017eanovi\u0107 and Montenegro's Minister of Education and Religious Affairs, Mirko Miju\u0161kovi\u0107. As a result of this agreement, Pljevlja was formally incorporated into the Kingdom of Montenegro.<ref name=\"PCGP\"/> \n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Pljevlja was part of the [[Zeta Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. At the beginning of the [[Second World War]] Pljevlja, like the rest of Sand\u017eak, was occupied by NDH [[Usta\u0161e]] forces. Notable Muslims from Pljevlja, Bijelo Polje and Prijepolje wrote to Paveli\u0107 and expressed their loyalty to the [[Independent State of Croatia]] allegedly in the name of all Muslims of Sandjak.<ref name=\"Kne\u017eevi\u01071969\">{{cite book|last=Kne\u017eevi\u0107|first=Danilo|title=Prilog u krvi: Pljevlja 1941-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekdAAAAAIAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Op\u0161tinski odbor SUBNOR-a<!-- |quote= \u0422\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0458\u0435 15. \u043c\u0430\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0428\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043b>\u0430, \u0411\u044f\u0458\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u041f\u043e\u041b)\u0430 \u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0438]\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043b>\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u0443 \u0438\u043c\u0435 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0430\u043a\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u042c\u0443 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e \u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0438 \u041d\u0414\u0425, ... -->}}</ref> By September 1941 Usta\u0161e left Sand\u017eak which was occupied by Italian forces within [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]].

The city lies at an altitude of {{convert|770|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In the Middle Ages, Pljevlja had been a crossroad of the important commercial roads and cultural streams, with important roads connecting the littoral with the Balkan interior.  In 2011, the municipality of Pljevlja had a population of 30,786, while the city itself had a population of about 19,489. The municipality borders those of [[\u017dabljak]], [[Bijelo Polje]] and [[Mojkovac]] in Montenegro, as well as [[Serbia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to the east and west respectively. With a total area of {{convert|1346|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, it is the third largest municipality in Montenegro.\n\n==History==\n=== Prehistory and antiquity ===\nThe first traces of human life in the region date between 50,000 and 40,000 [[Before Christ|BC]], while reliable findings show that the [[\u0106ehotina|\u0106ehotina River]] valley was inhabited no later than 30,000 BC. The oldest traces of human presence in the town area, a flint tool, had been found in the cave under Gospi\u0107 Peak. The traces of settlements in the later stages of the [[Stone Age]] were found in two large archaeological sites called ''Mali\u0161ina Stijena'' and ''Medena Stijena'' (around 10,000 stone tools and arms), dating to 12,000\u20138,000 BC. During the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]], since around 2,000 BC up until the Roman conquests, a large number of necropolises with tumuli, as well as fortified settlements rose along the \u0106ehotina valley, especially around villages of Mataruge, Kakmu\u017ea, Ho\u0107evina and Gotovu\u0161a. The tumuli found in Ljuti\u0107i, Gotovu\u0161a and Borovica have been archeologically researched.\n\n=== Roman era===\nThe first attested tribe in the region was called the [[List of ancient tribes in Illyria#Pirustae|Pirustae]], an Illyrian Pannonian tribe, existed until the Roman invasion in the 1st century AD.{{citation needed|reason=Rome invaded and occupied Illyria in the 2nd century BC, following the Third Illyrian War|date=July 2015}} The Romans had a town built on the ruins of their town, and it was called ''Municipium S'',{{cn|date=August 2017}} located in the Komini neighbourhood.Several hundred artifacts from the Komini necropolis including a unique not damaged  Pljevlja diatreta are kept in the [[Heritage Museum Pljevlja]] the richest museum in Montenegro.The Roman house was found in the necropolis Within the borders of present-day Montenegro, Municipium S \nwas located in the [[ Byzantine Empire ]] it's clear indicates the Pljevlja diatreta inscription \"VIVAS PANELLENI BONA\".The most valuable object is the ''diatreta'' or [[cage cup]], a glass vase trimmed with blue glass threads which is considered to be priceless.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the Middle Ages, the region of Pljevlja was also a part of nucleus of the [[Serbia|Serbian]] state under the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], until the end of the rule of the Emperor [[Stefan Du\u0161an]]. After his death, Pljevlja was under the rule of Serbian autonomous rulers Vojislav Vojinovi\u0107 and [[Nikola Altomanovi\u0107]]. After the defeat of Altomanovi\u0107 1373 by the joint forces of Serbian lord [[Lazar of Serbia|Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]] and [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Bosnian Ban Tvrtko I]], the region of Pljevlja became part of the eastern section of the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]], subsequently part of [[Sandalj Hrani\u0107]]'s province and later the [[Duchy of Saint Sava]].\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:Sanjak of Novibazar.png|thumb|Pljevlja was located within the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]]. In 1880 the town became the capital of the Pljevaljski Sanjak (''Sanjak of Ta\u015fl\u0131ca'') of the Ottoman Empire, which existed until the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912.]]\n\nIn 1465, the [[Ottoman Empire]] conquered Pljevlja. During the Ottoman offensive, the fortress of Kukanj, the residence of [[Stjepan Vuk\u010di\u0107 Kosa\u010da]], was destroyed. Fearing an onslaught, many merchants, almost all feudal land owners and wealthier population fled from Pljevlja, seeking refuge in the [[Republic of Venice]], [[Republic of Ragusa]], or further north into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] or [[Austrian Empire]]. In Turkish, the town was known as '''Ta\u015fl\u0131ca''' (\"rocky\").\n\nIn the Ottoman ''[[defter]]'' (census book) of 1475/76, the majority of local inhabitants were [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]], numbering some 101 households. The town was expanded into a ''kasaba'', a larger Ottoman city without a fortress. The 15th and 16th centuries were a period of much construction in the city: in 1465 the [[Holy Trinity Monastery (Pljevlja)|Holy Trinity Monastery]] was founded, in 1569 Husein-pa\u0161a's [[mosque]] was built and during the 16th century the city got a sewage system. When the center of [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] was moved to Pljevlja from Fo\u010da in 1572, the city started to change rapidly: urban housing increased: 72 houses in 1468, 150 in 1516, 300 in 1570; in the 17th century Pljevlja had around 650 houses in the city center and over 400 in the surrounding area. The first Muslim religious school (madrasa), was built in the 17th century; water-works were constructed in the 18th century. The Russian consul visited Pljevlja in the 19th century and wrote that Pljevlja was a very beautiful oriental city with gardens and fountains, mosques and churches and over 800 houses in the city center (7,000 citizens) which made Pljevlja the second largest city in the Herzegovina Sanjak besides [[Mostar]]. After two big fires that burned the city center to the ground, the city's economy was ruined. That was the reason for displacing the center of Herzegovina to [[Mostar]] in 1833. After 1833 the city stagnated in both an economic and cultural sense.\n\nIn 1875, after a failed uprising, mass emigration took place around Pljevlja in the direction of U\u017eice, Valjevo and the Drina river basin.<ref>Jovan Cviji\u0107, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju\u017enoslovenske zemlje, Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud\u017ebenika, 1966, pp. 151-152.</ref>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman control after the Berlin Congress===\nAs a result of the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, Pljevlja and the rest of the [[Sand\u017eak]] region were given to [[Austria-Hungary]], interrupting Ottoman rule in the area for the first time in four centuries. However, by 1879, a special convention between [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] transferred western parts of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] into dual jurisdiction between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. In 1880, Pljevlja was named the capital of the newly formed Sanjak of Pljevlja (in Turkish: ''Ta\u015fl\u0131ca Sanca\u011f\u0131''). Administration remained in Turkish hands, with Austro-Hungarian military presence in the cities of Pljevlja, [[Prijepolje]] and [[Priboj]]. Some 5,000 Austro-Hungarian soldiers and their families came to Pljevlja. As a result, Austro-Hungarian businesses expanded in Pljevlja; the first modern drug store was opened in 1879, a photo store in 1892, and a hospital in 1880. The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] built the first brewery in Pljevlja in 1889.<ref name=\"VPP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/drustvo/od-pljevaljskog-ne-ostade-ni-pjena|author=Goran Malid\u017ean|work=[[Vijesti]]|title=''Od \"pljevaljskog\" ne ostade ni pjena''|language=Serbian|date=March 10, 2013|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> The Pljevlja brewery's annual production was limited to 2,000 hectoliters, and demand was greater than what the brewery could produce.<ref name=\"VPP\"/> As a result, the Austro-Hungarian garrison in Pljevlja consumed most of the beer produced there.<ref name=\"VPP\"/> \n\nIn 1901, the [[Pljevlja Gymnasium]] was built by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], with the approval of the Ottoman administration. As a result of the [[Bosnian crisis]], Austria-Hungary withdrew its forces from Pljevlja in 1908. From 1908 to 1912, Pljevlja remained under the control of [[Young Turks]].\nIn the first days of the [[First Balkan War]] Pljevlja was freed on October 26, 1912.\n\n===Incorporation into Montenegro and Yugoslavia===\nOn October 8, 1912, [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] was the first of the Balkan states to declare war on the Ottoman Empire, starting the First Balkan War. As a result, territories with significant populations of Serbs and Montenegrins were subject to conflict between the Ottoman occupation and incoming armies of Serbia and Montenegro. This was particularly the case with Sand\u017eak, in which Pljevlja had been wedged in an Ottoman Sanjak between Montenegro and Serbia. By October 28, 1912, Ottoman forces had been completely removed from Pljevlja when the [[Royal Serbian Army]]'s ''Javorska'' brigade arrived, which was accompanied by 150 soldiers from Montenegro.<ref name=\"PCGP\">{{cite web|url=https://adnanprekic.wordpress.com/2012/12/12/politika-crne-gore-u-pljevaljskom-kraju-191213-godine-u-izvjestajima-ministarstava-kraljevine-crne-gore/|author=Adnan Preki\u0107|title=''Politika Crne Gore u pljevaljskom kraju 1912/13 godine u izvje\u0161tajima ministarstava Kraljevine Crne Gore''|language=Serbian|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}</ref> With the departure of Ottoman forces, Montenegro and Serbia eliminated the Ottoman \"wedge\" in the Sand\u017eak and now shared a border. On November 13, 1913, a formal border agreement between Serbia and Montenegro was signed by Serbian general Milo\u0161 Bo\u017eanovi\u0107 and Montenegro's Minister of Education and Religious Affairs, Mirko Miju\u0161kovi\u0107. As a result of this agreement, Pljevlja was formally incorporated into the Kingdom of Montenegro.<ref name=\"PCGP\"/> \n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Pljevlja was part of the [[Zeta Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. At the beginning of the [[Second World War]] Pljevlja, like the rest of Sand\u017eak, was occupied by NDH [[Usta\u0161e]] forces. Notable Muslims from Pljevlja, Bijelo Polje and Prijepolje wrote to Paveli\u0107 and expressed their loyalty to the [[Independent State of Croatia]] allegedly in the name of all Muslims of Sandjak.<ref name=\"Kne\u017eevi\u01071969\">{{cite book|last=Kne\u017eevi\u0107|first=Danilo|title=Prilog u krvi: Pljevlja 1941-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekdAAAAAIAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Op\u0161tinski odbor SUBNOR-a<!-- |quote= \u0422\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0458\u0435 15. \u043c\u0430\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0430 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0428\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043b>\u0430, \u0411\u044f\u0458\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u041f\u043e\u041b)\u0430 \u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0438]\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043b>\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u0443 \u0438\u043c\u0435 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0430\u043a\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u042c\u0443 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e \u0443 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0438 \u041d\u0414\u0425, ... -->}}</ref> By September 1941 Usta\u0161e left Sand\u017eak which was occupied by Italian forces within [[Italian governorate of Montenegro]]. The [[Battle of Pljevlja]], fought on 1 December 1941 between attacking [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] and the Italian Pljevlja garrison, was the biggest battle of the [[Uprising in Montenegro (1941)|Uprising in Montenegro]]. In April 1942 Italians established a battalion of [[Sand\u017eak Muslim militia]] in [[Metaljka (\u010cajni\u010de)|Metaljka]], near \u010cajni\u010de, composed of about 500 Muslims from villages around Pljevlja and \u010cajni\u010de.

The school in the Holy Trinity Monastery has been working continuously since the 16th century. In 1823, a primary school in Pljevlja started working. The school in Dovolja monastery worked since the 18th century. The very important date in the history of education in Pljevlja is the opening of the [[Pljevaljska Gymnasium]] in 1901.

He was appointed Controller General of Finances of France under the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orleans]], who served as regent for the youthful king, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].\n\nIn 1716 Law established the [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]], a private bank, in France and which, one year later, was nationalised at his request to become the [[Bank of France|Banque Royale]], the first Central [[Bank of France]]. The original private bank was substantially funded by John Law and Louis XV and three-quarters of its [[capital (economics)|capital]] consisted of government bills and government-accepted notes, effectively making it the first [[central bank]] of the nation and was only partially backed by silver making it a [[Fractional-reserve banking|fractional reserve bank]]. He set up and was director of the [[Mississippi Scheme|Mississippi Company]], which was funded by the ''Banque royale.'' Its eventual chaotic collapse in France has been compared to the early-17th century [[tulip mania]] in Holland.<ref name=nyfed/> The Mississippi Bubble was contemporaneous with the [[South Sea Company]] bubble of England which allegedly borrowed ideas from the [[Mississippi Scheme|Mississippi Company]] design.\n\nLaw was a [[gambler]] and a brilliant mental calculator.

Upon leaving the High School of Edinburgh, Law joined the family business at age fourteen and studied the banking business until his father died in 1688.

The first manifestation of [[Law's system]] came when he had returned to Scotland and contributed to the debates leading to the [[Treaty of Union 1707]]. He published a text entitled ''[[Money and Trade Considered|Money and Trade Considered: with a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money]]'' (1705).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Law |first=John |author-link=|year=1750 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Money and Trade Consider'd with a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money, First Published in Edinburgh in 1705 |volume= |edition= |publisher= A.

P.F. Collier Inc, 1978.</ref>\n\nHe spent ten years moving between France and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]], dealing in financial [[speculation]]s. Problems with the French economy presented the opportunity to put his system into practice.\n\nHe had the idea of abolishing minor [[monopoly|monopolies]] and private [[tax farming (France)|farming of taxes]]. He would create a bank for national finance and a state company for commerce, ultimately to exclude all private revenue. This would create a huge monopoly of finance and trade run by the state, and its profits would pay off the [[national debt]]. The council called to consider Law's proposal, including financiers such as [[Samuel Bernard]], rejected the proposition on 24 October 1715.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nLaw made his home in Place Louis-le-Grand, a royal square where he hosted and entertained various Parisian nobles. Gaining the attention of such notable people as the Duke of Orleans, Law quickly found himself a regular in high-stakes gambling parties attended by only the most affluent of Paris. His tall stature and elegant dress allowed Law to charm his way across Europe's financial hubs, from Amsterdam to Venice. These travels heavily influenced Law's theories on monetary policy and the importance of paper money as credit. Law's idea of a centralised bank which would deal in a new form of paper money was years ahead of its time. Despite this forward concept, Law still championed mercantilist beliefs with the promotion of monopolistic companies through government charters.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade |last=Robert |first=Harms |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=43\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThe wars waged by [[Louis XIV]] left the country completely wasted, both economically and financially. The resultant shortage of [[precious metal]]s led to a shortage of coins in circulation, which in turn limited the production of new coins. With the death of Louis XIV seventeen months after Law's arrival, the Duke of Orleans finally presented Law with the opportunity to display his ingenuity. Since, following the devastating [[War of the Spanish Succession]], France's economy was stagnant and her [[national debt]] was crippling, Law proposed to stimulate industry by replacing gold with paper credit and then increasing the supply of credit, and to reduce the national debt by replacing it with shares in economic ventures.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA105 |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy |publisher=Oxford U.

The second key feature of the proposal centred on the premise that this private bank was able to issue its own currency backed by [[Louis d'or|Louis of gold]]. This enabled the currency to be redeemed by the weight of silver from the original deposit instead of the fluctuating value of the [[French livre|livres]] which had been devaluing rapidly.<ref name=\"Velde07\">{{Cite journal |last=Velde |first=Fran\u00e7ois R. |date=May 2007 |title=John Law's System |journal=American Economic Review |volume=97 |issue=2 |jstor=30034460}}</ref>{{rp|277}}\n\nIn May 1716 Law set up the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Priv\u00e9e (\"General Private Bank\"), which developed the use of paper money.<ref>BACKHOUSE, Roger, ''Economists and the economy: the evolution of economic ideas'', Transaction Publishers, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-56000-715-9}}, p. 118</ref>\nIt was one of only six such banks to have issued paper money, joining Sweden, England, Holland, Venice, and Genoa.<ref name=nyfed>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/01/crisis-chronicles-the-mississippi-bubble-of-1720-and-the-european-debt-crisis.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York: \"Crisis Chronicles: The Mississippi Bubble of 1720 and the European Debt Crisis\" (Narron and Skeie)]</ref> The bank was nationalised in December 1718 at Law's request.<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}}\n\nFrom this new banking platform, Law was able to pursue the [[monopoly]] companies he envisioned by having France bankroll the endeavour with 100&nbsp;million ''livres'' in the form of company stock. The founding of the Mississippi Company, later renamed the Occident Company and eventually part of the Company of the Indies, was financed in the same way as the bank.\n\nIn this context the regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]], appointed Law as Controller General of Finances in 1720, effectively giving him control over external and internal commerce. The rapid ascension of this new global monopoly led to massive speculation and stock prices ballooned to over sixty times their original value.\n\nAs Controller General, Law instituted many beneficial reforms (some of which had lasting effect, while others were soon abolished). He tried to break up large land-holdings to benefit the peasants; he abolished internal road and canal tolls; he encouraged the building of new roads, the starting of new industries (even importing artisans but mostly by offering low-interest loans), and the revival of overseas commerce\u2014and indeed industry increased 60% in two years, and the number of French ships engaged in export went from sixteen to three hundred.<ref>Will and Ariel Durant, ''The Age of Voltaire'', Simon & Schuster (1965), p. 13</ref>\n\n===Company of the West===\nLaw became the architect of what would later be known as the [[Mississippi Bubble]], an event that would begin with consolidating the trading companies of [[Louisiana]] into a single monopoly (The Mississippi Company), and ended with the collapse of the [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and subsequent devaluing of the Mississippi Company's shares.\n<blockquote>\nIn 1719, the French government allowed Law to issue 50,000 new shares in the Mississippi Company at 500 livres with just 75 livres down and the rest due in nineteen additional monthly payments of 25 livres each. The share price rose to 1,000 livres before the second instalment was even due, and ordinary citizens flocked to Paris to participate.<ref name=nyfed/>\n</blockquote>\nIn October 1719 Law's Company lent the French state 1.5 billion livres at 3% to pay off the national debt, a transaction funded by issuing a further 300,000 shares in the company.<ref name=\"RSA91\">{{Cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Lawrence |last2=Congdon |first2=Tim |date=January 1991 |title=John Law and the invention of paper money |journal=RSA Journal |volume=139 |issue=5414 |jstor=41375433}}</ref>{{rp|919}}<ref name=nyfed/>\n\nBetween May and December 1719 the market price of a share rose from 500 to 10,000 livres<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}} and continued rising into early 1720, supported by Law's 4% dividend promise.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|143\u20134}} Under rapidly emerging price inflation,<ref name=nyfed/> Law sought to hold the share price at 9,000 livres in March 1720, and then on 21 May 1720 to engineer a controlled reduction in the value of both notes and the shares, a measure that was itself reversed 6 days later.<ref name=\"RSA91\"/>{{rp|920}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hayek |first=F A |title=The Trend of Economic Thinking |year=1991 |publisher=Liberty Fund |isbn=9780865977426 |page=162}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|147}} \n<blockquote>\nAs the public rushed to convert banknotes to coin, Law was forced to close the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for ten days, then limit the transaction size once the bank reopened.

By May 1720, prices fell to 4,000 livres per share, a 73% decrease within a year. The rush to convert paper money to coins led to sporadic bank hours and riots. Squatters now occupied the square of Palace Louis-le-Grand and openly attacked the financiers that inhabited the area. It was under these circumstances and the cover of night that John Law left Paris some seven months later, leaving all of his substantial property assets in France, including the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] and at least twenty-one Chateaux which he had purchased over his years in Paris, for the repayment of creditors.\n\nThe descent of a relatively unknown man came as fast as his rise, leaving an economic power vacuum. Law's theories live on 300 years later and \"captured many key conceptual points which are very much a part of modern monetary theorizing\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA1&lpg=PP1&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy|publisher=Oxford U.

He was appointed Controller General of Finances of France under the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orleans]], who served as regent for the youthful king, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].\n\nIn 1716 Law established the [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]], a private bank, in France and which, one year later, was nationalised at his request to become the [[Bank of France|Banque Royale]], the first Central [[Bank of France]]. The original private bank was substantially funded by John Law and Louis XV and three-quarters of its [[capital (economics)|capital]] consisted of government bills and government-accepted notes, effectively making it the first [[central bank]] of the nation and was only partially backed by silver making it a [[Fractional-reserve banking|fractional reserve bank]]. He set up and was director of the [[Mississippi Scheme|Mississippi Company]], which was funded by the ''Banque royale.''

The first manifestation of [[Law's system]] came when he had returned to Scotland and contributed to the debates leading to the [[Treaty of Union 1707]].

P.F. Collier Inc, 1978.</ref>\n\nHe spent ten years moving between France and the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]], dealing in financial [[speculation]]s. Problems with the French economy presented the opportunity to put his system into practice.\n\nHe had the idea of abolishing minor [[monopoly|monopolies]] and private [[tax farming (France)|farming of taxes]]. He would create a bank for national finance and a state company for commerce, ultimately to exclude all private revenue. This would create a huge monopoly of finance and trade run by the state, and its profits would pay off the [[national debt]]. The council called to consider Law's proposal, including financiers such as [[Samuel Bernard]], rejected the proposition on 24 October 1715.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nLaw made his home in Place Louis-le-Grand, a royal square where he hosted and entertained various Parisian nobles. Gaining the attention of such notable people as the Duke of Orleans, Law quickly found himself a regular in high-stakes gambling parties attended by only the most affluent of Paris. His tall stature and elegant dress allowed Law to charm his way across Europe's financial hubs, from Amsterdam to Venice. These travels heavily influenced Law's theories on monetary policy and the importance of paper money as credit. Law's idea of a centralised bank which would deal in a new form of paper money was years ahead of its time. Despite this forward concept, Law still championed mercantilist beliefs with the promotion of monopolistic companies through government charters.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade |last=Robert |first=Harms |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=43\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThe wars waged by [[Louis XIV]] left the country completely wasted, both economically and financially. The resultant shortage of [[precious metal]]s led to a shortage of coins in circulation, which in turn limited the production of new coins. With the death of Louis XIV seventeen months after Law's arrival, the Duke of Orleans finally presented Law with the opportunity to display his ingenuity. Since, following the devastating [[War of the Spanish Succession]], France's economy was stagnant and her [[national debt]] was crippling, Law proposed to stimulate industry by replacing gold with paper credit and then increasing the supply of credit, and to reduce the national debt by replacing it with shares in economic ventures.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA105 |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy |publisher=Oxford U.

This enabled the currency to be redeemed by the weight of silver from the original deposit instead of the fluctuating value of the [[French livre|livres]] which had been devaluing rapidly.<ref name=\"Velde07\">{{Cite journal |last=Velde |first=Fran\u00e7ois R. |date=May 2007 |title=John Law's System |journal=American Economic Review |volume=97 |issue=2 |jstor=30034460}}</ref>{{rp|277}}\n\nIn May 1716 Law set up the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Priv\u00e9e (\"General Private Bank\"), which developed the use of paper money.<ref>BACKHOUSE, Roger, ''Economists and the economy: the evolution of economic ideas'', Transaction Publishers, 1994, {{ISBN|978-1-56000-715-9}}, p. 118</ref>\nIt was one of only six such banks to have issued paper money, joining Sweden, England, Holland, Venice, and Genoa.<ref name=nyfed>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2014/01/crisis-chronicles-the-mississippi-bubble-of-1720-and-the-european-debt-crisis.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York: \"Crisis Chronicles: The Mississippi Bubble of 1720 and the European Debt Crisis\" (Narron and Skeie)]</ref> The bank was nationalised in December 1718 at Law's request.<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}}\n\nFrom this new banking platform, Law was able to pursue the [[monopoly]] companies he envisioned by having France bankroll the endeavour with 100&nbsp;million ''livres'' in the form of company stock. The founding of the Mississippi Company, later renamed the Occident Company and eventually part of the Company of the Indies, was financed in the same way as the bank.\n\nIn this context the regent, [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans]], appointed Law as Controller General of Finances in 1720, effectively giving him control over external and internal commerce. The rapid ascension of this new global monopoly led to massive speculation and stock prices ballooned to over sixty times their original value.\n\nAs Controller General, Law instituted many beneficial reforms (some of which had lasting effect, while others were soon abolished). He tried to break up large land-holdings to benefit the peasants; he abolished internal road and canal tolls; he encouraged the building of new roads, the starting of new industries (even importing artisans but mostly by offering low-interest loans), and the revival of overseas commerce\u2014and indeed industry increased 60% in two years, and the number of French ships engaged in export went from sixteen to three hundred.<ref>Will and Ariel Durant, ''The Age of Voltaire'', Simon & Schuster (1965), p. 13</ref>\n\n===Company of the West===\nLaw became the architect of what would later be known as the [[Mississippi Bubble]], an event that would begin with consolidating the trading companies of [[Louisiana]] into a single monopoly (The Mississippi Company), and ended with the collapse of the [[Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale]] and subsequent devaluing of the Mississippi Company's shares.\n<blockquote>\nIn 1719, the French government allowed Law to issue 50,000 new shares in the Mississippi Company at 500 livres with just 75 livres down and the rest due in nineteen additional monthly payments of 25 livres each. The share price rose to 1,000 livres before the second instalment was even due, and ordinary citizens flocked to Paris to participate.<ref name=nyfed/>\n</blockquote>\nIn October 1719 Law's Company lent the French state 1.5 billion livres at 3% to pay off the national debt, a transaction funded by issuing a further 300,000 shares in the company.<ref name=\"RSA91\">{{Cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Lawrence |last2=Congdon |first2=Tim |date=January 1991 |title=John Law and the invention of paper money |journal=RSA Journal |volume=139 |issue=5414 |jstor=41375433}}</ref>{{rp|919}}<ref name=nyfed/>\n\nBetween May and December 1719 the market price of a share rose from 500 to 10,000 livres<ref name=\"Velde07\"/>{{rp|277}} and continued rising into early 1720, supported by Law's 4% dividend promise.<ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|143\u20134}} Under rapidly emerging price inflation,<ref name=nyfed/> Law sought to hold the share price at 9,000 livres in March 1720, and then on 21 May 1720 to engineer a controlled reduction in the value of both notes and the shares, a measure that was itself reversed 6 days later.<ref name=\"RSA91\"/>{{rp|920}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hayek |first=F A |title=The Trend of Economic Thinking |year=1991 |publisher=Liberty Fund |isbn=9780865977426 |page=162}}</ref><ref name=\"Buchan97\"/>{{rp|147}} \n<blockquote>\nAs the public rushed to convert banknotes to coin, Law was forced to close the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for ten days, then limit the transaction size once the bank reopened. But the queues grew longer, the Mississippi Company stock price continued to fall, and food prices soared by as much as 60 percent.<ref name=nyfed/>\n</blockquote>\nThe fractional reserve ratio was one fifth,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (5:55 of 9:44)</ref> and a Royal edict to criminalise the sale of gold was decreed.<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (6:45 of 9:44)</ref> A later Royal edict decreed that gold coin was illegal,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (7:35 of 9:44)</ref> which was soon reversed,<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (7:55 of 9:44)</ref> leading 50 people to be stampeded to death.<ref>\"John Law and the Mississippi Company\" (8:00 of 9:44)</ref> The company's shares were ultimately rendered worthless, and initially inflated speculation about their worth led to widespread financial stress, which saw Law dismissed at the end of 1720 from his sinecure as Controller General<ref name=nyfed/> and his post as Chief Director of the Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\n===Downfall===\nSpeculation gave way to panic as people flooded the market with future shares trading as high as fifteen thousand livres per share, while the shares themselves maintained at ten thousand livres each. By May 1720, prices fell to 4,000 livres per share, a 73% decrease within a year. The rush to convert paper money to coins led to sporadic bank hours and riots. Squatters now occupied the square of Palace Louis-le-Grand and openly attacked the financiers that inhabited the area. It was under these circumstances and the cover of night that John Law left Paris some seven months later, leaving all of his substantial property assets in France, including the [[Place Vend\u00f4me]] and at least twenty-one Chateaux which he had purchased over his years in Paris, for the repayment of creditors.\n\nThe descent of a relatively unknown man came as fast as his rise, leaving an economic power vacuum. Law's theories live on 300 years later and \"captured many key conceptual points which are very much a part of modern monetary theorizing\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kduEtlToecC&pg=PA1&lpg=PP1&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |title=John Law |author=Antoin E Murphy|publisher=Oxford U.

Law realised he would never return to France when Orl\u00e9ans died suddenly in 1723 and Law was granted permission to return to London, having received a pardon in 1719. He lived in London for four years and then moved to Venice, where he contracted [[pneumonia]] and died as a poor man in 1729.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[Sharon Condie]] and [[Richard Condie]]'s 1978 [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) [[animated short]] ''John Law and the Mississippi Bubble'' is a humorous interpretation.
