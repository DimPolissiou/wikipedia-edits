He also edited and published compilations of his work, which greatly influenced [[visual artist]]s and the developing fields of scientific and industrial photography. He returned to his native England permanently in 1894. In 1904, [[Kingston Museum]] was opened in his hometown and continues to house a collection of his works to this day in a dedicated 'Muybridge Exhibition'. \n\n== Names ==\nEdward James Muggeridge was born and raised in England.

From 1855 to 1865, he mainly used the surname \"Muygridge\".{{sfn|Solnit|2003|p=7|ps=}}\n\nFrom 1865 onward, he used the surname \"Muybridge\". \n\nIn addition, he used the [[pseudonym]] ''[[Helios]]'' (Titan of the sun) for his early photography.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

Mid-October 1874, Muybridge learned how serious the relationship between his wife and Larkyns really was. Flora's maternity nurse revealed many details and had  in her possession some love letters that the couple still had been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with \"Harry\" written on the back in Flora's handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be Larkyns'.\n\nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, \"Here's the answer to the letter you sent my wife\", and shot him [[point-blank]].

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public.

The human eye could not fully break down the action at the quick gaits of the trot and gallop. Up until this time, most artists painted horses at a trot with one foot always on the ground; and at a full gallop with the front legs extended forward and the hind legs extended to the rear, and all feet off the ground.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com/muybridge.html |title=Eadweard Muybridge and His Influence on Horse Art |publisher=Your-guide-to-gifts-for-horse-lovers.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Muybridge eventually managed to shoot a small and very fuzzy picture of Occident running in 1873. They agreed it lacked quality, but Stanford was enthused to finally have a reliable depiction of a running horse. No copy of the image has yet resurfaced. Muybridge promised to study better solutions.\n\nIn July 1877, Muybridge made a new picture of Occident at full speed, with improved techniques and a much clearer result. To enhance the still fuzzy picture, it was recreated by a retouche artist and published as a cabinet card. The news about this breakthrough in [[snapshot (photography)|instantaneous photography]] was spread enthusiastically, but several critics believed the heavily manipulated image could not be a truthful depiction of the horse. Muybridge allowed reporters to study the original negative, but he and Stanford planned to work on a project that would convince everyone, so they saw no need to proof that this image was authentic. The original negative has not yet resurfaced.\n\nIn June 1878, Muybridge created sequential series of photographs with a battery of 12 cameras along the race track at Stanford's [[Palo Alto Stock Farm Horse Barn|Palo Alto Stock Farm]] (now the campus of [[Stanford University]]). The shutters were automatically triggered when the wheel of a card or the breast or legs of a horse tripped wires connected to an electro-magnetic circuit. For a session 15 June 1878, the press and a selection of turfmen were invited to witness the process. An accident with a snapping strap was captured on the negatives and shown to the attendees, convincing even the most skeptical witnesses. The news of this success was reported worldwide. \n\n''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' reported that Muybridge first exhibited magic lantern slides of the photographs at the [[San Francisco Art Association]] on 8 July 1878.<ref>{{cite news |title=Muybridge's Photographs |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18780709.2.15&srpos=16&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-muybridge-------1 |accessdate=26 July 2018 |volume=XXX|issue=10315 |page=1|publisher=[[Daily Alta California]] |date=9 July 1878}}</ref> Six different series were soon published, as cabinet cards entitled ''[[The Horse in Motion]]''.

Flora's maternity nurse revealed many details and had  in her possession some love letters that the couple still had been writing to each other. At her place, Muybridge also came across a picture of Florado with \"Harry\" written on the back in Flora's handwriting, suggesting that she believed the child to be Larkyns'.\n\nOn 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns.

The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background in a variety of action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as [[baseball]], [[cricket]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[discus throwing]], and a [[ballet]] dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some of the photographic sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.<ref name=\"Shimamura\"/><ref name=\"Leslie\"/>\n[[File:Muybridge horse jumping animated.gif|left|thumb|Classic animation by Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping]]\n\nBetween 1883 and 1886, Muybridge made more than 100,000 images, working obsessively in Philadelphia under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania. During 1884, the painter [[Thomas Eakins]] briefly worked alongside him, to learn more about the application of photography to the study of human and animal motion. Eakins later favored the use of [[multiple exposure]]s superimposed on a single photographic negative to study motion more precisely, while Muybridge continued to use multiple cameras to produce separate images which could also be projected by his zoopraxiscope.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=93|ps=}} The vast majority of Muybridge's work at this time was done in a special sunlit outdoor studio, due to the bulky cameras and slow photographic emulsion speeds then available. Toward the end of this period, Muybridge spent much of his time selecting and editing his photos in preparation for publication.\n\nIn 1887, the photos were published as a massive portfolio, with 781 plates comprising 20,000 of the photographs, in a groundbreaking collection titled ''Animal Locomotion: an Electro-Photographic Investigation of Connective Phases of Animal Movements''.<ref name=\"UPennArchive\">[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html Selected Items from the Eadweard Muybridge Collection (University of Pennsylvania Archives and Records Center)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072501/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upt/upt50/upt50m993/upt50m993.html |date=16 December 2008 }} \"The Eadweard Muybridge Collection at the University of Pennsylvania Archives contains 702 of the 784 plates in his Animal Locomotion study\"</ref> Muybridge's work contributed substantially to developments in the science of [[biomechanics]] and the mechanics of athletics.

In 1881, Muybridge first visited Marey's studio in France and viewed stop-motion studies before returning to the US to further his own work in the same area.{{sfn|Brookman|2010|p=91|ps=}} Marey was a pioneer in producing multiple-exposure, sequential images using a rotary shutter in his so-called \"Marey wheel\" camera.\n\nWhile Marey's scientific achievements in the realms of [[cardiology]] and [[aerodynamics]] (as well as pioneering work in [[photography]] and [[chronophotography]]) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, in some of his published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order to illustrate a representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).<ref name=Adam14>{{cite book|editor-last=Adam|editor-first=Hans Christian|title=Eadweard Muybridge, the human and animal locomotion photographs|year=2010|publisher=Taschen|location=K\u00f6ln|isbn=978-3-8365-0941-1|page=14|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIVePgAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\nToday, similar setups of carefully timed multiple cameras are used in modern [[special effects]] photography, but they have the opposite goal of capturing changing camera angles, with little or no movement of the subject. This is often dubbed \"[[bullet time]]\" photography.\n\nAfter his work at the University of Pennsylvania, Muybridge travelled widely and gave numerous lectures and demonstrations of his still photography and primitive motion picture sequences. At the Chicago [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, Muybridge presented a series of lectures on the \"Science of Animal Locomotion\" in the Zoopraxographical Hall, built specially for that purpose in the \"Midway Plaisance\" arm of the exposition. He used his zoopraxiscope to show his [[film|moving pictures]] to a paying public.

He returned to the US once more, in 1896\u20131897, to settle financial affairs and to dispose of property related to his work at the University of Pennsylvania.

It has four pages, each with a 4:3 grid, and each displaying the current time and date. Available applications, known as \"channels\", are displayed and can be navigated using the pointer capability of the [[Wii Remote]]. The grid is customizable; users can move channels (except for the Disc Channel) among the menu's 47 customizable slots by pressing and holding the A and B button while hovering over the channel the user wants to move. By pressing the plus and minus buttons on the Wii Remote users can scroll across accessing empty slots.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Pre-installed channels==\n\n===Disc Channel===\nThe ''Disc Channel'' allows users to play [[Wii]] and [[GameCube]] titles from supported [[Nintendo optical disc]]s inserted into the console.\n\nIf no disc is inserted, the message \"Please insert a disc.\" will be displayed along with images of a template Wii and GameCube disc (Except for the [[Wii Mini|Wii mini]] or the [[Wii U]], where only the Wii disc is shown due to lack of GameCube support). The \"Start\" button will also remain deactivated until a playable disc is inserted.\n\nWhen a disc is inserted, the channel preview and banner on the menu will change to the one supplied by the title and the \"Start\" button will become available. If it is a GameCube disc, the banner and preview will change to the GameCube logo with the GameCube startup theme playing on the preview.\n\nEach Wii game disc includes a system update partition, which includes the latest Wii software from the time the game was released. If a disc is inserted that contains newer software than installed on the console, installing the new software will be required to play the game. This allows users without an internet connection to still receive system updates. When loaded into the disc slot, an icon on the Disc Channel that says \"Wii System Update\" appears. After selecting the channel, the Wii will automatically update. If these updates are not installed, the game will remain unplayable until the update is installed, as each time the channel is loaded with the game inserted, the update prompt will appear, and declining the update will return the player to the Wii Menu instead of starting the game. (Note: This is the only channel that cannot be moved across the Wii Menu without the use of third party tools.)  The games which display \"Wii System Update\" can still be played without updating using [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] software, such as Gecko OS or a USB loader.\n\n===Mii Channel===\n{{main article|Mii}}\n\nThe ''Mii Channel'' is an [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]] creator, where users can design 3D [[caricatures]] of people called Miis by selecting from a group of facial and bodily features. At the Game Developers Conference 2007, Shigeru Miyamoto explained that the look and design of the Mii characters are based on [[Kokeshi]], a form of Japanese doll used as souvenir gifts.\n\nA ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' interview of [[Katsuya Eguchi]] (producer of ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Wii Sports]]'') held in 2006 confirmed that the custom player avatar feature shown at Nintendo's E3 Media Briefing would be included in the hardware. The feature was described as part of a \"profile\" system that contains the Mii and other pertinent player information.<ref name=\"caricature\">{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/index.blog?entry_id=1493873|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826090030/http://blog.wired.com/games/index.blog?entry_id=1493873|archivedate=August 26, 2006|title=Confirmed: Wii Hardware Stores Player Caricatures, Profiles|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=June 3, 2006|first=Chris|last=Kohler}}</ref> This application was officially unveiled by Nintendo in September 2006. It is incorporated into Wii's operating system interface as the \"''Mii Channel''\". Users can select from pre-made Miis or create their own by choosing custom facial shapes, colors, and positioning. In certain games like ''[[Wii Sports]]'', ''[[Wii Play]]'', ''[[Wii Fit]]'', ''[[Wii Sports Resort]]'', ''[[Wii Party]]'', ''[[Wii Fit Plus]]'', ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'', ''[[WarioWare: Smooth Moves]]'', ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', ''[[Mario Party 8]]'', ''[[My Pok\u00e9mon Ranch]]'', ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]'', ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]'', and ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'', each player's Mii will serve as the character he/she controls in some/all forms of gameplay. Miis can interact with other Wii users by showing up on their Wii consoles through the [[WiiConnect24]] feature or by talking with other Miis created by Wii owners all over the world. This feature is called Mii Parade. Early-created Miis as well as those encountered in Mii Parades may show up as spectators in some games.<ref name=\"IGN Wii Channels\">{{cite news|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/732/732745p1.html|title=Wii Channel Breakdown|access-date=September 16, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428150140/http://wii.ign.com/articles/732/732745p1.html|archive-date=April 28, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Miis can be stored on Wii Remotes and taken to other Wii consoles. The Wii Remote can hold a maximum of 10 Miis.\n\nIn addition, Mii characters can be transferred from a user's Wii to [[Nintendo 3DS]] consoles, as well as supported [[Nintendo DS]] games via the Mii Channel. While in the channel, pressing A, followed by B, then 1, and holding 2 on the Wii Remote allows the user to unlock the feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/11049|title=Wii to DS Connection Found in Mii Channel|publisher=Cubed3}}</ref> The Mii Channel is succeeded by the Mii Maker app for both Nintendo 3DS and [[Wii U]], and the Mii options in Settings for [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\nAccording to Nintendo president [[Satoru Iwata]], over 160 million Mii characters had been created using the \u2018\u2019Mii Channel\u2019\u2019 as of May 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-throwing-wii-party-160-million-miis-made/1100-6261573/ |title=Nintendo throwing Wii Party, 160 million Miis made |first=Tor |last=Thorsen |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=May 7, 2010 |accessdate=October 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Photo Channel===\nIf a user inserts an [[Secure Digital card|SD card]] into the console, or receives photos ([[JPEG]]) or videos ([[MJPEG]]) via email, they can be viewed using the ''Photo Channel''. The user can create a slideshow simply by inserting an SD card with photos and, optionally, MP3 or AAC files (see [[#Photo Channel 1.1|note]] regarding December 10, 2007 update to version 1.1).  The Wii will automatically add [[Ken Burns Effect]] transitions between the photos and play either the music on the SD card or built-in music in the background. A built-in editor allows users to add markings and effects to their photos or videos (The edits float statically above the videos). Mosaics can also be created with this feature. Puzzles can be created from photos or videos with varying degrees of difficulty (However, your first puzzle will be six-pieces) with 6, 12, 24 and 48 piece puzzles available, with 192 selectable while holding down 1 on the Wii remote. Edited photos can be saved to the Wii and sent to other Wiis via the message board. According to the system's manual, the following file extensions (i.e. formats) are supported: Photos (jpeg/jpg), Movies (mov/avi), and Music (mp3/aac).\n\nJPEG files can be up to 8192x8192 resolution and in baseline format.<ref name=\"File types compatible with the Photo Channel\">{{cite web| url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/sdCards.jsp#file_types |title=File types compatible with the Photo Channel|accessdate=January 16, 2007}}</ref> Video data contained within the .mov or .avi files must be in an [[OpenDML]] compliant [[MotionJPEG]] use some variant of this format for their videos.<ref name=\"Video Formats compatible with the Photo Channel\">{{cite web| url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/compatibleMovie.jsp |title=Known Compatible Devices \u2013 Movie Files|accessdate=January 16, 2007}}</ref> Photos, even high resolution ones, are compressed and decreased in resolution.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/748/748526p3.html|title=IGN: Wii Thoughts and Suggestions<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|access-date=December 4, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225102923/http://wii.ign.com/articles/748/748526p3.html|archive-date=February 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Photo Channel 1.1====\n''Photo Channel 1.1'' is an optional update to the ''Photo Channel'' that became available on the Wii Shop Channel on December 10, 2007. It allows users to customize the Photo Channel icon on the Wii Menu with photos from an SD Card or the Wii Message Board. It also allows playback of songs in random order.

Users could browse in the [[Virtual Console]], [[WiiWare]], or Wii Channels sections for downloads. A feature to purchase downloaded software as gifts for others became available worldwide on December 10, 2007. Additional channels that were not released at the console's launch were available for purchase in the Wii Shop Channel. These included: [[Internet Channel]], [[Everybody Votes Channel]], [[Check Mii Out Channel]], [[Nintendo Channel]], [[Netflix|Netflix Channel]], and the Japan-only [[Television Friend Channel]]. Until the channel's shut down on January 30, 2019, all downloadable channels were free of charge.\n\nNintendo discontinued the Wii Shop Channel on January 30, 2019 (having announced that they planned to do so on September 29, 2017), with the purchase of Wii Points ending on March 26, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/News/2017/September/Important-information-about-the-closure-of-the-Wii-Shop-Channel-1285994.html|title=Important information about the closure of the Wii Shop Channel|website=Nintendo of Europe GmbH}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wii-shop-channel-is-closing-down/1100-6453682/|title=Wii Shop Channel Is Closing Down|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|date=September 29, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The ability to redownload and transfer content to the Wii U remains available.\n\n===Forecast Channel===\nThe ''Forecast Channel'' allowed weather reports and forecasts to be shown on the console from the Internet via the [[WiiConnect24]] service.

The ''Forecast Channel'' first became available on December 19, 2006. Certain games like ''[[Madden NFL 07]]'', ''[[Nights: Journey of Dreams]]'', and ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'' could use the ''Forecast Channel'' to simulate weather conditions depending on the player's region.<ref name=\"maddenweather\">{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/Madden_NFL_07_Wii/4524-9993_7-31861374.html|title=Madden NFL 07 (Wii)|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=November 19, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120524093132/http://reviews.cnet.com/Madden_NFL_07_Wii/4524-9993_7-31861374.html|archivedate=May 24, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere are slight variations of ''Forecast Channel'' versions in different regions.

It contains an informational video specifying the benefits of connecting the Wii console to the Internet, such as downloading extra channels, new software, [[Virtual Console]] titles, and playing games over [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]].\n\nThe ''Get Connected Video Channel'' is the only pre-installed channel that takes up spare internal memory, and the only channel that can be manually deleted or moved to an [[SD Card]] by the user. The channel takes up 1,180 blocks of memory, which is over half the Wii's internal memory space. The large size of this channel is likely due to the fact it is available in multiple languages; three videos in the U.S. versions, and six videos in the PAL versions. Upon connecting to the Internet and running the channel, the user will be asked if they would like to delete it. It cannot be re-downloaded or restored upon deletion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/channelsWiiInternetVideo.jsp |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122214542/http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/channelsWiiInternetVideo.jsp |archive-date=November 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe same video presentation contained in the channel can also be viewed on an archived version of Nintendo's official website.<ref>[https://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/internet Wii Official Site - Enhance Your Wii] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127153746/https://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/internet |date=November 27, 2011 }}.

Unlike the other channels, the video in the channel is not translated digitally, but is presented in multiple dubs, which means there are multiple copies of the same video in a single channel. The language of the video is presented is respectively according to the Wii's language setting. Available languages are [[English language|English]], [[French Language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in the U.S. versions; and [[British English|English]], French, [[Castilian Spanish|Spanish]], German, Italian, and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in the PAL version. The availability of multiple dubs is a likely factor that contributes to the large size of the channel.\n\n===Internet Channel===\n{{main article|Internet Channel}}\nThe ''Internet Channel'' is a version of the [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] [[web browser]] for use on the [[Wii]] by [[Opera Software]] and [[Nintendo]].<ref>[http://www.consolewatcher.com/2006/05/confirmed-Wii-will-be-using-the-opera-browser/ Wii will be using the opera browser] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206164453/http://www.consolewatcher.com/2006/05/confirmed-wii-will-be-using-the-opera-browser/ |date=February 6, 2007 }} ''Console Watcher''</ref> On December 22, 2006 a free demo version (promoted as \"Internet Channel: Trial Version\") of the browser was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.operasoftware.com/press/releases/devices/the-opera-browser-for-wii-launches-just-in-time-for-the-holidays|title=The Opera browser for Wii launches just in time for the holidays - Opera|website=www.operasoftware.com}}</ref> The final version (promoted as \"Internet Channel: Final Version\") of the browser was released on April 11, 2007 and was free to download until June 30, 2007.

A refund was issued to those who paid for the channel in the form of one free NES game download worth 500 Wii Points.\n\nThe ''Internet Channel'' uses whichever connection is chosen in the Wii settings, and utilizes the user's internet connection directly; there is no third party network that traffic is being routed through. It receives a connection from a router/modem and uses a web browser to pull up HTTP and HTTPS (secure and encrypted) web pages. Opera, the Wii's web browser, is capable of rendering most web sites in the same manner as its desktop counterpart by using Opera's Medium Screen Rendering technology. For most Internet users, the Wii offers all of the functionality they need to perform the most common Internet tasks.\n\nThe software is saved to the Wii's 512 MB internal flash memory (it can be copied to an [[Secure Digital card|SD card]] after it has been downloaded). The temporary Internet files (maximum of 5MB for the trial version) can only be saved to the Wii's internal memory. The application launches within a few seconds, after connecting to the Internet through a [[Wi-Fi|wireless]] [[LAN]] using the built-in interface or a [[Ethernet|wired]] LAN by using the [[USB]] to the Ethernet adapter.\n\nThe Opera-based Wii browser allows users full access to the Internet and supports all the same web standards that are included in the desktop versions of Opera, including [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[JavaScript|Java]]. It is also possible for the browser to use technologies such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], [[SVG]], [[RSS]], and [[Adobe Flash Player]] 8 and limited support for Adobe Flash Player 9. Opera Software has indicated that the functionality will allow for third parties to create web applications specifically designed for the use on the Wii Browser, and it will support [[Widget engine|widgets]], standalone web-based applications using Opera as an application platform.<ref name=\"Widgets\">{{cite web| url=http://www.opera.com/company/investors/finance/2006/2Q06_presentation.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016122630/http://www.opera.com/company/investors/finance/2006/2Q06_presentation.pdf| archivedate=October 16, 2006| title=Second quarter 2006 Financial Presentation| publisher=Opera Software }}</ref>\n\n===Everybody Votes Channel===\n{{main article|Everybody Votes Channel}}\n''Everybody Votes Channel'' allowed users to vote in simple opinion polls and compare and contrast opinions with those of friends, family, and people across the globe.\n\n''Everybody Votes Channel'' was launched on February 13, 2007, and was available in the Wii Channels section of the Wii Shop Channel. The application allowed Wii owners to vote on various questions using their [[Mii]] as a registered voter. Additionally, voters were also able to make predictions for the choice that will be the most popular overall after their own vote has been cast. Each Mii's voting and prediction record is tracked and voters can also view how their opinions compare to others. Whether the Mii is correct in its predictions or not is displayed on a statistics page along with a counter of how many times that Mii has voted. Up to six Miis would be registered to vote on the console. The channel was free to download. Each player would make a suggestion for a poll a day.\n\nLike the other four Wii channels{{clarify|date=August 2019}}, the Everybody Votes Channel ended its seven-year support on June 27, 2013 due to Nintendo shifting its resources to its next generation projects. Unlike the other discontinued channels, Everybody Votes Channel remains accessible with users able to view the latest poll data posted, albeit the channel will never be updated again. \n===Check Mii Out Channel===\n{{main article|Check Mii Out Channel}}\n\nThe ''Check Mii Out Channel'' (also known as the ''Mii Contest Channel in Australia and Europe'') was a channel that allowed players to share their Miis and enter them into popularity contests. It was first available on November 11, 2007. It was available free to download from the [[Wii Channels]] section of the [[Wii Shop Channel]].\n\nUsers would post their own Miis in the Posting Plaza, or import other user-submitted Miis to their own personal Mii Parade. Each submitted Mii was assigned a 12-digit entry number to aid in searching. Submitted Miis were given 2 initials by their creator and a notable skill/talent to aid in sorting.\n\nIn the Contests section, players submitted their own Miis to compete in contests to best fit a certain description (e.g. [[Mario]] without his cap). After the time period for sending a Mii had expired, the user had the choice of voting for three Miis featured on the judging panel, with ten random Miis being shown at a time. Once the judging period is over, the results of the contest may be viewed. Their selection and/or submission's popularity in comparison to others was displayed, as well as the winning Mii and user.\n\nThe Check Mii Out Channel sent messages to the Wii Message Board concerning recent contests. Participants in certain contests would add their user and submitted Mii to a photo with a background related to the contest theme. This picture would then be sent to the Wii Message Board.\n\nThis channel ended its seven-year support on June 27, 2013 like the four other channels{{clarify|date=August 2019}}.\n\n===Nintendo Channel===\n{{main article|Nintendo Channel}}\n\nThe ''Nintendo Channel'' (also known as the '''Everybody's Nintendo Channel''' in Japan) allowed [[Wii]] users to watch videos such as interviews, trailers, commercials, and even download [[Game demo|demos]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. In this capacity the channel worked in a similar way to the [[DS Download Station]]. The channel provided games, info, pages and users could rate games that they have played. A search feature was also available to assist users in finding new games to try or buy. The channel had the ability to take the user directly into the Wii Shop Channel for buying the wanted game immediately.

However, the European version was missing some of these new additional features, such as options for choosing video quality. In addition, a weekly show known as ''[[Nintendo Week]]'' began airing exclusively on the North American edition of the channel, while another show ''Nintendo TV'', was available on the UK version of the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=249788|title=ONM launches Nintendo TV|author=Thomas East|publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames}}</ref>\n\nThe Nintendo Channel and the other 4 channels{{clarify|date=August 2019}} ended their seven-year support on June 27, 2013.\n\nA few shows appeared on Nintendo Channel which were no more than 20 minutes long:\n\n'''Nintendo Week'''\n\nNintendo Week was a show on the Nintendo Channel.

The channel allows them to view and compare their results, and those of others, as well as their progress in the game, without requiring the game disc to be inserted.\n\nThe channel is essentially a stripped down version of ''[[Wii Fit]]''. It allows users to view statistics from the game including users' [[Body mass index|BMI]] measurements and balance test scores in the form of a line graph, as well as keep track of the various activities they have undertaken with a calendar. Users are also able to weigh themselves and do a BMI and balance test with the channel once per day. However, if the player wishes to do any exercises or play any of the aerobics games and/or balance games, the game prompts the user to insert the ''[[Wii Fit]]'' game disc.\n\n===Mario Kart Channel===\n{{main|Mario Kart Wii}}\n''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' allows players to install the ''Mario Kart Channel'' on their [[Wii]] console. The channel can work without inserting the ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' disc into the console, but to compete in races and time trials the disc is required. The use of the Mario Kart Channel allows for a number of options. A ranking option lets players see their best Time Trial scores for each track and compare their results to those of their friends and other players worldwide, represented by their Miis. Players will have the option of racing against the random or selective ghosts, or improving their results gradually by taking on the ghosts of rivals, those with similar race times. Users have the option to submit these times for others around the world to view. Players can also manage and register friends using the channel and see if any of them are currently online.\n\nAnother feature of the channel are Tournaments, where Nintendo invited players to challenges similar to the missions on ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''. Players were also able to compare their competition rankings with other players.<ref>[http://nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2007/going_global_with_mario_kart_wii__7448.html]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 20, 2014, most features of the channel have been discontinued.\n\n===Jam with the Band Live Channel===\nThe [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Jam with the Band]]'' supports the ''Jam with the Band Live Channel'' (known as the ''Speaker Channel'' in Japan) that allows players to connect their game to a Wii console and let the game's audio be played through the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/19/nintendo-wii-speaker-channel-for-blasting-band-bros-sequel|title=Nintendo: Wii 'Speaker Channel' for blasting Band Bros. sequel|author=Randy Nelson|publisher=Joystiq}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2010/pump_up_the_volume_and_jam_with_the_band_16642.html|title=Pump up the volume and Jam with the Band!|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of Europe]]|date=April 13, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> The channel supports multiple players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touch-ds.jp/mfs/st91/mft5.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622194758/http://touch-ds.jp/mfs/st91/mft5.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 22, 2008|title=Touch-DS.jp - \"Massachusetto!

In addition, users can also leave audio messages for other users by sending a message to their Wii Message Board. Users can also photo [[slideshows]] and comment on them. The Wii Speak Channel became available in North America and Europe on December 5, 2008, and was discontinued on May 20, 2014. The Wii Speak Channel is succeeded by [[Wii U Chat]], which is standardized for the [[Wii U]] console.\n\n===Rabbids Channel===\nA channel created by ''[[Rabbids Go Home]]''. When the game is started up for the first time or when the player goes to the player profile screen, the player may install the ''Rabbids Channel'', which will appear on the Wii Menu after downloaded. Players can use the channel to view other people's Rabbids and enter contests.\n\n==Downloadable channels==\n\n===Virtual Console Channels===\n{{Main article|Virtual Console}}\n''Virtual Console'' channels are channels that allow users to play their downloaded ''Virtual Console'' games obtained from the Wii Shop Channel. The ''Virtual Console'' portion of the Wii Shop Channel specializes in older software originally designed and released for home entertainment platforms that are now defunct. These games are played on the Wii through the [[Video game console emulator|emulation]] of the older hardware. The prices are generally the same in almost every region and are determined primarily by the software's original platform.\n\n===WiiWare Channels===\n{{Main article|WiiWare}}\nFunctioning similarly to the ''Virtual Console'' channels, ''WiiWare'' channels allow users to use their WiiWare games obtained from the Wii Shop Channel. The WiiWare section specializes in downloadable software specifically designed for the Wii. The first WiiWare games were made available on March 25, 2008 in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wiiware-launching-in-japan-march-25/1100-6187517/|title=WiiWare launching in Japan March 25|first=Emma|last=Boyes|date=March 25, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> WiiWare games launched in North America on May 12, 2008,<ref>{{cite news |title=UPDATE 1-Nintendo rolls out Wii fitness game product |date=February 20, 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2034720820080220 |accessdate=February 21, 2008 | work=Reuters | first=Yinka | last=Adegoke}}</ref> and launched in Europe and Australia on May 20, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nintendo of Europe |title=Nintendo announces Q2 release schedule |date=April 24, 2008 |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/nintendo_announces_q2_release_schedule_7920.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530115128/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/nintendo_announces_q2_release_schedule_7920.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 24, 2008 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo/news/index.php nintendo.com.au \u2013 News from Nintendo<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030602212228/http://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo/news/index.php |date=June 2, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe WiiWare section is being touted as a forum to provide developers with small budgets to release smaller-scale games without the investment and risk of creating a title to be sold at retail (somewhat similar to the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and the [[PlayStation Store]]). While actual games have been planned to appear in this section since its inception, there had been no official word on when any would be appearing until June 27, 2007, when Nintendo made an official confirmation in a press release which revealed the first titles would surface sometime in 2008. According to Nintendo, \"The remarkable motion controls will give birth to fresh takes on established genres, as well as original ideas that currently exist only in developers' minds.\"\n\nLike Virtual Console games, WiiWare games are purchased using Wii Points. Nintendo handles all pricing options for the downloadable games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/lJUgYjCGf4pVbYMAU2qmwF3wp7DiOK5k |title=Nintendo's WiiWare Paves the Way for Fresh Games, Cool Consumer Experiences |date=June 27, 2007 |publisher=Nintendo of America |accessdate=December 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Television Friend Channel===\n{{Main article|Television Friend Channel G-Guide for Wii}}\nThe ''Television Friend Channel'' allowed Wii users to check what programs are on the television.

If an e-mail address or mobile phone number would have been registered in the address book, the channel could send out an alert 30 minutes prior to the start of the selected program. The channel tracked the stamps of all Wii users and allowed users to rate programs on a five-star scale.

The channel was developed in collaboration with Media Kobo and allows users to view fortunes for up to six Miis across five categories: love, work, study, communications, and money. The channel also features a compatibility test that compares two Miis, and also gives out \"lucky words\" that must be interpreted by the user. The channel uses Mii birthdate data, but users must input a birth year when they are loaded onto the channel. This channel was never released in North America, and although it was discontinued on January 30th, 2019 (due to the Wii Shop Channel discontinuation) if you downloaded the channel prior to being discontinued you can still use it, as the channel itself never utilized the internet.\n\n===Wii no Ma===\n{{main article|Wii no Ma}}\nA video on-demand service channel was released in Japan on May 1, 2009. The channel is a joint venture between Nintendo and Japanese advertising agency [[Dentsu]]. The channel's interface is built around a virtual living room, where up to 8 Miis can be registered and interact with each other. The virtual living room contains a TV which takes the viewer to the video list. Celebrity \"concierge\" Miis occasionally introduce special programming. Nintendo ceased operations of Wii no Ma on April 30, 2012.\n\n===Demae Channel or Food Delivery ===\nA food delivery service channel was released in Japan on May 26, 2009.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/features/wii_channel.html|title=Wii Channels|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=April 26, 2009|language=ja}}</ref> The channel was a joint venture between Nintendo and Japanese on-line food delivery portal service Demae-can, and was developed by Denyu-sha. The channel offered a wide range of foods provided by different food delivery companies which can be ordered directly through the Wii channel. A note was posted to the Wii Message Board containing what had been ordered and the total price. The food was then delivered to the address the Wii user has registered on the channel. On February 22, 2017, Demae Channel was delisted from the Wii Shop Channel, it was later discontinued alongside the Wii U version on March 31, 2017.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/features/wii_channel.html|title=Wii Channels|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=March 21, 2020|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n===BBC iPlayer Channel===\nWii access to the [[BBC iPlayer]] was interrupted on April 9, 2008, when an update to the Opera Browser turned out to be incompatible with the BBC iPlayer. The BBC chose not to make the BBC iPlayer compatible with the upgrade. This was resolved on November 18, 2009 when they released the ''BBC iPlayer Channel'', allowing easier access to the BBC iPlayer.\n\nThe BBC had since offered a free, dedicated Wii channel version of their BBC iPlayer application<ref name=cubed3>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/12032|title=Dedicated BBC Wii Channel, Looking into Games Development|publisher=Cubed3}}</ref> which is only available in the UK.

This channel allowed [[Netflix]] subscribers to use that service's \"Watch Instantly\" [[Streaming media|movie streaming]] service over the Wii with their regular Netflix subscription fee, and replaced the previous Wii \"streaming disc\" mailed to Netflix customers with Wii and [[PlayStation 3]] consoles from February\u2013October 2010 due to contractual limitations involving [[Xbox 360]] exclusivity. The channel was free to download in the Wii Channels section of the Wii Shop Channel. The channel displayed roughly 12 unique categories of videos with exactly 75 video titles in each category. The TV category had many seasons of videos (i.e. 15\u2013100 episodes) associated with each title. There were also categories for videos just watched, new releases, and videos recommended (based on the user's Netflix subscription history). On July 31, 2018, the ability to download the channel was discontinued; Netflix would drop support for the Wii on January 31, 2019.\n\n===LoveFilm Instant Channel===\nAs of 4 December 2012, a [[LoveFilm Instant]] channel was available to download in the UK; the channel was discontinued before the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=LOVEFiLM on Wii Launch|url=http://www.lovefilm.com/micro/wii_launch|accessdate=4 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113210248/http://www.lovefilm.com/micro/wii_launch|archive-date=January 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Kirby TV Channel===\nThe Kirby TV Channel launched on June 23, 2011 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and has since been discontinued.

The only purpose of this channel is to assist transferring all eligible content out from a Wii console to a Wii U console, where the said content would be available via Wii Mode on the target Wii U. The application can transfer all available listed [[WiiWare]] titles (initially with the sole exemption of ''[[LostWinds]]'' for unknown reasons, but the game had since become available for both transfer to and purchase on Wii U since May 2014), all available listed Virtual Console titles, game save data, DLC data, Mii Channel data, Wii Shop Channel data (including [[Nintendo Points|Wii Points]], conditional that accumulated total does not exceed 10,000 Wii Points on target Wii U), and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ID data to a target Wii U (albeit now moot since the service was discontinued in May 2014), but it cannot transfer Wii settings data, pre-installed WiiWare/Virtual Console titles (such as ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong: Original Edition]]'' that came pre-installed in the PAL version of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' 25th Anniversary Wii bundle), any game or application software that had been since delisted from the Wii Shop Channel prior to the release of Wii U (such as the ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' trilogy), software that is already available on the target Wii U's Wii Mode, [[WiiConnect24]]-supported software and save data (which includes the 16-digit Wii console Friend Code), and Nintendo GameCube save data since the Wii U does not support the latter two. It is possible to move content from multiple Wii consoles to a single target Wii U console, as well as multiple transfers from a single Wii console if required, albeit the last Wii console's content will overwrite any similar Wii data transferred to target Wii U earlier. Due to technical limitations, the channel cannot directly transfer any eligible background data which has been saved on the console's [[Secure Digital|SD card]].\n\nThe Wii U Transfer Tool Channel features an animation based on the [[Pikmin (series)|''Pikmin'']] series, wherein a visual transfer display of various Pikmin drones would automatically carry the eligible data and software to a Hocotate-based space ship bound for the Wii U. While context dynamic, this animation is not interactive, and only exists for entertainment purposes.\n \nThe ability to transfer content from the Wii to the Wii U will continue to be available for the foreseeable future post the Wii Shop Channel's shutdown on January 31, 2019.\n\n===Amazon Video===\n[[Amazon Video]], a [[video on demand]] service provided by [[Amazon.com]], was released as a downloadable Wii channel in the [[United States]] in January 2013; the service was discontinued on January 30, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1774342&highlight=|title=Amazon - Press Room - Press Release|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\n===Crunchyroll===\nIn late 2014, [[Crunchyroll]] released their video app for the Wii's successor, [[Wii U]], in North America.

Users could also use WiiConnect24 to trade messages and pictures with other Wii owners, conventional email accounts (email pictures to console, but not pictures to email), and mobile phones (through text messages). Each Wii has an individual wii.com email account containing the Wii Number. Prior to trading messages it is necessary to add and approve contacts in the address book, although the person added will not get an automatic notification of the request, and must be notified by other means. The service also alerts all users of incoming game-related information.\n\nMessage Board was available for users to post messages that are available to other Wii users by usage of Wii Numbers with [[WiiConnect24]].  In addition to writing text, players can also include images from an SD card in the body of messages, as well as attaching a [[Mii]] to the message. Announcements of software updates and video game news are posted by Nintendo. The Message Board can be used for posting memos for oneself or for family members without going online. These messages could then be put on any day of the calendar. The Wii Message Board could also be updated automatically by a real-time game like ''[[Animal Crossing (Wii)|Animal Crossing]]''.\n\n''[[Wii Sports]]'', ''[[Wii Play]]'', ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', ''[[Wii Speak Channel]]'', ''[[Wii Sports Resort]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' & ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''  use the Message Board to update the player on any new high scores or gameplay advancements, such as medal placements in the former two titles, completions of races including a photo, audio messages, and letters from the Mailtoad via the Wii message board. ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', ''Super Mario Galaxy'', ''Super Smash Bros Brawl'', ''[[Elebits]]'', ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]'', ''[[Dewy's Adventure]]'' and the Virtual Console game ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allow players to take screenshots and post them to the Message Board to edit later or send to friends via messages. Except for [[Nintendo GameCube]] games, the Message Board also records the play history in the form of \"Today's Accomplishments\".

This menu allows the user to run [[Virtual Console]] games, [[WiiWare]] games, and Wii Channels directly from the [[SD card]], which makes it possible to free up the Wii's internal memory.  Applications can be downloaded to the SD card directly from the Wii Shop Channel as well.\n\nWhen running an application from the SD Card Menu, it is temporarily copied to the internal memory of the Wii, meaning the internal memory still must contain an amount of free blocks equal to the application's size.  If the internal memory does not have enough space, the Channel will run an \"Automanager\" program, which clears up space for the user in one of many ways (selectable by the user).\n\nThe manager can place the largest channels on the user's Wii in the SD card, put smaller channels on the SD card until enough space remains to run the channel, clear channels from the left side of the Wii menu to the right side, or from the right side to the left until there are enough blocks to run the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ca.ign.com/articles/2009/03/25/the-wii-update-youve-waited-for|title=The Wii Update You've Waited For|author=Lucas M.

By pressing the plus and minus buttons on the Wii Remote users can scroll across accessing empty slots.\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Pre-installed channels==\n\n===Disc Channel===\nThe ''Disc Channel'' allows users to play [[Wii]] and [[GameCube]] titles from supported [[Nintendo optical disc]]s inserted into the console.\n\nIf no disc is inserted, the message \"Please insert a disc.\" will be displayed along with images of a template Wii and GameCube disc (Except for the [[Wii Mini|Wii mini]] or the [[Wii U]], where only the Wii disc is shown due to lack of GameCube support). The \"Start\" button will also remain deactivated until a playable disc is inserted.\n\nWhen a disc is inserted, the channel preview and banner on the menu will change to the one supplied by the title and the \"Start\" button will become available. If it is a GameCube disc, the banner and preview will change to the GameCube logo with the GameCube startup theme playing on the preview.\n\nEach Wii game disc includes a system update partition, which includes the latest Wii software from the time the game was released. If a disc is inserted that contains newer software than installed on the console, installing the new software will be required to play the game. This allows users without an internet connection to still receive system updates. When loaded into the disc slot, an icon on the Disc Channel that says \"Wii System Update\" appears. After selecting the channel, the Wii will automatically update. If these updates are not installed, the game will remain unplayable until the update is installed, as each time the channel is loaded with the game inserted, the update prompt will appear, and declining the update will return the player to the Wii Menu instead of starting the game. (Note: This is the only channel that cannot be moved across the Wii Menu without the use of third party tools.)  The games which display \"Wii System Update\" can still be played without updating using [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] software, such as Gecko OS or a USB loader.\n\n===Mii Channel===\n{{main article|Mii}}\n\nThe ''Mii Channel'' is an [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]] creator, where users can design 3D [[caricatures]] of people called Miis by selecting from a group of facial and bodily features. At the Game Developers Conference 2007, Shigeru Miyamoto explained that the look and design of the Mii characters are based on [[Kokeshi]], a form of Japanese doll used as souvenir gifts.\n\nA ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' interview of [[Katsuya Eguchi]] (producer of ''[[Animal Crossing]]'' and ''[[Wii Sports]]'') held in 2006 confirmed that the custom player avatar feature shown at Nintendo's E3 Media Briefing would be included in the hardware. The feature was described as part of a \"profile\" system that contains the Mii and other pertinent player information.<ref name=\"caricature\">{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/index.blog?entry_id=1493873|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826090030/http://blog.wired.com/games/index.blog?entry_id=1493873|archivedate=August 26, 2006|title=Confirmed: Wii Hardware Stores Player Caricatures, Profiles|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|accessdate=June 3, 2006|first=Chris|last=Kohler}}</ref> This application was officially unveiled by Nintendo in September 2006. It is incorporated into Wii's operating system interface as the \"''Mii Channel''\". Users can select from pre-made Miis or create their own by choosing custom facial shapes, colors, and positioning. In certain games like ''[[Wii Sports]]'', ''[[Wii Play]]'', ''[[Wii Fit]]'', ''[[Wii Sports Resort]]'', ''[[Wii Party]]'', ''[[Wii Fit Plus]]'', ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'', ''[[WarioWare: Smooth Moves]]'', ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', ''[[Mario Party 8]]'', ''[[My Pok\u00e9mon Ranch]]'', ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]'', ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]'', and ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'', each player's Mii will serve as the character he/she controls in some/all forms of gameplay. Miis can interact with other Wii users by showing up on their Wii consoles through the [[WiiConnect24]] feature or by talking with other Miis created by Wii owners all over the world. This feature is called Mii Parade. Early-created Miis as well as those encountered in Mii Parades may show up as spectators in some games.<ref name=\"IGN Wii Channels\">{{cite news|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/732/732745p1.html|title=Wii Channel Breakdown|access-date=September 16, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428150140/http://wii.ign.com/articles/732/732745p1.html|archive-date=April 28, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Miis can be stored on Wii Remotes and taken to other Wii consoles.

The user can create a slideshow simply by inserting an SD card with photos and, optionally, MP3 or AAC files (see [[#Photo Channel 1.1|note]] regarding December 10, 2007 update to version 1.1).  The Wii will automatically add [[Ken Burns Effect]] transitions between the photos and play either the music on the SD card or built-in music in the background. A built-in editor allows users to add markings and effects to their photos or videos (The edits float statically above the videos). Mosaics can also be created with this feature. Puzzles can be created from photos or videos with varying degrees of difficulty (However, your first puzzle will be six-pieces) with 6, 12, 24 and 48 piece puzzles available, with 192 selectable while holding down 1 on the Wii remote. Edited photos can be saved to the Wii and sent to other Wiis via the message board. According to the system's manual, the following file extensions (i.e. formats) are supported: Photos (jpeg/jpg), Movies (mov/avi), and Music (mp3/aac).\n\nJPEG files can be up to 8192x8192 resolution and in baseline format.<ref name=\"File types compatible with the Photo Channel\">{{cite web| url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/sdCards.jsp#file_types |title=File types compatible with the Photo Channel|accessdate=January 16, 2007}}</ref> Video data contained within the .mov or .avi files must be in an [[OpenDML]] compliant [[MotionJPEG]] use some variant of this format for their videos.<ref name=\"Video Formats compatible with the Photo Channel\">{{cite web| url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/compatibleMovie.jsp |title=Known Compatible Devices \u2013 Movie Files|accessdate=January 16, 2007}}</ref> Photos, even high resolution ones, are compressed and decreased in resolution.<ref name=\"IGN review\">{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/748/748526p3.html|title=IGN: Wii Thoughts and Suggestions<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|access-date=December 4, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225102923/http://wii.ign.com/articles/748/748526p3.html|archive-date=February 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Photo Channel 1.1====\n''Photo Channel 1.1'' is an optional update to the ''Photo Channel'' that became available on the Wii Shop Channel on December 10, 2007.

Users could browse in the [[Virtual Console]], [[WiiWare]], or Wii Channels sections for downloads. A feature to purchase downloaded software as gifts for others became available worldwide on December 10, 2007. Additional channels that were not released at the console's launch were available for purchase in the Wii Shop Channel. These included: [[Internet Channel]], [[Everybody Votes Channel]], [[Check Mii Out Channel]], [[Nintendo Channel]], [[Netflix|Netflix Channel]], and the Japan-only [[Television Friend Channel]].

The ''Forecast Channel'' first became available on December 19, 2006. Certain games like ''[[Madden NFL 07]]'', ''[[Nights: Journey of Dreams]]'', and ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]'' could use the ''Forecast Channel'' to simulate weather conditions depending on the player's region.<ref name=\"maddenweather\">{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/Madden_NFL_07_Wii/4524-9993_7-31861374.html|title=Madden NFL 07 (Wii)|publisher=[[CNET]]|date=November 19, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120524093132/http://reviews.cnet.com/Madden_NFL_07_Wii/4524-9993_7-31861374.html|archivedate=May 24, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere are slight variations of ''Forecast Channel'' versions in different regions.

It contains an informational video specifying the benefits of connecting the Wii console to the Internet, such as downloading extra channels, new software, [[Virtual Console]] titles, and playing games over [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]].\n\nThe ''Get Connected Video Channel'' is the only pre-installed channel that takes up spare internal memory, and the only channel that can be manually deleted or moved to an [[SD Card]] by the user. The channel takes up 1,180 blocks of memory, which is over half the Wii's internal memory space. The large size of this channel is likely due to the fact it is available in multiple languages; three videos in the U.S. versions, and six videos in the PAL versions. Upon connecting to the Internet and running the channel, the user will be asked if they would like to delete it. It cannot be re-downloaded or restored upon deletion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/channelsWiiInternetVideo.jsp |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122214542/http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/channelsWiiInternetVideo.jsp |archive-date=November 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe same video presentation contained in the channel can also be viewed on an archived version of Nintendo's official website.<ref>[https://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/internet Wii Official Site - Enhance Your Wii] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127153746/https://www.nintendo.com/wii/online/internet |date=November 27, 2011 }}.

Unlike the other channels, the video in the channel is not translated digitally, but is presented in multiple dubs, which means there are multiple copies of the same video in a single channel. The language of the video is presented is respectively according to the Wii's language setting. Available languages are [[English language|English]], [[French Language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in the U.S. versions; and [[British English|English]], French, [[Castilian Spanish|Spanish]], German, Italian, and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in the PAL version.

A refund was issued to those who paid for the channel in the form of one free NES game download worth 500 Wii Points.\n\nThe ''Internet Channel'' uses whichever connection is chosen in the Wii settings, and utilizes the user's internet connection directly; there is no third party network that traffic is being routed through. It receives a connection from a router/modem and uses a web browser to pull up HTTP and HTTPS (secure and encrypted) web pages. Opera, the Wii's web browser, is capable of rendering most web sites in the same manner as its desktop counterpart by using Opera's Medium Screen Rendering technology. For most Internet users, the Wii offers all of the functionality they need to perform the most common Internet tasks.\n\nThe software is saved to the Wii's 512 MB internal flash memory (it can be copied to an [[Secure Digital card|SD card]] after it has been downloaded). The temporary Internet files (maximum of 5MB for the trial version) can only be saved to the Wii's internal memory. The application launches within a few seconds, after connecting to the Internet through a [[Wi-Fi|wireless]] [[LAN]] using the built-in interface or a [[Ethernet|wired]] LAN by using the [[USB]] to the Ethernet adapter.\n\nThe Opera-based Wii browser allows users full access to the Internet and supports all the same web standards that are included in the desktop versions of Opera, including [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[JavaScript|Java]]. It is also possible for the browser to use technologies such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], [[SVG]], [[RSS]], and [[Adobe Flash Player]] 8 and limited support for Adobe Flash Player 9. Opera Software has indicated that the functionality will allow for third parties to create web applications specifically designed for the use on the Wii Browser, and it will support [[Widget engine|widgets]], standalone web-based applications using Opera as an application platform.<ref name=\"Widgets\">{{cite web| url=http://www.opera.com/company/investors/finance/2006/2Q06_presentation.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016122630/http://www.opera.com/company/investors/finance/2006/2Q06_presentation.pdf| archivedate=October 16, 2006| title=Second quarter 2006 Financial Presentation| publisher=Opera Software }}</ref>\n\n===Everybody Votes Channel===\n{{main article|Everybody Votes Channel}}\n''Everybody Votes Channel'' allowed users to vote in simple opinion polls and compare and contrast opinions with those of friends, family, and people across the globe.\n\n''Everybody Votes Channel'' was launched on February 13, 2007, and was available in the Wii Channels section of the Wii Shop Channel. The application allowed Wii owners to vote on various questions using their [[Mii]] as a registered voter. Additionally, voters were also able to make predictions for the choice that will be the most popular overall after their own vote has been cast. Each Mii's voting and prediction record is tracked and voters can also view how their opinions compare to others. Whether the Mii is correct in its predictions or not is displayed on a statistics page along with a counter of how many times that Mii has voted. Up to six Miis would be registered to vote on the console. The channel was free to download. Each player would make a suggestion for a poll a day.\n\nLike the other four Wii channels{{clarify|date=August 2019}}, the Everybody Votes Channel ended its seven-year support on June 27, 2013 due to Nintendo shifting its resources to its next generation projects. Unlike the other discontinued channels, Everybody Votes Channel remains accessible with users able to view the latest poll data posted, albeit the channel will never be updated again. \n===Check Mii Out Channel===\n{{main article|Check Mii Out Channel}}\n\nThe ''Check Mii Out Channel'' (also known as the ''Mii Contest Channel in Australia and Europe'') was a channel that allowed players to share their Miis and enter them into popularity contests. It was first available on November 11, 2007. It was available free to download from the [[Wii Channels]] section of the [[Wii Shop Channel]].\n\nUsers would post their own Miis in the Posting Plaza, or import other user-submitted Miis to their own personal Mii Parade. Each submitted Mii was assigned a 12-digit entry number to aid in searching. Submitted Miis were given 2 initials by their creator and a notable skill/talent to aid in sorting.\n\nIn the Contests section, players submitted their own Miis to compete in contests to best fit a certain description (e.g. [[Mario]] without his cap). After the time period for sending a Mii had expired, the user had the choice of voting for three Miis featured on the judging panel, with ten random Miis being shown at a time. Once the judging period is over, the results of the contest may be viewed. Their selection and/or submission's popularity in comparison to others was displayed, as well as the winning Mii and user.\n\nThe Check Mii Out Channel sent messages to the Wii Message Board concerning recent contests. Participants in certain contests would add their user and submitted Mii to a photo with a background related to the contest theme. This picture would then be sent to the Wii Message Board.\n\nThis channel ended its seven-year support on June 27, 2013 like the four other channels{{clarify|date=August 2019}}.\n\n===Nintendo Channel===\n{{main article|Nintendo Channel}}\n\nThe ''Nintendo Channel'' (also known as the '''Everybody's Nintendo Channel''' in Japan) allowed [[Wii]] users to watch videos such as interviews, trailers, commercials, and even download [[Game demo|demos]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. In this capacity the channel worked in a similar way to the [[DS Download Station]]. The channel provided games, info, pages and users could rate games that they have played.

The update introduced a new interface and additional features, options, and statistics for users to view. However, the European version was missing some of these new additional features, such as options for choosing video quality. In addition, a weekly show known as ''[[Nintendo Week]]'' began airing exclusively on the North American edition of the channel, while another show ''Nintendo TV'', was available on the UK version of the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=249788|title=ONM launches Nintendo TV|author=Thomas East|publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames}}</ref>\n\nThe Nintendo Channel and the other 4 channels{{clarify|date=August 2019}} ended their seven-year support on June 27, 2013.\n\nA few shows appeared on Nintendo Channel which were no more than 20 minutes long:\n\n'''Nintendo Week'''\n{{main article|Nintendo Week}}\n\nNintendo Week was a show on the Nintendo Channel. The hosts were Gary and Allison, but other co-hosts appeared as well like Dark Gary, Daniel, and others.\n\n'''Ultimate Wii Challenge/New Super Mario Bros. Wii Challenge'''\n\nThe hosts were David and Ben. They tried to beat each other's time in Nintendo Games like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, Donkey Kong Country Returns, Super Mario Galaxy 2, and Kirby's Epic Yarn. In a few episodes, Ben and David worked together in levels of a few games.\n\n====Disconnection====\nIt was announced on April 3, 2013 that the Check Mii Out Channel would close permanently on June 7, 2013,<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3512/p/604|title=Discontinuation of Rush Hour Services {{!}} Wii & Wii mini {{!}} Nintendo Support|website=en-americas-support.nintendo.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> as Nintendo terminated the [[WiiConnect24]] service which these channels required, and shifted their resources to their next-generation projects.\n\n==Additional channels==\nThese channels are those that can be acquired through the usage of various games and accessories.\n\n===Wii Fit Channel===\n''[[Wii Fit]]'' allows users to install the ''Wii Fit Channel'' to the Wii Menu. The channel allows them to view and compare their results, and those of others, as well as their progress in the game, without requiring the game disc to be inserted.\n\nThe channel is essentially a stripped down version of ''[[Wii Fit]]''. It allows users to view statistics from the game including users' [[Body mass index|BMI]] measurements and balance test scores in the form of a line graph, as well as keep track of the various activities they have undertaken with a calendar. Users are also able to weigh themselves and do a BMI and balance test with the channel once per day. However, if the player wishes to do any exercises or play any of the aerobics games and/or balance games, the game prompts the user to insert the ''[[Wii Fit]]'' game disc.\n\n===Mario Kart Channel===\n{{main|Mario Kart Wii}}\n''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' allows players to install the ''Mario Kart Channel'' on their [[Wii]] console. The channel can work without inserting the ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' disc into the console, but to compete in races and time trials the disc is required. The use of the Mario Kart Channel allows for a number of options. A ranking option lets players see their best Time Trial scores for each track and compare their results to those of their friends and other players worldwide, represented by their Miis. Players will have the option of racing against the random or selective ghosts, or improving their results gradually by taking on the ghosts of rivals, those with similar race times. Users have the option to submit these times for others around the world to view. Players can also manage and register friends using the channel and see if any of them are currently online.\n\nAnother feature of the channel are Tournaments, where Nintendo invited players to challenges similar to the missions on ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''. Players were also able to compare their competition rankings with other players.<ref>[http://nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2007/going_global_with_mario_kart_wii__7448.html]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 20, 2014, most features of the channel have been discontinued.\n\n===Jam with the Band Live Channel===\nThe [[Nintendo DS]] game ''[[Jam with the Band]]'' supports the ''Jam with the Band Live Channel'' (known as the ''Speaker Channel'' in Japan) that allows players to connect their game to a Wii console and let the game's audio be played through the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/19/nintendo-wii-speaker-channel-for-blasting-band-bros-sequel|title=Nintendo: Wii 'Speaker Channel' for blasting Band Bros. sequel|author=Randy Nelson|publisher=Joystiq}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2010/pump_up_the_volume_and_jam_with_the_band_16642.html|title=Pump up the volume and Jam with the Band!|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of Europe]]|date=April 13, 2010|accessdate=April 27, 2010}}</ref> The channel supports multiple players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touch-ds.jp/mfs/st91/mft5.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622194758/http://touch-ds.jp/mfs/st91/mft5.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 22, 2008|title=Touch-DS.jp - \"Massachusetto!

Users can join one of four rooms (with no limit to the number of people in each room) to chat with others online. Each user is represented by their own [[Mii]], which lip-syncs to their words. In addition, users can also leave audio messages for other users by sending a message to their Wii Message Board. Users can also photo [[slideshows]] and comment on them. The Wii Speak Channel became available in North America and Europe on December 5, 2008, and was discontinued on May 20, 2014. The Wii Speak Channel is succeeded by [[Wii U Chat]], which is standardized for the [[Wii U]] console.\n\n===Rabbids Channel===\nA channel created by ''[[Rabbids Go Home]]''. When the game is started up for the first time or when the player goes to the player profile screen, the player may install the ''Rabbids Channel'', which will appear on the Wii Menu after downloaded. Players can use the channel to view other people's Rabbids and enter contests.\n\n==Downloadable channels==\n\n===Virtual Console Channels===\n{{Main article|Virtual Console}}\n''Virtual Console'' channels are channels that allow users to play their downloaded ''Virtual Console'' games obtained from the Wii Shop Channel. The ''Virtual Console'' portion of the Wii Shop Channel specializes in older software originally designed and released for home entertainment platforms that are now defunct. These games are played on the Wii through the [[Video game console emulator|emulation]] of the older hardware. The prices are generally the same in almost every region and are determined primarily by the software's original platform.\n\n===WiiWare Channels===\n{{Main article|WiiWare}}\nFunctioning similarly to the ''Virtual Console'' channels, ''WiiWare'' channels allow users to use their WiiWare games obtained from the Wii Shop Channel. The WiiWare section specializes in downloadable software specifically designed for the Wii. The first WiiWare games were made available on March 25, 2008 in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wiiware-launching-in-japan-march-25/1100-6187517/|title=WiiWare launching in Japan March 25|first=Emma|last=Boyes|date=March 25, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> WiiWare games launched in North America on May 12, 2008,<ref>{{cite news |title=UPDATE 1-Nintendo rolls out Wii fitness game product |date=February 20, 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2034720820080220 |accessdate=February 21, 2008 | work=Reuters | first=Yinka | last=Adegoke}}</ref> and launched in Europe and Australia on May 20, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nintendo of Europe |title=Nintendo announces Q2 release schedule |date=April 24, 2008 |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/nintendo_announces_q2_release_schedule_7920.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530115128/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/nintendo_announces_q2_release_schedule_7920.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 24, 2008 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo/news/index.php nintendo.com.au \u2013 News from Nintendo<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030602212228/http://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo/news/index.php |date=June 2, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nThe WiiWare section is being touted as a forum to provide developers with small budgets to release smaller-scale games without the investment and risk of creating a title to be sold at retail (somewhat similar to the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and the [[PlayStation Store]]). While actual games have been planned to appear in this section since its inception, there had been no official word on when any would be appearing until June 27, 2007, when Nintendo made an official confirmation in a press release which revealed the first titles would surface sometime in 2008. According to Nintendo, \"The remarkable motion controls will give birth to fresh takes on established genres, as well as original ideas that currently exist only in developers' minds.\"\n\nLike Virtual Console games, WiiWare games are purchased using Wii Points. Nintendo handles all pricing options for the downloadable games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/lJUgYjCGf4pVbYMAU2qmwF3wp7DiOK5k |title=Nintendo's WiiWare Paves the Way for Fresh Games, Cool Consumer Experiences |date=June 27, 2007 |publisher=Nintendo of America |accessdate=December 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Television Friend Channel===\n{{Main article|Television Friend Channel G-Guide for Wii}}\nThe ''Television Friend Channel'' allowed Wii users to check what programs are on the television.

The user was also able to place their [[Mii]] on a business card. The completed design would then sent online to Fujifilm who printed and delivered the completed product to the user.

The channel was developed in collaboration with Media Kobo and allows users to view fortunes for up to six Miis across five categories: love, work, study, communications, and money. The channel also features a compatibility test that compares two Miis, and also gives out \"lucky words\" that must be interpreted by the user. The channel uses Mii birthdate data, but users must input a birth year when they are loaded onto the channel. This channel was never released in North America, and although it was discontinued on January 30th, 2019 (due to the Wii Shop Channel discontinuation) if you downloaded the channel prior to being discontinued you can still use it, as the channel itself never utilized the internet.\n\n===Wii no Ma===\n{{main article|Wii no Ma}}\nA video on-demand service channel was released in Japan on May 1, 2009. The channel is a joint venture between Nintendo and Japanese advertising agency [[Dentsu]]. The channel's interface is built around a virtual living room, where up to 8 Miis can be registered and interact with each other. The virtual living room contains a TV which takes the viewer to the video list. Celebrity \"concierge\" Miis occasionally introduce special programming. Nintendo ceased operations of Wii no Ma on April 30, 2012.\n\n===Demae Channel or Food Delivery ===\nA food delivery service channel was released in Japan on May 26, 2009.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/features/wii_channel.html|title=Wii Channels|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=April 26, 2009|language=ja}}</ref> The channel was a joint venture between Nintendo and Japanese on-line food delivery portal service Demae-can, and was developed by Denyu-sha. The channel offered a wide range of foods provided by different food delivery companies which can be ordered directly through the Wii channel. A note was posted to the Wii Message Board containing what had been ordered and the total price. The food was then delivered to the address the Wii user has registered on the channel. On February 22, 2017, Demae Channel was delisted from the Wii Shop Channel, it was later discontinued alongside the Wii U version on March 31, 2017.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/features/wii_channel.html|title=Wii Channels|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=March 21, 2020|language=ja}}</ref>\n\n===BBC iPlayer Channel===\nWii access to the [[BBC iPlayer]] was interrupted on April 9, 2008, when an update to the Opera Browser turned out to be incompatible with the BBC iPlayer. The BBC chose not to make the BBC iPlayer compatible with the upgrade. This was resolved on November 18, 2009 when they released the ''BBC iPlayer Channel'', allowing easier access to the BBC iPlayer.\n\nThe BBC had since offered a free, dedicated Wii channel version of their BBC iPlayer application<ref name=cubed3>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/12032|title=Dedicated BBC Wii Channel, Looking into Games Development|publisher=Cubed3}}</ref> which is only available in the UK.

The channel was free to download in the Wii Channels section of the Wii Shop Channel. The channel displayed roughly 12 unique categories of videos with exactly 75 video titles in each category. The TV category had many seasons of videos (i.e. 15\u2013100 episodes) associated with each title. There were also categories for videos just watched, new releases, and videos recommended (based on the user's Netflix subscription history). On July 31, 2018, the ability to download the channel was discontinued; Netflix would drop support for the Wii on January 31, 2019.\n\n===LoveFilm Instant Channel===\nAs of 4 December 2012, a [[LoveFilm Instant]] channel was available to download in the UK; the channel was discontinued before the end of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=LOVEFiLM on Wii Launch|url=http://www.lovefilm.com/micro/wii_launch|accessdate=4 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113210248/http://www.lovefilm.com/micro/wii_launch|archive-date=January 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Kirby TV Channel===\nThe Kirby TV Channel launched on June 23, 2011 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and has since been discontinued.

The only purpose of this channel is to assist transferring all eligible content out from a Wii console to a Wii U console, where the said content would be available via Wii Mode on the target Wii U. The application can transfer all available listed [[WiiWare]] titles (initially with the sole exemption of ''[[LostWinds]]'' for unknown reasons, but the game had since become available for both transfer to and purchase on Wii U since May 2014), all available listed Virtual Console titles, game save data, DLC data, Mii Channel data, Wii Shop Channel data (including [[Nintendo Points|Wii Points]], conditional that accumulated total does not exceed 10,000 Wii Points on target Wii U), and Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ID data to a target Wii U (albeit now moot since the service was discontinued in May 2014), but it cannot transfer Wii settings data, pre-installed WiiWare/Virtual Console titles (such as ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong: Original Edition]]'' that came pre-installed in the PAL version of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' 25th Anniversary Wii bundle), any game or application software that had been since delisted from the Wii Shop Channel prior to the release of Wii U (such as the ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' trilogy), software that is already available on the target Wii U's Wii Mode, [[WiiConnect24]]-supported software and save data (which includes the 16-digit Wii console Friend Code), and Nintendo GameCube save data since the Wii U does not support the latter two. It is possible to move content from multiple Wii consoles to a single target Wii U console, as well as multiple transfers from a single Wii console if required, albeit the last Wii console's content will overwrite any similar Wii data transferred to target Wii U earlier. Due to technical limitations, the channel cannot directly transfer any eligible background data which has been saved on the console's [[Secure Digital|SD card]].\n\nThe Wii U Transfer Tool Channel features an animation based on the [[Pikmin (series)|''Pikmin'']] series, wherein a visual transfer display of various Pikmin drones would automatically carry the eligible data and software to a Hocotate-based space ship bound for the Wii U. While context dynamic, this animation is not interactive, and only exists for entertainment purposes.\n \nThe ability to transfer content from the Wii to the Wii U will continue to be available for the foreseeable future post the Wii Shop Channel's shutdown on January 31, 2019.\n\n===Amazon Video===\n[[Amazon Video]], a [[video on demand]] service provided by [[Amazon.com]], was released as a downloadable Wii channel in the [[United States]] in January 2013; the service was discontinued on January 30, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1774342&highlight=|title=Amazon - Press Room - Press Release|website=phx.corporate-ir.net|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\n===Crunchyroll===\nIn late 2014, [[Crunchyroll]] released their video app for the Wii's successor, [[Wii U]], in North America. However, believing there are still many actively connected Wii consoles in its twilight years, Crunchyroll had surprised users with dedicated a Crunchyroll channel for Wii as well, launching the app categorized under \"WiiWare\" on October 15, 2015 in North America and the PAL regions.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/10/15-1/crunchyroll-app-now-available-on-nintendo-wii |title=Crunchyroll App Now Available on Nintendo Wii |publisher=Crunchyroll |first=Joseph |last=Luster |date=2015-10-16 |accessdate=2015-10-16}}</ref> The Crunchyroll Wii channel currently only permits access to Premium account holders to the majority of the prime content.{{citation needed|date= June 2018}} On May 5, 2017, less than 20 months after its launch, Crunchyroll ceased support for the Wii due to technical limitations after the service updated with new technology.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://help.crunchyroll.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002299086-UPDATE-Xbox-360-and-Wii-App-Support |title=UPDATE: Xbox 360 and Wii App Support |publisher=Crunchyroll |author=Nate |date=2017-05-05 |accessdate=2019-01-12}}</ref>\n\n== Wii Message Board ==\nThe ''Message Board'' allows users to leave messages for friends, family members, or other users on a calendar-based message board. Users could also use WiiConnect24 to trade messages and pictures with other Wii owners, conventional email accounts (email pictures to console, but not pictures to email), and mobile phones (through text messages). Each Wii has an individual wii.com email account containing the Wii Number. Prior to trading messages it is necessary to add and approve contacts in the address book, although the person added will not get an automatic notification of the request, and must be notified by other means. The service also alerts all users of incoming game-related information.\n\nMessage Board was available for users to post messages that are available to other Wii users by usage of Wii Numbers with [[WiiConnect24]].  In addition to writing text, players can also include images from an SD card in the body of messages, as well as attaching a [[Mii]] to the message. Announcements of software updates and video game news are posted by Nintendo. The Message Board can be used for posting memos for oneself or for family members without going online. These messages could then be put on any day of the calendar. The Wii Message Board could also be updated automatically by a real-time game like ''[[Animal Crossing (Wii)|Animal Crossing]]''.\n\n''[[Wii Sports]]'', ''[[Wii Play]]'', ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', ''[[Wii Speak Channel]]'', ''[[Wii Sports Resort]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' & ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''  use the Message Board to update the player on any new high scores or gameplay advancements, such as medal placements in the former two titles, completions of races including a photo, audio messages, and letters from the Mailtoad via the Wii message board. ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', ''Super Mario Galaxy'', ''Super Smash Bros Brawl'', ''[[Elebits]]'', ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]'', ''[[Dewy's Adventure]]'' and the Virtual Console game ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allow players to take screenshots and post them to the Message Board to edit later or send to friends via messages. Except for [[Nintendo GameCube]] games, the Message Board also records the play history in the form of \"Today's Accomplishments\". This feature automatically records details of what games or applications were played and for how long. It cannot be deleted or hidden without formatting the console itself.<ref name=\"Reasoning Behind the Wii\">{{cite news|date=September 14, 2006|url=http://ms.nintendo-europe.com/wii/?site=v3_03.html&l=enGB|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20061209134925/http://ms.nintendo-europe.com/wii/?site=v3_03.html&l=enGB|archivedate=December 9, 2006|title=Reasoning Behind the Wii|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=September 14, 2006}}</ref> Prior to its closure, the Nintendo Channel was able to automatically tally all Wii game play data from the Message Board and display them in an ordered list within the channel.\n\nSubsequent system updates added a number of minor features to the Message Board, including minor aesthetic changes, USB keyboard support and the ability to receive Internet links from friends, which can be launched in the Internet Channel.\n\nAn exploit in the Wii Message Board can be used to [[Wii homebrew|homebrew]] a Wii via a tool called LetterBomb.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://please.hackmii.com/|title=LetterBomb|website=please.hackmii.com|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Discontinuation ===\nThe [[WiiConnect24]] service has been terminated as of June 27, 2013,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/04/nintendo_to_pull_the_plug_on_several_online_wii_channels|title=Nintendo to Pull the Plug on Several Online Wii Channels|last=Life|first=Nintendo|date=2013-04-12|work=Nintendo Life|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/> completely ceasing the data exchange functionality of the Wii Message Board for all Wii consoles, whether as messages or game data.

This menu allows the user to run [[Virtual Console]] games, [[WiiWare]] games, and Wii Channels directly from the [[SD card]], which makes it possible to free up the Wii's internal memory.  Applications can be downloaded to the SD card directly from the Wii Shop Channel as well.\n\nWhen running an application from the SD Card Menu, it is temporarily copied to the internal memory of the Wii, meaning the internal memory still must contain an amount of free blocks equal to the application's size.  If the internal memory does not have enough space, the Channel will run an \"Automanager\" program, which clears up space for the user in one of many ways (selectable by the user).\n\nThe manager can place the largest channels on the user's Wii in the SD card, put smaller channels on the SD card until enough space remains to run the channel, clear channels from the left side of the Wii menu to the right side, or from the right side to the left until there are enough blocks to run the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ca.ign.com/articles/2009/03/25/the-wii-update-youve-waited-for|title=The Wii Update You've Waited For|author=Lucas M.

These updates may include additional features, patches/fixes, or support for newly released channels. When an update becomes available, Nintendo notifies users by sending a message to their console.

The contestants, referred to as \"HouseGuests,\" are sequestered in the Big Brother House with no contact to or from the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food, luxuries and power in the house.\n\nAt the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (HoH) competition. The winner of the HoH competition will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. As with [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|the previous season]], the first five weeks of the season feature two concurrent Heads of Household. Each HoH would nominate two other HouseGuests for eviction, totaling four nominees. The two pairs of nominees would then compete in the \"Battle of the Block\" competition. The winning pair would be removed from the block, with the HoH who nominated them dethroned. The dethroned HoH would later be eligible to be nominated as a replacement if the Veto was used, while the Battle of the Block winners are safe for the rest of the week. The rest of the cycle would continue as per usual, with the remaining HoH retaining immunity for the week, and the two nominees being eligible for safety through the Power of Veto. The reigning (or sole) HoH also earns the right to name the \"Have Nots\" for the week, forcing the chosen HouseGuests to eat solely \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food selection chosen by producers, take cold showers, and sleep in a bedroom designed to look like a dental clinic.\n\nEach week, six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (PoV) competition: the reigning HoH, their two nominees, and three HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is; if the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. The HouseGuest overthrown as a result of the Battle of the Block competition is eligible to be nominated by the reigning Head of Household if the Power of Veto is used.\n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests vote to evict one of the two nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household, who is only allowed to vote in the event of a tie, and in that case, must do so publicly. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. Unlike most other versions of Big Brother, the HouseGuests may openly and freely discuss the nomination and eviction process. The nominee with the majority of votes will be evicted from the house on the weekly live broadcast, exiting to an adjacent studio to be interviewed by Chen, after which the cycle begins again.\n\nHouseGuests may voluntarily leave the house at any time and those who break the rules may be expelled from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests will form the Big Brother jury, and vote for the winner during the season finale. The jury members will be sequestered in a separate house and will not be allowed to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests; the jury members will not be shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations.\n\n===Twists===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n\n====BB Takeover====\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\nCBS announced the season's twist, BB Takeover, on June 17, 2015, in which a surprise guest was to visit the house each week to reveal a different twist to the HouseGuests.<ref name=\"BB Takeover\">{{cite web|title='Big Brother' Announces this Season's New Twist, 'BB Takeover,' Featuring Weekly Surprise Guests Who Will Shake Up the House Each and Every Week|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=42928|website=CBS Press Express|accessdate=June 17, 2015|date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Though it was initially announced that there would be a guest every week, there were no Takeovers after Week 3; in an interview during the season, host Julie Chen stated that the twist had been cancelled because \"there was enough going on\u201d with the other elements of the game, though no official announcement was ever made to the HouseGuests.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why the Big Brother twist BB Takeover disappeared|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2015/08/bb17-bb-takeover-what-happened-julie-chen/|website=Reality Blurred|first=Andy|last=Dehnart|accessdate=August 11, 2015|date=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week\n! style=\"width:15%\"|Takeover guest\n! style=\"width:20%\"|Twist\n! style=\"width:60%\"|Effect\n|-\n! rowspan=2|1\n| rowspan=2|[[Phil Keoghan]]\n| Two additional HouseGuests\n| ''[[The Amazing Race 26]]'' alumni Jackie and Jeff entered the game.\n|-\n| [[#BB Fast Forward|BB Fast Forward]]\n| Immunity for the week was granted to the two HouseGuests who sat out of the first HoH competitions and one HouseGuest of their choice each.\n|-\n! 2\n| [[Kathy Griffin]]\n| [[#Last Laugh|The Last Laugh]]\n| The power to block three HouseGuests from voting in the next eviction was granted to the HouseGuest who answered the seventh call to a phone booth in the house.\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3\n| rowspan=2|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n| Gronk Party Week\n| Have-Nots were removed for the week, provided the HouseGuests participated in Gronk Parties throughout.\n|-\n| Luxury competition \n| All of the week's competition winners earned a chance to win a cabin on a three-day cruise.\n|}\n\n====Battle of the Block====\nThe Battle of the block was first introduced in [[Big Brother 16 (American season)|the sixteenth season]]. In the twist, 2 houseguests would be nominated by each Head of Household. The pairs of houseguests that were nominated would compete in The Battle of the Block competition. Whoever won out of those two pairs would have safety for the week as the Head of Household who nominated them would be dethroned leaving one Head of Household remaining. The Battle of the block twist ended week six right after Jason Roy's eviction.\n\n====Twin Twist====\nAs with [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|the fifth season]], a pair of twins competed as one, switching every few days between the house and a sequester location off-site; the twins, Liz and Julia, played as Liz, changing places in the Diary Room with approximately 10 minutes to catch each other up.

During introductions, both Clay and Da'Vonne withheld their professions as a former football player and poker dealer, respectively, while Audrey revealed that she is a [[trans woman]], which received a universally positive reaction from her fellow HouseGuests. A mutual attraction began to form between Clay and Shelli, as did an early alliance between Audrey, Da'Vonne, and Shelli. Julie Chen revealed the return of the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#Battle of the Block|Battle of the Block]] twist and announced the first Head of Household competition. First, the HouseGuests were told that one of them would have to sit out of the competition; Da'Vonne volunteered in exchange for none of the others nominating her, to which they all agreed.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Flying Tomatoes\"):''' The HouseGuests, standing on movable perches, were pelted with plastic tomatoes; as HouseGuests fell off, they were eliminated. The first HouseGuest to catch ten tomatoes or the last one remaining on the perch, whichever occurred first, became the first Head of Household.\n\nAudrey, Jace, James, and Shelli were the final four competitors remaining, but all fell off at the same time; upon review of the footage, James was determined to have fallen off last, so he was named the first Head of Household. The HouseGuests were told about the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#BB Takeover|BB Takeover]], in which a new twist would be introduced every week. Addressing the viewing public, Julie revealed the final twist, which would be kept secret from the HouseGuests. Known as the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#Twin Twist|Twin Twist]], a pair of identical twins would be taking turns competing as one, earning the right to play as individuals, provided they survive the first five evictions.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 547\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n| Title = Episode 2\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|06|25}}\n| Aux1 = Day 1\n| ShortSummary = Six more new HouseGuests\u2014Becky, Jason, John, Liz, Steve, and Vanessa\u2014entered the Big Brother house. As the 14 HouseGuests met each other, Vanessa withheld her profession as a poker player, while Jace noticed that there were two empty seats at the dinner table. For the first BB Takeover, ''[[The Amazing Race]]'' host [[Phil Keoghan]] introduced two new HouseGuests: ''[[The Amazing Race 26]]'' alumni Jackie and Jeff. As with the first group, one of the six new HouseGuests was instructed to sit out of the other Head of Household competition; Vanessa volunteered and the HouseGuests agreed not to nominate her as they did with Da'Vonne earlier.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"UFOh No\"):''' The seven HouseGuests held onto a pole while a harness pulled them upward. The last HouseGuest left hanging onto their pole became the second Head of Household.\n\nWhen only Jackie and Jason remained, Jason promised her that he wouldn't nominate her if she dropped out of the competition; she did, and Jason won.

Former ''Amazing Race'' partners Jackie and Jeff decided to keep their distance from each other to decrease their targets and be perceived as individuals. Phil returned and granted Da'Vonne and Vanessa the BB Fast Forward, which granted them immunity for the week, along with immunity for one HouseGuest each of their choice. Vanessa held court to help her with her decision and settled on Austin. Da'Vonne decided not to protect her allies Audrey and Shelli in order to hide their alliance and picked Liz instead. Da'Vonne's decision angered Shelli, and she later flirted with Clay, which made Da'Vonne question her loyalty. Austin and Jace bonded and later formed an alliance called ShellTown, but Jace's brash remarks and physique made him a target to several HouseGuests, including Jason. James and Jason teamed up with Audrey and Da'Vonne to backdoor Jace and tried to recruit other HouseGuests to be nominated as pawns. Jason nominated Becky and John while James nominated Jackie and Steve.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"DuBoB\"):''' The pairs navigated a series of balance beams to transport blocks to a platform and used them to build a tower according to a blueprint. The first pair that built their tower correctly earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nBecky and John won the competition, dethroning Jason and keeping James in power.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 549\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n| Title = Episode 4\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|01}}\n| Aux1 = Days 7\u201310\n| ShortSummary = Needing seven votes to evict Jace, James recruited Meg and Clay to join him, Audrey, Da'Vonne, and Jason. Jace decided to [[streaking|streak]], which further annoyed the other HouseGuests, including his closest ally, Austin. To save themselves, Austin and Jace formed an alliance with Audrey and James, who had no intention of deviating from their initial plan to take out Jace. While preparing for a possible future counting competition, Da'Vonne wandered into all the rooms, alarming Clay, Jeff, and Shelli, which led to both factions plotting against each other. Jeff and Clay's attempts to address the situation led to further confrontations, and Audrey later tried to get Clay and Da'Vonne to make up, to no avail. Audrey and Da'Vonne independently considered betraying each other\u2014Audrey for Da'Vonne's attitude and Da'Vonne for Audrey's constant meddling. James had to choose four Have-Nots; he picked the four HouseGuests protected by the BB Fast Forward\u2014Austin, Da'Vonne, Liz, and Vanessa. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, John, Jason, and Becky were selected to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Nose-a Scotia\"):''' The six competitors dug for pieces with a letter on them; each letter had an assigned point value. The HouseGuest who made the correctly-spelled word that was worth the most points won the Power of Veto.\n\nSteve won the Power of Veto with the word \"trombonists.\" Audrey decided to bring Jeff and Shelli into her main alliance, but her incessant strategizing in the middle of the night alienated her allies, making James consider putting her up as the replacement nominee. However, at the Veto Meeting, Steve used the Power of Veto on himself, and James followed through on his original plan and nominated Jace.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 550\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n| Title = Episode 5\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|02}}\n| Aux1 = Days 10\u201315\n| ShortSummary = After his nomination, an agitated Jace attempted to rally support, to no avail. Audrey told Jace that she had no part in his nomination but later told him that the whole house was involved; he saw through her lies and later threatened to expose her manipulations. Host Julie Chen revealed that Liz and her twin sister, Julia, were competing as one in the Twin Twist and would switch places again while casting a vote that night. During the live eviction, everyone except Audrey voted against Jace, and he became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house. Actress and comedian [[Kathy Griffin]] arrived for the season's second takeover and revealed to the viewing public that there would be a telephone booth in the house, ringing periodically. The HouseGuest who answered the seventh call would earn the right to stop three HouseGuests from voting in the next eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Ginger Fever\"):''' Divided into two groups of seven by random draw, the HouseGuests raced to assemble a puzzle. The first HouseGuest in each round that assembled their puzzle became the new Heads of Household.\n\nBecky and Shelli won their respective rounds and became the new Heads of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 2|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 551\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n| Title = Episode 6\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|05}}\n| Aux1 = Days 13\u201316\n| ShortSummary = Two days before Jace's eviction, Audrey told her alliance that Vanessa was the leader of an opposing, all-girls alliance and then told Vanessa that Da'Vonne had started that rumor. After Vanessa tried to talk things out with Da'Vonne, Da'Vonne realized that Audrey had been lying and called an alliance meeting; after Audrey refused to own up to her machinations, she was exiled from her alliance.\n\nWith Becky and Shelli as the Heads of Household, the HouseGuests scrambled to ensure their safety, except for Audrey, who decided to lay low to reduce her target. Becky proposed backdooring Audrey; while Shelli initially agreed, she later conspired with Clay and Jeff to target Da'Vonne after their altercation the previous week. The trio recruited John to be nominated as a pawn and told him to throw the Battle of the Block competition while pledging that they would do whatever they could to ensure his safety. Shelli nominated Da'Vonne and John while Becky, still hoping to backdoor Audrey, nominated Jason\u2014as payback for him putting her up the previous week\u2014and Steve.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Give Me Props\"):''' The pairs, conjoined by a single shirt and a three-legged pair of pants, operated nine cameras and repositioned them to follow a shot list; the cameras corresponded to a specific shot but were unlabeled. The first pair that correctly lined up all nine cameras earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nJason and Steve only operated two cameras at a time, which proved to be an effective strategy. Meanwhile, Da'Vonne's idea to turn on all nine cameras at once put her and John at a disadvantage, and he didn't even need to actively try to throw the competition. Jason and Steve handily won the competition, dethroning Becky and keeping Shelli in power and putting the plan to backdoor Audrey in jeopardy.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 552\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n| Title = Episode 7\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|08}}\n| Aux1 = Days 16\u201319\n| ShortSummary = While a dethroned Becky was convinced that the plan to backdoor Audrey was still on the agenda, Shelli continued to plot Da'Vonne's eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Meg, Steve, and Clay were drawn to join Shelli, Da'Vonne, and John.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"High Maintenance\"):''' Two competitors would be given a list of seven items and then shown an image with six of those items. The first competitor to press their buzzer after retrieving the missing item from an adjacent room would win the round, and the other competitor would be eliminated from the competition. If the first player to press their buzzer brought back a wrong item, they would be eliminated. The winner would then choose one of the remaining competitors to play in the next round who in turn would choose their opponent. The last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nIn the final round, John beat Clay to win the Power of Veto, which forced Shelli to find a replacement nominee. After unsuccessfully trying to get John to not use the Veto on himself, Shelli considered nominating Liz. Liz's allies Austin and Vanessa tried to get Shelli to put Meg up instead, telling Shelli that Meg was going to work with Da'Vonne, James, and Jason to save Da'Vonne and target Clay and Shelli and that the only way to ensure Da'Vonne's eviction was to nominate Meg as a pawn. Audrey later reprimanded Clay for being condescending, which prompted Clay to convince Shelli to nominate Audrey instead. However, at the Veto Meeting, after John used the Power of Veto on himself, Shelli decided to listen to Austin and Vanessa and nominated Meg.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 553\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n| Title = Episode 8\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|09}}\n| Aux1 = Days 19\u201322\n| ShortSummary = A telephone booth appeared in the house for Kathy's BB Takeover, and she told the HouseGuests about the Last Laugh twist. Da'Vonne answered the seventh call and earned the power to stop three of the HouseGuests from voting in the upcoming eviction, which meant that she only needed five votes to survive the eviction. Da'Vonne and Jason suspected that Liz had been playing with a twin and alerted the other HouseGuests. Da'Vonne tried to use this information as leverage to secure Liz's vote. At the live eviction, Da'Vonne used the power of the Last Laugh to stop Becky, Jackie, and Jeff from voting, but it didn't matter, as she was evicted anyway after everyone except Audrey and Jason voted against her, and she became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house. [[New England Patriots]] [[tight end]] [[Rob Gronkowski]] kicked off his BB Takeover, Gronk's Party Week, by announcing that there would be no Have-Nots that week.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Gronk Pong\"):''' One at a time, each HouseGuest launched a ball toward 55 oversized cups arranged in the shape of a triangle. Each cup had its own unique point value; the two HouseGuests with the highest scores became the new Heads of Household.\n\nAustin became the first new Head of Household while James, Liz, and Vanessa tied for second; Vanessa won the tiebreaker and became the second new Head of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 3|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 554\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n| Title = Episode 9\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|12}}\n| Aux1 = Days 21\u201323\n| ShortSummary = The night before Da'Vonne's eviction, Vanessa confronted Liz, not knowing it was actually Julia, about the rumors of her being a twin, which Julia confessed to, and Vanessa brought in Austin, Clay, and Shelli to protect the twins and ensure that they make it past the first five evictions in order to increase their numbers. The next night, \nJulia and Liz switched again, and Liz joined her new allies in officially forming the Sixth Sense alliance. Allies and new Heads of Household Austin and Vanessa planned to target Jeff and James as the strongest members of the opposing alliance with James as the upfront target and Jeff to be potentially backdoored. Austin and Vanessa planned for Vanessa to remain Head of Household after the Battle of the Block to allow her to improve her social connections. Austin nominated Jason and Meg, Jeff and James's allies, while Vanessa nominated James and John, who again had been recruited to throw the Battle of the Block competition in exchange for future protection. To remove suspicion, Austin told his nominees that Audrey, not Jeff, was the backdoor target.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Gronk's A-maze-ing Foam Party\"):''' One at a time, a competitor searched through a pile of clothing for a patterned item and then waded through a foam maze to deliver it to the person wearing that pattern. After bringing the person to the starting platform, the player then switched out with their partner. The first pair that brought ten people out of the maze earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nFor the second week in a row, John had no need to throw the competition, as James was confused by the patterns. Jason and Meg won the competition, dethroning Austin and keeping Vanessa in power.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 555\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n| Title = Episode 10\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|15}}\n| Aux1 = Days 23\u201326\n| ShortSummary = To minimize the blood on her hands, Vanessa decided she was not going to try to backdoor Jeff, though Jeff made himself more of a target after telling Austin that he wanted to target Shelli and talking about his suspicions about Liz being a twin. Audrey, Austin, and Shelli were randomly chosen to compete in the Veto competition. In order to justify not nominating her as a replacement if the Veto was used, Vanessa conspired with the Sixth Sense to throw the competition to Audrey.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Gronk and Roll\"):''' Two players in giant six-sided [[dice]] went head-to-head. A number between one and six would be randomly selected, and the two competitors maneuvered around the playing field attempting to return to their starting platform with the correct number on top. The first to do so stayed in the competition, eliminating their opponent. After five rounds, the last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nThe plot to throw the competition to Audrey was foiled after she was defeated by John, and he went on to defeat Austin in the final round to earn his second consecutive Veto. Vanessa, now needing to find a replacement nominee, accused Austin of throwing the final round to John. As part of Rob Gronkowski's BB Takeover, he mandated that all HouseGuests participate in parties; any non-participating HouseGuests would become Have-Nots. All of the HouseGuests participated. Jeff talked to Vanessa to ensure his safety and realized that she had no intention of nominating Audrey. Jason then alerted Jeff to the fact that Austin and Vanessa were working together, which Jeff told Clay, unaware that Clay was also working with them. Austin decided to call Jeff out for talking against him, and Jeff's resulting confrontation with Vanessa provided enough reason for her to nominate him.\n\n*'''Luxury Competition:''' The week's competition winners\u2014Austin, Vanessa, Jason, Meg, and John\u2014picked a cup at random; one of the cups had a chip at the bottom that would earn its owner a cabin on a three-day cruise with Rob.\n\nMeg won the Luxury Competition.

Liz returned to the house, much to the delight of Austin, who had been developing feelings for her. Jeff, during his campaign, told Liz that he knew about the Twin Twist, and she decided to flirt with him in order to control him. Austin walked in on the two lying in bed together under the covers, which made him angry and jealous. Jeff's campaigning ultimately earned him votes from Jackie, John, Liz, and Steve, but it wasn't enough, as he became the third HouseGuest to be evicted from the house after the other seven voters voted against him.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Bustin' Moves\"):''' The HouseGuests were asked true or false questions based on a 1990s-inspired dance routine they had just watched; HouseGuests who answered incorrectly were eliminated. The last two HouseGuests remaining became the new Heads of Household.\n\nAfter just three questions, Liz and Shelli became the new Heads of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 4|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 557\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 12\n| Title = Episode 12\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|19}}\n| Aux1 = Days 29\u201330\n| ShortSummary = After it was revealed that four people voted to save Jeff, members of the Sixth Sense tried to figure out who the four were, unaware that one was among them\u2014Liz. With Liz as one of the new Heads of Household, HouseGuests suspicious about her being a twin\u2014especially John\u2014scoured her new bedroom for clues. Jackie, now without any allies thanks to Jeff's eviction, was approached by Austin in order to potentially work with her later and told her that she was likely to be nominated by Liz. After Jackie discussed her impending nomination with Shelli, Shelli considered severing ties with the volatile Austin. Audrey told Shelli that Jason was coming after her; deciding to target him, Shelli and Clay recruited John to be a pawn, this time to ensure that Jason went home. Liz nominated Jackie and James while Shelli nominated Jason and John. After Liz assured Jackie that she was safe, Jackie asked Liz who the real target was, which angered Liz. Shelli told Jason that Audrey had told her that he was targeting her, which Jason denied. After Audrey told Shelli that it was a lie, Shelli considered nominating her if the Power of Veto was used.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"[[Grunge (music)|Grunge]] BoB\"):''' The pairs dove through [[mudhoney]] to get to four zones themed after grunge bands from the 1990s\u2014[[Pearl Jam]], [[Screaming Trees]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Smashing Pumpkins]]\u2014to find one key in each. They then used the four keys to unlock a mannequin, [[Alice in Chains|Alice]], tied up in chains. The first pair that unchained Alice and took her to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], the finish platform, won the competition.\n\nThough Jason and John had an early lead, they fell behind in the pumpkin smashing zone, which allowed Jackie and James to come from behind to win the competition, dethroning Liz and keeping Shelli in power and putting the plan to backdoor Audrey in jeopardy again. As punishment for losing the competition or being dethroned, Jason, John, and Liz were forced to dress up as a [[boy band]] and dance together at routine intervals.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 558\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n| Title = Episode 13\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|22}}\n| Aux1 = Days 30\u201333\n| ShortSummary = Audrey, having exposed her manipulations to Shelli, vented her frustration to James and urged him to target Shelli and Clay if he ever became Head of Household; he subsequently ratted her out. Clay later discussed it with Audrey while trying to dissuade her paranoia regarding being backdoored. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, James, Meg, and Vanessa were chosen to compete. After Audrey wasn't chosen to compete for the Veto, all of those chosen plotted to use it on John so that Shelli could nominate Audrey as the replacement, though Shelli was later distraught regarding her impending decision.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Saved by the Smell\"):''' In each round, the six competitors were given a list of chemicals and then instructed to pour a specific chemical based on a question about the list. If a competitor was incorrect, they would be eliminated and splattered with paint; the last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nIn the fifth round, Vanessa beat Jason and John to win the competition. After Audrey complained about her loneliness in the game to Clay, he berated her for not trusting their alliance, which quickly escalated into an argument after Audrey denied asking Clay if Shelli was going to backdoor her, leading to subsequent altercations with Shelli and Vanessa. After the confrontations, Audrey secluded herself from the other HouseGuests and didn't even attend the Veto Meeting, although it didn't matter because Vanessa used the Power of Veto on Jason, and Shelli nominated Audrey in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 559\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 14\n| Title = Episode 14\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|23}}\n| Aux1 = Days 33\u201336\n| ShortSummary = After spending five hours in the Diary Room before the Veto Meeting, Audrey retreated to the Have-Not room, prompting the other HouseGuests to wonder if she would quit the game. Ultimately, Audrey remained in the game until eviction night when she became the fourth HouseGuest to be evicted after everyone except Austin voted against her, and she received a penalty vote for breaking the Have-Not rule by eating regular food.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Pop Till You Drop\"):''' Two HouseGuests, competing head-to-head, listened to a 1990s pop song about a past competition. The first to buzz in with the correct competition type (\"Head of Household,\" \"Battle of the Block,\" or \"Power of Veto\") won the round, and the other HouseGuest was eliminated. If the first player to buzz in was wrong, they were eliminated and the other HouseGuest would choose the next match-up.

Jason, along with Meg, told Shelli and Vanessa, both of whom continued to lose trust in Austin. After the eviction and the Head of Household competition, Austin lied to Vanessa about his conversation with Jason, and she conspired with Clay, Shelli, and Jackie to betray him. Jackie and Vanessa decided to work together to backdoor Austin and to ensure that Jackie became the surviving Head of Household as Vanessa had already been the surviving Head of Household once before. Vanessa nominated Becky and a volunteering Clay with the hope that they would win and be safe while Jackie nominated Liz and James, who had been recruited to throw the Battle of the Block. An alliance of Vanessa, Jackie, Shelli, Clay, Jason, James, Becky, and Meg called Dark Moon was formed with the idea of them being the final eight HouseGuests.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Splashy Headlines\"):''' The pairs threw paint around a room to reveal letters that spelled the names of three ''[[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|Big Brother 16]]'' HouseGuests. The first pair to correctly identify the three names earned safety for the week, and they, plus the surviving Head of Household, won a private [[Outback Steakhouse]] dinner.\n\nThe plan to backdoor Austin was put in jeopardy when Liz was able to win the Battle of the Block all by herself, securing immunity for the week for herself and James and all but ensuring Julia's entry into the game after the upcoming eviction.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 561\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 16\n| Title = Episode 16\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|29}}\n| Aux1 = Days 37\u201340\n| ShortSummary = Though the initial plan to backdoor Austin was foiled after James and Liz won the Battle of the Block, Vanessa assured the now-dethroned Jackie that she was still committed to backdooring Austin.

Shelli, Liz, and John were drawn to join Vanessa, Becky, and Clay in the Power of Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Get Nutty\"):''' The competitors rolled a plastic acorn back and forth on a ramp; the first competitor to roll it 250 times in a row without dropping it won the Power of Veto.\n\nClay won the Power of Veto, setting the plan to backdoor Austin in motion. Vanessa first told Liz about it and then decided to confront Austin about what he had said to Jason. When Austin relayed his heated conversation with Vanessa to Clay and Shelli, they realized that they needed to keep him in the game as, despite his volatility, he was loyal to them. Clay and Shelli attempted to convince Vanessa to change the plan, and Vanessa proposed getting rid of Jason, the smartest player outside of the Sixth Sense.

Shelli, not wanting to be Head of Household for a third time, proposed a deal to John and James for her and Clay's safety for the week. James agreed to keep them and John safe, and John and Shelli dropped off to make James the sole Head of Household, taking the Sixth Sense out of power for the first time since Week 1. Now in the house together, Julia and Liz discussed Austin telling Jason that he would target Julia; though Liz believed that Austin was trustworthy and that Jason had been lying, Julia was firmly against Austin. Finally in control, Jackie, James, and Meg decided to target Clay and Shelli for betraying them the previous week and debated putting them both up directly or backdooring Shelli. They discussed it with Becky who, unbeknownst to them, relayed James's plan back to Clay and Shelli. Clay and Shelli tried to convince James to honor their deal and target Austin instead. Vanessa, knowing full well that she was responsible for sending two of James's closest allies home in Jeff and Jason in Week 3 and Week 5, respectively, offered James and one other person of his choice safety until the final seven, provided he didn't nominate her. James took Vanessa up on her deal and avenged Jason's blindside by nominating Clay and Shelli, breaking his deal with them that he had made earlier. Shelli called James out for betraying them and continued to claim that they had nothing to do with Jason's nomination, which further alienated Vanessa.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 564\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 19\n| Title = Episode 19\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|05}}\n| Aux1 = Days 44\u201347\n| ShortSummary = Clay and Shelli lamented being on the block with each other. Clay yelled at James for breaking their deal and told Shelli that he was ready to sacrifice himself to keep her, the bigger threat to win, in the game. Vanessa, upset that Clay and Shelli were refusing to own up to their roles in Jason's nomination, broke down, and James told her that it was that refusal that caused him to target them for eviction and not Vanessa. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jackie, Vanessa, and Becky were chosen to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Game of Throws\"):''' In each round, the competitors launched a dart onto a board that was divided into sections with assigned point values. The player who scored the fewest points in each round was eliminated. Upon elimination, each HouseGuest uncovered a prize that could be good or bad; they could then choose to keep their prize or trade it for another eliminated HouseGuest's prize. After all five rounds, the HouseGuest holding the Veto medallion won the Power of Veto.\n\nShelli initially won the Veto, but after the fifth round, James took the Veto for himself. Jackie had to wear a [[unitard]] shaped like a suit of armor, and Vanessa was forced to shine Jackie's armor for 24 hours. Clay won a trip to Ireland, and Becky won $5,000. Shelli had to perform a regimen with a sword 2,400 times in 24 hours; if she failed, then she would be ineligible to compete in the next Veto competition. After completing her punishment, Shelli attempted to get James to use the Power of Veto on her and to nominate Austin for being deceptive, but James chose not to use it, ensuring that Clay and Shelli would be separated.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 565\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 20\n| Title = Episode 20\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|06}}\n| Aux1 = Days 47\u201350\n| ShortSummary = Having had romantic feelings for each other since Day 1, Clay and Shelli vowed to not campaign against each other. James and his alliance targeted Shelli, but Vanessa campaigned to keep her. James told Austin that Clay and Shelli had campaigned against him but didn't reveal what they had told him. Vanessa, knowing the Sixth Sense was crumbling, affirmed with Austin, Shelli, and the twins that they needed to stay together. Knowing that their time together was running out, Clay and Shelli finally kissed. When discussing whom to eliminate, Vanessa campaigned hard for Shelli, alarming James and Jackie as to Vanessa's true motives. During the live eviction, Clay asked the voters to evict him; they respected his wish, and he became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house and the first to be evicted by a unanimous vote. After Clay's eviction, Julie informed the HouseGuests that the next nine evicted HouseGuests would make up the game-deciding Jury and that they may not be out of the game upon eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Midway Mayhem\"):''' The HouseGuests skated down an icy path while transporting liquid in a funnel to a container, which contained three labeled balls: Head of Household, $5,000, and a Never-Not Pass, which would exempt the winner from being a Have-Not for the remainder of the game. The first HouseGuest to retrieve each ball would receive the corresponding prize. Any HouseGuest could retrieve all three of their balls, but the game would end when a Head of Household ball was retrieved.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 7|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 566\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 21\n| Title = Episode 21\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|09}}\n| Aux1 = Days 50\u201351\n| ShortSummary = Hours before Clay's eviction, John told Clay that he would rather him stay than Shelli, as he was afraid that Vanessa would target him and recruit Shelli. Clay, in an attempt to patch things up, told Vanessa that James told John that Vanessa was targeting him, which resulted in a confrontation between Clay and James in which Clay threatened violence. Vanessa then publicly discussed the situation with Clay; though John admitted that James had nothing to do with it and it was all his thoughts, Vanessa didn't believe him. Clay, John and Shelli compared notes and realized that it was a whole misunderstanding. They realized that Vanessa's emotional outbursts were routinely used to send her targets home, and pledged to retaliate so that it wouldn't happen to them next. Becky had such a large lead in the HoH competition that she was able to win all three prizes. Though Becky had worked with both James' alliance and the Sixth Sense, many were unsure as to who she would target. Becky teamed up with Jackie, James and Meg to nominate Shelli and Steve under the guise of targeting Shelli as per the agreement of evicting her and Clay consecutively, but actually backdoor Vanessa, having eavesdropped on the confrontations between Clay, James and Vanessa earlier that day. Becky told Shelli about her plan and told her to act as if she didn't know to stop Vanessa from thinking something was up, though Vanessa became suspicious after Becky told her that John was the backdoor target and then refused to make a deal. At the nomination ceremony, Becky followed through with nominating Shelli and Steve, with Vanessa as the backdoor target.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 567\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 22\n| Title = Episode 22\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|12}}\n| Aux1 = Days 51\u201354\n| ShortSummary = Vanessa, afraid of being backdoored by Becky, asked both Shelli and Steve to choose her to play in the Veto competition if given the choice so that Vanessa could take one of them off the block and remain immune from being the replacement nominee. John later told Shelli to pick him to play, but she was hesitant about clueing Vanessa into the plan. John told Steve about the plan to backdoor Vanessa and also asked him to pick him for the Veto competition as well, but John said he wouldn't use the Veto to save him, only to save Shelli and ensure Vanessa's nomination, as he believed that no one would ever vote to evict Steve. Liz began developing romantic feelings for Austin, much to Julia's disapproval. When picking players for the Veto competition, Austin, Meg and Vanessa were chosen to compete.  Shelli picked the \"HouseGuest's Choice\" chip and chose Vanessa, upsetting John, Becky and Steve.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"BB Comics\"):''' The competitors ziplined past a display of 17 comic books designed after the HouseGuests. One at a time, they had to replicate the display in order, but were given two copies of each cover with minor differences between them. The competitor to correctly assemble the display in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. \n\nSteve won the competition. A paranoid Vanessa interrogated James about Becky's plans and he told her to talk to Becky about it; during the conversation, Becky assured Vanessa that she wasn't going up. At the Veto ceremony, after Steve used the Veto on himself, Becky revealed her deception and nominated Vanessa in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 568\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 23\n| Title = Episode 23\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|13}}\n| Aux1 = Days 54\u201357\n| ShortSummary = A blindsided Vanessa attempted to confront Becky, but she refused to discuss it. Vanessa campaigned for votes; while she thought she could count on Steve's vote, he was hesitant and she felt betrayed. Vanessa told James that Becky was the one who fed information from his alliance to Shelli and Clay. Jackie, James and Meg realized that Shelli would be targeting James for sending Clay home, but Vanessa would go after Becky. James' alliance decided to betray Becky and vote against Shelli; Shelli became the seventh HouseGuest evicted from the house, the second unanimously, becoming the first Jury member in the process, blindsiding Becky and her allies. The HouseGuests were told that the night would be a double eviction, with a week's worth of competitions occurring that night, culminating in a second eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Getting Loopy\"):''' The night before the challenge, HouseGuests were shown looping video clips of 16 events from earlier that summer. The HouseGuests were given true or false statements based on the clips; incorrect HouseGuests were eliminated and the last one remaining became the new Head of Household. \n\nSteve won the competition; minutes later, he nominated Jackie and Meg for eviction. When picking players for the upcoming Veto competition, Vanessa, John, and James were selected by random draw to join them.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Slippery Slope\"):''' The six competitors rolled balls down a platform with three holes. The first HouseGuest to get a ball in each of the three holes in order won the Veto; competitors were eliminated if they sunk balls out of order. \n\nJohn won the Veto for a third time and chose not to use it, putting the plan to backdoor Becky in jeopardy and Jackie became the eighth HouseGuest evicted from the house after everyone except Becky voted against her, becoming the second Jury member, after which she stated in an interview with Julie that Steve nominated her after a rumor was spread that she was going to backdoor him, though her actual backdoor target was Austin.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 8|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 569\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 24\n| Title = Episode 24\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|16}}\n| Aux1 = Days 57\u201358\n| ShortSummary = During the Double Eviction, Steve's plan was to backdoor Becky, but John's third Veto victory foiled his plan.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Mixed Emojis\"):''' HouseGuests competed in a tournament-style bracket. In each round, HouseGuests were asked a question. They then had to find the correct emoji that answered the question. The first HouseGuest to hit the correct button moved on and eliminated their opponent. An incorrect answer resulted in their own elimination. The last HouseGuest standing became the new Head of Household. \n\nLiz became the new Head of Household and put her alliance back in power for the first time since Week 5. Liz debated either targeting Becky or Vanessa. However, at the nomination ceremony, Liz nominated Becky and John, with Becky as the target and Vanessa as a backdoor option.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 570\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 25\n| Title = Episode 25\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|19}}\n| Aux1 = Days 58\u201361\n| ShortSummary = After nominations, Becky told Austin and the twins that Vanessa was in on the plan to backdoor Austin in Week 5 in an attempt to convince Liz to consider backdooring Vanessa.

In each round, they were required to bring a butter with the HouseGuest's name that answered OTEV's riddle. The last HouseGuest to bring back the correct answer would be eliminated. The last HouseGuest remaining will win the Power of Veto. \n\nLiz defeated Austin in the final round to win the Power of Veto. Both Becky and John campaigned hard to Liz to use the Power of Veto and backdoor Vanessa. Even though Liz deeply considered putting Vanessa up, at the Veto Meeting, she decided not to use it, keeping her nominations intact.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 571\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 26\n| Title = Episode 26\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|20}}\n| Aux1 = Days 61\u201364\n| ShortSummary = Becky campaigned hard for votes to the HouseGuests.

Becky told Julie that should she return, she would work with Vanessa and go after Austin and the twins.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Ready, Set, Whoa\"):''' HouseGuests stood at the end of their own lane and held down three buttons with their hands and one foot. In each round, they had to hold down their buttons until the screens at the end of the lane went through the words \"ready,\" \"set\" and \"go.\" If any HouseGuest released a button before the word \"go,\" they were eliminated. The last HouseGuest to hit their button in each round was also eliminated.

Austin and the twins also thought about keeping Becky and using her to go after Vanessa. In the Head of Household competition, even though he considered throwing it, Austin beat James in the final round to become the new Head of Household. Austin was furious to be the new Head of Household due to having multiple deals with everyone in the game.

Zingbot arrived to heckle the HouseGuests and host the upcoming Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Newly Zingle\"):''' HouseGuests competed one at a time. Competitors looked at six of Zingbot's potential lovers on the new \"Zinder\" app. For each face, HouseGuests had to identify which three HouseGuests composed the face. The HouseGuest who identifies all six faces in the fastest amount of time will win the Power of Veto. \n\nVanessa finished in the fastest time and won the Power of Veto, foiling Austin's plan of backdooring her. Steve told Vanessa he was very excited about her Veto win. However, Vanessa knew he was fine with Austin's plan to backdoor her, so at the Veto meeting, Vanessa called Steve out on his bluff and decided to not use the Power of Veto, keeping Austin's nominations intact.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 574\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 29\n| Title = Episode 29\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|27}}\n| Aux1 = Days 68\u201371\n| ShortSummary = All of the HouseGuests were unsure of whom to evict. John hoped to gain James, Meg and Vanessa's votes. However, Vanessa told John she would be voting with the twins, which caused John to work for Liz and Julia's votes instead. Ultimately, John's campaigning was unsuccessful and he became the tenth HouseGuest evicted from the house,  becoming the fourth Jury member. Shortly after, John, along with Shelli, Jackie and Becky, re-entered the House to join the rest of the HouseGuests to have a chance to re-enter the game and possibly become the new Head of Household.\n\n*'''Head of Household/Battle to Return (\"Dizzyland\"):''' The eligible HouseGuests and jurors each stood on a small disc suspended by a hanging rope. As the competition continued, they were spun into hand-shaped punching bags, which caused them to spin more. The last juror standing on their rope re-entered the game, while the last HouseGuest remaining overall became the new Head of Household. \n\nJulia, Steve and Meg quickly fell off before the conclusion of the live show.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 10|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 575\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 30\n| Title = Episode 30\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|30}}\n| Aux1 = Days 71\u201372\n| ShortSummary = John, Shelli and Vanessa were the last competitors remaining.

After everyone hid their boxes, HouseGuests had two minutes to individually search the House for a Veto box. The competition continued until five Veto boxes had been found. The HouseGuest who hides their Veto box the best will win the Power of Veto. \n\nJames hid his Veto box under the living room rug and won the Power of Veto. Now desperately needing a replacement nominee and not wanting to break her secret alliance with John and Steve, Vanessa asked Julia if she would be fine with going up in James' place as a pawn to ensure Meg's eviction and weaken James. Austin and the twins urged Vanessa to nominate and evict John, unaware of her secret alliance with him.

The last HouseGuest remaining is the new Head of Household. \n\nThe final round came down to the twins, with Liz outlasting Julia and becoming a two-time HoH. Immediately after, Liz nominated James and John for eviction, citing that she had previous loyalties in the house to others. In the random draw for veto players, all of the HouseGuests competed except Vanessa were chosen to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Boomerang\")''': The HouseGuests rolled two balls onto a boomerang-shaped block, with slots on the other side of the block that are designated with specific point values.

Seasons 10 & 11 Jessie Godderz surprised the HouseGuests to host the Power of Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Bowlerina\")''': Jessie drew names out of a box to determine the order. In each round, two HouseGuests went head-to-head. HouseGuests had to hold onto a handle above their heads and spin 30 times to lower the gate at the end of their bowling lane for 30 seconds. This gave the HouseGuests the opportunity to bowl down their pins. The first HouseGuest to knock down their four pins in each round moved on and eliminated their opponent.

The twins asked for Julia to be evicted, knowing that Liz would fare better in future competitions. However, John and Vanessa considered evicting Liz due to her being the tie between Austin and Julia, and due to the fact that she is better in competitions. However, at the live eviction, John and Vanessa honored the twins' wishes and Julia was evicted from the house by a 3-0 vote.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Under the Rainbow\")''': Each HouseGuest has their own lane with a curved section of chicken wire.

Each HouseGuest had their own lane with a balance beam, a timer with a button, and a magnetic puzzle board. HouseGuests had to hit their button to magnetize their puzzle board for twenty seconds. They then had to walk across the beam to start working on their puzzle. Running out of time or falling off of the beam resulted in the puzzle board being demagnetized, forcing them to start their puzzle from scratch. After a board demagnetizes, that HouseGuest only has ten seconds to remagnetize their board or they will be eliminated from the competition. The first HouseGuest to complete their puzzle and hit their button will win the Power of Veto. \n\nVanessa was quickly eliminated after her board demagnetized and her time ran out. John had a strategy to build his puzzle in his tray instead of on the board, allowing him to walk on the grass as he pleased, then once he had his pieces situated, he could place them on the board correctly. His strategy proved effective and John won the Power of Veto for the fourth time. At the Veto Meeting, John used the Veto on himself and Vanessa nominated Austin in his place. At the live eviction ceremony, after John cast his vote to evict Austin and Liz cast hers to evict Steve, Vanessa cast the tie-breaking vote to send Austin to the jury and he became the fourteenth HouseGuest evicted from the house, becoming the seventh jury member.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"What the Bleep?!\")''': HouseGuests were shown a clip with a censored word(s). Julie then gave them a word that the censored word(s) could be. HouseGuests then had to decide if Julie's statement was true or false. The HouseGuest with the most points after seven clips will be the new Head of Household with a guaranteed place in the final three. \n\nAfter a tie-breaker question between John and Steve, Steve won his third Head of Household of the season.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 583\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 38\n| Title = Episode 38\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|16}}\n| Aux1 = Days 89\u201391\n| ShortSummary = With the final veto competition looming, John, Steve, and Vanessa hoped to win the Power of Veto to send Liz to the jury. At the final nomination ceremony of the summer, Steve nominated John and Vanessa for eviction. Caleb Reynolds from last season entered the House to host the final Veto competition of the summer.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Martial Smarts\")''': In each round, Caleb asked the HouseGuests on what day a certain event occurred. The HouseGuests then had to hit their karate partner, either a hand punch for one day, or a shin kick for 5 days, to display the correct day on their counter. If a HouseGuest buzzed in with an incorrect answer, their counter would drop to zero and would have to try again. The last HouseGuest to answer correctly in each round got one strike against them. Two strikes resulted in elimination from the competition. The last HouseGuest standing will win the final Power of Veto of the summer.\n\nThe competition came down to Vanessa and John, both with both strikes remaining. Vanessa won the last two rounds to win the Power of Veto. Liz campaigned to Vanessa, stating if she kept her, she would take her to the final two. At the Veto Meeting, Vanessa used the Power of Veto to save herself, with Liz going up in her stead. Vanessa then cast her vote to evict John, and he became the eighth member of the Jury.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 13|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 584\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 39\n| Title = Episode 39\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|20}}\n| Aux1 = Days 91\u201394\n| ShortSummary = Liz, Steve, and Vanessa reminisced about the summer's events.\n\n*'''Final Head of Household, Part 1 (\"How 'Bout Them Apples?\")''': HouseGuests sat on an apple-shaped ball and were dunked in chocolate; the last competitor remaining advanced to the third part of the competition, to face off against the winner of Part 2.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 585\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 40\n| Title = Episode 40\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|23}}\n| Aux1 = Days 91\u201398\n| ShortSummary = Steve fell 3 hours and 35 minutes into the competition. Liz dropped after Vanessa convinced her that she'd be more likely to beat Steve in Part 2, and Vanessa won Part 1 of the Final Head of Household competition. Steve and Liz then had to face off in Part 2 of the Final Head of Household competition.\n\n*'''Final Head of Household, Part 2 (\"Colossal Crossword\")''': HouseGuests competed individually. Each HouseGuest had a giant crossword puzzle with several clues. They had to scale the wall and collect the letters to spell the correct answer to each clue and place them in the crossword. The HouseGuest who completes the crossword and hits their button faster will face Vanessa in Part 3 of the Final Head of Household competition on Finale Night. \n\nSteve completed his puzzle faster than Liz, and advanced to face Vanessa in Part 3.\n\n*'''Final Head of Household, Part 3 (\"Scales of Just-Us\")''': Vanessa and Steve were asked questions based on how the members of the jury completed various statements. A correct answer resulted in receiving one point. The HouseGuest with the most points after 8 questions will become the final Head of Household of the summer.\n\nSteve defeated Vanessa and became the final Head of Household, guaranteeing himself a spot in the final two. He then immediately cast the sole vote to evict Vanessa after praising her strategic game. After the jury questioned the final two, they locked in their votes. Steve won the game after receiving Shelli, Jackie, Becky, Meg, James, and John's votes to win, and Liz became the runner-up with Vanessa, Austin, and Julia's votes. John, James, and Jason were the top three vote-getters for America's Favorite HouseGuest; James won. \n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Have-Nots==\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:100%; line-height:15px;\"\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 1\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 2\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 3\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 4\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 5\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 6\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 7\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 8\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 9\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 10\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 11\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 12\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 13\n|-\n| Austin,<br />Da'Vonne,<br />Liz,<br />Vanessa\n| James,<br />Jason,<br />Meg,<br />Steve\n| {{cNone|None}}\n| Audrey,<br />Becky,<br />Jackie,<br />John\n| Clay,<br />Shelli,<br />Steve\n| Austin,<br />Julia,<br />Liz\n| Jackie,<br />James,<br />Meg\n| John,<br />Steve,<br />Vanessa\n| {{cNone|None}}\n| James,<br />John,<br />Julia,<br />Meg\n| colspan=\"3\" {{cNone|None}}\n|}\n\n==Voting history==\n<!--<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">-->\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center; font-size:85%<!--Please keep the font size at this value for conforming to page margins.-->; line-height:12px;\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 1<!--Jason nominated FIRST in Week 1.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 2<!--Shelli nominated FIRST in Week 2.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 3<!--Austin nominated FIRST in Week 3.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 4<!--Liz nominated FIRST in Week 4.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 5<!--Jackie nominated FIRST in Week 5.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 6\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 7\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 8\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 9\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 10\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 11\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 12\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 13\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 50\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 57\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 71\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 78 \n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 85\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 89\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 98\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Finale\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Head(s) of Household<!--Please keep this in the order they nominated.

The contestants, referred to as \"HouseGuests,\" are sequestered in the Big Brother House with no contact to or from the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food, luxuries and power in the house.\n\nAt the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (HoH) competition. The winner of the HoH competition will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. As with [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|the previous season]], the first five weeks of the season feature two concurrent Heads of Household. Each HoH would nominate two other HouseGuests for eviction, totaling four nominees. The two pairs of nominees would then compete in the \"Battle of the Block\" competition. The winning pair would be removed from the block, with the HoH who nominated them dethroned. The dethroned HoH would later be eligible to be nominated as a replacement if the Veto was used, while the Battle of the Block winners are safe for the rest of the week. The rest of the cycle would continue as per usual, with the remaining HoH retaining immunity for the week, and the two nominees being eligible for safety through the Power of Veto. The reigning (or sole) HoH also earns the right to name the \"Have Nots\" for the week, forcing the chosen HouseGuests to eat solely \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food selection chosen by producers, take cold showers, and sleep in a bedroom designed to look like a dental clinic.\n\nEach week, six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (PoV) competition: the reigning HoH, their two nominees, and three HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is; if the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. The HouseGuest overthrown as a result of the Battle of the Block competition is eligible to be nominated by the reigning Head of Household if the Power of Veto is used.\n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests vote to evict one of the two nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household, who is only allowed to vote in the event of a tie, and in that case, must do so publicly. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. Unlike most other versions of Big Brother, the HouseGuests may openly and freely discuss the nomination and eviction process. The nominee with the majority of votes will be evicted from the house on the weekly live broadcast, exiting to an adjacent studio to be interviewed by Chen, after which the cycle begins again.\n\nHouseGuests may voluntarily leave the house at any time and those who break the rules may be expelled from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests will form the Big Brother jury, and vote for the winner during the season finale. The jury members will be sequestered in a separate house and will not be allowed to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests; the jury members will not be shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations.\n\n===Twists===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n\n====BB Takeover====\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\nCBS announced the season's twist, BB Takeover, on June 17, 2015, in which a surprise guest was to visit the house each week to reveal a different twist to the HouseGuests.<ref name=\"BB Takeover\">{{cite web|title='Big Brother' Announces this Season's New Twist, 'BB Takeover,' Featuring Weekly Surprise Guests Who Will Shake Up the House Each and Every Week|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=42928|website=CBS Press Express|accessdate=June 17, 2015|date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Though it was initially announced that there would be a guest every week, there were no Takeovers after Week 3; in an interview during the season, host Julie Chen stated that the twist had been cancelled because \"there was enough going on\u201d with the other elements of the game, though no official announcement was ever made to the HouseGuests.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why the Big Brother twist BB Takeover disappeared|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2015/08/bb17-bb-takeover-what-happened-julie-chen/|website=Reality Blurred|first=Andy|last=Dehnart|accessdate=August 11, 2015|date=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week\n! style=\"width:15%\"|Takeover guest\n! style=\"width:20%\"|Twist\n! style=\"width:60%\"|Effect\n|-\n! rowspan=2|1\n| rowspan=2|[[Phil Keoghan]]\n| Two additional HouseGuests\n| ''[[The Amazing Race 26]]'' alumni Jackie and Jeff entered the game.\n|-\n| [[#BB Fast Forward|BB Fast Forward]]\n| Immunity for the week was granted to the two HouseGuests who sat out of the first HoH competitions and one HouseGuest of their choice each.\n|-\n! 2\n| [[Kathy Griffin]]\n| [[#Last Laugh|The Last Laugh]]\n| The power to block three HouseGuests from voting in the next eviction was granted to the HouseGuest who answered the seventh call to a phone booth in the house.\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3\n| rowspan=2|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n| Gronk Party Week\n| Have-Nots were removed for the week, provided the HouseGuests participated in Gronk Parties throughout.\n|-\n| Luxury competition \n| All of the week's competition winners earned a chance to win a cabin on a three-day cruise.\n|}\n\n====Battle of the Block====\nThe Battle of the block was first introduced in [[Big Brother 16 (American season)|the sixteenth season]]. In the twist, 2 houseguests would be nominated by each Head of Household. The pairs of houseguests that were nominated would compete in The Battle of the Block competition.

The Battle of the block twist ended week six right after Jason Roy's eviction.\n\n====Twin Twist====\nAs with [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|the fifth season]], a pair of twins competed as one, switching every few days between the house and a sequester location off-site; the twins, Liz and Julia, played as Liz, changing places in the Diary Room with approximately 10 minutes to catch each other up.

A mutual attraction began to form between Clay and Shelli, as did an early alliance between Audrey, Da'Vonne, and Shelli. Julie Chen revealed the return of the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#Battle of the Block|Battle of the Block]] twist and announced the first Head of Household competition. First, the HouseGuests were told that one of them would have to sit out of the competition; Da'Vonne volunteered in exchange for none of the others nominating her, to which they all agreed.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Flying Tomatoes\"):''' The HouseGuests, standing on movable perches, were pelted with plastic tomatoes; as HouseGuests fell off, they were eliminated. The first HouseGuest to catch ten tomatoes or the last one remaining on the perch, whichever occurred first, became the first Head of Household.\n\nAudrey, Jace, James, and Shelli were the final four competitors remaining, but all fell off at the same time; upon review of the footage, James was determined to have fallen off last, so he was named the first Head of Household. The HouseGuests were told about the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#BB Takeover|BB Takeover]], in which a new twist would be introduced every week. Addressing the viewing public, Julie revealed the final twist, which would be kept secret from the HouseGuests.

Vanessa held court to help her with her decision and settled on Austin. Da'Vonne decided not to protect her allies Audrey and Shelli in order to hide their alliance and picked Liz instead. Da'Vonne's decision angered Shelli, and she later flirted with Clay, which made Da'Vonne question her loyalty. Austin and Jace bonded and later formed an alliance called ShellTown, but Jace's brash remarks and physique made him a target to several HouseGuests, including Jason. James and Jason teamed up with Audrey and Da'Vonne to backdoor Jace and tried to recruit other HouseGuests to be nominated as pawns.

While preparing for a possible future counting competition, Da'Vonne wandered into all the rooms, alarming Clay, Jeff, and Shelli, which led to both factions plotting against each other. Jeff and Clay's attempts to address the situation led to further confrontations, and Audrey later tried to get Clay and Da'Vonne to make up, to no avail. Audrey and Da'Vonne independently considered betraying each other\u2014Audrey for Da'Vonne's attitude and Da'Vonne for Audrey's constant meddling.

When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, John, Jason, and Becky were selected to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Nose-a Scotia\"):''' The six competitors dug for pieces with a letter on them; each letter had an assigned point value. The HouseGuest who made the correctly-spelled word that was worth the most points won the Power of Veto.\n\nSteve won the Power of Veto with the word \"trombonists.\" Audrey decided to bring Jeff and Shelli into her main alliance, but her incessant strategizing in the middle of the night alienated her allies, making James consider putting her up as the replacement nominee. However, at the Veto Meeting, Steve used the Power of Veto on himself, and James followed through on his original plan and nominated Jace.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 550\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n| Title = Episode 5\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|02}}\n| Aux1 = Days 10\u201315\n| ShortSummary = After his nomination, an agitated Jace attempted to rally support, to no avail. Audrey told Jace that she had no part in his nomination but later told him that the whole house was involved; he saw through her lies and later threatened to expose her manipulations. Host Julie Chen revealed that Liz and her twin sister, Julia, were competing as one in the Twin Twist and would switch places again while casting a vote that night. During the live eviction, everyone except Audrey voted against Jace, and he became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house. Actress and comedian [[Kathy Griffin]] arrived for the season's second takeover and revealed to the viewing public that there would be a telephone booth in the house, ringing periodically. The HouseGuest who answered the seventh call would earn the right to stop three HouseGuests from voting in the next eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Ginger Fever\"):''' Divided into two groups of seven by random draw, the HouseGuests raced to assemble a puzzle. The first HouseGuest in each round that assembled their puzzle became the new Heads of Household.\n\nBecky and Shelli won their respective rounds and became the new Heads of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 2|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 551\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n| Title = Episode 6\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|05}}\n| Aux1 = Days 13\u201316\n| ShortSummary = Two days before Jace's eviction, Audrey told her alliance that Vanessa was the leader of an opposing, all-girls alliance and then told Vanessa that Da'Vonne had started that rumor. After Vanessa tried to talk things out with Da'Vonne, Da'Vonne realized that Audrey had been lying and called an alliance meeting; after Audrey refused to own up to her machinations, she was exiled from her alliance.\n\nWith Becky and Shelli as the Heads of Household, the HouseGuests scrambled to ensure their safety, except for Audrey, who decided to lay low to reduce her target. Becky proposed backdooring Audrey; while Shelli initially agreed, she later conspired with Clay and Jeff to target Da'Vonne after their altercation the previous week. The trio recruited John to be nominated as a pawn and told him to throw the Battle of the Block competition while pledging that they would do whatever they could to ensure his safety. Shelli nominated Da'Vonne and John while Becky, still hoping to backdoor Audrey, nominated Jason\u2014as payback for him putting her up the previous week\u2014and Steve.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Give Me Props\"):''' The pairs, conjoined by a single shirt and a three-legged pair of pants, operated nine cameras and repositioned them to follow a shot list; the cameras corresponded to a specific shot but were unlabeled. The first pair that correctly lined up all nine cameras earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nJason and Steve only operated two cameras at a time, which proved to be an effective strategy. Meanwhile, Da'Vonne's idea to turn on all nine cameras at once put her and John at a disadvantage, and he didn't even need to actively try to throw the competition. Jason and Steve handily won the competition, dethroning Becky and keeping Shelli in power and putting the plan to backdoor Audrey in jeopardy.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 552\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n| Title = Episode 7\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|08}}\n| Aux1 = Days 16\u201319\n| ShortSummary = While a dethroned Becky was convinced that the plan to backdoor Audrey was still on the agenda, Shelli continued to plot Da'Vonne's eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Meg, Steve, and Clay were drawn to join Shelli, Da'Vonne, and John.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"High Maintenance\"):''' Two competitors would be given a list of seven items and then shown an image with six of those items. The first competitor to press their buzzer after retrieving the missing item from an adjacent room would win the round, and the other competitor would be eliminated from the competition. If the first player to press their buzzer brought back a wrong item, they would be eliminated. The winner would then choose one of the remaining competitors to play in the next round who in turn would choose their opponent. The last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nIn the final round, John beat Clay to win the Power of Veto, which forced Shelli to find a replacement nominee. After unsuccessfully trying to get John to not use the Veto on himself, Shelli considered nominating Liz. Liz's allies Austin and Vanessa tried to get Shelli to put Meg up instead, telling Shelli that Meg was going to work with Da'Vonne, James, and Jason to save Da'Vonne and target Clay and Shelli and that the only way to ensure Da'Vonne's eviction was to nominate Meg as a pawn. Audrey later reprimanded Clay for being condescending, which prompted Clay to convince Shelli to nominate Audrey instead. However, at the Veto Meeting, after John used the Power of Veto on himself, Shelli decided to listen to Austin and Vanessa and nominated Meg.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 553\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n| Title = Episode 8\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|09}}\n| Aux1 = Days 19\u201322\n| ShortSummary = A telephone booth appeared in the house for Kathy's BB Takeover, and she told the HouseGuests about the Last Laugh twist. Da'Vonne answered the seventh call and earned the power to stop three of the HouseGuests from voting in the upcoming eviction, which meant that she only needed five votes to survive the eviction. Da'Vonne and Jason suspected that Liz had been playing with a twin and alerted the other HouseGuests. Da'Vonne tried to use this information as leverage to secure Liz's vote. At the live eviction, Da'Vonne used the power of the Last Laugh to stop Becky, Jackie, and Jeff from voting, but it didn't matter, as she was evicted anyway after everyone except Audrey and Jason voted against her, and she became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house. [[New England Patriots]] [[tight end]] [[Rob Gronkowski]] kicked off his BB Takeover, Gronk's Party Week, by announcing that there would be no Have-Nots that week.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Gronk Pong\"):''' One at a time, each HouseGuest launched a ball toward 55 oversized cups arranged in the shape of a triangle. Each cup had its own unique point value; the two HouseGuests with the highest scores became the new Heads of Household.\n\nAustin became the first new Head of Household while James, Liz, and Vanessa tied for second; Vanessa won the tiebreaker and became the second new Head of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 3|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 554\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n| Title = Episode 9\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|12}}\n| Aux1 = Days 21\u201323\n| ShortSummary = The night before Da'Vonne's eviction, Vanessa confronted Liz, not knowing it was actually Julia, about the rumors of her being a twin, which Julia confessed to, and Vanessa brought in Austin, Clay, and Shelli to protect the twins and ensure that they make it past the first five evictions in order to increase their numbers. The next night, \nJulia and Liz switched again, and Liz joined her new allies in officially forming the Sixth Sense alliance. Allies and new Heads of Household Austin and Vanessa planned to target Jeff and James as the strongest members of the opposing alliance with James as the upfront target and Jeff to be potentially backdoored. Austin and Vanessa planned for Vanessa to remain Head of Household after the Battle of the Block to allow her to improve her social connections. Austin nominated Jason and Meg, Jeff and James's allies, while Vanessa nominated James and John, who again had been recruited to throw the Battle of the Block competition in exchange for future protection. To remove suspicion, Austin told his nominees that Audrey, not Jeff, was the backdoor target.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Gronk's A-maze-ing Foam Party\"):''' One at a time, a competitor searched through a pile of clothing for a patterned item and then waded through a foam maze to deliver it to the person wearing that pattern. After bringing the person to the starting platform, the player then switched out with their partner. The first pair that brought ten people out of the maze earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nFor the second week in a row, John had no need to throw the competition, as James was confused by the patterns.

Audrey, Austin, and Shelli were randomly chosen to compete in the Veto competition. In order to justify not nominating her as a replacement if the Veto was used, Vanessa conspired with the Sixth Sense to throw the competition to Audrey.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Gronk and Roll\"):''' Two players in giant six-sided [[dice]] went head-to-head. A number between one and six would be randomly selected, and the two competitors maneuvered around the playing field attempting to return to their starting platform with the correct number on top. The first to do so stayed in the competition, eliminating their opponent. After five rounds, the last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nThe plot to throw the competition to Audrey was foiled after she was defeated by John, and he went on to defeat Austin in the final round to earn his second consecutive Veto. Vanessa, now needing to find a replacement nominee, accused Austin of throwing the final round to John. As part of Rob Gronkowski's BB Takeover, he mandated that all HouseGuests participate in parties; any non-participating HouseGuests would become Have-Nots. All of the HouseGuests participated. Jeff talked to Vanessa to ensure his safety and realized that she had no intention of nominating Audrey. Jason then alerted Jeff to the fact that Austin and Vanessa were working together, which Jeff told Clay, unaware that Clay was also working with them. Austin decided to call Jeff out for talking against him, and Jeff's resulting confrontation with Vanessa provided enough reason for her to nominate him.\n\n*'''Luxury Competition:''' The week's competition winners\u2014Austin, Vanessa, Jason, Meg, and John\u2014picked a cup at random; one of the cups had a chip at the bottom that would earn its owner a cabin on a three-day cruise with Rob.\n\nMeg won the Luxury Competition.

Liz returned to the house, much to the delight of Austin, who had been developing feelings for her. Jeff, during his campaign, told Liz that he knew about the Twin Twist, and she decided to flirt with him in order to control him. Austin walked in on the two lying in bed together under the covers, which made him angry and jealous. Jeff's campaigning ultimately earned him votes from Jackie, John, Liz, and Steve, but it wasn't enough, as he became the third HouseGuest to be evicted from the house after the other seven voters voted against him.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Bustin' Moves\"):''' The HouseGuests were asked true or false questions based on a 1990s-inspired dance routine they had just watched; HouseGuests who answered incorrectly were eliminated.

With Liz as one of the new Heads of Household, HouseGuests suspicious about her being a twin\u2014especially John\u2014scoured her new bedroom for clues. Jackie, now without any allies thanks to Jeff's eviction, was approached by Austin in order to potentially work with her later and told her that she was likely to be nominated by Liz. After Jackie discussed her impending nomination with Shelli, Shelli considered severing ties with the volatile Austin. Audrey told Shelli that Jason was coming after her; deciding to target him, Shelli and Clay recruited John to be a pawn, this time to ensure that Jason went home. Liz nominated Jackie and James while Shelli nominated Jason and John. After Liz assured Jackie that she was safe, Jackie asked Liz who the real target was, which angered Liz. Shelli told Jason that Audrey had told her that he was targeting her, which Jason denied. After Audrey told Shelli that it was a lie, Shelli considered nominating her if the Power of Veto was used.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"[[Grunge (music)|Grunge]] BoB\"):''' The pairs dove through [[mudhoney]] to get to four zones themed after grunge bands from the 1990s\u2014[[Pearl Jam]], [[Screaming Trees]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Smashing Pumpkins]]\u2014to find one key in each. They then used the four keys to unlock a mannequin, [[Alice in Chains|Alice]], tied up in chains. The first pair that unchained Alice and took her to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], the finish platform, won the competition.\n\nThough Jason and John had an early lead, they fell behind in the pumpkin smashing zone, which allowed Jackie and James to come from behind to win the competition, dethroning Liz and keeping Shelli in power and putting the plan to backdoor Audrey in jeopardy again.

Clay later discussed it with Audrey while trying to dissuade her paranoia regarding being backdoored. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, James, Meg, and Vanessa were chosen to compete. After Audrey wasn't chosen to compete for the Veto, all of those chosen plotted to use it on John so that Shelli could nominate Audrey as the replacement, though Shelli was later distraught regarding her impending decision.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Saved by the Smell\"):''' In each round, the six competitors were given a list of chemicals and then instructed to pour a specific chemical based on a question about the list. If a competitor was incorrect, they would be eliminated and splattered with paint; the last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nIn the fifth round, Vanessa beat Jason and John to win the competition. After Audrey complained about her loneliness in the game to Clay, he berated her for not trusting their alliance, which quickly escalated into an argument after Audrey denied asking Clay if Shelli was going to backdoor her, leading to subsequent altercations with Shelli and Vanessa. After the confrontations, Audrey secluded herself from the other HouseGuests and didn't even attend the Veto Meeting, although it didn't matter because Vanessa used the Power of Veto on Jason, and Shelli nominated Audrey in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 559\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 14\n| Title = Episode 14\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|23}}\n| Aux1 = Days 33\u201336\n| ShortSummary = After spending five hours in the Diary Room before the Veto Meeting, Audrey retreated to the Have-Not room, prompting the other HouseGuests to wonder if she would quit the game. Ultimately, Audrey remained in the game until eviction night when she became the fourth HouseGuest to be evicted after everyone except Austin voted against her, and she received a penalty vote for breaking the Have-Not rule by eating regular food.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Pop Till You Drop\"):''' Two HouseGuests, competing head-to-head, listened to a 1990s pop song about a past competition. The first to buzz in with the correct competition type (\"Head of Household,\" \"Battle of the Block,\" or \"Power of Veto\") won the round, and the other HouseGuest was eliminated. If the first player to buzz in was wrong, they were eliminated and the other HouseGuest would choose the next match-up.

Jason, along with Meg, told Shelli and Vanessa, both of whom continued to lose trust in Austin. After the eviction and the Head of Household competition, Austin lied to Vanessa about his conversation with Jason, and she conspired with Clay, Shelli, and Jackie to betray him. Jackie and Vanessa decided to work together to backdoor Austin and to ensure that Jackie became the surviving Head of Household as Vanessa had already been the surviving Head of Household once before. Vanessa nominated Becky and a volunteering Clay with the hope that they would win and be safe while Jackie nominated Liz and James, who had been recruited to throw the Battle of the Block. An alliance of Vanessa, Jackie, Shelli, Clay, Jason, James, Becky, and Meg called Dark Moon was formed with the idea of them being the final eight HouseGuests.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Splashy Headlines\"):''' The pairs threw paint around a room to reveal letters that spelled the names of three ''[[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|Big Brother 16]]'' HouseGuests. The first pair to correctly identify the three names earned safety for the week, and they, plus the surviving Head of Household, won a private [[Outback Steakhouse]] dinner.\n\nThe plan to backdoor Austin was put in jeopardy when Liz was able to win the Battle of the Block all by herself, securing immunity for the week for herself and James and all but ensuring Julia's entry into the game after the upcoming eviction.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 561\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 16\n| Title = Episode 16\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|29}}\n| Aux1 = Days 37\u201340\n| ShortSummary = Though the initial plan to backdoor Austin was foiled after James and Liz won the Battle of the Block, Vanessa assured the now-dethroned Jackie that she was still committed to backdooring Austin. Austin's attraction to Liz developed; though she enjoyed her time with him, she privately admitted that she didn't return his affections, though he was unaware and kissed her anyway. Shelli, Liz, and John were drawn to join Vanessa, Becky, and Clay in the Power of Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Get Nutty\"):''' The competitors rolled a plastic acorn back and forth on a ramp; the first competitor to roll it 250 times in a row without dropping it won the Power of Veto.\n\nClay won the Power of Veto, setting the plan to backdoor Austin in motion. Vanessa first told Liz about it and then decided to confront Austin about what he had said to Jason. When Austin relayed his heated conversation with Vanessa to Clay and Shelli, they realized that they needed to keep him in the game as, despite his volatility, he was loyal to them. Clay and Shelli attempted to convince Vanessa to change the plan, and Vanessa proposed getting rid of Jason, the smartest player outside of the Sixth Sense. At the Veto Meeting, Clay used the Power of Veto on himself, and Vanessa nominated Jason in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 562\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 17\n| Title = Episode 17\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|30}}\n| Aux1 = Days 40\u201343\n| ShortSummary = After Jason's nomination, the members of Dark Moon not in the Sixth Sense\u2014Becky, Jackie, James, Jason, and Meg\u2014felt betrayed by Vanessa and discussed it with Clay and Shelli. Though Clay and Shelli remained adamant about not knowing about Jason's nomination, Jason realized that they had known, and their refusal to own up to it worried Vanessa, who had to shoulder the entire blame for the plan. The alliance of Jackie, James, Jason, and Meg campaigned for Jason's safety, but it wasn't enough as he became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house after only James and Meg voted to keep him. Having survived five evictions, Liz and Julia earned the right to compete as individuals, and Julia officially entered the game as a HouseGuest.

Shelli, not wanting to be Head of Household for a third time, proposed a deal to John and James for her and Clay's safety for the week. James agreed to keep them and John safe, and John and Shelli dropped off to make James the sole Head of Household, taking the Sixth Sense out of power for the first time since Week 1. Now in the house together, Julia and Liz discussed Austin telling Jason that he would target Julia; though Liz believed that Austin was trustworthy and that Jason had been lying, Julia was firmly against Austin. Finally in control, Jackie, James, and Meg decided to target Clay and Shelli for betraying them the previous week and debated putting them both up directly or backdooring Shelli. They discussed it with Becky who, unbeknownst to them, relayed James's plan back to Clay and Shelli. Clay and Shelli tried to convince James to honor their deal and target Austin instead. Vanessa, knowing full well that she was responsible for sending two of James's closest allies home in Jeff and Jason in Week 3 and Week 5, respectively, offered James and one other person of his choice safety until the final seven, provided he didn't nominate her. James took Vanessa up on her deal and avenged Jason's blindside by nominating Clay and Shelli, breaking his deal with them that he had made earlier. Shelli called James out for betraying them and continued to claim that they had nothing to do with Jason's nomination, which further alienated Vanessa.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 564\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 19\n| Title = Episode 19\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|05}}\n| Aux1 = Days 44\u201347\n| ShortSummary = Clay and Shelli lamented being on the block with each other. Clay yelled at James for breaking their deal and told Shelli that he was ready to sacrifice himself to keep her, the bigger threat to win, in the game. Vanessa, upset that Clay and Shelli were refusing to own up to their roles in Jason's nomination, broke down, and James told her that it was that refusal that caused him to target them for eviction and not Vanessa. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jackie, Vanessa, and Becky were chosen to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Game of Throws\"):''' In each round, the competitors launched a dart onto a board that was divided into sections with assigned point values.

Shelli had to perform a regimen with a sword 2,400 times in 24 hours; if she failed, then she would be ineligible to compete in the next Veto competition.

Vanessa, knowing the Sixth Sense was crumbling, affirmed with Austin, Shelli, and the twins that they needed to stay together. Knowing that their time together was running out, Clay and Shelli finally kissed. When discussing whom to eliminate, Vanessa campaigned hard for Shelli, alarming James and Jackie as to Vanessa's true motives. During the live eviction, Clay asked the voters to evict him; they respected his wish, and he became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house and the first to be evicted by a unanimous vote. After Clay's eviction, Julie informed the HouseGuests that the next nine evicted HouseGuests would make up the game-deciding Jury and that they may not be out of the game upon eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Midway Mayhem\"):''' The HouseGuests skated down an icy path while transporting liquid in a funnel to a container, which contained three labeled balls: Head of Household, $5,000, and a Never-Not Pass, which would exempt the winner from being a Have-Not for the remainder of the game.

Clay, in an attempt to patch things up, told Vanessa that James told John that Vanessa was targeting him, which resulted in a confrontation between Clay and James in which Clay threatened violence. Vanessa then publicly discussed the situation with Clay; though John admitted that James had nothing to do with it and it was all his thoughts, Vanessa didn't believe him. Clay, John and Shelli compared notes and realized that it was a whole misunderstanding. They realized that Vanessa's emotional outbursts were routinely used to send her targets home, and pledged to retaliate so that it wouldn't happen to them next. Becky had such a large lead in the HoH competition that she was able to win all three prizes. Though Becky had worked with both James' alliance and the Sixth Sense, many were unsure as to who she would target. Becky teamed up with Jackie, James and Meg to nominate Shelli and Steve under the guise of targeting Shelli as per the agreement of evicting her and Clay consecutively, but actually backdoor Vanessa, having eavesdropped on the confrontations between Clay, James and Vanessa earlier that day. Becky told Shelli about her plan and told her to act as if she didn't know to stop Vanessa from thinking something was up, though Vanessa became suspicious after Becky told her that John was the backdoor target and then refused to make a deal. At the nomination ceremony, Becky followed through with nominating Shelli and Steve, with Vanessa as the backdoor target.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 567\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 22\n| Title = Episode 22\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|12}}\n| Aux1 = Days 51\u201354\n| ShortSummary = Vanessa, afraid of being backdoored by Becky, asked both Shelli and Steve to choose her to play in the Veto competition if given the choice so that Vanessa could take one of them off the block and remain immune from being the replacement nominee. John later told Shelli to pick him to play, but she was hesitant about clueing Vanessa into the plan. John told Steve about the plan to backdoor Vanessa and also asked him to pick him for the Veto competition as well, but John said he wouldn't use the Veto to save him, only to save Shelli and ensure Vanessa's nomination, as he believed that no one would ever vote to evict Steve. Liz began developing romantic feelings for Austin, much to Julia's disapproval. When picking players for the Veto competition, Austin, Meg and Vanessa were chosen to compete.  Shelli picked the \"HouseGuest's Choice\" chip and chose Vanessa, upsetting John, Becky and Steve.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"BB Comics\"):''' The competitors ziplined past a display of 17 comic books designed after the HouseGuests. One at a time, they had to replicate the display in order, but were given two copies of each cover with minor differences between them.

Jackie, James and Meg realized that Shelli would be targeting James for sending Clay home, but Vanessa would go after Becky. James' alliance decided to betray Becky and vote against Shelli; Shelli became the seventh HouseGuest evicted from the house, the second unanimously, becoming the first Jury member in the process, blindsiding Becky and her allies. The HouseGuests were told that the night would be a double eviction, with a week's worth of competitions occurring that night, culminating in a second eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Getting Loopy\"):''' The night before the challenge, HouseGuests were shown looping video clips of 16 events from earlier that summer.

The last HouseGuest remaining will win the Power of Veto. \n\nLiz defeated Austin in the final round to win the Power of Veto.

Austin and the twins also thought about keeping Becky and using her to go after Vanessa. In the Head of Household competition, even though he considered throwing it, Austin beat James in the final round to become the new Head of Household. Austin was furious to be the new Head of Household due to having multiple deals with everyone in the game.

John hoped to gain James, Meg and Vanessa's votes. However, Vanessa told John she would be voting with the twins, which caused John to work for Liz and Julia's votes instead. Ultimately, John's campaigning was unsuccessful and he became the tenth HouseGuest evicted from the house,  becoming the fourth Jury member. Shortly after, John, along with Shelli, Jackie and Becky, re-entered the House to join the rest of the HouseGuests to have a chance to re-enter the game and possibly become the new Head of Household.\n\n*'''Head of Household/Battle to Return (\"Dizzyland\"):''' The eligible HouseGuests and jurors each stood on a small disc suspended by a hanging rope.

The HouseGuest who hides their Veto box the best will win the Power of Veto. \n\nJames hid his Veto box under the living room rug and won the Power of Veto. Now desperately needing a replacement nominee and not wanting to break her secret alliance with John and Steve, Vanessa asked Julia if she would be fine with going up in James' place as a pawn to ensure Meg's eviction and weaken James. Austin and the twins urged Vanessa to nominate and evict John, unaware of her secret alliance with him.

Running out of time or falling off of the beam resulted in the puzzle board being demagnetized, forcing them to start their puzzle from scratch. After a board demagnetizes, that HouseGuest only has ten seconds to remagnetize their board or they will be eliminated from the competition. The first HouseGuest to complete their puzzle and hit their button will win the Power of Veto. \n\nVanessa was quickly eliminated after her board demagnetized and her time ran out. John had a strategy to build his puzzle in his tray instead of on the board, allowing him to walk on the grass as he pleased, then once he had his pieces situated, he could place them on the board correctly. His strategy proved effective and John won the Power of Veto for the fourth time. At the Veto Meeting, John used the Veto on himself and Vanessa nominated Austin in his place.

John, James, and Jason were the top three vote-getters for America's Favorite HouseGuest; James won. \n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Have-Nots==\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:100%; line-height:15px;\"\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 1\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 2\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 3\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 4\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 5\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 6\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 7\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 8\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 9\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 10\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 11\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 12\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 13\n|-\n| Austin,<br />Da'Vonne,<br />Liz,<br />Vanessa\n| James,<br />Jason,<br />Meg,<br />Steve\n| {{cNone|None}}\n| Audrey,<br />Becky,<br />Jackie,<br />John\n| Clay,<br />Shelli,<br />Steve\n| Austin,<br />Julia,<br />Liz\n| Jackie,<br />James,<br />Meg\n| John,<br />Steve,<br />Vanessa\n| {{cNone|None}}\n| James,<br />John,<br />Julia,<br />Meg\n| colspan=\"3\" {{cNone|None}}\n|}\n\n==Voting history==\n<!--<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">-->\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center; font-size:85%<!--Please keep the font size at this value for conforming to page margins.-->; line-height:12px;\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 1<!--Jason nominated FIRST in Week 1.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 2<!--Shelli nominated FIRST in Week 2.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 3<!--Austin nominated FIRST in Week 3.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 4<!--Liz nominated FIRST in Week 4.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 5<!--Jackie nominated FIRST in Week 5.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 6\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 7\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 8\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 9\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 10\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 11\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 12\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 13\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 50\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 57\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 71\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 78 \n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 85\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 89\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 98\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Finale\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Head(s) of Household<!--Please keep this in the order they nominated.

This also meant the HoH who nominated them was dethroned, and subsequently eligible for post-veto nomination.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: Identical twins Liz and Julia took turns playing as a single HouseGuest during the first five weeks, secretly trading places every few days between living inside the house and being in sequester. Both twins pretended to be Liz until they completed this task. Following the Week 5 eviction, Julia was allowed to enter the house under her own identity and both twins were allowed to play for themselves.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: {{anchor|BB Fast Forward}}{{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} For volunteering to sit out of the Week 1 Head of Household competitions, Da'Vonne and Vanessa were awarded the BB Fast Forward, which gave them immunity for the week. They were instructed to share the Fast Forward with another HouseGuest each; they chose Liz and Austin. \n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{anchor|Last Laugh}}{{Color box|#ccc|border=darkgray}} A telephone appeared in the House; for being the HouseGuest who answered the seventh call, Da'Vonne was awarded the Last Laugh, which allowed her to block three HouseGuests from voting in this week's eviction; she chose Becky, Jackie, and Jeff.\n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: Audrey was given a penalty vote for eviction after eating normal food while on the mandatory Have-Not slop diet.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games \u2014 including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During the Head of Household competition in Week 10, the first four jurors \u2014 Shelli, Jackie, Becky, and John \u2014 competed for an opportunity to come back into the game. The juror who lasted the longest would return to the game to win and was eligible to become Head of Household if that juror finished first amongst the other HouseGuests in the competition. John lasted the longest of the jury members and re-entered the house.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: As Head of Household, Vanessa was forced to break the tie on Day 89.\n*{{note|9|Note 9}}: During the finale, the jury members voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n<!--</div>-->\n\n==Reception==\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n\n===Viewing figures===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

One of the first of these schoolhouses was built in [[Havana, Texas|Havana]] in 1849 when citizens from the towns and villages of [[Abram-Perezville, Texas|Abram-Perezville]] (Ojo de Agua), [[Penitas, Texas|Penitas]], Tabasco (now La Joya), [[Havana, Texas|Havana]], [[Los Ebanos, Hidalgo County, Texas|Los Ebanos]] and [[Cuevitas, Texas|Cuevitas]] established a place of learning. Although far from the little red schoolhouse one might envision, the structure of rock and adobe sheltered the students of this area and gave them a solid education. This building would later become known as the La Joya Independent School District.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1993 the district was majority Hispanic, and as of that year, annually 1,000 new students enrolled in the district. Over 3,000 students were enrolled at [[La Joya High School]]. In 1992<!--Last year from 1993-->, one elementary had a growth rate of 17% and another had a growth rate of 18%. James E.

One of the first of these schoolhouses was built in [[Havana, Texas|Havana]] in 1849 when citizens from the towns and villages of [[Abram-Perezville, Texas|Abram-Perezville]] (Ojo de Agua), [[Penitas, Texas|Penitas]], Tabasco (now La Joya), [[Havana, Texas|Havana]], [[Los Ebanos, Hidalgo County, Texas|Los Ebanos]] and [[Cuevitas, Texas|Cuevitas]] established a place of learning. Although far from the little red schoolhouse one might envision, the structure of rock and adobe sheltered the students of this area and gave them a solid education. This building would later become known as the La Joya Independent School District.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1993 the district was majority Hispanic, and as of that year, annually 1,000 new students enrolled in the district. Over 3,000 students were enrolled at [[La Joya High School]]. In 1992<!--Last year from 1993-->, one elementary had a growth rate of 17% and another had a growth rate of 18%. James E.
