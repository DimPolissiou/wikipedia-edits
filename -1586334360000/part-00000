Where and how he learned photography is unknown. He quickly gained a reputation as a professional; specializing in photographs of cultural and entertainment personalities. He signed his works with \"OTTO\", in gold letters, to match the sign above the door of his studio. He eventually came to occupy four floors of the building.<ref>[http://rittsel.weebly.com/otto-wegener.html ''Otto Wegener''] @ P\u00e4r Rittsel: fotohistoriska, on [[Weebly]]</ref>\n\nHe taught photography to [[Prince Eugen|Prince Eugen, Duke of N\u00e4rke]] of Sweden and [[Edward Steichen]] was one of his assistants. He is most famous for his portraits of [[Isadora Duncan]] and  [[Marcel Proust]], who was also a friend,  and [[Paul Verlaine]], who posed in 1893 as part of his preparation to become a candidate for membership in the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]].\n\nHe participated in numerous exhibitions; in France and abroad. A fire at his studio in 1916 caused significant damage.<ref>''[[Le Figaro]]'', 24 f\u00e9vrier 1916</ref> Although he knew the photographer, [[Eug\u00e8ne Pirou]], he was never professionally associated with him, as is often mistakenly assumed.

Where and how he learned photography is unknown. He quickly gained a reputation as a professional; specializing in photographs of cultural and entertainment personalities. He signed his works with \"OTTO\", in gold letters, to match the sign above the door of his studio. He eventually came to occupy four floors of the building.<ref>[http://rittsel.weebly.com/otto-wegener.html ''Otto Wegener''] @ P\u00e4r Rittsel: fotohistoriska, on [[Weebly]]</ref>.\n\nHe taught photography to [[Prince Eugen|Prince Eugen, Duke of N\u00e4rke]] of Sweden and [[Edward Steichen]] was one of his assistants. He is most famous for his portraits of [[Isadora Duncan]] and  [[Marcel Proust]], who was also a friend,  and [[Paul Verlaine]], who posed in 1893 as part of his preparation to become a candidate for membership in the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]].\n\nHe participated in numerous exhibitions; in France and abroad.

She added that it is \"a disappointing comeback from an artist who has a track record in creating hits\", as it is \"one romp that never reaches climax\".<ref name=\"NME\" /> ''[[Evening Standard]]''{{'}}s David Smyth expressed his disappointment in the album's subject matter, but complimented its production: \"In fact, so single-minded is his [Bieber] approach this time that it feels like she's [Baldwin] his only intended audience\", and thus Bieber's audience at his tour \"are going to be underwhelmed by the unchanging, lounging pace of the new material, gently ticking beats and lack of memorable choruses\".<ref name=\"ES\" /> \n\nRating the album a 4.5 out of 10, Jayson Greene of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' wrote that \"''Changes'' settles into a middle-distance, stream-friendly murmur that is more sleepy than salacious\", adding that its songs \"are all cold angles and frictionless surfaces, devoid of intimacy and heat\".

He stated that the album emulates the early 2000s, but it \"doesn't do so reverentially, nor does it borrow from a sonic palette to make it new again\", resulting in an \"uninspired and confused\" record, that \"lacks the emotional maturity\" to translate Bieber's marriage. He described Bieber's treatment of sex on the album is \"instant, bountiful, in your face, but ultimately unrealistic and devoid of any eroticism\" like [[pornography]].

He described Bieber's treatment of sex on the album is \"instant, bountiful, in your face, but ultimately unrealistic and devoid of any eroticism\" like [[pornography]].

The islands are administratively part of [[Krabi Province]]. [[Ko Phi Phi Don]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e14\u0e2d\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi don''}}) (''ko'' {{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30}} 'island') is the largest and most populated island of the group, although the beaches of the second largest island, [[Ko Phi Phi Le]] ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e01\u0e32\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e40\u0e25}}; {{rtgs|''ko phiphi le''}}) are visited by many people as well. The rest of the islands in the group, including Bida Nok, Bida Nai, and Bamboo Island ([[Ko Mai Phai]]), are not much more than large limestone rocks jutting out of the sea. The islands are reachable by speedboats or [[long-tail boat]]s most often from [[Krabi]] town or from piers in [[Phuket Province]].\n\nPhi Phi Don was initially populated by [[Muslim]] fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2013).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.<ref name=Vox-20200211>{{cite journal |last1=Makalintal |first1=Bettina |title=Leonardo DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Predicted the Worst of Influencer Culture |journal=Vox |date=11 February 2020 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xj54/leonardo-dicaprios-the-beach-predicted-the-worst-of-influencer-culture?utm |accessdate=12 February 2020}}</ref> This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment, as the producers bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it more resemble descriptions in the book,<ref name=Vox-20200211 /> an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation. Phi Phi Le is home to the \"Viking Cave\", where there is a thriving industry harvesting [[edible bird's nest]]s.\n\nKo Phi Phi was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004]], when nearly all of the island's infrastructure was destroyed.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Sunset over a gypsy boat on Koh Phi Phi Island.jpg|thumb|Gypsy boat, Ko Phi Phi]]\nFrom archaeological discoveries, it is believed that the area was one of the oldest communities in Thailand, dating back to the prehistoric period. It is believed that this province may have taken its name from ''Krabi'', which means 'sword'. This may come from a legend that an ancient sword was unearthed prior to the city's founding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe name ''Phi Phi'' (pronounced \"phi-phi\") originates from [[Malay Language|Malay]]. The original name for the islands was ''Pulau Api-Api'' ('the fiery isle'). The name refers to the ''Pokok Api-Api'', or \"fiery tree\" ([[Avicennia marina|grey mangrove]]) which is found on the islands.\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are six islands in the group known as Phi Phi. They lie {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} southeast of Phuket and are part of [[Hat Nopparat Thara-Ko Phi Phi National Park]].

There are two seasons: the rainy season from May till December and the hot season from January till April. Average temperature ranges between {{convert|17|\u2013|37|C|F}}. Average rainfall per year is about {{convert|2,231|mm|inch|lk=out|abbr=off}}, with wettest month being July and the driest February.<ref name=DNP/>\n\n== Transportation and communication==\n;Roads\nSince the re-building of Ko Phi Phi after the 2004 tsunami, paved roads now cover the vast majority of Ton Sai Bay and Loh Dalum Bay. All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai.\n\n;Air\nThe nearest airports are at Krabi, Trang, and Phuket. All three have direct road and boat connections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n;Ferry\nThere are frequent ferry boats to Ko Phi Phi from Phuket, Ko Lanta, and Krabi town starting at 08:30. Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30.  In the \"green season\" (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.phuketharbour.com/|title=Phuket to Phi Phi Ferry {{!}} Phuket to Phi Phi Speedboat|work=phuketharbour.com|accessdate=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\nThere is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[File:Ko Phi Phi after sunset, preparing for the night.JPG|thumb|right|Sunset, Ko Phi Phi]]\n[[File:Phi Phi party.jpg|thumb|right|Phi Phi party]]\n\nThe islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. Tourism on the islands  exploded since the release of the movie ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.\n\nPhi Phi Le's Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.<ref name=Guardian-20181003/>\n\nMarine Discovery Centre, located at Loh Ba Gao Bay on Koh Phi Phi Don, houses a series of colourful, interactive displays explaining the life cycles and habits of many marine species endemic to the Noppharat Thara - Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park, as well as information on area natural attractions and a gift shop. \n\n== Medical==\nThere is a small hospital on Phi Phi Island for emergencies. Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work.

With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. \"Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand\", says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at [[Kasetsart University]] and an established environmental writer.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sidasathian|first1=Chutima|last2=Morison|first2=Alan|title=Mass Tourism Makes 'a Slum' of Phi Phi|url=http://phuketwan.com/tourism/phi-phi-slum-mass-tourism-destroys-thailands-natural-heritage-22092/|accessdate=15 June 2015|work=Phuket Wan Tourism News|date=2015-03-21}}</ref>\n\nMore than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily.

The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly \u2013 but I have no faith in them,\" Mr Pankum said. \"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plerin|first1=Chutharat|title=Special Report: Phi Phi cries for help|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Special-Report-Phi-Phi-cries-help|accessdate=29 September 2018|work=The Taiger|date=2014-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s 2000 film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover.

The islands are reachable by speedboats or [[long-tail boat]]s most often from [[Krabi]] town or from piers in [[Phuket Province]].\n\nPhi Phi Don was initially populated by [[Muslim]] fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however\u2014if counting transient workers\u2014is more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2013).{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]''.<ref name=Vox-20200211>{{cite journal |last1=Makalintal |first1=Bettina |title=Leonardo DiCaprio's 'The Beach' Predicted the Worst of Influencer Culture |journal=Vox |date=11 February 2020 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xj54/leonardo-dicaprios-the-beach-predicted-the-worst-of-influencer-culture?utm |accessdate=12 February 2020}}</ref> This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island's environment, as the producers bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it more resemble descriptions in the book,<ref name=Vox-20200211 /> an accusation the film's makers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film's release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation.

It is believed that this province may have taken its name from ''Krabi'', which means 'sword'. This may come from a legend that an ancient sword was unearthed prior to the city's founding.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe name ''Phi Phi'' (pronounced \"phi-phi\") originates from [[Malay Language|Malay]].

Its main purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Phuket hospital.  It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5\u20137 minute walk from the main pier.\n\n==2004 tsunami==\nOn 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The island's main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e49\u0e19\u0e44\u0e17\u0e23}}), is built on a sandy [[isthmus]] between the island's two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than  {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]].\n\nShortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was {{convert|3|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=off}} high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone [[karst]]s, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong ([[Urak Lawoi|Sea Gypsy]] Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.\n\nAt the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.\n\n==Post-tsunami reconstruction==\n[[File:PhiPhiAftermath.jpg|thumb|[[Ko Phi Phi Don]], March 2005 in the aftermath of the tsunami.]]\nAfter the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed.

Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.\n\nOn 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, ''Help International Phi Phi'' (\"HI Phi Phi\"). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work.

The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of\", Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (''OrBorTor'') President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. ''Ao Nang OrBorTor'' pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang ''OrBorTor'' boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi's waste issues is sewage. \"We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly \u2013 but I have no faith in them,\" Mr Pankum said. \"They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.\" The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Plerin|first1=Chutharat|title=Special Report: Phi Phi cries for help|url=https://thethaiger.com/news/phuket/Special-Report-Phi-Phi-cries-help|accessdate=29 September 2018|work=The Taiger|date=2014-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s 2000 film ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover.

These fossils were found in the lower part of unit T5 (the Irohalene Member) of the [[Timezgadiouine Formation]]. This geological formation, which is found in the [[Argana Basin]] of [[Morocco]], may have been deposited in the [[Carnian]] stage of the [[Late Triassic]] period.<ref name=\"NJKP07\" />\n\n''Arganasuchus dutuiti'' was named and described in 2007 by [[Nour-Eddine Jalil]] and [[Karin Peyer]]. Its name translates to \"Dutuit's Argana crocodile\" in honor of its discoverer and place of discovery. The genus was based on the [[holotype]] AZA 904, a partial [[Pubis (bone)|pubis bone]] found at a fossil site near the village of Azarifen. Other ''Arganasuchus'' fossils from Azarifen include ribs and a [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevron]] (AZA 903-1-3, and 407-1-5), teeth (AZA 408-1-3), a femur (AZA 900), a fibula (AZA 901), part of a [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical vertebra]] (AZA 902), part of a neural arch (AZA 905), and part of a [[tibia]] (AZA 906). Skull bones have been found at a different locale, the Alili n\u2019yifis site near the village of Alma. These skull bones include a maxilla (ALM 1), and several lower jaws (ALM 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7). One of the jaws, ALM 2, connected to a small angled bone tentatively identified as a [[Quadratojugal bone|quadratojugal]]. The referral of the skull fossils to ''Arganasuchus'' is uncertain but likely considering their \"rauisuchian\" identity and similar size and occurrence.<ref name=\"NJKP07\" />\n\n== Description ==\n\n=== Skull ===\nThe [[maxilla]] has a straight lower edge with at least 12 large, knife-like teeth set in deep sockets and covered by [[Interdental plate|interdental plates]]. A longitudinal ridge runs along the inner portion of the maxilla and is continuous with a low facet for the [[Palatine bone|palatine]] bone. This continuity is seemingly unique to ''Arganasuchus''. The maxilla as a whole is Y-shaped like ''[[Batrachotomus]]'' and ''[[Fasolasuchus]]''. It has a long and tapering posterior process (rear branch) and a shorter ascending process (upper branch) separated by a triangular [[antorbital fenestra]] which forms a 40 degrees angle. The maxilla also has an unusually long anterior process (forward branch), forming the \"stem\" of the Y shape. It is uncertain whether the front edge of the maxilla formed part of the [[Nostril|naris]] (like ''Batrachotomus'') or contacted the [[premaxilla]] (like other [[Loricata|loricatans]]). The possible [[Quadratojugal bone|quadratojugal]] fossil is thick and sharply angled, apparently contacting a long [[Jugal bone|jugal]] but not the [[Quadrate bone|quadrate]], unlike its relatives. The front of the lower jaw is narrow and taper towards the chin, resembling that of ''[[Saurosuchus]]'' in most respects. Although the rear of the lower jaw is unknown, enough of the front half was preserved to indicate that at least 14 teeth were present. ''Arganasuchus'' has an alternating tooth replacement scheme, like many other archosaurs.<ref name=\"NJKP07\" />\n\n=== Postcrania ===\nThe single known [[vertebra]] is a spool-shaped [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]] (neck) centrum with a low keel running along its underside. A partial neural arch is also preserved, though the low inclination of the [[Articular processes|postzygapophyses]] indicates that it may belong to a dorsal (back) vertebra. The rib is similar to those of ''Saurosuchus'' (thick, two-headed, with a longitudinal ridge) while the [[Chevron (anatomy)|chevron]] is similar to those of ''[[Ticinosuchus]]'' (thickened at its tip). The [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] is among the most unusual and unique bones in ''Arganasuchus''. The [[acetabulum]] (hip socket) expands down the shaft of the pubis and is delineated from the front by a thick ridge which projects out as a tuberosity at its lower extent. The size and orientation of the acetabulum on the pubis is an autapomorphy (unique defining feature) of ''Arganasuchus''. The [[femur]] is large and robust, with a prominent knob-like [[fourth trochanter]] overlooking a smaller knob which may be an area of diseased bone. The [[tibia]] is thick but incomplete while the [[fibula]] is thinner and has a pronounced ''iliofibularis'' muscle scar almost halfway down its shaft.<ref name=\"NJKP07\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n''Arganasuchus'' is universally considered a \"[[Rauisuchia|rauisuchian]]\", a grouping of large carnivorous [[Pseudosuchia|pseudosuchians]] (crocodile-line archosaurs) from the Triassic. However, \"Rauisuchia\" is currently considered to be a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] [[Evolutionary grade|grade]] of archosaurs incrementally closer to [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]], rather than a [[clade]] (a natural grouping defined by shared relations). The most recent [[Cladistics|cladistic]] interpretations of archosaur classification are mainly inspired by an analysis by [[Sterling Nesbitt|Nesbitt]] (2011). He split \"rauisuchians\" (relabeled as [[Paracrocodylomorpha]]) into two branches: the unusual [[Poposauroidea|poposauroids]] and a more diverse branch called [[Loricata]], which includes [[Crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorphs]] and ancestral forms like ''[[Postosuchus]]'' and ''[[Saurosuchus]]''.<ref name=\"NSJ11\">{{cite journal|last=Nesbitt|first=S.J.|year=2011|title=The early evolution of archosaurs: relationships and the origin of major clades|url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/6112/1/B352.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History|volume=352|pages=1\u2013292|doi=10.1206/352.1|hdl=2246/6112}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> Although most frequently compared with loricatans, ''Arganasuchus'' has yet to be properly incorporated into this newer understanding of crocodilian ancestry, and as a result its classification relative to other \"rauisuchians\" is poorly understood.\n\nThe original description by Jalil & Peyer (2007) made many comparisons between the anatomy of ''Arganasuchus'' and other loricatans. The shape of the maxilla was similar to ''[[Batrachotomus]]'' and ''[[Fasolasuchus]]'', the vertebrae were similar to ''Postosuchus'', the femur was comparable to ''[[Prestosuchus]]'', and the pubis had a few similarities with both ''Batrachotomus'' and ''Postosuchus''.
