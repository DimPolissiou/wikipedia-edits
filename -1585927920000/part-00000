He is a producer and DJ commonly associated with the North London grime scene, including [[Roll Deep]] and [[Boy Better Know]]. Skepta released his debut album ''[[Greatest Hits (Skepta album)|Greatest Hits]]'' on 17 September 2007. It was released on the Boy Better Know label. Skepta self-released the first single \"[[Rolex Sweep]]\" in September 2008, which reached number 89 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He released the album ''[[Microphone Champion]]'' on 1 June 2009. The single \"Too Many Man\", with JME, Wiley, Frisco and Shorty, charted at number 79.\n\nSkepta has released five singles off his third studio album ''[[Doin' It Again]]'' (first with a major label): \"[[Bad Boy (Skepta song)|Bad Boy]]\", \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\", \"[[Cross My Heart (Skepta song)|Cross My Heart]]\" featuring [[Preeya Kalidas]], \"[[So Alive (Skepta song)|So Alive]]\" and \"[[Amnesia (Skepta song)|Amnesia]]\", as well as a video for \"[[Hello Good Morning#Remixes|Hello Good Morning]]\" (Grime Remix). Three singles reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\" being the most successful at number 14. \"Cross My Heart\" came in at number 31 and dropped out of the Top 40 a week later. ''Doin' it Again'' spent three weeks in the top 100 album charts and debuted and peaked at number 19 on its first week of release. In 2012, Skepta released two singles from his forthcoming fourth album.\n\nSkepta's second major label album, ''The Honeymoon'', was intended to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011, but was delayed till 2012. After a disappointing response from the first two singles Skepta decided to release a purchasable mixtape, titled ''Blacklisted''. This was released on 2 December 2012 along with music videos to support the release. In March 2014, Skepta provided a verse for the remix of \"[[German Whip]]\" by [[Meridian Dan]]. In the same month, he debuted his new single, \"[[That's Not Me (Skepta song)|That's Not Me]]\", featuring his brother, [[JME (rapper)|JME]]. Released on 8 June 2014, the song peaked at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br/><ref name=\"UK\">Peak positions in the UK:\n* For all except noted: {{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/5188/skepta/|title=Skepta|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=19 May 2018}}\n* For \"Too Many Man\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_S.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: DJ S - The System Of Life|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Lush\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/091031cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 31.10.2009 (wk43)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For ''Microphone Champion'': {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/090613cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 13.06.2009 (wk23)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Amnesia\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/110212cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 12.02.2011 (wk5)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"It Ain't Safe\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/160514cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 14.05.2016 (wk19)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br/><ref name=\"AUS\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Skepta|title=Discography Skepta|publisher=Australian Charts Portal.

He is a producer and DJ commonly associated with the North London grime scene, including [[Roll Deep]] and [[Boy Better Know]]. Skepta released his debut album ''[[Greatest Hits (Skepta album)|Greatest Hits]]'' on 17 September 2007. It was released on the Boy Better Know label. Skepta self-released the first single \"[[Rolex Sweep]]\" in September 2008, which reached number 89 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He released the album ''[[Microphone Champion]]'' on 1 June 2009. The single \"Too Many Man\", with JME, Wiley, Frisco and Shorty, charted at number 79.\n\nSkepta has released five singles off his third studio album ''[[Doin' It Again]]'' (first with a major label): \"[[Bad Boy (Skepta song)|Bad Boy]]\", \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\", \"[[Cross My Heart (Skepta song)|Cross My Heart]]\" featuring [[Preeya Kalidas]], \"[[So Alive (Skepta song)|So Alive]]\" and \"[[Amnesia (Skepta song)|Amnesia]]\", as well as a video for \"[[Hello Good Morning#Remixes|Hello Good Morning]]\" (Grime Remix). Three singles reached the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, with \"[[Rescue Me (Skepta song)|Rescue Me]]\" being the most successful at number 14. \"Cross My Heart\" came in at number 31 and dropped out of the Top 40 a week later. ''Doin' it Again'' spent three weeks in the top 100 album charts and debuted and peaked at number 19 on its first week of release. In 2012, Skepta released two singles from his forthcoming fourth album.\n\nSkepta's second major label album, ''The Honeymoon'', was intended to be released in the fourth quarter of 2011, but was delayed till 2012. After a disappointing response from the first two singles Skepta decided to release a purchasable mixtape, titled ''Blacklisted''. This was released on 2 December 2012 along with music videos to support the release. In March 2014, Skepta provided a verse for the remix of \"[[German Whip]]\" by [[Meridian Dan]]. In the same month, he debuted his new single, \"[[That's Not Me (Skepta song)|That's Not Me]]\", featuring his brother, [[JME (rapper)|JME]]. Released on 8 June 2014, the song peaked at number 21 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\n==Albums==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details and chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10.5em;\"| [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]<br/><ref name=\"UK\">Peak positions in the UK:\n* For all except noted: {{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/5188/skepta/|title=Skepta|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=19 May 2018}}\n* For \"Too Many Man\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_S.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: DJ S - The System Of Life|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Lush\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/091031cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 31.10.2009 (wk43)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For ''Microphone Champion'': {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/090613cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 13.06.2009 (wk23)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"Amnesia\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/110212cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 12.02.2011 (wk5)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n* For \"It Ain't Safe\": {{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/160514cluk.txt|title=CHART: CLUK Update 14.05.2016 (wk19)|publisher=Official Charts Company|work=Zobbel.de/}}\n</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br/><ref name=\"AUS\">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Skepta|title=Discography Skepta|publisher=Australian Charts Portal.

At its Kallang Road headquarters, services are provided from \"cradle to grave\", starting from birth registration to the issuance of identity cards and finally to the registering of deaths.

Immigration officers are authorised to act on behalf of the Controller of Immigration (who is de facto the Commissioner of ICA). Officers may also be empowered as registration officers under the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/NRA1965 National Registration Act] (Cap 201).\n\nImmigration officers can prohibit entry to any person or class of persons for any reason related to the conditions of Singapore.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/travel/singapore-explains-why-many-vietnamese-women-have-been-denied-entry-49360.html|title=Singapore explains why many Vietnamese women have been denied entry|date=2015-07-26|work=Thanh Nien Daily|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>  Since 2018, immigration officers have limited policing powers within the checkpoints and in their immediate vicinity.<ref name=\":2\" /> Under the ICC concept, ICA is ultimately responsible for border security at Singapore's checkpoints.\n\nTo facilitate entry for [[Alien (law)|aliens]] arriving in Singapore, ICA issues a variety of passes.

The Registry of Births and Deaths is also under the Citizen Services Centre.\n\nThe Permanent Resident Centre issues the blue NRIC for permanent residents as well as entry and re-entry permits.\n\nThe Visitor Services Centre issues visit pass extensions, visas and long term visit passes.\n\n=== Structure ===\nICA is divided into staff and line units. Staff units are involved in manpower, training and corporate services. Line units deal with the front-line operations of ICA. The senior executive management is called the Leadership Group (LG).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica-annual-2018-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20ANNUAL%202004.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2004|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n[[File:OrgChart.jpg|center|thumb|987x987px|ICA organization chart.

Entry control began when the [[Crown colony|colonial government]] enacted the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance in 1915.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_si|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref>  In 1933, the Immigration Department was established to administer the Aliens Ordinance which placed quotas on newcomers entering Singapore. This effectively ended the freedom of travel in Singapore.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite book | title=Policing | publisher=Straits Times Press | author=Asad Latif | year=2017 | location=Singapore | pages=80\u201386 | isbn=978-981-47-4720-2}}</ref>\n\nOrdinance No. 5 of 1952 (The Immigration Ordinance) came into force on 1 August 1953, setting the foundation of immigration law in Singapore. The Immigration Ordinance was amended in 1959 after Singapore was granted sovereignty. The amendment gave Singaporeans the right of entry into the Colony.<ref name=\":4\" /> A new Immigration Depot was built at Telok Ayer Basin (East Wharf) while the head office was moved to Empress Place Building. Round-the-clock immigration clearance for [[Ship|vessels]] was started 1 June 1961.\n\nBirth registration started in 1872 which was then used for health and statistical purposes. However, by 1938 registration of births became compulsory by [[Law of Singapore|law]]. At the start of the second World War, the British introduced paper identity cards for the first time. This was suspended after the British surrender in 1945. The colonial government began issuing identity cards again in 1948 to counter the [[Communism|communist]] [[Malayan Emergency|insurgency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_nrd|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref> The desire to limit the entry of those who might have communist sympathies extended to the creation of a new Immigration Bill in 1950. When Singapore merged with Malaya, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form the Federation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, immigration came under the jurisdiction of the federal government and the Immigration Department became a federal agency in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\n==== Customs and Excise ====\nCustoms control was started when the Monopolies Department was founded in 1910 to collect excise duties on goods such as [[hard liquor]]s and [[opium]]. In 1916, the colonial government began taxing [[tobacco products]] on import to raise funds for the war effort.<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_ced|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>  In 1932, the Customs headquarters was shifted to the Customs House from Cecil Street.  The Excise Department replaced the Monopolies Department in 1936 and in 1938, the Excise Department was renamed the Department of Customs & Excise.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Post-independence (1965 - 2002) ===\n\n==== Stricter immigration control ====\nAfter Singapore separated from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, freedom of movement continued to exist between the two countries for a short period of time. Two [[border checkpoint]]s were gazetted for travel between the two countries. They were the [[Tanjong Pagar Railway Station]] and the [[Woodlands Checkpoint]]. Malaysians had to produce [[identity card]]s to be able to enter Singapore, until passports were required on both sides in July 1967. To travel to [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Singapore restricted passport and the Singapore Certificate of Identity was required. The Restricted Passport Centre was at [[South Quay]] and was moved to [[Outram Road]] in 1976, but closed on 31 December 1994.\n\nIn the 1970s, illegal immigration and over-stayers became a serious problem in Singapore. A task force was set up in 1974 to deal with the immigration problem. Laws were introduced that allowed immigration officers to seize and detain vessels and vehicles used to convey illegal immigrants. Those who harboured or employed illegal immigrants could also be punished. Data on foreigners' movements within Singapore were processed by the new Immigration Data Processing Centre.\n\nThe Last Port Clearance was introduced in 1980 to attract more passenger liners to Singapore.\n\nA passport office was opened at Joo Chiat Complex in 1984. This office issued both international and restricted passports and was closed in 1999. The Immigration Department moved its head office to the Pidemco Centre in June 1986. Immigration officers were also deployed to places such as [[India]] and Hong Kong to open consulates and [[high commission]]s. All passports issued by Singapore immigration after 1990 were computerised and machine-readable. The Entry and Exit Control Integrated System implemented in the early 1990s was a computerized immigration system that was used at checkpoints to speed up the processing of travellers. A hotline for information was set up in 1992, with restricted access to countries lifted.\n\n==== National Registration Office ====\nThe independence of Singapore in 1965 brought with it the National Registration Act in 1966. The distinctive pink identity cards were issued for the first time. The National Registration Office (NRO) replaced the former Registry of Persons.\n\nAt the time, the NRO and the [[Registry of Births and Deaths]] (RBD) came under the former Ministry of Labour. The Registry of Societies (ROS), Martial Arts Control Unit (MACU) came under the Ministry of Home Affairs. On 16 October 1981, the NRO, RBD, ROC, MACU and ROS merged to form the National Registration Department (NRD). The NRD consisted of four registries: the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Registry of Citizens, the Registry of Societies and the National Registration Office. The NRD was located at the [[Empress Place Building]] until 1986 when the building was transformed into the now defunct Empress Place Museum.\n\n==== Customs and Excise Department ====\n[[Tobacco]], [[liquor]], [[motor vehicle]]s and [[petroleum]] became restricted goods after Singapore was granted independence as a sovereign nation. The Customs and Excise Department ([[Singapore Customs|CED]]) cooperated closely with other government agencies such as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority and the Central Narcotics Bureau. When the [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]] was introduced in 1994, the work scope of the CED was expanded. The red and green channel customs system was implemented in 1991 at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] and at sea checkpoints.\n\nThe CED was located first at [[Cecil Street]] from 1910 till 1932 and later the White House at Maxwell Road from 1932 until 1989 when it moved to [[World Trade Centre, Singapore|World Trade Centre]] (now [[HarbourFront Centre]]).\n\n==== Singapore Immigration and Registration ====\nIn 1995, the Immigration Department was renamed Singapore Immigration. An immigration checkpoint was established at the Changi Ferry Terminal in May that year. There was a change in the passport application and collection in the 1990s, reducing the need for applicants to report to the building. To further reduce that need, applications by mail and internet were introduced and rebates were given for such applications.\n\nA new logo was launched by then-[[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] [[Wong Kan Seng]] at the [[foundation stone]] ceremony for the SI Building in 1995. The West Coast Barter Trade Centre closed in June 1995. Singaporeans were sent renewal forms for passports nine months before their passports expired.\n\nSI became an autonomous agency in 1996 as well as launching its first website. All immigration offices moved from the Pidemco Centre to the new building at Kallang Road in 1997. The Singapore Immigration and the National Registration Department merged to form Singapore Immigration & Registration in 1998. A new land checkpoint at Tuas was opened on 2 January.\n\n=== 21st century: Merger and integration (2003 - Present) ===\nOn 1 April 2003, SIR and the border control functions of CED were merged to form ICA in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] plots. The remaining functions of the CED was reorganised and renamed into Singapore Customs. ICA was to be part of the Home Team and a new, blue uniform was introduced to reflect that change. The first Commissioner of ICA was Lock Wai Han, who was in the Singapore Police Force before he oversaw the merger of the two agencies.\n\nICA's first major challenge came with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, testing the agency's ability to control Singapore's borders and screen passengers for contagious diseases.\n\nIn 2005, the then-Director CNB Eric Tan became the Commissioner of ICA.\n\nIn 2010, Deputy Commissioner Clarence Yeo became the Commissioner of ICA.\n\n==== Integrated Checkpoints Command ====\nOn 2 January 2015, the Integrated Checkpoints Command concept was introduced. Under the Integrated Checkpoints Command, ICA checkpoints are split into three domains: Land, Sea and Air.  Each domain is headed by a Domain Commander who reports directly to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20AR%202015-FINAL-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ICA website|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  All Home Team agencies deployed at the checkpoints must report to the Domain Commander.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ica-launches-integrated-checkpoints-command-to-strengthen-coordination-among-agencies|title=ICA launches Integrated Checkpoints Command to strengthen coordination among agencies|last=migration|date=2015-01-02|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 March 2017, it was announced that Woodlands Town Centre would be absorbed by the new Woodlands Checkpoint extension.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/woodlands-checkpoint-to-be-expanded-to-old-woodlands-town-centre|title=Woodlands Checkpoint to be extended to Old Woodlands Town Centre; two land plots to be acquired|last=hermesauto|date=2017-03-30|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2018 the amended Immigration Act was introduced. ICA officers would now perform roles as first responders. The amendment gave immigration officers the legal powers of police officers in relation to offences committed in the vicinity of checkpoints.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-ica-officers-get-enhanced-powers-to-conduct-searches-arrest-people-at|title=Parliament: ICA officers get enhanced powers to conduct searches, arrest people at checkpoints|last=hermesauto|date=2018-01-08|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 September 2018, Marvin Sim became the Commissioner of ICA. He was previously senior director of Joint Operations Group at MHA and deputy director at CNB.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/leadership-changes-at-ica-and-home-team-academy-10577146|title=Leadership changes at ICA and Home Team Academy|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 May 2019 during its Work Plan Seminar, ICA announced its new crest, mission and vision. The organisation's values remain unchanged.\n\n==== 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic ====\nICA officers became the first line of defense against the Covid-10 outbreak. The Singapore government announced travel bans on foreign visitors arriving from affected areas, temperature screening, Stay-Home Notices (SHN)  and other measures in order to contain the outbreak. \n\nStay-Home Notices were issued by ICA to travellers who were deemed to be \"at-risk\". Such travellers were not allowed to leave their house for a 14-day period, staying from the day of arrival. A man who had been issued a SHN posted on social media a photo of [[Bak kut teh|Bak Kut Teh]], a popular meat soup dish in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/03/shn-eat-bak-kut-teh-kena-warning/|title=S\u2019porean man who breached Stay-Home Notice for bak kut teh receives warning from ICA|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> ICA subsequently said that the man would be referred to the Attorney-General Chambers for further action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/follow-up-response-to-media-queries-on-man-breaching-shn-requirements-to-eat-bak-kut-teh|title=ICA {{!}} Follow-up Response To Media Queries On Man Breaching SHN Requirements To Eat Bak Kut Teh|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAs of 03 April 2020, no foreign visitors are allowed transit or entry into Singapore. All Long Term Pass Holders (i.e. foreign residents) must obtain entry approval before arriving in Singapore. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19|title=ICA {{!}} Updates on Border Control Measures in Response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Checkpoints ==\nBelow is a list of Singapore's ports of entries for persons, conveyances and goods.

Under the current [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] Services (HAS) (ICA) Unified scheme, new junior officers and senior officers join as Direct-Entry Sergeants and Direct-Entry Inspectors respectively. Direct-Entry Sergeants range from [[Institute of Technical Education|ITE]] graduates to polytechnic diploma holders.  Direct-Entry Inspectors must be graduates from a university accredited by its home country.  New Sergeants will become Primary Screening Officers, while Inspectors will become Team Leaders in their foundation posting. Regardless, all new officers will be posted to Tuas, Woodlands or Coastal Command.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_position|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref>\n\nAll ICA direct-entry Sergeants and Inspectors must attend and pass the ICA Basic Course which is held regularly at the [[Home Team Academy]]. The Basic Course includes lessons on document examination, basic unarmed combat and basic firearms training. The Basic Course lasts twenty weeks for Direct-Entry Inspectors <ref name=\":1\" /> and sixteen weeks for Direct-Entry Sergeants.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both courses are non-residential, are fully paid-for the duration of the courses and trainees will receive their substantive rank pay as well. In return, officers have to serve bonds of one to two years after graduation. Direct-Entry Sergeants also receive sign-on bonuses and retention pay-outs. To remain in service, officers will have to pass law examinations and a firearms shooting test.\n\nAdvanced courses are also conducted by ICA's Training Command. Direct Entry Sergeants are typically trained into specialists in different fields such as profiling, cargo examination and firearms shooting. Senior officers will first be exposed to ICA's ground operations before being sent to enforcement, service or staff units. Overseas postings at Singapore's consulates are also available. Furthermore, suitable officers at any level below that of Inspector may also secure scholarships and promotion into the rank of senior officers as part of the new unified scheme.\n\nThere is also a separate scheme for Management Executives who are deployed to the Services Centres. These officers are not considered immigration officers and do not don the blue uniform.\n\n=== Ranks ===\n\nBefore the merger, both SIR and CED had their own distinct rank progression. However, they were similar in that there was a separate scheme for Senior and Junior officers. This continued to be the case post-merger until 2017.\n\nSince 2017, ICA officer ranks have fallen under the HAS (ICA) Unified scheme.<ref>https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica_annual_2017.pdf</ref> All Immigration Officers are placed under this scheme regardless of education level.\n\nAs part of the unified scheme, the ranks of Corporal and Staff Sergeant were collapsed into a single Sergeant rank with numerical increments. The ranks of Senior Checkpoint Inspector were removed and suitable Checkpoint Inspectors would be promoted to Inspectors instead. A new rank, Deputy Assistant Commissioner was added to provide more opportunities for officers at the [[middle management]] level.\n\nAt present, ICA ranks follow those in the [[Singapore Police Force]] with some exceptions in insignia and naming (see table below).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_joinica|title=ICA -

In practice, only qualified officers serving in protective security related roles are issued firearms.\n\nThe service firearm is the 5-shot [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver. Other equipment include [[handcuffs]], [[Plastic handcuffs|flexicuffs]] and [[Baton (law enforcement)|expandable batons]].\n\n=== Uniform ===\nIn the early 1970s, Singapore Immigration had a brown and cream uniform. The colour of the uniforms did not vary for more than 20 years, with only modifications in style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_faf|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> In 1997, uniforms in green and white were introduced.\n\nIn 1996, the Customs uniforms and accessories were changed to a shade of blue reminiscent of the current design.\n\nIn 2003, the uniform was updated to its current design. The uniform became Navy Blue, which was chosen to establish ICA as a member of the Home Team.\n\nThe uniform comes in different designs to suit the varied operating environments of ICA. The basic field uniform consists of a short-sleeved dress shirt and pants with a dress or [[Police duty belt|duty belt]] as appropriate. This uniform can be most often seen in the Land and Sea checkpoints. Senior officers typically wear a [[Safari jacket|bush jacket]] (for men) or a tunic (for women). A dress skirt is also available for female staff officer. Air Domain officers working at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] wear two-piece suits with ties to conform with airport guidelines, while sea-going clearance team officers wear long-sleeve coastal uniforms that resemble the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]]'s Number 4 uniform. Cargo examination officers are issued [[polo shirt]]s due to their warm operational environment.\n\nIn 2016, a distinctive ICC domain insignia was designed for each domain to serve as a symbol of common identity for all HT officers operating in the domain. The domain insignia also encourages a greater sense of belonging and closer collaboration among Home Team officers.<ref name=\"ica badges\" />\n\n=== Technology ===\nICA integrates [[information technology]] to streamline the entry and exit procedure at checkpoints. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and other registered travelers can use automated lanes called enhanced-Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS). The Biometric Identification of Motorbikers (BIKES) System at ICA's land checkpoints can be used by residents and work pass holders entering and leaving Singapore by motorcycles.\n\nIn 2018, the ICA released the MyICA app which allowed citizens to process multiple transactions in a single payment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/myica-e-services-web-portal-passport-entry-visa-applications-10482494|title=ICA launches web portal for passport, entry visa applications|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAt ICA's 2019 Workplan Seminar, the New Clearance Concept was introduced. Foreigners would be allowed to use ICA's automated immigration gates upon arrival. They would fill in an electronic disembarkation card or e-DE card. Singaporeans will no longer have to present their passports or their thumbprints for immigration clearance at the automated gates. Instead, facial recognition technology will be utilised.<ref>{{Citation|last=ICAOutreach|title=New Clearance Concept|date=2019-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq803fcfU5s|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, ICA announced the cessation of physical embarkation cards. Arriving travellers would be directed to use the SG Arrival Card, an electronic embarkation card with apps in [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)|Apple's App Store]]. In view of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] outbreak, all travellers entering Singapore from 27 March 2020 were to fill in electronic health cards integrated into the SG Arrival Card website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/all-travellers-arriving-in-singapore-from-27-march-2020-0900-hours-must-submit-health-declaration-via-the-sg-arrival-card-e-service|title=ICA {{!}} All Travellers Arriving In Singapore From 27 March 2020, 0900 Hours, Must Submit Health Declaration Via The SG Arrival Card E-Service|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Biometric verification ====\nICA has progressively implemented the use of biometric verification to improve security at its checkpoints. ICA employs the use of biometry to find persons of interests and has deployed a suitcase sized facial recognition system to different checkpoints <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.htx.gov.sg/news/featured-news-identifying-a-face-amongst-thousands-at-our-borders|title=[Featured News] Identifying a Face amongst Thousands at Our Borders|website=HTX|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the Checkpoint Access Cards used fingerprint data to facilitate entry.\n\nIn October 2006, ICA began issuing biometric passports to Singapore citizens. In October 2017, ICA started issuance of new biometric passports that comes with additional security features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-design-for-singapore-passport-with-additional-security-features-ica|title=New design for Singapore passport with additional security features: ICA|last=hermesauto|date=2017-10-26|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}</ref> This marked the second series of biometrics passports issued by Singapore.

At its Kallang Road headquarters, services are provided from \"cradle to grave\", starting from birth registration to the issuance of identity cards and finally to the registering of deaths. At the various checkpoints of Singapore, ICA carries out its border control duties on both goods and people.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Organisation Identity\n!'''Mission'''\n!We secure our borders and uphold our laws on immigration and national registration\n|-\n|Vision\n|Secure Borders, Safe Singapore\n|-\n|Values\n|Integrity, Commitment and Accountability\n|}\n\n===== Legal Powers =====\nICA officers primarily enforce the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/IA1959 Immigration Act (Cap 133)] and the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PA2007 Passports Act (Cap 220)]. Immigration officers are authorised to act on behalf of the Controller of Immigration (who is de facto the Commissioner of ICA). Officers may also be empowered as registration officers under the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/NRA1965 National Registration Act] (Cap 201).\n\nImmigration officers can prohibit entry to any person or class of persons for any reason related to the conditions of Singapore.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/travel/singapore-explains-why-many-vietnamese-women-have-been-denied-entry-49360.html|title=Singapore explains why many Vietnamese women have been denied entry|date=2015-07-26|work=Thanh Nien Daily|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>  Since 2018, immigration officers have limited policing powers within the checkpoints and in their immediate vicinity.<ref name=\":2\" /> Under the ICC concept, ICA is ultimately responsible for border security at Singapore's checkpoints.\n\nTo facilitate entry for [[Alien (law)|aliens]] arriving in Singapore, ICA issues a variety of passes. The most common is the social visit pass, which allows aliens to remain in country for a specified number of days. Other types of passes include student passes, dependent's passes, landing passes and special passes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/IA1959-RG1?DocDate=20171102|title=Immigration Regulations - Singapore Statutes Online|website=sso.agc.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n===== Contraband smuggling =====\n\nICA officers deployed as cargo and baggage examination officers are empowered under the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CA1960 Customs Act (Cap 70)] to search people and conveyances at any checkpoint.

Examples of common offences include the harbouring of immigration offenders, employing immigrants illegally or entering [[Marriage of convenience|marriages of convenience]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/till-prison-do-us-part-ica-officers-crack-one-of-the-largest-9949218|title=Till prison do us part: ICA officers crack one of the largest sham marriage cases|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Home owners who have been found guilty of renting their houses to immigration offenders and not carrying out one or more of the mandatory checks may be sentenced to a jail term, fine or both.\n\n===== Counter-terrorism =====\nICA is Singapore's first line of defence against potential terrorist threats by restricting the movement of security sensitive persons across international borders. After the escape of [[Mas Selamat Kastari|Mas Selamat]] in 2008, all checkpoints immediately stepped up security checks. During the lead-up to the 2018 [[2018 North Korea\u2013United States summit|Trump-Kim Summit]], Home Affairs Minister [[K.

Entry control began when the [[Crown colony|colonial government]] enacted the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance in 1915.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_si|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref>  In 1933, the Immigration Department was established to administer the Aliens Ordinance which placed quotas on newcomers entering Singapore. This effectively ended the freedom of travel in Singapore.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite book | title=Policing | publisher=Straits Times Press | author=Asad Latif | year=2017 | location=Singapore | pages=80\u201386 | isbn=978-981-47-4720-2}}</ref>\n\nOrdinance No. 5 of 1952 (The Immigration Ordinance) came into force on 1 August 1953, setting the foundation of immigration law in Singapore. The Immigration Ordinance was amended in 1959 after Singapore was granted sovereignty. The amendment gave Singaporeans the right of entry into the Colony.<ref name=\":4\" /> A new Immigration Depot was built at Telok Ayer Basin (East Wharf) while the head office was moved to Empress Place Building. Round-the-clock immigration clearance for [[Ship|vessels]] was started 1 June 1961.\n\nBirth registration started in 1872 which was then used for health and statistical purposes. However, by 1938 registration of births became compulsory by [[Law of Singapore|law]]. At the start of the second World War, the British introduced paper identity cards for the first time. This was suspended after the British surrender in 1945. The colonial government began issuing identity cards again in 1948 to counter the [[Communism|communist]] [[Malayan Emergency|insurgency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_nrd|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref> The desire to limit the entry of those who might have communist sympathies extended to the creation of a new Immigration Bill in 1950. When Singapore merged with Malaya, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form the Federation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, immigration came under the jurisdiction of the federal government and the Immigration Department became a federal agency in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\n==== Customs and Excise ====\nCustoms control was started when the Monopolies Department was founded in 1910 to collect excise duties on goods such as [[hard liquor]]s and [[opium]]. In 1916, the colonial government began taxing [[tobacco products]] on import to raise funds for the war effort.<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_ced|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>  In 1932, the Customs headquarters was shifted to the Customs House from Cecil Street.  The Excise Department replaced the Monopolies Department in 1936 and in 1938, the Excise Department was renamed the Department of Customs & Excise.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Post-independence (1965 - 2002) ===\n\n==== Stricter immigration control ====\nAfter Singapore separated from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, freedom of movement continued to exist between the two countries for a short period of time. Two [[border checkpoint]]s were gazetted for travel between the two countries. They were the [[Tanjong Pagar Railway Station]] and the [[Woodlands Checkpoint]]. Malaysians had to produce [[identity card]]s to be able to enter Singapore, until passports were required on both sides in July 1967. To travel to [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Singapore restricted passport and the Singapore Certificate of Identity was required. The Restricted Passport Centre was at [[South Quay]] and was moved to [[Outram Road]] in 1976, but closed on 31 December 1994.\n\nIn the 1970s, illegal immigration and over-stayers became a serious problem in Singapore. A task force was set up in 1974 to deal with the immigration problem. Laws were introduced that allowed immigration officers to seize and detain vessels and vehicles used to convey illegal immigrants. Those who harboured or employed illegal immigrants could also be punished. Data on foreigners' movements within Singapore were processed by the new Immigration Data Processing Centre.\n\nThe Last Port Clearance was introduced in 1980 to attract more passenger liners to Singapore.\n\nA passport office was opened at Joo Chiat Complex in 1984. This office issued both international and restricted passports and was closed in 1999. The Immigration Department moved its head office to the Pidemco Centre in June 1986. Immigration officers were also deployed to places such as [[India]] and Hong Kong to open consulates and [[high commission]]s. All passports issued by Singapore immigration after 1990 were computerised and machine-readable. The Entry and Exit Control Integrated System implemented in the early 1990s was a computerized immigration system that was used at checkpoints to speed up the processing of travellers. A hotline for information was set up in 1992, with restricted access to countries lifted.\n\n==== National Registration Office ====\nThe independence of Singapore in 1965 brought with it the National Registration Act in 1966. The distinctive pink identity cards were issued for the first time. The National Registration Office (NRO) replaced the former Registry of Persons.\n\nAt the time, the NRO and the [[Registry of Births and Deaths]] (RBD) came under the former Ministry of Labour. The Registry of Societies (ROS), Martial Arts Control Unit (MACU) came under the Ministry of Home Affairs. On 16 October 1981, the NRO, RBD, ROC, MACU and ROS merged to form the National Registration Department (NRD). The NRD consisted of four registries: the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Registry of Citizens, the Registry of Societies and the National Registration Office. The NRD was located at the [[Empress Place Building]] until 1986 when the building was transformed into the now defunct Empress Place Museum.\n\n==== Customs and Excise Department ====\n[[Tobacco]], [[liquor]], [[motor vehicle]]s and [[petroleum]] became restricted goods after Singapore was granted independence as a sovereign nation. The Customs and Excise Department ([[Singapore Customs|CED]]) cooperated closely with other government agencies such as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority and the Central Narcotics Bureau. When the [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]] was introduced in 1994, the work scope of the CED was expanded. The red and green channel customs system was implemented in 1991 at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] and at sea checkpoints.\n\nThe CED was located first at [[Cecil Street]] from 1910 till 1932 and later the White House at Maxwell Road from 1932 until 1989 when it moved to [[World Trade Centre, Singapore|World Trade Centre]] (now [[HarbourFront Centre]]).\n\n==== Singapore Immigration and Registration ====\nIn 1995, the Immigration Department was renamed Singapore Immigration. An immigration checkpoint was established at the Changi Ferry Terminal in May that year. There was a change in the passport application and collection in the 1990s, reducing the need for applicants to report to the building. To further reduce that need, applications by mail and internet were introduced and rebates were given for such applications.\n\nA new logo was launched by then-[[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] [[Wong Kan Seng]] at the [[foundation stone]] ceremony for the SI Building in 1995. The West Coast Barter Trade Centre closed in June 1995. Singaporeans were sent renewal forms for passports nine months before their passports expired.\n\nSI became an autonomous agency in 1996 as well as launching its first website. All immigration offices moved from the Pidemco Centre to the new building at Kallang Road in 1997. The Singapore Immigration and the National Registration Department merged to form Singapore Immigration & Registration in 1998. A new land checkpoint at Tuas was opened on 2 January.\n\n=== 21st century: Merger and integration (2003 - Present) ===\nOn 1 April 2003, SIR and the border control functions of CED were merged to form ICA in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] plots. The remaining functions of the CED was reorganised and renamed into Singapore Customs. ICA was to be part of the Home Team and a new, blue uniform was introduced to reflect that change. The first Commissioner of ICA was Lock Wai Han, who was in the Singapore Police Force before he oversaw the merger of the two agencies.\n\nICA's first major challenge came with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, testing the agency's ability to control Singapore's borders and screen passengers for contagious diseases.\n\nIn 2005, the then-Director CNB Eric Tan became the Commissioner of ICA.\n\nIn 2010, Deputy Commissioner Clarence Yeo became the Commissioner of ICA.\n\n==== Integrated Checkpoints Command ====\nOn 2 January 2015, the Integrated Checkpoints Command concept was introduced. Under the Integrated Checkpoints Command, ICA checkpoints are split into three domains: Land, Sea and Air.  Each domain is headed by a Domain Commander who reports directly to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20AR%202015-FINAL-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ICA website|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  All Home Team agencies deployed at the checkpoints must report to the Domain Commander.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ica-launches-integrated-checkpoints-command-to-strengthen-coordination-among-agencies|title=ICA launches Integrated Checkpoints Command to strengthen coordination among agencies|last=migration|date=2015-01-02|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 March 2017, it was announced that Woodlands Town Centre would be absorbed by the new Woodlands Checkpoint extension.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/woodlands-checkpoint-to-be-expanded-to-old-woodlands-town-centre|title=Woodlands Checkpoint to be extended to Old Woodlands Town Centre; two land plots to be acquired|last=hermesauto|date=2017-03-30|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2018 the amended Immigration Act was introduced. ICA officers would now perform roles as first responders. The amendment gave immigration officers the legal powers of police officers in relation to offences committed in the vicinity of checkpoints.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-ica-officers-get-enhanced-powers-to-conduct-searches-arrest-people-at|title=Parliament: ICA officers get enhanced powers to conduct searches, arrest people at checkpoints|last=hermesauto|date=2018-01-08|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 September 2018, Marvin Sim became the Commissioner of ICA. He was previously senior director of Joint Operations Group at MHA and deputy director at CNB.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/leadership-changes-at-ica-and-home-team-academy-10577146|title=Leadership changes at ICA and Home Team Academy|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 May 2019 during its Work Plan Seminar, ICA announced its new crest, mission and vision. The organisation's values remain unchanged.\n\n==== 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic ====\nICA officers became the first line of defense against the Covid-10 outbreak. The Singapore government announced travel bans on foreign visitors arriving from affected areas, temperature screening, Stay-Home Notices (SHN)  and other measures in order to contain the outbreak. \n\nStay-Home Notices were issued by ICA to travellers who were deemed to be \"at-risk\". Such travellers were not allowed to leave their house for a 14 day period, staying from the day of arrival. A man who had been issued a SHN posted on social media a photo of [[Bak kut teh|Bak Kut Teh]], a popular meat soup dish in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/03/shn-eat-bak-kut-teh-kena-warning/|title=S\u2019porean man who breached Stay-Home Notice for bak kut teh receives warning from ICA|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> ICA subsequently said that the man would be referred to the Attorney-General Chambers for further action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/follow-up-response-to-media-queries-on-man-breaching-shn-requirements-to-eat-bak-kut-teh|title=ICA {{!}} Follow-up Response To Media Queries On Man Breaching SHN Requirements To Eat Bak Kut Teh|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAs of 03 April 2020, no foreign visitors are allowed transit or entry into Singapore. All Long Term Pass Holders (i.e. foreign residents) must obtain entry approval before arriving in Singapore. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19|title=ICA {{!}} Updates on Border Control Measures in Response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Checkpoints ==\nBelow is a list of Singapore's ports of entries for persons, conveyances and goods.

Under the current [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] Services (HAS) (ICA) Unified scheme, new junior officers and senior officers join as Direct-Entry Sergeants and Direct-Entry Inspectors respectively. Direct-Entry Sergeants range from [[Institute of Technical Education|ITE]] graduates to polytechnic diploma holders.  Direct-Entry Inspectors must be graduates from a university accredited by its home country.  New Sergeants will become Primary Screening Officers, while Inspectors will become Team Leaders in their foundation posting. Regardless, all new officers will be posted to Tuas, Woodlands or Coastal Command.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_position|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref>\n\nAll ICA direct-entry Sergeants and Inspectors must attend and pass the ICA Basic Course which is held regularly at the [[Home Team Academy]]. The Basic Course includes lessons on document examination, basic unarmed combat and basic firearms training. The Basic Course lasts twenty weeks for Direct-Entry Inspectors <ref name=\":1\" /> and sixteen weeks for Direct-Entry Sergeants.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both courses are non-residential, are fully paid-for the duration of the courses and trainees will receive their substantive rank pay as well. In return, officers have to serve bonds of one to two years after graduation. Direct-Entry Sergeants also receive sign-on bonuses and retention pay-outs. To remain in service, officers will have to pass law examinations and a firearms shooting test.\n\nAdvanced courses are also conducted by ICA's Training Command. Direct Entry Sergeants are typically trained into specialists in different fields such as profiling, cargo examination and firearms shooting. Senior officers will first be exposed to ICA's ground operations before being sent to enforcement, service or staff units. Overseas postings at Singapore's consulates are also available. Furthermore, suitable officers at any level below that of Inspector may also secure scholarships and promotion into the rank of senior officers as part of the new unified scheme.\n\nThere is also a separate scheme for Management Executives who are deployed to the Services Centres. These officers are not considered immigration officers and do not don the blue uniform.\n\n=== Ranks ===\n\nBefore the merger, both SIR and CED had their own distinct rank progression. However, they were similar in that there was a separate scheme for Senior and Junior officers. This continued to be the case post-merger until 2017.\n\nSince 2017, ICA officer ranks have fallen under the HAS (ICA) Unified scheme.<ref>https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica_annual_2017.pdf</ref> All Immigration Officers are placed under this scheme regardless of education level.\n\nAs part of the unified scheme, the ranks of Corporal and Staff Sergeant were collapsed into a single Sergeant rank with numerical increments. The ranks of Senior Checkpoint Inspector were removed and suitable Checkpoint Inspectors would be promoted to Inspectors instead. A new rank, Deputy Assistant Commissioner was added to provide more opportunities for officers at the [[middle management]] level.\n\nAt present, ICA ranks follow those in the [[Singapore Police Force]] with some exceptions in insignia and naming (see table below).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_joinica|title=ICA -

In practice, only qualified officers serving in protective security related roles are issued firearms.\n\nThe service firearm is the 5-shot [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver. Other equipment include [[handcuffs]], [[Plastic handcuffs|flexicuffs]] and [[Baton (law enforcement)|expandable batons]].\n\n=== Uniform ===\nIn the early 1970s, Singapore Immigration had a brown and cream uniform. The colour of the uniforms did not vary for more than 20 years, with only modifications in style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_faf|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> In 1997, uniforms in green and white were introduced.\n\nIn 1996, the Customs uniforms and accessories were changed to a shade of blue reminiscent of the current design.\n\nIn 2003, the uniform was updated to its current design. The uniform became Navy Blue, which was chosen to establish ICA as a member of the Home Team.\n\nThe uniform comes in different designs to suit the varied operating environments of ICA. The basic field uniform consists of a short-sleeved dress shirt and pants with a dress or [[Police duty belt|duty belt]] as appropriate. This uniform can be most often seen in the Land and Sea checkpoints. Senior officers typically wear a [[Safari jacket|bush jacket]] (for men) or a tunic (for women). A dress skirt is also available for female staff officer. Air Domain officers working at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] wear two-piece suits with ties to conform with airport guidelines, while sea-going clearance team officers wear long-sleeve coastal uniforms that resemble the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]]'s Number 4 uniform. Cargo examination officers are issued [[polo shirt]]s due to their warm operational environment.\n\nIn 2016, a distinctive ICC domain insignia was designed for each domain to serve as a symbol of common identity for all HT officers operating in the domain. The domain insignia also encourages a greater sense of belonging and closer collaboration among Home Team officers.<ref name=\"ica badges\" />\n\n=== Technology ===\nICA integrates [[information technology]] to streamline the entry and exit procedure at checkpoints. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and other registered travelers can use automated lanes called enhanced-Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS). The Biometric Identification of Motorbikers (BIKES) System at ICA's land checkpoints can be used by residents and work pass holders entering and leaving Singapore by motorcycles.\n\nIn 2018, the ICA released the MyICA app which allowed citizens to process multiple transactions in a single payment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/myica-e-services-web-portal-passport-entry-visa-applications-10482494|title=ICA launches web portal for passport, entry visa applications|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAt ICA's 2019 Workplan Seminar, the New Clearance Concept was introduced. Foreigners would be allowed to use ICA's automated immigration gates upon arrival. They would fill in an electronic disembarkation card or e-DE card. Singaporeans will no longer have to present their passports or their thumbprints for immigration clearance at the automated gates. Instead, facial recognition technology will be utilised.<ref>{{Citation|last=ICAOutreach|title=New Clearance Concept|date=2019-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq803fcfU5s|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, ICA announced the cessation of physical embarkation cards. Arriving travellers would be directed to use the SG Arrival Card, an electronic embarkation card with apps in [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)|Apple's App Store]]. In view of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] outbreak, all travellers entering Singapore from 27 March 2020 were to fill in electronic health cards integrated into the SG Arrival Card website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/all-travellers-arriving-in-singapore-from-27-march-2020-0900-hours-must-submit-health-declaration-via-the-sg-arrival-card-e-service|title=ICA {{!}} All Travellers Arriving In Singapore From 27 March 2020, 0900 Hours, Must Submit Health Declaration Via The SG Arrival Card E-Service|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Biometric verification ====\nICA has progressively implemented the use of biometric verification to improve security at its checkpoints. ICA employs the use of biometry to find persons of interests and has deployed a suitcase sized facial recognition system to different checkpoints <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.htx.gov.sg/news/featured-news-identifying-a-face-amongst-thousands-at-our-borders|title=[Featured News] Identifying a Face amongst Thousands at Our Borders|website=HTX|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the Checkpoint Access Cards used fingerprint data to facilitate entry.\n\nIn October 2006, ICA began issuing biometric passports to Singapore citizens. In October 2017, ICA started issuance of new biometric passports that comes with additional security features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-design-for-singapore-passport-with-additional-security-features-ica|title=New design for Singapore passport with additional security features: ICA|last=hermesauto|date=2017-10-26|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}</ref> This marked the second series of biometrics passports issued by Singapore.

H. Arnold High School) is an American high school located in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, and is a part of the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]], the 9th largest United States School System. Although located in Germany, the school follows a traditional U.S. curriculum and traditional U.S. school activities.\n\n==History==\n\n==== 1940s ====\nWiesbaden High School was established in 1948 using a former German school building on Lahnstrasse. Prior to its opening, American high school students in Wiesbaden attended high school in [[Frankfurt American High School|Frankfurt]]. The initial school population was 56 students and nine faculty members. In 1949\u201350, the school was named '''General H.H. Arnold High School''' after [[Henry H. Arnold]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] and [[General of the Air Force]] during and immediately after [[World War II]]. The [[Berlin Blockade]] (Berlin Airlift) which started in Wiesbaden <ref>http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp</ref> coincided with the opening of the school, with many of the students\u2019 parents involved. \n\n==== 1950s ====\nIn January 1955, the school moved from Lahnstrasse to its present location on Texasstra\u00dfe just outside the Wiesbaden city limits. Students from outlying communities lived in dormitories during the school week. Later, students from [[Rhein Main Air Base]] and the [[Darmstadt]] Military community were bused to the school until the closure of these military facilities. \n\n==== 1960s / 1970s ====\nBy the 1970s the school population was up to 1800 students, recording its peak (1,809) the '72-'73 school year.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dodea.edu/WiesbadenHS/about.cfm|title=About Our School|last=Communications|first=DoDEA|website=www.dodea.edu|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> \n\n==== 1980s / 1990s ====\nAt the end of the 1980s the school's population was over 850 and nearly all students were either Air Force or Army [[Military dependent|dependents]], few others were children of [[United States federal civil service|DoD civilians]] or [[Expatriate|expatriates]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, and subsequent collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Soviet Union]], the [[Cold War]] effectively ended December 25, 1991. The student body began to decline rapidly as U.S. forces drew down their presence in Europe. By 1993, the student population dropped below 500 with the closure of numerous regional installations, including the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital, [[Europaviertel (Wiesbaden)|Lindsey Air Station]], Mainz Army Depot, [[Lee Barracks]], and Camp Pieri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Wikipedia%20Articles/Warriors%20newsletterWinter2018.pdf|title=Warrior Gazzette, December 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden High School / Gen.

Arnold High School  Alumni Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> In 1995, following the closure of the [[Frankfurt American High School]], Frankfurt-area students were bused to Wiesbaden, bringing enrollment to around 430 students.\n\n==== 2000s ====\nImmediately after the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on 9/11]], the school heightened its security, erecting fencing and posting armed US soldiers on its perimeter. The campus has remained behind enhanced [[physical security]] measures ever since. The school's populace increased to 600 students by 2005.<ref name=\":4\" />  In 2006 the school was officially renamed Wiesbaden High School. Despite the change, its historical name of 57 years, Gen. H. H. Arnold High School, is still widely used by tens of thousands of alumni, former faculty and community members. The school's post-[[Cold War]] transformation also resulted in a reversal of key demographics, with Army [[Military dependent|dependents]] becoming the school's majority and Air Force [[Military dependent|dependents]] in the minority. This reality led to a change of the school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program, which transitioned from Air Force to Army in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/wiesbadens-jrotc-warrior-battalion-pursues-designation-of-distinction/|title=Wiesbaden\u2019s JROTC Warrior Battalion pursues designation of distinction|date=2017-02-01|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/75663/masters_of_drill_wiesbaden_warrior_drill_team_defends_title_farewells_air_force_competition|title=Masters of drill: Wiesbaden Warrior drill team defends title, farewells Air Force competition|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Wiesbaden's long-standing Air Force [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program had been one of only four in Germany, and seven in Europe.     \n\n==== 2010s ====\nBy 2010, a multi-phased transformation of the 55-year-old campus had already begun. Demolition began with the iconic space station-like Dependent Youth Activities (DYA) building, who's futuristic profile stood prominently next to the football field. It was a recreational facility that provided a lunchtime hangout and alternative eatery to the cafeteria.

Arnold High School Crest.png|thumb|The General H. H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore.]]\n'''Protecting the school crest''' is arguably the most unique tradition remembered by school alumni. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, a general take is that no one was allowed to walk on the school crest, and it was the seniors' responsibility to enforce it.

H. Arnold High School) is an American high school located in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, and is a part of the [[Department of Defense Dependents Schools]], the 9th largest United States School System. Although located in Germany, the school follows a traditional U.S. curriculum and traditional U.S. school activities.\n\n==History==\n\n==== 1940s ====\nWiesbaden High School was established in 1948 using a former German school building on Lahnstrasse. Prior to its opening, American high school students in Wiesbaden attended high school in [[Frankfurt American High School|Frankfurt]]. The initial school population was 56 students and nine faculty members. In 1949\u201350, the school was named '''General H.H. Arnold High School''' after [[Henry H. Arnold]], [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] and [[General of the Air Force]] during and immediately after [[World War II]]. The [[Berlin Blockade]] (Berlin Airlift) which started in Wiesbaden <ref>http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/sites/about/history.asp</ref> coincided with the opening of the school, with many of the students\u2019 parents involved. \n\n==== 1950s ====\nIn January 1955, the school moved from Lahnstrasse to its present location on Texasstra\u00dfe just outside the Wiesbaden city limits. Students from outlying communities lived in dormitories during the school week. Later, students from [[Rhein Main Air Base]] and the [[Darmstadt]] Military community were bused to the school until the closure of these military facilities. \n\n==== 1960s / 1970s ====\nBy the 1970s the school population was up to 1800 students, recording its peak (1,809) the '72-'73 school year.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dodea.edu/WiesbadenHS/about.cfm|title=About Our School|last=Communications|first=DoDEA|website=www.dodea.edu|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> \n\n==== 1980s / 1990s ====\nAt the end of the 1980s the school's population was over 850 and nearly all students were either Air Force or Army [[Military dependent|dependents]], few others were children of [[United States federal civil service|DoD civilians]] or [[Expatriate|expatriates]]. After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] on November 9, 1989, and subsequent collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and [[Soviet Union]], the [[Cold War]] effectively ended December 25, 1991. The student body began to decline rapidly as U.S. forces drew down their presence in Europe. By 1993, the student population dropped below 500 with the closure of numerous regional installations, including the USAF Wiesbaden Hospital, [[Europaviertel (Wiesbaden)|Lindsey Air Station]], Mainz Army Depot, [[Lee Barracks]], and Camp Pieri.<ref>{{Cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Wikipedia%20Articles/Warriors%20newsletterWinter2018.pdf|title=Warrior Gazzette, December 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Wiesbaden High School / Gen.

Arnold High School  Alumni Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> In 1995, following the closure of the [[Frankfurt American High School]], Frankfurt-area students were bused to Wiesbaden, bringing enrollment to around 430 students.\n\n==== 2000s ====\nImmediately after the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on 9/11]], the school heightened its security, erecting fencing and posting armed US soldiers on its perimeter. The campus has remained behind enhanced [[physical security]] measures ever since. The school's populace increased to 600 students by 2005.<ref name=\":4\" />  In 2006 the school was officially renamed Wiesbaden High School. Despite the change, its historical name of 57 years, Gen. H. H. Arnold High School, is still widely used by tens of thousands of alumni, former faculty and community members. The school's post-[[Cold War]] transformation also resulted in a reversal of key demographics, with Army [[Military dependent|dependents]] becoming the school's majority and Air Force [[Military dependent|dependents]] in the minority. This reality led to a change of the school's [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program, which transitioned from Air Force to Army in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herald-union.com/wiesbadens-jrotc-warrior-battalion-pursues-designation-of-distinction/|title=Wiesbaden\u2019s JROTC Warrior Battalion pursues designation of distinction|date=2017-02-01|website=Herald Union|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/75663/masters_of_drill_wiesbaden_warrior_drill_team_defends_title_farewells_air_force_competition|title=Masters of drill: Wiesbaden Warrior drill team defends title, farewells Air Force competition|website=www.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Wiesbaden's long-standing Air Force [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] program had been one of only four in Germany, and seven in Europe.     \n\n==== 2010s ====\nBy 2010, a multi-phased transformation of the 55-year-old campus had already begun. Demolition began with the iconic space station-like Dependent Youth Activities (DYA) building, who's futuristic profile stood prominently next to the football field.

Arnold High School Crest.png|thumb|The General H. H. Arnold High School crest, an icon of the school's traditions and lore.]]\n'''Protecting the school crest''' is arguably the most unique tradition remembered by school alumni. Although there are variants of the crest's lore, a general take is that no one was allowed to walk on the school crest, and it was the seniors' responsibility to enforce it. This 'rule' was essential because 'the warrior' was buried beneath the crest and if anyone were to walk on it, his spirit would turn over. If that occurred, it was considered bad luck and the probable cause of losing any football game. During some periods of the school's history, it was acceptable for seniors to walk on the crest, a earned privilege.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 2005, at the conclusion of First Lady, Laura Bush's, message to 400 assembled 'Warriors,' she remarked, \"And there is one more important bit of advice I forgot to mention, and this is especially important for the lower class men: Whatever you do, don't walk on the Crest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/strong-family-base-at-home-important-for-deployed-troops-first-lady-tells-students-1.29799|title=Strong family base at home important for deployed troops, first lady tells students|website=Stars and Stripes|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>     \n\nThe crest was embedded into the floor of the main foyer amidst the early phases of school's construction.<ref name=\":2\" /> It comprises a mosaic-tiled blue shield with a black and red outline, featuring the school's symbolic profile of warrior with [[War bonnet|headdress]] and the school's former name (H H Arnold High School).

He is the father of Bruce Wayne ([[Batman]]), and husband of [[Martha Wayne]]. Wayne was introduced in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #33 (Nov. 1939), the first exposition of Batman's [[origin story]]. A gifted surgeon and philanthropist to [[Gotham City]], Wayne inherited the Wayne family fortune after Patrick Wayne. When Wayne and his wife are murdered in a street mugging, Bruce is inspired to fight crime as the [[vigilante]] Batman.<ref name=\"DC-ency\">{{cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 40\u201344 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>\n\nWayne was revived in [[Geoff Johns]]' alternate timeline comic ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (2011), in which he plays a major role as a hardened version of Batman, whose son was killed instead of his wife and himself, and dies again by the end of the storyline. Wayne returned to the main DC Universe in [[DC Rebirth]], as a revived amalgamation of his original self killed by [[Joe Chill]] and his ''Flashpoint'' Batman self killed by [[Eobard Thawne]] in \"[[The Button (comics)|The Button]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThomas Wayne, M.D. is seldom shown outside of Bruce Wayne and [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s memories of him, and often through Bruce's dreams and nightmares. He is frequently depicted as looking very much like his son, but with a mustache.\n\nA notable occurrence in Thomas\u2019 biography was when Bruce falls through a fissure on the Wayne property, into what would one day become the [[Batcave]] (sometimes the fissure is replaced with an abandoned well). Thomas eventually rescues his terrified son from the cave.\n\n[[File:Bruce Wayne Batman Vol 3 9.png|thumb|upright|Bruce Wayne with a portrait of his deceased parents in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #9 (Dec. 2016). Art by Mikel Jan\u00edn.]]\nDr. Wayne's role in his son's future vigilante career is expanded upon in ''The First Batman'', a [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] tale which reveals that Dr. Wayne attacks and defeats hoodlums while dressed like a \"Bat-Man\" for a masquerade ball. According to the story, Dr. Wayne's actions result in crime boss [[Lew Moxon]] being imprisoned; ten years later, Moxon orders [[Joe Chill]] to murder Dr. Wayne. Realizing Moxon ordered his parents killed, [[Batman]] confronts Moxon, now suffering from [[amnesia]] and thus has no memory of Dr. Wayne. When his [[Batsuit|costume]] is torn, Batman wears his father's in order to frighten Moxon. Sure enough, the costume restores Moxon's memory; the former crime boss panics, believing that Thomas\u2019 ghost is attacking, and flees into the streets and is struck and killed by a truck. These events were retold in the 1980 miniseries ''[[The Untold Legend of the Batman]]''. Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Thomas as the \"First Batman\" was [[retcon]]ned - he instead attends the masquerade ball as [[Zorro]]. This was retconned once more in the pages of ''[[Superman/Batman]]'', where [[Superman]], hoping to reverse some universe-altering change in the time streams, lands in a version of Gotham City in which Thomas never died, finding him giving out [[Halloween]] candy in the original Batman costume.\n\nIn many of the modern interpretations of the character, such as those by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Jeph Loeb]], Thomas Wayne is portrayed as having been a distant, stern father, bestowing more kindness and generosity on his patients than his own son.\n\nDr. Wayne was once suspected to be the father of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. However, [[DNA]] testing proved this to be false, and Bane's real father was recently revealed to be [[King Snake]].\n\nIn ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', a flashback reveals that Thomas Wayne saved the life of gangster [[Carmine Falcone]]. Falcone's father Vincent Falcone came to Wayne Manor and begged Thomas to save his dying son, who had been shot by rival gangster Luigi Maroni. Thomas wanted to take the younger Falcone to the hospital, but Vincent insisted that nobody know about the shooting; the surgery was thus performed in the dining room with Alfred assisting. After saving Carmine's life, he was offered a reward or favor, but refused to accept any form of payment. Unbeknownst to Thomas, young Bruce watched this all in silence from afar. Years later, Bruce contemplates whether Gotham would have been better off had his father let Falcone die; Alfred replies that Thomas would have helped anyone in need.\n\nIn ''Superman/Batman'' #50, it is revealed that, while on a drive with a pregnant Martha Wayne, Thomas witnesses a strange object fall to [[Earth]]. As he inspects it, Thomas' consciousness is transported to [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], and presented in a [[holograph]]ic form. There, he encounters [[Jor-El]], wishing to know what kind of a world Earth is, as it is one of many possible candidates for him to send his son Kal-El to. Thomas tells Jor-El that the people of Earth aren't perfect, but are essentially a good and kind race, who would raise the child right, convincing Jor-El to send Kal-El there. Upon returning to his body, Thomas uses the technology in the Kryptonian probe to revitalize a failing Wayne Enterprises. Years later, the alien technology would be the basis of much of Batman's crimefighting technology. Thomas recorded his encounter in a diary, which was discovered by Bruce in the present day.\n\n===Murder===\n{{Main|Origin of Batman}}\n[[File:The Wayne Family and Joe Chill (Detective Comics -33 (November 1939)).jpg|thumb|right|Bruce Wayne's family encounters Joe Chill in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #33 (Nov. 1939). Art by Bob Kane.]]\nWhen exiting a theater, Thomas and Martha Wayne are murdered by a mugger right in front of their son Bruce Wayne. This tragedy shocks Gotham and leads to Park Row (the street where it occurred) being labeled Crime Alley. Most importantly, it serves as the motivation for Bruce to become Batman.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 1: Batman |date=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co |isbn=0-02-538700-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco01flei/page/378/mode/2up |accessdate=29 March 2020 |pages=379-380}}</ref>\n\n===Alleged double life===\nDuring ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', it is alleged that Thomas Wayne and [[Martha Wayne]] were leading a double life, secretly partaking in criminal endeavors, [[drug abuse]] and [[orgy|orgies]] while presenting a fa\u00e7ade of respectability to the outside world. The alleged evidence is revealed to be doctored in the aftermath of the storyline, however.\n\nDoctor [[Simon Hurt]], head of The Black Glove and the mastermind behind ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', actually claims to ''be'' Thomas Wayne to both Bruce Wayne and Alfred Pennyworth. Although both of them rebuke him without hesitation, Hurt never explicitly drops the claim.\n\nIn the ongoing follow-up series, ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman & Robin]]'', it is suggested that some, if not all, of these allegations have begun to circulate around Gotham; [[Dick Grayson]] and [[Damian Wayne]] attend a high society function where a few party guests vaguely mention the existence of rumors surrounding the family, and Dick tries to tie Bruce's absence from the public eye with being occupied with clearing his family's reputation.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' (vol. 1) #4 (November 2009)</ref> Matters come to a head when Hurt returns to the city, claiming to be Thomas Wayne in order to take control of Wayne Manor and establish himself as the new Batman, but Grayson and Damian outsmart him.\n\nIt is hinted at during the course of the ''Batman and Robin'' series that Simon Hurt's actual identity is Thomas Wayne, albeit one from the 17th century who was a 'black sheep' of the Wayne family and prolongs his life through occult rituals. The ''[[Return of Bruce Wayne]]'' miniseries and its fallout ''[[Bruce Wayne: The Road Home]]'' cements Hurt's status as the elder Thomas Wayne from the Puritan Ages, driven insane by his meeting with ''Barbatos'', the Hyper-Adapter sent through time along with Bruce Wayne to ensure the effectiveness of Darkseid's \"Omega Sanction\".\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Flashpoint===\n{{Main|Batman (Thomas Wayne)}}\n\n===''Batman: Castle of the Bat''===\nIn ''[[Batman: Castle of the Bat]]'', Doctor Bruce Wayne discovers the preserved brain of his father deep below the research university where he works. He steals this and other body parts in a desperate attempt to revive his beloved father from death. This doesn't work out well due to various factors outside his control, but the part of the creature that still recognizes and loves his son does its best to help Bruce escape his enemies and expose the person responsible for the Waynes' murders; Thomas had discovered that one of his colleagues was killing people to perfect the preservation fluid used to store organs (Including Thomas's own brain, claimed by his killer after his death).<ref>''Castle of the Bat'' (November 1994)</ref>\n\n===''Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty''===\nIn ''[[Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty]]'', Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne are saved from death when [[Vandal Savage|Valentin Sinclair]]- really [[Vandal Savage]], a man who has a long-standing interest and admiration for the Wayne family despite the fact that they often end up opposing him when they learn about his plans- scares off Joe Chill. Sinclair then becomes a partner in Wayne Enterprises, only to have the Waynes killed when they threaten to expose his plan to divert the meteor that gave him his powers back to Earth in order to study it. Their deaths come at the hands of Sinclair's fear-inducing henchman Scarecrone who causes them to remember the mugging, which drives them to flee Chill by running off their balcony. This prompts Bruce to become Batman to investigate.\n\n===''Batman: Holy Terror''===\nIn ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'', depicting an alternate timeline where [[Oliver Cromwell]] established a [[theocratic]] government across the globe, Thomas Wayne is the chief physician of the [[Privy Council]], but when it is discovered that he is treating various 'enemies of the state' such as Jews or homosexuals, the Star Chamber votes by secret ballot to have him and Martha executed and make it look like a random mugging.\n\n===''Batman: Earth One''===\n[[File:Thomas Wayne (Earth One version - circa 2012).png|thumb|upright|Thomas Wayne in ''Batman: Earth One''. Art by Gary Frank and Jon Sibal.]]\nIn the graphic novel written by [[Geoff Johns]] and with art by [[Gary Frank]], ''[[Batman: Earth One]]'', Thomas Wayne was a physician who had run for mayor against [[Penguin (character)|Oswald Cobblepot]]. Cobblepot had attempted to arrange his opponent's murder during the latter's outing to a movie with his family, but a mugger got to them first and killed Thomas and his wife. It is also implied that both he and Alfred are keeping a traumatic secret.\n\n===''JLA: Earth 2''===\nIn ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]], the Thomas Wayne of the [[antimatter]] universe is the father of the supervillain [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]. Like his original counterpart, he married Martha Kane and fathered Bruce Wayne. However, this version also had a second child named Thomas Wayne Jr. After Martha and Bruce are gunned down by a crooked police officer when Thomas Sr. refused to accompany him for questioning as Thomas Wayne had performed an \"illegal medical operation,\" Thomas Jr. becomes Owlman to get revenge on the justice system. It is later revealed that Thomas Wayne Sr. is currently acting as commissioner of the [[Gotham City Police Department]], seeking to bring his son to justice with the help of a cadre of idealistic officers. Owlman finds it his goal to \"punish\" his father for letting his mother and brother die.<ref>''JLA: Earth 2'' (2000)</ref>\n\n===''Superman: Red Son''===\nIn [[Mark Millar]]'s ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', Batman's (unnamed) parents are [[anti-communist]] protesters in the [[Soviet Union]]. They are executed in their home by [[NKVD]] Commissar [[Pete Ross|Pyotr Roslov]] for printing and distributing anti-communist pamphlets. Their son witnesses the murders and attempts to overthrow the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] when he is an adult.<ref>''Superman: Red Son'' #1-3 (June\u2013August 2003)</ref>\n\n===''Smallville''===\nThe fifth issue of the comic book continuation of the television series ''[[Smallville]]'', written by executive story editor [[Bryan Q. Miller]], reveals that [[Lionel Luthor]] invited Thomas to join the secret society Veritas with Virgil Swann, which Thomas declined.<ref>''Smallville Season 11'' vol. 1 #5 (September 2012)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\n====Earth 2====\nIn the revised [[Earth-Two]] alternate universe of \"The New 52\", Thomas Wayne is revealed to be the second version of [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Batman]], having succeeded his son as the incumbent through use of the Miraclo pill of [[Hourman]] (Rex Tyler) which enhances his strength and agility. He states that he is 65 years old. In contrast to his depiction on the Prime Earth, he and Martha Wayne are targeted for assassination due to Thomas's [[Organized crime|Mafia]] connections and subsequent efforts to \"straighten out\" when Bruce was born. Thomas hides the fact that he survived for many years in order to keep Bruce safe. Eventually, when the first version of Batman tracks Thomas down, he learns the truth and rejects Thomas's reason for being \"dead\" for most of Bruce's life, thus discouraging him from ever having any future relationship with his son, and by extension Bruce and the former [[Catwoman]] Selina Kyle Wayne's family. However, he watched them from afar and tried to be as involved as he could, particularly with their daughter Helena. After Bruce's death saving Earth 2 from an Apokoliptan invasion, Thomas honors him by taking up the \"mantle of the Bat\" and makes use of Miraclo to help him fight crime.<ref>\"Earth 2: Annual #2 (2014)</ref>\n\nAfter Earth-2's destruction in the war with Apokolips as seen in the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' storyline, Thomas Wayne is one of the few survivors transferred to Telos's world, along with Dick Grayson and other heroes.<ref>''Convergence'' #1</ref> While investigating this world, Thomas travels with Dick into a variation of the pre-''Flashpoint'' Gotham City where he has an unknown conversation with Bruce before he departs with Dick in a flying Batmobile.<ref>''Convergence'' vol.1 #2</ref> When they are cornered by the Club of Villains, who pursued them out of the city, Thomas sacrifices himself in a suicide bomb blast, destroying most of the Club of Villains in the process, his last words being to inform the Club of Villains that they will never hurt another Batman.<ref>''Convergence'' vol.1 #3</ref>\n\n====Earth 3====\nIn the revised Earth-Three alternate universe of \"The New 52\", Thomas Wayne Sr. is featured in Owlman's origin story. In stark contrast to Batman's father who was a highly skilled surgeon and philanthropist who had saved countless lives during his time, Earth-Three Thomas Wayne is a cowardly and sociopathic doctor who often kills his patients (Martha claims that this is due to a \"surgical fetish\") and spends his money on lawyers to cover up his patients' deaths as accidents. [[Outsider (comics)|Earth 3's Alfred]] kills him along with Martha and Bruce Wayne as per Thomas Wayne Jr.'s orders. Owlman later states that his father was a weak man and wonders why Batman would devote his life to the memory of Thomas Wayne of Prime Earth.\n\n===''DC Comics Bombshells''===\nIn the opening of the first issue of the comics ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', set in an alternate history 1940, Thomas and Martha Wayne's lives are saved by an already-existing [[Batwoman]], implying that Bruce Wayne will never grow up to become Batman. However, in the final issue, set in 1960, the now grown up Bruce Wayne takes up training and becomes Batman, to honor the person who saved him and his parents' lives.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n* While Thomas never appears in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], Bruce Wayne has brought up that the murder of his parents is what motivates him to take down criminals. In the first episode, Bruce mentions his father's law books, implying that his father wasn't a doctor like the other versions.\n* Thomas Wayne appears on the Fox television series ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by [[Grayson McCouch]] in the pilot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/12/02/a-joker-in-gothams-past-a-grundy-in-arrows-future/ |title=A Double Murder In Gotham's Past And A Grundy In Arrow's Future (UPDATE) |publisher=Bleedingcool.com |date=2013-12-02 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref> His and [[Martha Wayne]]'s murder is the main focus of the series as they are shot in the pilot episode by a masked man in shiny shoes. This murder was also witnessed by [[Selina Kyle]]. In the episode \"The Anvil or the Hammer\", it is revealed by Sid Bunderslaw that Thomas had kept quiet about the illegal activities at Wayne Enterprises. In the episode \"Wrath of the Villains: This Ball of Mud and Meanness\", it was revealed that [[Matches Malone|Patrick \"Matches\" Malone]] was the one who killed Thomas and Martha Wayne. In the episode \"Wrath of the Villains: Pinewood\", Thomas is revealed to be a dear friend of [[Hugo Strange]] who attempted to reason with him prior to his death to not oppose [[Court of Owls|the group]] behind Wayne Enterprises. This led to Hugo Strange being given orders to orchestrate Thomas Wayne's death. The episode \"Ace Chemicals\" revealed that [[Jeremiah Valeska]] had abducted a husband and wife who had the same bone structure and build as Thomas and Martha Wayne where he had [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]] hypnotize them and a doctor that works for him do plastic surgery on them. This is part of Jeremiah's plot to re-enact the night when Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered. When it came to the murder in the alley, Jeremiah had already killed the doubles after they served their purpose and replaced them with a brainwash James Gordon and Leslie Thompkins with the hypnosis ending when the pearls hit the ground upon their death. This murder attempt was thwarted by Selina Kyle.\n* Thomas Wayne appears in the prequel series ''[[Pennyworth (TV series)|Pennyworth]]'' as part of the main cast portrayed by [[Ben Aldridge (actor)|Ben Aldridge]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/pennyworth-ben-aldridge-cast-thomas-wayne-batman-prequel-on-epix-1202482014/|title=\u2018Pennyworth\u2019: Ben Aldridge To Play Thomas Wayne In Batman Prequel On Epix|magazine=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 15, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2018|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva}}</ref> In this version, he's a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent operating out of Gotham in [[England]] to monitor Alfred and go undercover in the No Name League.\n* A photo of Thomas appears in [[Wayne Manor]] in ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]''.\n\n====Animation====\n* Thomas Wayne appears with his wife in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', voiced by [[Paul Kirby (voice actor)|Paul Kirby]]. In a flashback in the episode \"The Fear\", they are confronted by an [[Joe Chill|unidentified mugger]], just after watching a [[Robin Hood]] film with their son Bruce Wayne. When Thomas tries to fight the mugger, Bruce says \"No Dad, he's got a...\" and lightning flashes as his parents are shot. This was the first time Batman's origin was shown outside of the comics.\n* Dr. Thomas Wayne is alluded on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. Dr. Wayne was a good friend of [[Marion Grange]] (mayor of Gotham City for the first four seasons), [[Lucius Fox]] (CEO of [[Wayne Enterprises]]) and [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. After taking their son to watch the film ''The Cloaked Rider'', Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered by an unidentified mugger. In several episodes in the first season, Bruce Wayne goes over his parents' murder several times. In the fourth season's premiere, Batman tells [[Dick Grayson]], whose parents have just been murdered by [[Tony Zucco]], that the \"[[Joe Chill|man who murdered my parents]] was never brought to justice\". Also in the future, it was misinterpreted that Thomas was Batman while Martha was [[Batwoman]] and their son was Red Robin.\n* Thomas Wayne is featured in several times in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Corey Burton]] (in \"Invasion of the Secret Santas!\") as well as [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] (in \"Dawn of the Deadman!\") and [[Adam West]] (in \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\"). He appears in a flashback of the episode \"Invasion of the Secret Santas!\" and also appears as a ghost in the episode \"Dawn of the Deadman!\". The character has a more central role in the episode \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\", where the [[Phantom Stranger]] takes Batman back in time to a costume party Thomas attended. Batman notes that Thomas's costume is very similar to [[Batsuit|his own design]]. Batman teams up with his father to fight a gang of robbers led by [[Lew Moxon]] and learns new information about Thomas's and Martha's murder.\n* Thomas Wayne appears in several flashback sequences in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[Anthony Ruivivar]]. He appears in the episodes \"Secrets\", \"Fall\", \"Monsters\", and \"Unique\".\n\n=====DC Animated Universe=====\n* Thomas Wayne has sporadic appearances in the [[DC Animated Universe]], primarily voiced by [[Kevin Conroy]].\n** Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', initially voiced by [[Richard Moll]] (in \"Nothing to Fear\", \"Dreams in Darkness\" and \"Two-Face\"). In this version, Thomas and his wife [[Martha Wayne]] are murdered in Crime Alley by an unidentified man. The murder is only occasionally alluded to via nightmares. In the episode \"Nothing to Fear\", Batman is under the influence of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s fear toxin and has a hallucination of his father being ashamed of him. In the episode \"Dreams in Darkness\", Batman is once again drugged with fear toxin and sees his parents walking towards a tunnel, and runs towards them telling them to stop. They enter the tunnel, which is revealed to be the barrel of a giant gun, dripping blood. Batman screams as the world is bleached white and a loud shot is heard. In the episode \"Two-Face\", Batman has a nightmare about failing to save the [[Two-Face|titular villain]], and Thomas appears alongside Martha and asks, \"Why couldn't you save ''us'', son?\". The series also makes use of the rose motif that the films ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Batman Forever]]'' associate with the murder. Bruce Wayne leaves roses at the site of his parents' murder on the event's anniversary (as he does in the comics except that he leaves the roses on their graves). As in the comics, his friend Dr. [[Leslie Thompkins]] serves as one of his son's legal guardians. Thomas was also close friends with [[Crime Doctor (DC Comics)|Dr. Matthew Thorne]] and Dr. Long (faculty of Gotham University).\n** Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In the episode \"For the Man Who Has Everything\", Batman is temporarily trapped by the hallucinogenic plant Black Mercy where his perfect dream world shows his father fighting and disarming [[Joe Chill]]. Batman knows that this is not real and so the Black Mercy plant is removed, ending the hallucination with the sound of a gunshot.\n\n===Film===\n\n====Live-action====\n\n=====''Batman'' (1989 film series)=====\n{{main|Batman in film#Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher}}\n* Thomas Wayne appeared in [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', portrayed by David Baxt. In a flashback, the Waynes are ambushed in an alley by [[Joker (character)|Jack Napier]]'s gang. As Thomas tries to fight off the gang members, Napier shoots him and Martha.\n* ''[[Batman Forever]]'' features a new flashback to the murder of the Waynes, with Michael Scranton as Thomas Wayne.\n\n=====''The Dark Knight'' Trilogy=====\n{{main|Batman in film#Christopher Nolan \u2013 The Dark Knight Trilogy}}\n* [[Linus Roache]] played Thomas Wayne in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005). In this incarnation, he is a surgeon at the [[Gotham City]] hospital, the fifth generation of the Wayne family to live in [[Wayne Manor]], and was the chairman of [[Wayne Enterprises]]. When the young Bruce Wayne falls into a cave, Thomas personally rescues his son by rappelling down into the cave. Thomas says to his son, \"Bruce, why do we fall?...So that we can learn to pick ourselves up again.\" According to [[Alfred Pennyworth]], he and Martha Wayne believed the example they set would help inspire Gotham's wealthy elite to participate in helping the city. One of his endeavors included building an efficient public transit system in the form of raised trains, in order to provide free transportation to the people of Gotham. In this version, he and Martha are murdered at gunpoint by [[Joe Chill]]. They leave the performance of the ''[[Mefistofele]]'' opera early when Bruce is scared by performers dressed as bats. Dr. Wayne tries to protect his wife after Chill tries to rip off Martha's necklace. Chill then shoots and kills both of them and runs off. Wayne's last words to his son are \"Bruce...don't be afraid.\" It is revealed in the film that the deaths of two such prominent citizens encourages Gotham City's elite to bring it back from the brink of ruin (temporarily foiling [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s plan to destroy Gotham's economy).\n* In ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012), Bruce Wayne is helped by his father's memory with the strength to climb out and escape of \"The Pit\" prison in the Middle East that superficially resembles the well that Thomas rescued his son from as a child.\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\n[[File:Jeffrey Dean Morgan by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] portrays Thomas Wayne in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016)]]\n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] portrayed Thomas Wayne in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. In this version, the Waynes leave the theater after seeing the 1940 Tyrone Power version of ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]''. A mugger holds them at gunpoint under a train bridge. Thomas steps in front of the mugger in an attempt to save his family, but the mugger shoots him. His wife [[Martha Wayne]] is also killed as the mugger tries to take her pearl necklace. But the necklace breaks into pieces as she falls and the mugger then runs away, probably due to fear of police. Before dying, Thomas sees his dead wife and calls out \"Martha\" as his last word.\n* A portrait of Thomas Wayne in the likeness of Jeffrey Dean Morgan appears in Wayne Manor in both ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' and ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''.\n\n=====''Joker''=====\nOn August 27, 2018, it was announced that actor [[Alec Baldwin]] would be portraying Thomas Wayne in the film ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/joker-movie-todd-phillips-alec-baldwin-thomas-wayne-batman-father-1202452962/|title=Alec Baldwin Joins Todd Phillips' 'Joker'|magazine=Deadline|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=August 27, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the portrayal would be a departure from the traditional comic book version with the character re-interpreted as \"a cheesy and tanned businessman who is more in the mold of a 1980s [[Donald Trump]].\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/alec-baldwin-joins-joker-movie-as-bruce-waynes-father-113784|title='Joker' Movie: Alec Baldwin to Play Bruce Wayne's Father|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=August 27, 2018}}</ref> Two days later, Baldwin told ''[[USA Today]]'' that he had withdrawn from the role because of \"scheduling issues\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title=Alec Baldwin pulls out of Thomas Wayne role in 'Joker': 'I'm no longer doing that movie'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/08/29/alec-baldwin-drops-thomas-wayne-role-joker-movie-exclusive/1136678002/|newspaper=USA Today|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}</ref> On September 17, 2018, [[Brett Cullen]] was cast in the role, replacing Baldwin.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chitwood |first1=Adam |title=Brett Cullen Replaces Alec Baldwin as Thomas Wayne in 'Joker' |url=http://collider.com/joker-movie-thomas-wayne-actor-brett-cullen/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |accessdate=September 17, 2018 |date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThomas Wayne in this film is portrayed much less sympathetically than in other incarnations. He is a successful businessman who is running to become Mayor of Gotham City, however he has little sympathy for the lower classes, believing that they have no-one else but themselves to blame for their misfortune. During the course of the movie Arthur Fleck ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]) discovers from a letter his mother Penny is writing (one of many) that he may be the son of Wayne, borne out of an affair while Penny worked for the Wayne family. When Arthur sneaks backstage at an event and confronts Wayne, who refutes the accusation claiming that there was no affair and Penny adopted Arthur before being institutionalized (Penny says that Thomas created the adoption paperwork in order to hide the affair). Thomas then punches Arthur for earlier speaking to his son and threatens to kill Arthur if he ever comes near Bruce and hurts him. At the end of the film, Thomas, Martha and Bruce attempt to flee a riot that has engulfed the city by ducking down an alley, only for one of the rioters to follow them down and kill Thomas and Martha in front of Bruce, being influenced by the riots and killing them under Arthur's ideas (unlike other incarnations where the shooting is a robbery gone wrong).\n\n====Animation====\n* Thomas Wayne is referenced several times in ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]''.\n* Dr. Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Jason Marsden]].\n* Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (film)|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', voiced by [[Bruce Timm]].\n* The [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] iteration of Batman appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'', voiced by [[Kevin McKidd]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/DC-animated-flashpoint-paradox-news.html |title=FLASHPOINT PARADOX Gets Release Date, Cast, Logline |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Rich Sands |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greys-Anatomy-Kevin-McKidd-Justin-Chambers-Justice-League-Flashpoint-Paradox-1064095.aspx |title=First Look: Grey's Anatomy Stars Get Animated for Justice League |publisher=Tvguide.com |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref> Just like in the original Flashpoint universe, Thomas Wayne turns into a crime-fighting vigilante after his son's death while [[Martha Wayne]] goes insane as the Joker. Batman doesn't care about crime outside Gotham City and has his successful casinos fund his seemingly fruitless fight on crime. Despite his cynical outlook, Batman reluctantly assist Barry Allen with a device to recreate the accident behind Barry's powers as the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]. After the first attempt fails and the second attempt restores Barry's powers, Batman and Flash contact [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] for help in tracking down the government branch that hid the frail [[Superman|Kal-El]]. When Kal-El's freedom failed along with Flash's painful altered memories, the alternate Dark Knight tries to prevent the speedster's mental deterioration with his son's memory. As the World War between [[Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] reaches its breaking point, Cyborg's [[Suicide Squad (comics)|crude team]] heads to the final battle in Batman's plane. During the chaos, Batman and [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] kill off [[Black Manta]] to which Batman dryly refers to Grifter as the \"[[Robin (comics)|boy idiot]]\" before the alternate Dark Knight gets injured by the [[Ocean Master]]. In the middle of [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom]]'s monologue to Flash, Batman shoots the evil speedster in the head. Before Flash leaves to escape the alternate world, Thomas gives Flash a letter for his son. In the [[The New 52|New 52]] universe, Flash gives Thomas's letter to [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne).\n* Thomas Wayne briefly appears during a flashback in ''[[Son of Batman]]''.\n* Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Batman vs. Robin]]'', voiced again by Kevin Conroy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/animated-batman-robin-movie-finds-763553 |title=Animated 'Batman vs. Robin' Movie Finds Its Voice Cast (Exclusive) |date=January 14, 2015 |last=Kit |first=Borys |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n* In ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', a picture of Thomas, Martha and a young Bruce is seen in Wayne Manor as Bruce looks at it telling his dead parents that he saved Gotham City again.\n* Thomas Wayne appears in ''DC Super Heroes vs. Eagle Talon'', voiced by Frogman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://DC-taka.com/character/\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30b9\u306e|title=\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u540d|website=DC-taka.com|language=Japanese|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n* The Flashpoint iteration of Batman makes non-voiced appearances in ''[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]'', recalling the moment he shot Eobard Thawne's head in ''The Flashpoint Paradox'', a feat acknowledged with respect by [[Deadshot]].\n\n===Video games===\n* Thomas Wayne makes a cameo in ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''.\n* The Flashpoint Batman's outfit is one of the playable costumes for Batman (Bruce Wayne) in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mallory|first=Jordan|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/27/lobo-trounces-flashpoint-batman-in-first-injustice-gods-among-u/|title=Lobo trounces Flashpoint Batman in first Injustice: Gods Among Us DLC footage [Update: Lobo on May 7|publisher=Joystiq|date=2013-04-27|accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref>\n* Thomas Wayne appears in flashbacks in ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. In this continuity, it is revealed that he had criminal ties to [[Carmine Falcone]] and [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Mayor Hamilton Hill]]. Additionally, Thomas was responsible for forcibly putting a number of people to Arkham Asylum, including Oswald Cobblepot's mother. Once Martha discovered the full extent of his crimes, she began planning to expose him, only for Hill to discover her plan and send Joe Chill to kill both Thomas and Martha in Crime Alley. Bruce and most of Gotham remained unaware of his crimes until twenty years after his death when a group called the Children of Arkham (a group largely consisting of Thomas' victims and their loved ones) publicly release evidence of his crimes. Due to Thomas being long dead by the time his crimes became public, Bruce (despite having no involvement in his father's crimes) becomes the target of much of the anger from both the Children of Arkham and the people of Gotham, with many of them convincing themselves that Bruce is no better than his father.\n* Thomas Wayne is mentioned in ''[[Batman: The Enemy Within]]'', a sequel to ''Batman: The Telltale Series''. He is mentioned by Bruce Wayne when reviewing his father's actions and brings him up when he talks with Harley Quinn. He is a major factor in why Alfred decides to leave Bruce in the 5th episode, fearing that Bruce's need for control will end in his death as it did with Thomas.\n\n====''Batman Arkham''====\nThomas Wayne is featured in the ''[[Batman Arkham]]'' series where Kevin Conroy reprises the role.\n\n* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Batman, while under the influence of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s fear toxin, experiences flashbacks of his parents' murder, and has nightmares of his parents in body bags in the medical facility\u2019s morgue. Additionally, a bench in [[Arkham Asylum]] dedicated to Thomas and Martha Wayne is the answer to one of the [[Riddler (comics)|Riddler]]'s riddles, which leads to Thomas and Martha's unlockable biography.\n* Thomas Wayne is alluded in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. The Monarch Theatre (the site of the Wayne murders) is featured in Arkham City. Near the gates of Ra's al Ghul's hideout, Batman collapses from the effects of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s blood poison and sees a vision of his parents in front of a light, imploring their son to come into it and reunite with them. However, Batman shrugs it off and continues on. If the player visits the site of the murder, Batman discovers a pair of chalk outlines resembling his parents' bodies, as well as a bouquet of flowers and a tape recording from [[Hugo Strange]], taunting the Dark Knight. The player then has the option to \"pay respect\" to the site, causing Batman to kneel at the site for a time. The Waynes' murders is also briefly mentioned in one of the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s interview tapes during which Penguin tells Strange of being overjoyed after hearing the Waynes had been murdered, revealing hatred of the Wayne family due mainly to the Cobblepot family's long standing feud with them.\n* The character is alluded in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]''. Following his capture of the Joker at the Royal Hotel and return to the Batcave, Batman has a vision of his parents' murder in [[Crime Alley]]. The site of the Waynes' murder can be found in Park Row's Crime Alley behind the Monarch Theatre (in the same location as it appeared in Arkham City). The pair of chalk outlines of Thomas and Martha are present along with a single rose. Thomas' New 52 Earth-2 Batman costume is an alternate outfit which can be used in challenge mode, online multiplayer, and story mode once the main story is completed.\n* The ''Flashpoint'' Batman suit and Thomas Wayne's New 52 Earth-2 Batman suit appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', as Downloadable Content (DLC).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 Julie Madison, the Batarang and the Batgyro was debuted by Gardner Fox, Bob Kane and Sheldon Moldoff.

He is the father of Bruce Wayne ([[Batman]]), and husband of [[Martha Wayne]]. Wayne was introduced in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #33 (Nov. 1939), the first exposition of Batman's [[origin story]]. A gifted surgeon and philanthropist to [[Gotham City]], Wayne inherited the Wayne family fortune after Patrick Wayne. When Wayne and his wife are murdered in a street robbery, Bruce is inspired to fight crime as the [[vigilante]] Batman.<ref name=\"DC-ency\">{{cite book | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = | contribution = Batman | editor-last = Dougall | editor-first = Alastair | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia | pages = 40\u201344 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | place = London | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1}}</ref>\n\nWayne was revived in [[Geoff Johns]]' alternate timeline comic ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (2011), in which he plays a major role as a hardened version of Batman, whose son was killed instead of his wife and himself, and dies again by the end of the storyline. Wayne returned to the main DC Universe in [[DC Rebirth]], as a revived amalgamation of his original self killed by [[Joe Chill]] and his ''Flashpoint'' Batman self killed by [[Eobard Thawne]] in \"[[The Button (comics)|The Button]]\".\n\n==Background==\nThomas Wayne, M.D. is seldom shown outside of Bruce Wayne and [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s memories of him, and often through Bruce's dreams and nightmares. He is frequently depicted as looking very much like his son, but with a mustache.\n\nA notable occurrence in Thomas\u2019 biography was when Bruce falls through a fissure on the Wayne property, into what would one day become the [[Batcave]] (sometimes the fissure is replaced with an abandoned well). Thomas eventually rescues his terrified son from the cave.\n\n[[File:Bruce Wayne Batman Vol 3 9.png|thumb|upright|Bruce Wayne with a portrait of his deceased parents in ''Batman'' vol. 3, #9 (Dec. 2016). Art by Mikel Jan\u00edn.]]\nDr. Wayne's role in his son's future vigilante career is expanded upon in ''The First Batman'', a [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] tale which reveals that Dr. Wayne attacks and defeats hoodlums while dressed like a \"Bat-Man\" for a masquerade ball. According to the story, Dr. Wayne's actions result in crime boss [[Lew Moxon]] being imprisoned; ten years later, Moxon orders [[Joe Chill]] to murder Dr. Wayne. Realizing Moxon ordered his parents killed, [[Batman]] confronts Moxon, now suffering from [[amnesia]] and thus has no memory of Dr. Wayne. When his [[Batsuit|costume]] is torn, Batman wears his father's in order to frighten Moxon. Sure enough, the costume restores Moxon's memory; the former crime boss panics, believing that Thomas\u2019 ghost is attacking, and flees into the streets and is struck and killed by a truck. These events were retold in the 1980 miniseries ''[[The Untold Legend of the Batman]]''. Following the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]], Thomas as the \"First Batman\" was [[retcon]]ned - he instead attends the masquerade ball as [[Zorro]]. This was retconned once more in the pages of ''[[Superman/Batman]]'', where [[Superman]], hoping to reverse some universe-altering change in the time streams, lands in a version of Gotham City in which Thomas never died, finding him giving out [[Halloween]] candy in the original Batman costume.\n\nIn many of the modern interpretations of the character, such as those by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[Jeph Loeb]], Thomas Wayne is portrayed as having been a distant, stern father, bestowing more kindness and generosity on his patients than his own son.\n\nDr. Wayne was once suspected to be the father of [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. However, [[DNA]] testing proved this to be false, and Bane's real father was recently revealed to be [[King Snake]].\n\nIn ''[[Batman: The Long Halloween]]'', a flashback reveals that Thomas Wayne saved the life of gangster [[Carmine Falcone]]. Falcone's father Vincent Falcone came to Wayne Manor and begged Thomas to save his dying son, who had been shot by rival gangster Luigi Maroni. Thomas wanted to take the younger Falcone to the hospital, but Vincent insisted that nobody know about the shooting; the surgery was thus performed in the dining room with Alfred assisting. After saving Carmine's life, he was offered a reward or favor, but refused to accept any form of payment. Unbeknownst to Thomas, young Bruce watched this all in silence from afar. Years later, Bruce contemplates whether Gotham would have been better off had his father let Falcone die; Alfred replies that Thomas would have helped anyone in need.\n\nIn ''Superman/Batman'' #50, it is revealed that, while on a drive with a pregnant Martha Wayne, Thomas witnesses a strange object fall to [[Earth]]. As he inspects it, Thomas' consciousness is transported to [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]], and presented in a [[holograph]]ic form. There, he encounters [[Jor-El]], wishing to know what kind of a world Earth is, as it is one of many possible candidates for him to send his son Kal-El to. Thomas tells Jor-El that the people of Earth aren't perfect, but are essentially a good and kind race, who would raise the child right, convincing Jor-El to send Kal-El there. Upon returning to his body, Thomas uses the technology in the Kryptonian probe to revitalize a failing Wayne Enterprises. Years later, the alien technology would be the basis of much of Batman's crimefighting technology. Thomas recorded his encounter in a diary, which was discovered by Bruce in the present day.\n\n===Murder===\n{{Main|Origin of Batman}}\n[[File:The Wayne Family and Joe Chill (Detective Comics -33 (November 1939)).jpg|thumb|right|Bruce Wayne's family encounters Joe Chill in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #33 (Nov. 1939).

This tragedy shocks Gotham and leads to Park Row (the street where it occurred) being labeled Crime Alley. Most importantly, it serves as the motivation for Bruce to become Batman.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleisher |first1=Michael L. |title=The Encyclopedia of Comic Book Heroes, Volume 1: Batman |date=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co |isbn=0-02-538700-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco01flei/page/378/mode/2up |accessdate=29 March 2020 |pages=379-380}}</ref>\n\n===Alleged double life===\nDuring ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', it is alleged that Thomas Wayne and [[Martha Wayne]] were leading a double life, secretly partaking in criminal endeavors, [[drug abuse]] and [[orgy|orgies]] while presenting a fa\u00e7ade of respectability to the outside world. The alleged evidence is revealed to be doctored in the aftermath of the storyline, however.\n\nDoctor [[Simon Hurt]], head of The Black Glove and the mastermind behind ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'', actually claims to ''be'' Thomas Wayne to both Bruce Wayne and Alfred Pennyworth. Although both of them rebuke him without hesitation, Hurt never explicitly drops the claim.\n\nIn the ongoing follow-up series, ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman & Robin]]'', it is suggested that some, if not all, of these allegations have begun to circulate around Gotham; [[Dick Grayson]] and [[Damian Wayne]] attend a high society function where a few party guests vaguely mention the existence of rumors surrounding the family, and Dick tries to tie Bruce's absence from the public eye with being occupied with clearing his family's reputation.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' (vol. 1) #4 (November 2009)</ref> Matters come to a head when Hurt returns to the city, claiming to be Thomas Wayne in order to take control of Wayne Manor and establish himself as the new Batman, but Grayson and Damian outsmart him.\n\nIt is hinted at during the course of the ''Batman and Robin'' series that Simon Hurt's actual identity is Thomas Wayne, albeit one from the 17th century who was a 'black sheep' of the Wayne family and prolongs his life through occult rituals. The ''[[Return of Bruce Wayne]]'' miniseries and its fallout ''[[Bruce Wayne: The Road Home]]'' cements Hurt's status as the elder Thomas Wayne from the Puritan Ages, driven insane by his meeting with ''Barbatos'', the Hyper-Adapter sent through time along with Bruce Wayne to ensure the effectiveness of Darkseid's \"Omega Sanction\".\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===Flashpoint===\n{{Main|Batman (Thomas Wayne)}}\n\n===''Batman: Castle of the Bat''===\nIn ''[[Batman: Castle of the Bat]]'', Doctor Bruce Wayne discovers the preserved brain of his father deep below the research university where he works. He steals this and other body parts in a desperate attempt to revive his beloved father from death. This doesn't work out well due to various factors outside his control, but the part of the creature that still recognizes and loves his son does its best to help Bruce escape his enemies and expose the person responsible for the Waynes' murders; Thomas had discovered that one of his colleagues was killing people to perfect the preservation fluid used to store organs (Including Thomas's own brain, claimed by his killer after his death).<ref>''Castle of the Bat'' (November 1994)</ref>\n\n===''Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty''===\nIn ''[[Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty]]'', Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne are saved from death when [[Vandal Savage|Valentin Sinclair]]- really [[Vandal Savage]], a man who has a long-standing interest and admiration for the Wayne family despite the fact that they often end up opposing him when they learn about his plans- scares off Joe Chill. Sinclair then becomes a partner in Wayne Enterprises, only to have the Waynes killed when they threaten to expose his plan to divert the meteor that gave him his powers back to Earth in order to study it. Their deaths come at the hands of Sinclair's fear-inducing henchman Scarecrone who causes them to remember the mugging, which drives them to flee Chill by running off their balcony. This prompts Bruce to become Batman to investigate.\n\n===''Batman: Holy Terror''===\nIn ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'', depicting an alternate timeline where [[Oliver Cromwell]] established a [[theocratic]] government across the globe, Thomas Wayne is the chief physician of the [[Privy Council]], but when it is discovered that he is treating various 'enemies of the state' such as Jews or homosexuals, the Star Chamber votes by secret ballot to have him and Martha executed and make it look like a random mugging.\n\n===''Batman: Earth One''===\n[[File:Thomas Wayne (Earth One version - circa 2012).png|thumb|upright|Thomas Wayne in ''Batman: Earth One''. Art by Gary Frank and Jon Sibal.]]\nIn the graphic novel written by [[Geoff Johns]] and with art by [[Gary Frank]], ''[[Batman: Earth One]]'', Thomas Wayne was a physician who had run for mayor against [[Penguin (character)|Oswald Cobblepot]]. Cobblepot had attempted to arrange his opponent's murder during the latter's outing to a movie with his family, but a mugger got to them first and killed Thomas and his wife. It is also implied that both he and Alfred are keeping a traumatic secret.\n\n===''JLA: Earth 2''===\nIn ''[[JLA: Earth 2]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Frank Quitely]], the Thomas Wayne of the [[antimatter]] universe is the father of the supervillain [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]. Like his original counterpart, he married Martha Kane and fathered Bruce Wayne. However, this version also had a second child named Thomas Wayne Jr. After Martha and Bruce are gunned down by a crooked police officer when Thomas Sr. refused to accompany him for questioning as Thomas Wayne had performed an \"illegal medical operation,\" Thomas Jr. becomes Owlman to get revenge on the justice system. It is later revealed that Thomas Wayne Sr. is currently acting as commissioner of the [[Gotham City Police Department]], seeking to bring his son to justice with the help of a cadre of idealistic officers. Owlman finds it his goal to \"punish\" his father for letting his mother and brother die.<ref>''JLA: Earth 2'' (2000)</ref>\n\n===''Superman: Red Son''===\nIn [[Mark Millar]]'s ''[[Superman: Red Son]]'', Batman's (unnamed) parents are [[anti-communist]] protesters in the [[Soviet Union]].

He states that he is 65 years old. In contrast to his depiction on the Prime Earth, he and Martha Wayne are targeted for assassination due to Thomas's [[Organized crime|Mafia]] connections and subsequent efforts to \"straighten out\" when Bruce was born. Thomas hides the fact that he survived for many years in order to keep Bruce safe. Eventually, when the first version of Batman tracks Thomas down, he learns the truth and rejects Thomas's reason for being \"dead\" for most of Bruce's life, thus discouraging him from ever having any future relationship with his son, and by extension Bruce and the former [[Catwoman]] Selina Kyle Wayne's family. However, he watched them from afar and tried to be as involved as he could, particularly with their daughter Helena. After Bruce's death saving Earth 2 from an Apokoliptan invasion, Thomas honors him by taking up the \"mantle of the Bat\" and makes use of Miraclo to help him fight crime.<ref>\"Earth 2: Annual #2 (2014)</ref>\n\nAfter Earth-2's destruction in the war with Apokolips as seen in the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' storyline, Thomas Wayne is one of the few survivors transferred to Telos's world, along with Dick Grayson and other heroes.<ref>''Convergence'' #1</ref> While investigating this world, Thomas travels with Dick into a variation of the pre-''Flashpoint'' Gotham City where he has an unknown conversation with Bruce before he departs with Dick in a flying Batmobile.<ref>''Convergence'' vol.1 #2</ref> When they are cornered by the Club of Villains, who pursued them out of the city, Thomas sacrifices himself in a suicide bomb blast, destroying most of the Club of Villains in the process, his last words being to inform the Club of Villains that they will never hurt another Batman.<ref>''Convergence'' vol.1 #3</ref>\n\n====Earth 3====\nIn the revised Earth-Three alternate universe of \"The New 52\", Thomas Wayne Sr. is featured in Owlman's origin story. In stark contrast to Batman's father who was a highly skilled surgeon and philanthropist who had saved countless lives during his time, Earth-Three Thomas Wayne is a cowardly and sociopathic doctor who often kills his patients (Martha claims that this is due to a \"surgical fetish\") and spends his money on lawyers to cover up his patients' deaths as accidents. [[Outsider (comics)|Earth 3's Alfred]] kills him along with Martha and Bruce Wayne as per Thomas Wayne Jr.'s orders. Owlman later states that his father was a weak man and wonders why Batman would devote his life to the memory of Thomas Wayne of Prime Earth.\n\n===''DC Comics Bombshells''===\nIn the opening of the first issue of the comics ''[[DC Comics Bombshells]]'', set in an alternate history 1940, Thomas and Martha Wayne's lives are saved by an already-existing [[Batwoman]], implying that Bruce Wayne will never grow up to become Batman. However, in the final issue, set in 1960, the now grown up Bruce Wayne takes up training and becomes Batman, to honor the person who saved him and his parents' lives.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n====Live-action====\n* While Thomas never appears in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], Bruce Wayne has brought up that the murder of his parents is what motivates him to take down criminals.

This murder was also witnessed by [[Selina Kyle]]. In the episode \"The Anvil or the Hammer\", it is revealed by Sid Bunderslaw that Thomas had kept quiet about the illegal activities at Wayne Enterprises. In the episode \"Wrath of the Villains: This Ball of Mud and Meanness\", it was revealed that [[Matches Malone|Patrick \"Matches\" Malone]] was the one who killed Thomas and Martha Wayne. In the episode \"Wrath of the Villains: Pinewood\", Thomas is revealed to be a dear friend of [[Hugo Strange]] who attempted to reason with him prior to his death to not oppose [[Court of Owls|the group]] behind Wayne Enterprises. This led to Hugo Strange being given orders to orchestrate Thomas Wayne's death. The episode \"Ace Chemicals\" revealed that [[Jeremiah Valeska]] had abducted a husband and wife who had the same bone structure and build as Thomas and Martha Wayne where he had [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]] hypnotize them and a doctor that works for him do plastic surgery on them. This is part of Jeremiah's plot to re-enact the night when Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered. When it came to the murder in the alley, Jeremiah had already killed the doubles after they served their purpose and replaced them with a brainwash James Gordon and Leslie Thompkins with the hypnosis ending when the pearls hit the ground upon their death. This murder attempt was thwarted by Selina Kyle.\n* Thomas Wayne appears in the prequel series ''[[Pennyworth (TV series)|Pennyworth]]'' as part of the main cast portrayed by [[Ben Aldridge (actor)|Ben Aldridge]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/10/pennyworth-ben-aldridge-cast-thomas-wayne-batman-prequel-on-epix-1202482014/|title=\u2018Pennyworth\u2019: Ben Aldridge To Play Thomas Wayne In Batman Prequel On Epix|magazine=Deadline Hollywood|date=October 15, 2018|accessdate=October 15, 2018|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva}}</ref> In this version, he's a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent operating out of Gotham in [[England]] to monitor Alfred and go undercover in the No Name League.\n* A photo of Thomas appears in [[Wayne Manor]] in ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]''.\n\n====Animation====\n* Thomas Wayne appears with his wife in ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', voiced by [[Paul Kirby (voice actor)|Paul Kirby]]. In a flashback in the episode \"The Fear\", they are confronted by an [[Joe Chill|unidentified mugger]], just after watching a [[Robin Hood]] film with their son Bruce Wayne. When Thomas tries to fight the mugger, Bruce says \"No Dad, he's got a...\" and lightning flashes as his parents are shot. This was the first time Batman's origin was shown outside of the comics.\n* Dr. Thomas Wayne is alluded on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. Dr. Wayne was a good friend of [[Marion Grange]] (mayor of Gotham City for the first four seasons), [[Lucius Fox]] (CEO of [[Wayne Enterprises]]) and [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. After taking their son to watch the film ''The Cloaked Rider'', Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered by an unidentified mugger. In several episodes in the first season, Bruce Wayne goes over his parents' murder several times. In the fourth season's premiere, Batman tells [[Dick Grayson]], whose parents have just been murdered by [[Tony Zucco]], that the \"[[Joe Chill|man who murdered my parents]] was never brought to justice\". Also in the future, it was misinterpreted that Thomas was Batman while Martha was [[Batwoman]] and their son was Red Robin.\n* Thomas Wayne is featured in several times in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Corey Burton]] (in \"Invasion of the Secret Santas!\") as well as [[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]] (in \"Dawn of the Deadman!\") and [[Adam West]] (in \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\"). He appears in a flashback of the episode \"Invasion of the Secret Santas!\" and also appears as a ghost in the episode \"Dawn of the Deadman!\". The character has a more central role in the episode \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\", where the [[Phantom Stranger]] takes Batman back in time to a costume party Thomas attended. Batman notes that Thomas's costume is very similar to [[Batsuit|his own design]]. Batman teams up with his father to fight a gang of robbers led by [[Lew Moxon]] and learns new information about Thomas's and Martha's murder.\n* Thomas Wayne appears in several flashback sequences in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[Anthony Ruivivar]]. He appears in the episodes \"Secrets\", \"Fall\", \"Monsters\", and \"Unique\".\n\n=====DC Animated Universe=====\n* Thomas Wayne has sporadic appearances in the [[DC Animated Universe]], primarily voiced by [[Kevin Conroy]].\n** Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', initially voiced by [[Richard Moll]] (in \"Nothing to Fear\", \"Dreams in Darkness\" and \"Two-Face\"). In this version, Thomas and his wife [[Martha Wayne]] are murdered in Crime Alley by an unidentified man. The murder is only occasionally alluded to via nightmares. In the episode \"Nothing to Fear\", Batman is under the influence of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s fear toxin and has a hallucination of his father being ashamed of him. In the episode \"Dreams in Darkness\", Batman is once again drugged with fear toxin and sees his parents walking towards a tunnel, and runs towards them telling them to stop. They enter the tunnel, which is revealed to be the barrel of a giant gun, dripping blood. Batman screams as the world is bleached white and a loud shot is heard. In the episode \"Two-Face\", Batman has a nightmare about failing to save the [[Two-Face|titular villain]], and Thomas appears alongside Martha and asks, \"Why couldn't you save ''us'', son?\". The series also makes use of the rose motif that the films ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Batman Forever]]'' associate with the murder. Bruce Wayne leaves roses at the site of his parents' murder on the event's anniversary (as he does in the comics except that he leaves the roses on their graves). As in the comics, his friend Dr. [[Leslie Thompkins]] serves as one of his son's legal guardians. Thomas was also close friends with [[Crime Doctor (DC Comics)|Dr. Matthew Thorne]] and Dr. Long (faculty of Gotham University).\n** Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. In the episode \"For the Man Who Has Everything\", Batman is temporarily trapped by the hallucinogenic plant Black Mercy where his perfect dream world shows his father fighting and disarming [[Joe Chill]]. Batman knows that this is not real and so the Black Mercy plant is removed, ending the hallucination with the sound of a gunshot.\n\n===Film===\n\n====Live-action====\n\n=====''Batman'' (1989 film series)=====\n{{main|Batman in film#Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher}}\n* Thomas Wayne appeared in [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', portrayed by David Baxt. In a flashback, the Waynes are ambushed in an alley by [[Joker (character)|Jack Napier]]'s gang. As Thomas tries to fight off the gang members, Napier shoots him and Martha.\n* ''[[Batman Forever]]'' features a new flashback to the murder of the Waynes, with Michael Scranton as Thomas Wayne.\n\n=====''The Dark Knight'' Trilogy=====\n{{main|Batman in film#Christopher Nolan \u2013 The Dark Knight Trilogy}}\n* [[Linus Roache]] played Thomas Wayne in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005). In this incarnation, he is a surgeon at the [[Gotham City]] hospital, the fifth generation of the Wayne family to live in [[Wayne Manor]], and was the chairman of [[Wayne Enterprises]]. When the young Bruce Wayne falls into a cave, Thomas personally rescues his son by rappelling down into the cave. Thomas says to his son, \"Bruce, why do we fall?...So that we can learn to pick ourselves up again.\" According to [[Alfred Pennyworth]], he and Martha Wayne believed the example they set would help inspire Gotham's wealthy elite to participate in helping the city. One of his endeavors included building an efficient public transit system in the form of raised trains, in order to provide free transportation to the people of Gotham. In this version, he and Martha are murdered at gunpoint by [[Joe Chill]]. They leave the performance of the ''[[Mefistofele]]'' opera early when Bruce is scared by performers dressed as bats. Dr. Wayne tries to protect his wife after Chill tries to rip off Martha's necklace. Chill then shoots and kills both of them and runs off. Wayne's last words to his son are \"Bruce...don't be afraid.\" It is revealed in the film that the deaths of two such prominent citizens encourages Gotham City's elite to bring it back from the brink of ruin (temporarily foiling [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s plan to destroy Gotham's economy).\n* In ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' (2012), Bruce Wayne is helped by his father's memory with the strength to climb out and escape of \"The Pit\" prison in the Middle East that superficially resembles the well that Thomas rescued his son from as a child.\n\n=====DC Extended Universe=====\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\n[[File:Jeffrey Dean Morgan by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] portrays Thomas Wayne in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016)]]\n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] portrayed Thomas Wayne in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''. In this version, the Waynes leave the theater after seeing the 1940 Tyrone Power version of ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]''. A mugger holds them at gunpoint under a train bridge. Thomas steps in front of the mugger in an attempt to save his family, but the mugger shoots him. His wife [[Martha Wayne]] is also killed as the mugger tries to take her pearl necklace. But the necklace breaks into pieces as she falls and the mugger then runs away, probably due to fear of police. Before dying, Thomas sees his dead wife and calls out \"Martha\" as his last word.\n* A portrait of Thomas Wayne in the likeness of Jeffrey Dean Morgan appears in Wayne Manor in both ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'' and ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''.\n\n=====''Joker''=====\nOn August 27, 2018, it was announced that actor [[Alec Baldwin]] would be portraying Thomas Wayne in the film ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/joker-movie-todd-phillips-alec-baldwin-thomas-wayne-batman-father-1202452962/|title=Alec Baldwin Joins Todd Phillips' 'Joker'|magazine=Deadline|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=August 27, 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that the portrayal would be a departure from the traditional comic book version with the character re-interpreted as \"a cheesy and tanned businessman who is more in the mold of a 1980s [[Donald Trump]].\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/alec-baldwin-joins-joker-movie-as-bruce-waynes-father-113784|title='Joker' Movie: Alec Baldwin to Play Bruce Wayne's Father|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=August 27, 2018}}</ref> Two days later, Baldwin told ''[[USA Today]]'' that he had withdrawn from the role because of \"scheduling issues\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Alexander|first=Bryan|title=Alec Baldwin pulls out of Thomas Wayne role in 'Joker': 'I'm no longer doing that movie'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/08/29/alec-baldwin-drops-thomas-wayne-role-joker-movie-exclusive/1136678002/|newspaper=USA Today|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}</ref> On September 17, 2018, [[Brett Cullen]] was cast in the role, replacing Baldwin.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chitwood |first1=Adam |title=Brett Cullen Replaces Alec Baldwin as Thomas Wayne in 'Joker' |url=http://collider.com/joker-movie-thomas-wayne-actor-brett-cullen/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |accessdate=September 17, 2018 |date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThomas Wayne in this film is portrayed much less sympathetically than in other incarnations. He is a successful businessman who is running to become Mayor of Gotham City, however he has little sympathy for the lower classes, believing that they have no-one else but themselves to blame for their misfortune. During the course of the movie Arthur Fleck ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]) discovers from a letter his mother Penny is writing (one of many) that he may be the son of Wayne, borne out of an affair while Penny worked for the Wayne family. When Arthur sneaks backstage at an event and confronts Wayne, who refutes the accusation claiming that there was no affair and Penny adopted Arthur before being institutionalized (Penny says that Thomas created the adoption paperwork in order to hide the affair). Thomas then punches Arthur for earlier speaking to his son and threatens to kill Arthur if he ever comes near Bruce and hurts him. At the end of the film, Thomas, Martha and Bruce attempt to flee a riot that has engulfed the city by ducking down an alley, only for one of the rioters to follow them down and kill Thomas and Martha in front of Bruce, being influenced by the riots and killing them under Arthur's ideas (unlike other incarnations where the shooting is a robbery gone wrong).\n\n====Animation====\n* Thomas Wayne is referenced several times in ''[[The Batman vs. Dracula]]''.\n* Dr. Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: Gotham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Jason Marsden]].\n* Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (film)|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', voiced by [[Bruce Timm]].\n* The [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]] iteration of Batman appears in ''[[Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox]]'', voiced by [[Kevin McKidd]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/film/DC-animated-flashpoint-paradox-news.html |title=FLASHPOINT PARADOX Gets Release Date, Cast, Logline |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Rich Sands |url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Greys-Anatomy-Kevin-McKidd-Justin-Chambers-Justice-League-Flashpoint-Paradox-1064095.aspx |title=First Look: Grey's Anatomy Stars Get Animated for Justice League |publisher=Tvguide.com |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref> Just like in the original Flashpoint universe, Thomas Wayne turns into a crime-fighting vigilante after his son's death while [[Martha Wayne]] goes insane as the Joker. Batman doesn't care about crime outside Gotham City and has his successful casinos fund his seemingly fruitless fight on crime. Despite his cynical outlook, Batman reluctantly assist Barry Allen with a device to recreate the accident behind Barry's powers as the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]]. After the first attempt fails and the second attempt restores Barry's powers, Batman and Flash contact [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] for help in tracking down the government branch that hid the frail [[Superman|Kal-El]]. When Kal-El's freedom failed along with Flash's painful altered memories, the alternate Dark Knight tries to prevent the speedster's mental deterioration with his son's memory. As the World War between [[Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]] reaches its breaking point, Cyborg's [[Suicide Squad (comics)|crude team]] heads to the final battle in Batman's plane. During the chaos, Batman and [[Grifter (comics)|Grifter]] kill off [[Black Manta]] to which Batman dryly refers to Grifter as the \"[[Robin (comics)|boy idiot]]\" before the alternate Dark Knight gets injured by the [[Ocean Master]]. In the middle of [[Eobard Thawne|Professor Zoom]]'s monologue to Flash, Batman shoots the evil speedster in the head. Before Flash leaves to escape the alternate world, Thomas gives Flash a letter for his son. In the [[The New 52|New 52]] universe, Flash gives Thomas's letter to [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne).\n* Thomas Wayne briefly appears during a flashback in ''[[Son of Batman]]''.\n* Thomas Wayne appears in ''[[Batman vs. Robin]]'', voiced again by Kevin Conroy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/animated-batman-robin-movie-finds-763553 |title=Animated 'Batman vs. Robin' Movie Finds Its Voice Cast (Exclusive) |date=January 14, 2015 |last=Kit |first=Borys |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n* In ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'', a picture of Thomas, Martha and a young Bruce is seen in Wayne Manor as Bruce looks at it telling his dead parents that he saved Gotham City again.\n* Thomas Wayne appears in ''DC Super Heroes vs. Eagle Talon'', voiced by Frogman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://DC-taka.com/character/\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30b9\u306e|title=\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u540d|website=DC-taka.com|language=Japanese|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n* The Flashpoint iteration of Batman makes non-voiced appearances in ''[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]'', recalling the moment he shot Eobard Thawne's head in ''The Flashpoint Paradox'', a feat acknowledged with respect by [[Deadshot]].\n\n===Video games===\n* Thomas Wayne makes a cameo in ''[[Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu]]''.\n* The Flashpoint Batman's outfit is one of the playable costumes for Batman (Bruce Wayne) in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mallory|first=Jordan|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/27/lobo-trounces-flashpoint-batman-in-first-injustice-gods-among-u/|title=Lobo trounces Flashpoint Batman in first Injustice: Gods Among Us DLC footage [Update: Lobo on May 7|publisher=Joystiq|date=2013-04-27|accessdate=2014-05-13}}</ref>\n* Thomas Wayne appears in flashbacks in ''[[Batman: The Telltale Series]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. In this continuity, it is revealed that he had criminal ties to [[Carmine Falcone]] and [[Hamilton Hill (comics)|Mayor Hamilton Hill]]. Additionally, Thomas was responsible for forcibly putting a number of people to Arkham Asylum, including Oswald Cobblepot's mother. Once Martha discovered the full extent of his crimes, she began planning to expose him, only for Hill to discover her plan and send Joe Chill to kill both Thomas and Martha in Crime Alley. Bruce and most of Gotham remained unaware of his crimes until twenty years after his death when a group called the Children of Arkham (a group largely consisting of Thomas' victims and their loved ones) publicly release evidence of his crimes. Due to Thomas being long dead by the time his crimes became public, Bruce (despite having no involvement in his father's crimes) becomes the target of much of the anger from both the Children of Arkham and the people of Gotham, with many of them convincing themselves that Bruce is no better than his father.\n* Thomas Wayne is mentioned in ''[[Batman: The Enemy Within]]'', a sequel to ''Batman: The Telltale Series''. He is mentioned by Bruce Wayne when reviewing his father's actions and brings him up when he talks with Harley Quinn. He is a major factor in why Alfred decides to leave Bruce in the 5th episode, fearing that Bruce's need for control will end in his death as it did with Thomas.\n\n====''Batman Arkham''====\nThomas Wayne is featured in the ''[[Batman Arkham]]'' series where Kevin Conroy reprises the role.\n\n* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', Batman, while under the influence of the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]'s fear toxin, experiences flashbacks of his parents' murder, and has nightmares of his parents in body bags in the medical facility\u2019s morgue. Additionally, a bench in [[Arkham Asylum]] dedicated to Thomas and Martha Wayne is the answer to one of the [[Riddler (comics)|Riddler]]'s riddles, which leads to Thomas and Martha's unlockable biography.\n* Thomas Wayne is alluded in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]''. The Monarch Theatre (the site of the Wayne murders) is featured in Arkham City. Near the gates of Ra's al Ghul's hideout, Batman collapses from the effects of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s blood poison and sees a vision of his parents in front of a light, imploring their son to come into it and reunite with them. However, Batman shrugs it off and continues on. If the player visits the site of the murder, Batman discovers a pair of chalk outlines resembling his parents' bodies, as well as a bouquet of flowers and a tape recording from [[Hugo Strange]], taunting the Dark Knight. The player then has the option to \"pay respect\" to the site, causing Batman to kneel at the site for a time. The Waynes' murders is also briefly mentioned in one of the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s interview tapes during which Penguin tells Strange of being overjoyed after hearing the Waynes had been murdered, revealing hatred of the Wayne family due mainly to the Cobblepot family's long standing feud with them.\n* The character is alluded in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]''. Following his capture of the Joker at the Royal Hotel and return to the Batcave, Batman has a vision of his parents' murder in [[Crime Alley]]. The site of the Waynes' murder can be found in Park Row's Crime Alley behind the Monarch Theatre (in the same location as it appeared in Arkham City). The pair of chalk outlines of Thomas and Martha are present along with a single rose.
