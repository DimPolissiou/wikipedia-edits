She is a daughter of the god [[Helios]] and either the [[Oceanid]] nymph [[Perse (mythology)|Perse]] or the goddess [[Hecate]]. Circe was renowned for her vast knowledge of potions and herbs; one of her Homeric epithets is ''polypharmakos'' (\"knowing many drugs or charms\").<ref>[[LSJ]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolufa%2Frmakos s.v. \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5-\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1^\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2]; [[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-grc1:10.261-10.301 10.276].</ref> Through the use of these and a magic [[wand]] or staff, she would [[Shapeshifting|transform]] her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals.\n\nThe best known of her legends is told in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' when [[Odysseus]] visits her island of [[Aeaea]] on the way back from the [[Trojan War]] and she changes most of his crew into [[swine]]. He forces her to return them to human shape, lives with her for a year and has sons by her, including [[Latinus]] and [[Telegonus (son of Odysseus)|Telegonus]]. Her ability to change others into animals is further highlighted by the story of [[Picus]], an Italian king whom she turns into a woodpecker for resisting her advances. Another story makes her fall in love with the sea-god [[Glaucus]], who prefers the nymph [[Scylla]] to her. In revenge, Circe poisoned the water where her rival bathed and turned her into a dreadful  monster.\n\nDepictions, even in [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] times, wandered away from the detail in Homer's narrative, which was later to be reinterpreted morally as a cautionary story against drunkenness. Early philosophical questions were also raised whether the change from a reasoning being to a beast was not preferable after all, and this paradox was to have a powerful impact during the [[Renaissance]]. Circe was also taken as the archetype of the predatory female. In the eyes of those from a later age, this behaviour made her notorious both as a magician and as a type of the sexually free woman. As such she has been frequently depicted in all the arts from the Renaissance down to modern times.\n\nWestern paintings established a visual iconography for the figure, but also went for inspiration to other stories concerning Circe that appear in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The episodes of Scylla and Picus added the vice of violent jealousy to her bad qualities and made her a figure of fear as well as of desire.\n\n== Classical literature ==\nBy most accounts, she was the daughter of [[Helios]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[solar deity|sun god]], and [[Perse (mythology)|Perse]], one of the three thousand [[Oceanid]] [[nymph]]s.

Around her home prowl strangely docile lions and wolves. She lures any who land on the island to her home with her lovely singing while weaving on an enormous loom, but later drugs them so that they change shape.<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.212&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.212ff].</ref> She invites the hero Odysseus' crew to a feast of familiar food, a pottage of cheese and meal, sweetened with honey and laced with wine, but also mixed with one of her magical potions that turns them into swine.

Hermes provides Odysseus with the herb [[moly (herb)|moly]] to protect him from Circe's magic. He also tells Odysseus that he must then draw his sword and act as if he were going to attack her. From there, as Hermes foretold, Circe would ask Odysseus to bed, but Hermes advises caution, for the treacherous goddess could still \"unman\" him unless he has her swear by the names of the gods that she will not take any further action against him. Following this advice, Odysseus is able to free his men. After they have all remained on the island for a year, Circe advises Odysseus that he must first visit the [[Underworld]], something a mortal has never yet done,<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D475 10.475\u2014541].</ref> in order to gain knowledge about how to appease the gods, return home safely and recover his kingdom. Circe also advises him on how this might be achieved and furnishes him with the protections he will need and the means to communicate with the dead. On his return, she further advises him about two possible routes home, warning him, however, that both carry great danger.\n\n===Other texts===\n[[File:Kauffmann_Circe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angelica Kauffman]]'s painting of Circe enticing [[Odysseus]] (1786)|alt=|left]]\n\nTowards the end of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (c. 700 BCE), it is stated that Circe bore Odysseus three sons: [[Ardeas]] or Agrius (otherwise unknown); [[Latinus]]; and [[Telegonus (son of Odysseus)|Telegonus]], who ruled over the Tyrsenoi, that is the [[Etruscans]]. The ''[[Telegony]]'', an epic now lost, relates the later history of the last of these. Circe eventually informed him who his absent father was and, when he set out to find Odysseus, gave him a poisoned spear. With this he killed his father unknowingly. Telegonus then brought back his father's corpse to Aeaea, together with [[Penelope]] and Odysseus' other son [[Telemachus]]. After burying Odysseus, Circe made the others immortal.\n\nIn the 5th-century CE epic ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', author [[Nonnus]] mentions Phaunos, Circe's son by the sea god [[Poseidon]].<ref>Timothy Peter Wiseman, ''Remus: A Roman Myth'', Cambridge University 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LPNHRUlWacC&lpg=PA48&ots=-_sY_Y5iRY&dq=Phaunos%20Circe&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=Phaunos%20Circe&f=false pp. 47\u201348].</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Lycophron]]'s 3rd-century BCE poem ''Alexandra'', and [[John Tzetzes]]' [[scholia]] on it, Circe used magical herbs to bring Odysseus back to life after he had been killed by Telegonus. Odysseus then gave Telemachus to Circe's daughter Cassiphone in marriage. Some time later, Telemachus had a quarrel with his mother-in-law and killed her; Cassiphone then killed Telemachus to avenge her mother's death. On hearing of this, Odysseus died of grief.\n\nIn his 3rd-century BCE epic, the ''[[Argonautica]]'', [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]] relates that Circe purified the [[Argonauts]] for the death of [[Absyrtus]],<ref>\"They escaped neither the vast sea's hardships nor vexatious tempests till Kirk\u00e9<!--Kirk\u00e9 in original--> should wash them clean of the pitiless murder of Apsyrtos\" ([[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica'', iv. 586\u201388, in Peter Grean's translation).</ref> possibly reflecting an early tradition.<ref>See the ancient concept of ''[[Miasma (Greek mythology)|miasma]]'', a Peter Green's commentary on iv. 705\u201317, ''The Argonautika Apollonios Rhodios'', (1997, 2007) p. 322.</ref> In this poem, the animals that surround her are not former lovers transformed but primeval 'beasts, not resembling the beasts of the wild, nor yet like men in body, but with a medley of limbs'.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm#2H_4_0006|title=iv: 659\u201384|date=1997|publisher=Gutenberg.org|accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1.72.5) cites [[Xenagoras (historian)|Xenagoras]], the 2nd-century BCE historian, as claiming that Odysseus and Circe had three sons: Rhomus, [[Anteias]], and [[Ardeias]], who respectively founded three cities called by their names: [[Rome]], [[Antium]], and [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]].\n\nThree ancient plays about Circe have been lost: the work of the tragedian [[Aeschylus]] and of the 4th-century BCE comic dramatists [[Ephippus of Athens]] and Anaxilas. The first told the story of Odysseus' encounter with Circe. Vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual [[Satyr]]s.

Later traditions tell of her leaving or even destroying the island and moving to Italy, where she was identified with [[Cape Circeo]].\n\nThe theme of turning men into a variety of animals was elaborated by later writers, especially in [[Latin]]. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', Aeneas skirts the Italian island where Circe now dwells, and hears the cries of her many male victims, who now number more than the pigs of earlier accounts:{{poemquote|The roars of lions that refuse the chain, / The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, / And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.7.vii.html|title=Dryden's translation|date=|publisher=Classics.mit.edu|accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>|char=|sign=|title=|source=}}\n\n[[File:J.

The fourth episode covers Circe's encounter with Ulysses (Roman names of Odysseus). The first episode in that book deals with the story of [[Glaucus]] and Scylla, in which the enamoured sea-god seeks a love potion to win Scylla's love, only to have the sorceress fall in love with him. When she is unsuccessful, she takes revenge on her rival by turning Scylla into a monster (lines 1\u201374). The story of the [[Latium|Latian]] king [[Picus]] is told in the fifth episode (and also alluded to in the ''Aeneid''). Circe fell in love with him too; when he preferred to remain faithful to his wife Canens, she turned him into a woodpecker (lines 308\u2013440).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses14.html |title=Online translation |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Plutarch]] took up the theme in a lively dialogue that was later to have several imitators. Contained in his 1st-century ''[[Moralia]]'' is the Gryllus episode in which Circe allows Odysseus to interview a fellow Greek turned into a pig. There his interlocutor informs Odysseus that his present existence is preferable to the human.

Ulysses is depicted as deeper in sorcery and readier of tongue than Circe and through this means he leaves her pregnant with Telegonus. Most of the account deals with the son's later quest for and accidental killing of his father, drawing the moral that only evil can come of the use of sorcery.<ref>John Gower, English Works, [https://archive.org/stream/completeworksofj03goweuoft#page/204/mode/2up 6.1391\u20131788]; there is also a [http://www.ellinanderson.com/Circe%20and%20Ulysses.html modern translation] by Ellin Anderson.</ref>\n\nThe story of Ulysses and Circe was retold as an episode in Georg Rollenhagen's German verse epic, ''Froschmeuseler'' (''The Frogs and Mice'', Magdeburg, 1595).

There was much speculation concerning how this could be, whether the human consciousness changed at the same time, and even whether it was a change for the better. The Gryllus dialogue was taken up by another Italian writer, [[Giovan Battista Gelli]], in his ''La Circe'' (1549). This is a series of ten philosophical and moral dialogues between Ulysses and the humans transformed into various animals, ranging from an oyster to an elephant, in which Circe sometimes joins. Most argue against changing back; only the last animal, a philosopher in its former existence, wants to.<ref>The English translation of 1754 is available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=zrgFAAAAQAAJe Google Books].</ref> English poet [[Edmund Spenser]] also makes reference to Plutarch's dialogue in the section of his ''[[Faerie Queene]]'' (1590) based on the Circe episode which appears at the end of Book II. Sir Guyon changes back the victims of Acrasia's erotic frenzy in the Bower of Bliss, most of whom are abashed at their fall from chivalric grace, ''But one above the rest in speciall, / That had an hog beene late, hight Grille by name, / Repined greatly, and did him miscall, / That had from hoggish forme him brought to naturall.''<ref>Book 2.12, stanza 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dosso Dossi 003.jpg|thumb|[[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Circe and Her Lovers'' (c. 1525)|alt=]]\n\nTwo other Italians wrote rather different works that centre on the animal within the human. One was [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] in his unfinished long poem, ''L'asino d'oro'' (''The Golden Ass'', 1516). The author meets a beautiful herdswoman surrounded by Circe's herd of beasts. After spending a night of love with him, she explains the characteristics of the animals in her charge: the lions are the brave, the bears are the violent, the wolves are those forever dissatisfied, and so on (Canto 6). In Canto 7 he is introduced to those who experience frustration: a cat that has allowed its prey to escape; an agitated dragon; a fox constantly on the look-out for traps; a dog that bays the moon; Aesop's [[The Lion in Love (fable)|lion in love]] that allowed himself to be deprived of his teeth and claws. There are also emblematic satirical portraits of various Florentine personalities. In the eighth and last canto he has a conversation with a pig that, like the Gryllus of Plutarch, does not want to be changed back and condemns human greed, cruelty and conceit.<ref>There is a French translation in ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes'' X, Paris 1825, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KkgTAAAAQAAJ&hl=fr&pg=PA403 pp. 401\u201353].</ref>\n\nThe other Italian author was the esoteric philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who wrote in Latin. His ''Cantus Circaeus'' (''The Incantation of Circe'') was the fourth work on memory and the association of ideas by him to be published in 1582. It contains a series of poetic dialogues, in the first of which, after a long series of incantations to the seven planets of the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic tradition]], most humans appear changed into different creatures in the scrying bowl. The sorceress Circe is then asked by her handmaiden Moeris about the type of behaviour with which each is associated. According to Circe, for instance, ''fireflies are the learned, wise, and illustrious amidst idiots, asses, and obscure men'' (Question 32). In later sections different characters discuss the use of images in the imagination in order to facilitate use of the [[art of memory]], which is the real aim of the work.<ref>The original and its English translation is available [http://www.tomaszahora.org/CantusCircaeusTranslation.htm online].</ref>\n\nFrench writers were to take their lead from Gelli in the following century.<ref>Much of the information that follows can be found discussed in Brigitte Urbani, ''Vaut-il \"mieux mille fois \u00eatre \u00e2nes qu'\u00eatre hommes\"?

On the isle of Circe, Ulysses encounters an ass that was once a doctor, a lion that had been a valet, a female doe and a horse, all of whom denounce the decadence of the times. The ass sees human asses everywhere, ''Asses in the town square, asses in the suburbs, / Asses in the provinces, asses proud at court, / Asses browsing in the meadows, military asses trooping, / Asses tripping it at balls, asses in the theatre stalls.'' To drive the point home, in the end it is only the horse, formerly a courtesan, who wants to return to her former state.\n\n[[File:Schubert Ulysses and Circe.jpg|left|thumb|[[Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg]]'s ''Ulysses at the Palace of Circe'' (1667)]]\n\nThe same theme occupies [[La Fontaine's Fables|La Fontaine's]] late fable, \"The Companions of Ulysses\" (XII.1, 1690), that also echoes Plutarch and Gelli.

It had more or less the same scenario transposed into another medium and set to music by [[Jacques Aubert]]. Circe, wishing to be rid of the company of Ulysses, agrees to change back his companions, but only the dolphin is willing. The others, who were formerly a corrupt judge (now a wolf), a financier (a pig), an abused wife (a hen), a deceived husband (a bull) and a flibbertigibbet (a linnet), find their present existence more agreeable.\n\n[[File:Circe by John Collier.jpg|thumb|''Circe'' by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]] (19th century)|alt=]]\n\nThe Venetian [[Gasparo Gozzi]] was another Italian who returned to Gelli for inspiration in the 14 prose ''Dialoghi dell'isola di Circe'' (''Dialogues from Circe's Island'') published as journalistic pieces between 1760 and 1764. In this moral work, the aim of Ulysses in talking to the beasts is to learn more of the human condition. It includes figures from fable ([[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|The fox and the crow]], XIII) and from myth to illustrate its vision of society at variance. Far from needing the intervention of Circe, the victims find their natural condition as soon as they set foot on the island. The philosopher here is not Gelli's elephant but the bat that retreats from human contact into the darkness, like Bruno's fireflies (VI). The only one who wishes to change in Gozzi's work is the bear, a satirist who had dared to criticize Circe and had been changed as a punishment (IX).\n\nThere were two more satirical dramas in later centuries. One modelled on the Gryllus episode in Plutarch occurs as a chapter of [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s late novel, ''[[Gryll Grange]]'' (1861), under the title \"Aristophanes in London\". Half Greek comedy, half Elizabethan masque, it is acted at the Grange by the novel's characters as a Christmas entertainment.

[[Hercules]] arrives on the island of Circe with his servant Cercopo and has to be rescued by the latter when he too is changed into a pig. But, since the naturally innocent other animals had become corrupted by imitating human vices, the others who had been changed were refused when they begged to be rescued.\n\nAlso in England, Austin Dobson engaged more seriously with Homer's account of the transformation of Odysseus' companions when, though ''Head, face and members bristle into swine, / Still cursed with sense, their mind remains alone''.<ref>Pope's translation of the Odyssey, Book X, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUoIAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PA233&ots=A2clHXZYnt&dq=%22Head%2C%20face%20and%20members%20bristle%20into%20swine%22&pg=PA233#v=onepage&q=%22Head,%20face%20and%20members%20bristle%20into%20swine%22&f=false lines 279\u201380].</ref> Dobson's \"[[s:Littell's Living Age/Volume 127/Issue 1640/The Prayer of the Swine to Circe|The Prayer of the Swine to Circe]]\"<ref>''Vignettes in Rhyme and other verses'', US edition 1880, [https://archive.org/stream/vignettesinrhyme00dobsuoft#page/206/mode/2up/ pp. 206\u201310].</ref> (1640) depicts the horror of being imprisoned in an animal body in this way with the human consciousness unchanged. There appears to be no relief, for only in the final line is it revealed that Odysseus has arrived to free them. But in [[Matthew Arnold]]'s dramatic poem \"The Strayed Reveller\" (1849),<ref>Matthew Arnold, ''The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems'', London 1849, [http://www.telelib.com/authors/A/ArnoldMatthew/verse/strayedreveller/strayedreveller.html pp. 11\u201327].</ref> in which Circe is one of the characters, the power of her potion is differently interpreted. The inner tendencies unlocked by it are not the choice between animal nature and reason but between two types of impersonality, between divine clarity and the poet's participatory and tragic vision of life. In the poem, Circe discovers a youth laid asleep in the portico of her temple by a draught of her ivy-wreathed bowl. On awaking from possession by the poetic frenzy it has induced, he craves for it to be continued.<ref>M. G. Sundell, \"Story and Context in \"The Strayed Reveller\", Victorian Poetry 3.3, West Virginia University 1965, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20171700?seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents pp. 161\u201370].</ref>\n\n===Sexual politics===\nWith the [[Renaissance]] there began to be a reinterpretation of what it was that changed the men, if it was not simply magic. For [[Socrates]], in Classical times, it had been gluttony overcoming their self-control.<ref>Xenophon's ''Memorabilia of Socrates'' [http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Memorabilia.html Book I, 3.7].</ref> But for the influential emblematist [[Andrea Alciato]], it was unchastity. In the second edition of his ''Emblemata'' (1546), therefore, Circe became the type of the [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. His Emblem 76 is titled ''Cavendum a meretricibus''; its accompanying Latin verses mention Picus, Scylla and the companions of Ulysses, and concludes that 'Circe with her famous name indicates a whore and any who loves such a one loses his reason'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/alciato/emblem.php?id=A46a016|title=Alciato at Glasgow: Emblem: Cavendum \u00e0 meretricibus.|website=www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk}}</ref> His English imitator [[Geoffrey Whitney]] used a variation of Alciato's illustration in his own ''Choice of Emblemes'' (1586) but gave it the new title of ''Homines voluptatibus transformantur'', men are transformed by their passions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/alciato/whit/w082.html|title=Whitney 82|website=www.mun.ca}}</ref> This explains her appearance in the Nighttown section named after her in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 15, Circe|Ulysses]]''. Written in the form of a stage script, it makes of Circe the brothel madam, Bella Cohen. Bloom, the book's protagonist, fantasizes that she turns into a cruel man-tamer named Mr Bello who makes him get down on all fours and rides him like a horse.<ref>The text is at [http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/ulysses/15 Online Literature].</ref>\n\nBy the 19th century, Circe was ceasing to be a mythical figure. Poets treated her either as an individual or at least as the type of a certain kind of woman. The French poet [[Joseph Albert Alexandre Glatigny|Albert Glatigny]] addresses \"Circ\u00e9\" in his ''Les vignes folles'' (1857) and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream, the magnet of masochistic fantasies.<ref>French text [http://www.mediterranees.net/mythes/ulysse/epreuves/circe/glatigny.html online].</ref> [[Louis-Nicolas M\u00e9nard]]'s sonnet in ''R\u00eaveries d'un pa\u00efen mystique'' (1876) describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look, but appearance belies the accursed reality.<ref>French text [http://www.mediterranees.net/mythes/ulysse/epreuves/circe/menard.html online].</ref> Poets in English were not far behind in this lurid portrayal. [[John Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley|Lord de Tabley]]'s \"Circe\" (1895) is a thing of decadent perversity likened to a tulip, ''A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine... / With freckled cheeks and splotch'd side serpentine, / A gipsy among flowers''.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/246/757.html ''A Victorian Anthology''] 1837\u201395.</ref>\n\n[[File:'The Kingdom of Sorceress Circe' by Angelo Caroselli and Pseudo Caroselli.jpg|thumb|left|''The Kingdom of Sorceress Circe'' by [[Angelo Caroselli]] (c. 1630)|alt=]]\n\nThat central image is echoed by the blood-striped flower of [[T.S.Eliot]]'s student poem \"Circe's Palace\" (1909) in the [[Harvard Advocate]]. Circe herself does not appear, her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond: panthers, pythons, and peacocks that ''look at us with the eyes of men whom we knew long ago''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.std.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html|title=T.S. Eliot's 'Harvard Advocate' Poems|website=world.std.com}}</ref> Rather than a temptress, she has become an [[Emasculation|emasculatory]] threat.<ref>James E. Miller Jnr, ''T.S. Eliot: The Making Of An American Poet'', Pennsylvania State University 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Aq-lfNXrIDAC&lpg=PA71&ots=XQC16Ht7Cw&dq=%22Circe%22%20%20T.S.Eliot&pg=PA71#v=onepage&q=%22Circe%22%20%20T.S.Eliot&f=false p. 71].</ref>\n\nSeveral female poets make Circe stand up for herself, using the soliloquy form to voice the woman's position. The 19th-century English poet [[Augusta Webster]], much of whose writing explored the female condition, has a dramatic monologue in blank verse titled \"Circe\" in her volume ''Portraits'' (1870).<ref>The whole text can be read on [http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/circe PoemHunter].</ref> There the sorceress anticipates her meeting with Ulysses and his men and insists that she does not turn men into pigs\u2014she merely takes away the disguise that makes them seem human. ''But any draught, pure water, natural wine, / out of my cup, revealed them to themselves / and to each other. Change? there was no change; / only disguise gone from them unawares''. The mythological character of the speaker contributes at a safe remove to the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] discourse on women's sexuality by expressing female desire and criticizing the subordinate role given to women in heterosexual politics.<ref>Christine Sutphin, The representation of women's heterosexual desire in Augusta Webster's \"Circe\" and \"Medea in Athens\", Women's Writing 5.3, 1998, pp. 373\u201393.</ref>\n\nTwo American poets also explored feminine psychology in poems ostensibly about the enchantress. Leigh Gordon Giltner's \"Circe\" was included in her collection ''The Path of Dreams'' (1900), the first stanza of which relates the usual story of men turned to swine by her spell. But then a second stanza presents a sensuous portrait of an unnamed woman, very much in the French vein; once more, it concludes, 'A Circe's spells transform men into swine'.<ref>''The Path of Dreams'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27024/27024-h/27024-h.htm#Page_54 p. 54].</ref> This is no passive victim of male projections but a woman conscious of her sexual power. So too is [[Hilda Doolittle]]'s \"Circe\", from her collection ''Hymen'' (1921). In her soliloquy she reviews the conquests with which she has grown bored, then mourns the one instance when she failed. In not naming Ulysses himself, Doolittle universalises an emotion with which all women might identify.<ref>''Hymen'', [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/doolittle/hymen/1921-circe.html pp. 21\u201322].</ref> At the end of the century, British poet [[Carol Ann Duffy]] wrote a monologue entitled ''Circe'' which pictures the goddess addressing an audience of 'nereids and nymphs'. In this outspoken episode in the war between the sexes, Circe describes the various ways in which all parts of a pig could and should be cooked.<ref>''The World's Wife'', London 1999; the text is on the [http://www.porkopolis.org/library/pig-poetry/carol-ann-duffy Porkopolis website].</ref>\n\nAnother indication of the progression in interpreting the Circe figure is given by two poems a century apart, both of which engage with paintings of her. The first is the sonnet that [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote in response to [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' \"The Wine of Circe\" in his volume ''Poems'' (1870). It gives a faithful depiction of the painting's [[Pre-Raphaelite]] mannerism but its description of Circe's potion as 'distilled of death and shame' also accords with the contemporary (male) identification of Circe with perversity. This is further underlined by his statement (in a letter) that the black panthers there are 'images of ruined passion' and by his anticipation at the end of the poem of ''passion's tide-strown shore / Where the disheveled seaweed hates the sea''.<ref>Painting and poem are juxtaposed on the [http://preraphaelitesisterhood.com/the-wine-of-circe-by-edward-burne-jones-poem-by-dante-gabriel-rossetti Pre-Raphaelite Sisterhood site]; the letter to Barbara Bodichon is quoted on the [http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/24-1869.raw.html Rossetti Archive site].</ref> The Australian [[A. D. Hope]]'s \"Circe \u2013 after the painting by Dosso Dossi\", on the other hand, frankly admits humanity's animal inheritance as natural and something in which even Circe shares. In the poem, he links the fading rationality and speech of her lovers to her own animal cries in the act of love.<ref>''A Late Picking \u2013 poems 1965\u201374'', quoted in the [http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/hope-a-d/circe-0417019 Australian Poetry Library].</ref>\n\n[[File:Charles Hermans - Circe the temptress.jpg|thumb|upright|''Circe the Temptress'' by [[Charles Hermans]] (c. 1859\u20131924)|alt=]]\n\nThere remain some poems that bear her name that have more to do with their writers' private preoccupations than with reinterpreting her myth. The link with it in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s \"Circe/Mud Poems\", first published in ''You Are Happy'' (1974), is more a matter of allusion and is nowhere overtly stated beyond the title. It is a reflection on contemporary gender politics that scarcely needs the disguises of Augusta Webster's.<ref>''Selected Poems'', Boston 1976 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv2dfKp74sAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=circe&f=false pp. 201\u201323].</ref> With two other poems by male writers it is much the same: [[Louis Macneice]]'s, for example, whose \"Circe\" appeared in his first volume, ''Poems'' (London, 1935); or [[Robert Lowell]]'s, whose \"Ulysses and Circe\" appeared in his last, ''Day by Day'' (New York, 1977). Both poets have appropriated the myth to make a personal statement about their broken relationships.<ref>Jane Polden, ''Regeneration: Journey Through the Mid-Life Crisis'', London 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nXSWIIugy_0C&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=Louis+Macneice,+%22Circe%22&source=bl&ots=9GSBY1K7Nh&sig=uPuMKY4G6oYW1LXCopyl63i9nuU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bZdpUPLFJIXF0QX6x4DQAw&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Louis%20Macneice%2C%20%22Circe%22&f=false pp. 124\u201328]; \"Ulysses is of course one more surrogate for the poet\", Bruce Michelson, ''Lowell Versus Lowell'', Virginia Quarterly Review, Winter 1983, [http://www.vqronline.org/essay/lowell-versus-lowell pp. 22\u201339].</ref>\n\n===Parallels and sequels===\nSeveral Renaissance epics of the 16th century include lascivious sorceresses based on the Circe figure. These generally live in an isolated spot devoted to pleasure, to which lovers are lured and later changed into beasts. They include the following:\n* Alcina in the ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (''Mad Roland,'' 1516, 1532) of [[Ludovico Ariosto]], set at the time of [[Charlemagne]]. Among its many sub-plots is the episode in which the [[Saracen]] champion Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress and has to be freed from her magic island.<ref>There is a translation on the [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/615/pg615.html Gutenberg website].</ref>\n* The lovers of Filidia in ''Il Tancredi'' (1632) by Ascanio Grandi (1567\u20131647) have been changed into monsters and are liberated by the virtuous Tancred.<ref>Merritt Y. Hughes, ''Spenser's Acrasia and the Circe of the Renaissance'', Journal of the History of Ideas IV. 4, 1943, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707165?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents p. 383]</ref>\n* [[Armida]] in [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''La Gerusalemme liberata'' (''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', 1566\u20131575, published 1580) is a Saracen sorceress sent by the infernal senate to sow discord among the [[Crusades|Crusaders]] camped before Jerusalem, where she succeeds in changing a party of them into animals. Planning to assassinate the hero, Rinaldo, she falls in love with him instead and creates an enchanted garden where she holds him a lovesick prisoner who has forgotten his former identity.<ref>Edward Fairfax's 1600 translation is available at the [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/392/pg392.html Gutenberg website].</ref>\n* Acrasia in Edmund Spenser's ''Faerie Queene'', mentioned above, is a seductress of knights and holds them enchanted in her Bower of Bliss.\n\nLater scholarship has identified elements from the character of both Circe and especially her fellow enchantress [[Medea]] as contributing to the development of the mediaeval legend of [[Morgan le Fay]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://encompass.eku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1464&context=etd|title=Masks of the Dark Goddess in Arthurian Literature: Origin and Evolution of Morgan le Fay|last=Shearer|first=John Christopher|publisher=Eastern Kentucky University, Richmond|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> In addition, it has been argued that the fairy [[Titania]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1600) is an inversion of Circe.<ref>Paul A. Olson, Beyond a Common Joy: An Introduction to Shakespearean Comedy, University of Nebraska 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_cJE15y9FmIC&lpg=PA81&ots=4KqlmnUV-B&dq=Titania%20%22Circe%22&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q=Titania%20%22Circe%22&f=false pp. 79\u201382].</ref> Titania (daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]]) was a title by which the sorceress was known in Classical times. In this case the tables are turned on the character, who is queen of the fairies. She is made to love an ass after, rather than before, he is transformed into his true animal likeness.\n\n[[File:Comus with his revellers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[William Blake]]'s 1815 watercolour of Comus and his animal-headed revellers|alt=|left]]\n\nIt has further been suggested that [[John Milton]]'s [[Comus (John Milton)|''Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle'']] (1634) is a sequel to ''[[Tempe Restored]],'' a masque in which Circe had figured two years earlier, and that the situation presented there is a reversal of the Greek myth.<ref>John G. Demaray, \"Milton's ''Comus:'' The Sequel to a Masque of Circe,\" ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 29 (1966), pp. 245\u201354.</ref> At the start of the [[masque]], the character Comus is described as the son of Circe by [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], god of wine, and the equal of his mother in enchantment. He too changes travelers into beastly forms that 'roll with pleasure in a sensual sty'. Having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair, he stands over her, wand in hand, and presses on her a magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), which she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity.<ref>The text is on the [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19819/19819-h/19819-h.htm Gutenberg website].</ref> The picture presented is a mirror image of the Classical story. In place of the witch who easily seduces the men she meets, a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Circe episode was to be re-evaluated in two poetic sequels to the ''Odyssey''. In the first of these, [[Giovanni Pascoli]]'s ''L'Ultimo Viaggio'' (''The Last Voyage'', 1906), the aging hero sets out to rediscover the emotions of his youth by retracing his journey from [[Troy]], only to discover that the island of Eea is deserted. What in his dream of love he had taken for the roaring of lions and Circe's song was now no more than the sound of the sea-wind in autumnal oaks (Cantos 16\u201317).<ref>The Italian text is at the [http://www.fondazionepascoli.it/Poesie/pc22.htm Fondazioni Pascoli] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721115238/http://www.fondazionepascoli.it/Poesie/pc22.htm |date=2009-07-21 }}; there is a discussion of the work in Mario Truglio, ''Beyond the Family Romance: The Legend of Pascoli'', University of Toronto 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nlOvSf7Of4MC&lpg=PA65&ots=__Y5Ic6qdw&dq=Pascoli%20%20%22Circe%22&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q=Pascoli%20%20%22Circe%22&f=false pp. 65\u201368].</ref>\n\nThis melancholy dispelling of illusion is echoed in ''[[The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel]]'' (1938) by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. The fresh voyage in search of new meaning to life recorded there grows out of the hero's initial rejection of his past experiences in the first two sections. The Circe episode is viewed by him as a narrow escape from death of the spirit: ''With twisted hands and thighs we rolled on burning sands, / a hanging mess of hissing vipers glued in sun!... / Farewell the brilliant voyage, ended! Prow and soul / moored in the muddy port of the contented beast! / O prodigal, much-traveled soul, is this your country?'' His escape from this mire of sensuality comes one day when the sight of some fishermen, a mother and her baby enjoying the simple comforts of food and drink, recalls him to life, its duties and delights.<ref>The translation of Kimon Friar, New York 1958, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/10986184/The-Odyssey-A-Modern-Sequel-by-Nikos-Kazantzakis Book 2, pp. 126\u201329].</ref> Where the attempt by Pascoli's hero to recapture the past ended in failure, Kazantzakis' Odysseus, already realising the emptiness of his experiences, journeys into what he hopes will be a fuller future. {{clear left}}\n\n==Visual representations==\n\n===Ancient art===\n[[File:NAMA Circ\u00e9 & Ulysse.jpg|thumb|left|Circe on a 490\u2013480 BCE oil jar, Athens-National Archaeological Museum|alt=|upright]]\n\nScenes from the ''Odyssey'' are common on Greek pottery, the Circe episode among them.

There was also a tradition of private performances, with a variety of illustrated works to help with stage properties and costumes. Among these was [[Thomas Jefferys]]' ''A Collection of the Dresses of Different Nations, Antient and Modern'' (1757\u201372) which included a copperplate [[engraving]] of a crowned Circe in loose dress, holding a goblet aloft in her right hand and a long wand in her left.<ref>Published from London, [http://www.albion-prints.com/greece-circe-c1760-costume-print-5656-p.asp p. 240].</ref> Evidence of such performances during the following decades is provided by several portraits in character, of which one of the earliest was the pastel by [[Daniel Gardner]] (1750\u20131805) of \"Miss Elliot as Circe\". The artist had been a pupil of both [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], who themselves were soon to follow his example. On the 1778 engraving based on Gardner's portrait appear the lines from Milton's ''Comus'': ''The daughter of the Sun, whose charmed cup / Whoever tasted, lost his upright shape / And downward fell into a grovelling swine'', in compliment to the charm of this marriageable daughter of a country house. As in the Jefferys' plate, she wears a silver coronet over tumbled dark hair, with a wand in the right hand and a goblet in the left. In hindsight the frank eyes that look directly at the viewer and the rosebud mouth are too innocent for the role Miss Elliot is playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preraphaeliteoftheforest.tumblr.com/post/11755388956/miss-elliott-as-circe-daniel-gardner|title=Binding with Briars My Joys & Desires|website=preraphaeliteoftheforest.tumblr.com}}</ref>\n\nThe subjects of later paintings impersonating Circe have a history of sexual experience behind them, starting with \"Mary Spencer in the character of Circe\" by [[William Caddick]], which was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter [[George Stubbs]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Judy |last=Egerton |title=George Stubbs, Painter: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 |publisher=[[Yale University]] |year=2007 |url={{Google books |mFrO5o2X2EcC|page=482|plainurl=true}}|pages=95, 482 |isbn=978-0300125092}}</ref> A portrait of \"Mrs Nesbitt as Circe\" by Reynolds followed in 1781.

Specially designed, loose-fitting tunics were paired with large shawls or veils as she posed in such a way as to evoke figures from Classical mythology. These developed from mere poses, with the audience guessing the names of the classical characters and scenes that she portrayed, into small, wordless charades.<ref>Julia Peakman, Emma Hamilton, London 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lzn6AzBjE7EC&lpg=PA48&ots=_-by5D0Gr3&dq=%22pose%20plastique%22%20emma%20hamilton&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=%22pose%20plastique%22%20emma%20hamilton&f=false pp. 47\u201350].</ref>\n\nThe tradition of dressing up in character continued into the following centuries. One of the photographic series by [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], a pupil of the painter [[George Frederic Watts]], was of mythical characters, for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models. Young Kate Keown sat for the head of \"Circe\" in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character's use of wine to bring a change in personality.<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/16773 Victoria and Albert Museum].</ref> The society portrait photographer [[Yevonde Middleton]], also known as Madame Yevonde, was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball as the foundation for her own series of mythological portraits in colour.

The earliest was [[Beatrice Offor]] (1864\u20131920), whose sitter's part in her 1911 painting of Circe is suggested by the vine-leaf crown in her long dark hair, the snake-twined goblet she carries and the snake bracelet on her left arm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vintage-ephemera.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/circe-1911.html|title=Vera Violetta|access-date=2019-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417075726/http://vintage-ephemera.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/circe-1911.html|archive-date=2016-04-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Mary Cecil Allen]] was of Australian origin<ref>There is a fuller biography in the [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/allen-mary-cecil-5005 Australian Dictionary of Biography].</ref> but was living in the United States at the time \"Miss Audrey Stevenson as Circe\" was painted (1930).

This is [[Franz von Stuck]]'s striking portrait of Tilla Durieux as Circe (1913). She played this part in a Viennese revival of Calderon's play in 1912 and there is a publicity still of her by Isidor Hirsch in which she is draped across a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turnofthecentury.tumblr.com/image/1565153826|title=Turn of the Century: Photo|website=turnofthecentury.tumblr.com}}</ref> Her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of Van Stuck's enchantress as she holds out the poisoned bowl. It suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past. A nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of Mme [[Genevi\u00e8ve Vix]] as Circe in the light opera by Lucien Hillenacher at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/charmainezoe/5362148286|title=1907 Theatre \u2013 Mme Genevieve Vix as Circe, an opera comique by the Brothers Hillenacher at the Opera Comique, Paris|date=2011-01-16}}</ref> The posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect that goes beyond the merely theatrical. A later example is the still of [[Silvana Mangano]] in her part as Circe in the 1954 film ''[[Ulysses (1954 film)|Ulysses]]'', which is as cunningly posed for effect.\n\n==Musical treatments==\n===Cantata and song===\n[[File:Circe by Wright Barker (1889).jpg|thumb|left|Wright Barker's 1889 painting of Circe as musician|alt=]]\n\nBeside the verse dramas, with their lyrical interludes, on which many operas were based, there were poetic texts which were set as secular [[cantata]]s. One of the earliest was [[Alessandro Stradella]]'s ''La Circe'', in a setting for three voices that bordered on the operatic. It was first performed at [[Frascati]] in 1667 to honour Cardinal [[Leopoldo de Medici]] and contained references to its surroundings. In the opening recitative, Circe explains that it was her son Telegonus who founded Frascati. The other characters with whom she enters into dialogue are the south wind (Zeffiro) and the local river Algido.<ref>The entire score can be downloaded from [http://musickshandmade.com/lute/gerbodes/index/La%20Circe/page:1/sort:source/direction:asc Sarge Gerbode's site] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130129071116/http://musickshandmade.com/lute/gerbodes/index/La%20Circe/page:1/sort:source/direction:asc |date=2013-01-29}}</ref> In the following century, [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s cantata ''All'ombra di sospetto'' (In the shadow of doubt, RV 678) is set for a single voice and depicts Circe addressing Ulysses. The [[countertenor]] part is accompanied by [[flute]], [[harpsichord]], [[cello]], and [[theorbo]] and features two [[recitative]]s and two [[aria]]s. The piece is famous for the dialogue created between flute and voice, conjuring the moment of flirtation before the two become lovers.<ref>There is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsG1mSNHOg0 YouTube]; the score is also available [https://archive.org/stream/imslp-di-sospetto-rv-678-vivaldi-antonio/WIMA.dd52-Vivaldi_cantata_fLsop#page/n0/mode/2up online].</ref>\n\nThe most successful treatment of the Ulysses episode in French was [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]]'s poem ''Circ\u00e9'' (1703), that was specifically written to be a cantata. The different verse forms employed allow the piece to be divided by the musicians that set it in order to express a variety of emotions. The poem opens with the abandoned Circe sitting on a high mountain and mourning the departure of Ulysses. The sorceress then calls on the infernal gods and makes a terrible sacrifice: ''A myriad vapours obscure the light, / The stars of the night interrupt their course, / Astonished rivers retreat to their source / And even Death's god trembles in the dark''. But though the earth is shaken to its core, Love is not to be commanded in this way and the wintery fields come back to life.<ref>''Oeuvres de Jean-Baptiste Rousseau'', Brussels 1743, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IAQ_AAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA321&ots=5CNT4IqlSm&dq=jean%20baptiste%20rousseau%20circ%C3%A9&pg=PA321#v=onepage&q=jean%20baptiste%20rousseau%20circ%C3%A9&f=false Volume 1, pp. 321\u201324].</ref>\n\nThe earliest setting was by Jean-Baptiste Morin in 1706 and was popular for most of the rest of the century. One of its final moralising [[minuet]]s, ''Ce n'est point par effort qu'on aime'' (Love won't be forced) was often performed independently and the score reprinted in many song collections. The flautist [[Michel Blavet]] arranged the music for this and the poem's final stanza, ''Dans les champs que l'Hiver d\u00e9sole'' (In the fields that Winter wastes), for two flutes in 174.The new setting of the cantata three years later by Francois Collin de Blamont was equally successful and made the name of its nineteen-year-old composer. Originally for voice and bass continuo, it was expanded and considerably revised in 1729, with parts for flute, violin and viol added.<ref>Details are on the [http://philidor3.cmbv.fr/Parcourir/Oeuvres/COLIN-DE-BLAMONT-Francois-1690-1760-CIRCE-1725-cantate-francaise Philidor site] and there is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mN1yx7fh3w YouTube].</ref> Towards the end of the century, the choral setting by Georges Granges de Fontenelle (1769\u20131819) was equally to bring its young composer fame.<ref>Biographical notes on the [http://www.musicologie.org/Biographies/f/fontenelle_granges.html Musicologie website].</ref>\n\nRousseau's poem was also familiar to composers of other nationalities. Set for [[mezzo-soprano]] and full orchestra, it was given almost operatic treatment by the court composer [[Luigi Cherubini]] in 1789. Franz Seydelmann set it for soprano and full orchestra in Dresden in 1787 at the request of the Russian ambassador to the [[Saxony|Saxon]] Court, [[Belosselsky-Belozersky family|Prince Alexander Belosselsky]]. Although he spoke highly of Seydelmann's work, it is now judged grandiloquent and banal.<ref>[[Jacques Chailley]], \"Les dialogues sur la musique d'Alexandre Beloselskij\", ''Revue des \u00e9tudes slaves'' 45, 1966, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/slave_0080-2557_1966_num_45_1_1911?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard& pp. 93\u2013103].</ref> The later setting by the Austrian composer [[Sigismond von Neukomm]] for soprano and full orchestra (Op. 4 1810) is better regarded.<ref>The manuscript score is [http://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/15130 online].</ref>\n\nRecent treatments of the Circe theme include the Irish composer Gerald Victory's radio cantata ''Circe 1991'' (1973\u201375), David Gribble's ''A Threepenny Odyssey'', a fifteen-minute cantata for young people which includes the episode on Circe's Isle, and Malcolm Hayes' ''Odysseus remembers'' (2003\u201304), which includes parts for Circe, Anticleia and Tiresias. Gerald Humel's song cycle ''Circe'' (1998) grew out of his work on his 1993 ballet with Thomas H\u00f6ft. The latter subsequently wrote seven poems in German featuring Circe's role as seductress in a new light: here it is to freedom and enlightenment that she tempts her hearers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thomas-hoeft.de/|title=Thomas der Zug Spielzeug &#124; Ein Schl\u00fcssel zum Verst\u00e4ndnis von Thomas Train Characters ist eine handliche Thomas Train Character Guide f\u00fcr Jungen und M\u00e4dchen zur Auswahl.}}</ref> Another cycle of ''Seven Songs for High Voice and Piano'' (2008) by the American composer Martin Hennessey includes the poem \"Circe's Power\" from [[Louise Gl\u00fcck]]'s ''Meadowlands'' (1997).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martinhennessy.net/list2.htm|title=Martin Hennessy: Works Available Through This Site|website=www.martinhennessy.net}}</ref>\n\nThere have also been treatments of Circe in popular music, in particular the relation of the Odysseus episode in [[Friedrich Holl\u00e4nder]]'s song of 1958.<ref>A performance in German [http://www.discogs.com/Hanne-Wieder-Und-Friedrich-Meyer-Mit-Seiner-Studio-Band-Circe-Wiener-Schmarrn/release/957748 online].</ref> In addition, text in [[Homeric Greek]] is included in the \"Circe's Island\" episode in [[David Bedford]]'s ''The Odyssey'' (1976).<ref>Track 9, available on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=UG&feature=related&hl=en-GB&v=ZljJBAvQzUo YouTube].</ref> This was the ancestor of several later electronic suites that reference the Odysseus legend, with \"Circe\" titles among them, having little other programmatic connection with the myth itself.\n\n===Classical ballet and programmatic music===\nAfter [[classical ballet]] separated from theatrical spectacle into a wordless form in which the story is expressed solely through movement, the subject of Circe was rarely visited.

Its theme is psychological, representing the battle with animal instincts. The beasts portrayed extend beyond swine and include a goat, a snake, a lion and a deer.<ref>Lisa Allen's photographs of the ballet are available [http://www.exploredance.com/article.htm?id=514 online].</ref> The theme has been described as one of 'highly charged erotic action', although set in 'a world where sexual frustration is rampant'.<ref>Jamake Highwater, ''Dance: Rituals of Experience'', Oxford University 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tZOE1wrlweYC&lpg=PA179&ots=QS-3DzM6Nc&dq=Martha%20Graham%20%20%22Circe%22&pg=PA179#v=onepage&q=Martha%20Graham%20%20%22Circe%22&f=false pp. 179\u201381].</ref> In that same decade [[Rudolf Brucci]] composed his ''Kirka'' (1967) in Croatia.\n\nThere is a Circe episode in [[John Harbison]]'s ''Ulysses'' (Act 1, scene 2, 1983) in which the song of the enchantress is represented by [[ondes Martenot]] and tuned percussion.<ref>There is an excerpt [http://www.emusic.com/listen/#/album/boston-modern-orchestra-project/john-harbison-ulysses/11283351 online].</ref> After the sailors of Ullyses are transformed into animals by her spell, a battle of wills follows between Circe and the hero. Though the men are changed back, Ulysses is charmed by her in his turn. In 1993, a full scale treatment of the story followed in Gerald Humel's two-act ''Circe und Odysseus''. Also psychological in intent, it represents Circe's seduction of the restless hero as ultimately unsuccessful. The part played by the geometrical set in its Berlin production was particularly notable.<ref>Hans Dieter Schaal: Stage Architecture Stuttgart and London 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=spVLtZMGWO0C&lpg=PA49&ots=uVfc64U1ni&dq=Gerald%20Humel%2C%20%22Circe%20und%20Odysseus%22&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q=Gerald%20Humel,%20%22Circe%20und%20Odysseus%22&f=false pp. 48\u201351].</ref>\n\nWhile operas on the subject of Circe did not cease, they were overtaken for a while by the new musical concept of the [[symphonic poem]] which, whilst it does not use a sung text, similarly seeks a union of music and drama.<ref>Stanley Sadie, ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', New York, 1980, 13:544\u2013545.</ref> A number of purely musical works fall into this category from the late 19th century onwards, of which one of the first was [[Heinrich von Herzogenberg]]'s ''Odysseus'' (Op.16, 1873). A [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] symphony for large orchestra, dealing with the hero's return from the Trojan war, its third section is titled \"Circe's Gardens\" (''Die G\u00e4rten der Circe'').\n\nIn the 20th century, Ernst Boehe's cycle ''Aus Odysseus Fahrten'' (''From Odysseus' Voyage'', Op. 6, 1903) was equally programmatic and included the visit to Circe's Isle (''Die Insel der Circe'') as its second long section. After a depiction of the sea voyage, a bass clarinet passage introduces an ensemble of flute, harp and solo violin over a lightly orchestrated accompaniment, suggesting Circe's seductive attempt to hold Odysseus back from traveling further.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/Aus_Odysseus'_Fahrten,_Op.6_(Boehe,_Ernst)|title=Aus Odysseus' Fahrten, Op. 6 (Boehe, Ernst) \u2013 IMSLP/Petrucci Music Library: Free Public Domain Sheet Music|website=imslp.org}}</ref> [[Alan Hovhaness]]' ''Circe Symphony'' (No.18, Op. 204a, 1963) is a late example of such programmatic writing. It is, in fact, only a slightly changed version of his ballet music of that year, with the addition of more strings, a second [[timpani]]st and [[celesta]].\n\nWith the exception of Willem Frederik Bon's prelude for orchestra (1972), most later works have been for a restricted number of instruments. They include Hendrik de Regt's ''Circe'' (Op. 44, 1975) for clarinet, violin and piano; [[Christian Manen]]'s ''Les Enchantements De Circe'' (Op. 96, 1975) for bassoon and piano; and [[Jacques Lenot]]'s ''Cir(c)\u00e9'' (1986) for [[oboe d'amore]]. The German experimental musician [[Dieter Schnebel]]'s ''Circe'' (1988) is a work for harp, the various sections of which are titled ''Signale'' (signals), ''S\u00e4useln'' (whispers), ''Verlockungen'' (enticements), ''Pein'' (pain), ''Schl\u00e4ge'' (strokes) and ''Umgarnen'' (snare), which give some idea of their programmatic intent.\n\nMichael Amann (born 1964) provides notes for his ''Kirke'' for voice, violin, piano and percussion (1995). It is based on four excerpts from Homer's ''Odyssey'' and emphasises a variety of vocal uses for the mezzo-soprano part. He explains that 'the play between the foreseeable (deep structure) and the unexpected (surface) is for me an analogy of Ulysses (who realises Circe is a sorceress, so that the consequence of her magic is ineffective) and Odysseus' companions, whom Circe's enchantments take by surprise'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-amann.at/?id=11&sprache=de&to_include=werk&artcat=4|title=Michael Amann \u2013 Komponist & Musikp\u00e4dagoge|website=Michael Amann \u2013 Komponist & Musikp\u00e4dagoge}}</ref> Questioned in an interview about how this worked in terms of his composition, he explained that this meant disrupting the musical structure once it was established and that the singer's shift between voice tones, singing and non-communicative vocalisation equates to the movement from solitude to self-expression.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musikdokumentation-vorarlberg.at/miamt001.htm|title=Vorarlberg musical documentation centre}}</ref> Dominique Lemaitre's ''Circ\u00e9'' for soprano and eight cellos (1998) is equally programmatic.

She is a daughter of the god [[Helios]] and either the [[Oceanid]] nymph [[Perse (mythology)|Perse]] or the goddess [[Hecate]].

He forces her to return them to human shape, lives with her for a year and has sons by her, including [[Latinus]] and [[Telegonus (son of Odysseus)|Telegonus]]. Her ability to change others into animals is further highlighted by the story of [[Picus]], an Italian king whom she turns into a woodpecker for resisting her advances. Another story makes her fall in love with the sea-god [[Glaucus]], who prefers the nymph [[Scylla]] to her. In revenge, Circe poisoned the water where her rival bathed and turned her into a dreadful  monster.\n\nDepictions, even in [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] times, wandered away from the detail in Homer's narrative, which was later to be reinterpreted morally as a cautionary story against drunkenness. Early philosophical questions were also raised whether the change from a reasoning being to a beast was not preferable after all, and this paradox was to have a powerful impact during the [[Renaissance]]. Circe was also taken as the archetype of the predatory female. In the eyes of those from a later age, this behaviour made her notorious both as a magician and as a type of the sexually free woman. As such she has been frequently depicted in all the arts from the Renaissance down to modern times.\n\nWestern paintings established a visual iconography for the figure, but also went for inspiration to other stories concerning Circe that appear in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The episodes of Scylla and Picus added the vice of violent jealousy to her bad qualities and made her a figure of fear as well as of desire.\n\n== Classical literature ==\nBy most accounts, she was the daughter of [[Helios]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[solar deity|sun god]], and [[Perse (mythology)|Perse]], one of the three thousand [[Oceanid]] [[nymph]]s.

Around her home prowl strangely docile lions and wolves. She lures any who land on the island to her home with her lovely singing while weaving on an enormous loom, but later drugs them so that they change shape.<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+10.212&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 10.212ff].</ref> She invites the hero Odysseus' crew to a feast of familiar food, a pottage of cheese and meal, sweetened with honey and laced with wine, but also mixed with one of her magical potions that turns them into swine.

He escapes to warn Odysseus and the others who have remained with the ship.\n\n[[File:Ulisse e Circe.jpg|thumb|[[Annibale Carracci]]'s ''Ulysses and Circe'' ({{c.|lk=no|1590}}) at [[Farnese Palace]]|alt=]]\n\nBefore Odysseus reaches Circe's palace, [[Hermes]], the messenger god sent by [[Athena]], intercepts him and reveals how he might defeat Circe in order to free his crew from their enchantment. Hermes provides Odysseus with the herb [[moly (herb)|moly]] to protect him from Circe's magic. He also tells Odysseus that he must then draw his sword and act as if he were going to attack her. From there, as Hermes foretold, Circe would ask Odysseus to bed, but Hermes advises caution, for the treacherous goddess could still \"unman\" him unless he has her swear by the names of the gods that she will not take any further action against him. Following this advice, Odysseus is able to free his men. After they have all remained on the island for a year, Circe advises Odysseus that he must first visit the [[Underworld]], something a mortal has never yet done,<ref>Homer, ''Odyssey'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136%3Abook%3D10%3Acard%3D475 10.475\u2014541].</ref> in order to gain knowledge about how to appease the gods, return home safely and recover his kingdom. Circe also advises him on how this might be achieved and furnishes him with the protections he will need and the means to communicate with the dead. On his return, she further advises him about two possible routes home, warning him, however, that both carry great danger.\n\n===Other texts===\n[[File:Kauffmann_Circe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angelica Kauffman]]'s painting of Circe enticing [[Odysseus]] (1786)|alt=|left]]\n\nTowards the end of [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (c. 700 BCE), it is stated that Circe bore Odysseus three sons: [[Ardeas]] or Agrius (otherwise unknown); [[Latinus]]; and [[Telegonus (son of Odysseus)|Telegonus]], who ruled over the Tyrsenoi, that is the [[Etruscans]]. The ''[[Telegony]]'', an epic now lost, relates the later history of the last of these. Circe eventually informed him who his absent father was and, when he set out to find Odysseus, gave him a poisoned spear. With this he killed his father unknowingly. Telegonus then brought back his father's corpse to Aeaea, together with [[Penelope]] and Odysseus' other son [[Telemachus]]. After burying Odysseus, Circe made the others immortal.\n\nIn the 5th-century CE epic ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', author [[Nonnus]] mentions Phaunos, Circe's son by the sea god [[Poseidon]].<ref>Timothy Peter Wiseman, ''Remus: A Roman Myth'', Cambridge University 1995, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LPNHRUlWacC&lpg=PA48&ots=-_sY_Y5iRY&dq=Phaunos%20Circe&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=Phaunos%20Circe&f=false pp. 47\u201348].</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Lycophron]]'s 3rd-century BCE poem ''Alexandra'', and [[John Tzetzes]]' [[scholia]] on it, Circe used magical herbs to bring Odysseus back to life after he had been killed by Telegonus. Odysseus then gave Telemachus to Circe's daughter Cassiphone in marriage. Some time later, Telemachus had a quarrel with his mother-in-law and killed her; Cassiphone then killed Telemachus to avenge her mother's death. On hearing of this, Odysseus died of grief.\n\nIn his 3rd-century BCE epic, the ''[[Argonautica]]'', [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius Rhodius]] relates that Circe purified the [[Argonauts]] for the death of [[Absyrtus]],<ref>\"They escaped neither the vast sea's hardships nor vexatious tempests till Kirk\u00e9<!--Kirk\u00e9 in original--> should wash them clean of the pitiless murder of Apsyrtos\" ([[Apollonius of Rhodes]], ''Argonautica'', iv. 586\u201388, in Peter Grean's translation).</ref> possibly reflecting an early tradition.<ref>See the ancient concept of ''[[Miasma (Greek mythology)|miasma]]'', a Peter Green's commentary on iv. 705\u201317, ''The Argonautika Apollonios Rhodios'', (1997, 2007) p. 322.</ref> In this poem, the animals that surround her are not former lovers transformed but primeval 'beasts, not resembling the beasts of the wild, nor yet like men in body, but with a medley of limbs'.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm#2H_4_0006|title=iv: 659\u201384|date=1997|publisher=Gutenberg.org|accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (1.72.5) cites [[Xenagoras (historian)|Xenagoras]], the 2nd-century BCE historian, as claiming that Odysseus and Circe had three sons: Rhomus, [[Anteias]], and [[Ardeias]], who respectively founded three cities called by their names: [[Rome]], [[Antium]], and [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]].\n\nThree ancient plays about Circe have been lost: the work of the tragedian [[Aeschylus]] and of the 4th-century BCE comic dramatists [[Ephippus of Athens]] and Anaxilas. The first told the story of Odysseus' encounter with Circe. Vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual [[Satyr]]s.

Later traditions tell of her leaving or even destroying the island and moving to Italy, where she was identified with [[Cape Circeo]].\n\nThe theme of turning men into a variety of animals was elaborated by later writers, especially in [[Latin]]. In [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', Aeneas skirts the Italian island where Circe now dwells, and hears the cries of her many male victims, who now number more than the pigs of earlier accounts:{{poemquote|The roars of lions that refuse the chain, / The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears, / And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.7.vii.html|title=Dryden's translation|date=|publisher=Classics.mit.edu|accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>|char=|sign=|title=|source=}}\n\n[[File:J.

The fourth episode covers Circe's encounter with Ulysses (Roman names of Odysseus). The first episode in that book deals with the story of [[Glaucus]] and Scylla, in which the enamoured sea-god seeks a love potion to win Scylla's love, only to have the sorceress fall in love with him. When she is unsuccessful, she takes revenge on her rival by turning Scylla into a monster (lines 1\u201374). The story of the [[Latium|Latian]] king [[Picus]] is told in the fifth episode (and also alluded to in the ''Aeneid''). Circe fell in love with him too; when he preferred to remain faithful to his wife Canens, she turned him into a woodpecker (lines 308\u2013440).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses14.html |title=Online translation |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Plutarch]] took up the theme in a lively dialogue that was later to have several imitators. Contained in his 1st-century ''[[Moralia]]'' is the Gryllus episode in which Circe allows Odysseus to interview a fellow Greek turned into a pig. There his interlocutor informs Odysseus that his present existence is preferable to the human. They then engage in a philosophical dialogue in which every human value is questioned and beasts are proved to be of superior wisdom and virtue.<ref>Vol. XII of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1957, at the [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Gryllus*.html Chicago University website].</ref>\n\n{{Clear right}}\n\n== Later literature ==\n[[File:De_claris_mulieribus.jpg|thumb|\"Circea\" in [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s {{c.|1365|lk=no}} ''[[De Claris Mulieribus]]'', a catalogue of famous women, from a 1474 edition|alt=]]\n\n[[Giovanni Boccaccio]] provided a digest of what was known of Circe during the [[Middle Ages]] in his ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'' (''Famous Women'', 1361\u20131362).

Ulysses is depicted as deeper in sorcery and readier of tongue than Circe and through this means he leaves her pregnant with Telegonus. Most of the account deals with the son's later quest for and accidental killing of his father, drawing the moral that only evil can come of the use of sorcery.<ref>John Gower, English Works, [https://archive.org/stream/completeworksofj03goweuoft#page/204/mode/2up 6.1391\u20131788]; there is also a [http://www.ellinanderson.com/Circe%20and%20Ulysses.html modern translation] by Ellin Anderson.</ref>\n\nThe story of Ulysses and Circe was retold as an episode in Georg Rollenhagen's German verse epic, ''Froschmeuseler'' (''The Frogs and Mice'', Magdeburg, 1595).

There was much speculation concerning how this could be, whether the human consciousness changed at the same time, and even whether it was a change for the better. The Gryllus dialogue was taken up by another Italian writer, [[Giovan Battista Gelli]], in his ''La Circe'' (1549). This is a series of ten philosophical and moral dialogues between Ulysses and the humans transformed into various animals, ranging from an oyster to an elephant, in which Circe sometimes joins. Most argue against changing back; only the last animal, a philosopher in its former existence, wants to.<ref>The English translation of 1754 is available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=zrgFAAAAQAAJe Google Books].</ref> English poet [[Edmund Spenser]] also makes reference to Plutarch's dialogue in the section of his ''[[Faerie Queene]]'' (1590) based on the Circe episode which appears at the end of Book II. Sir Guyon changes back the victims of Acrasia's erotic frenzy in the Bower of Bliss, most of whom are abashed at their fall from chivalric grace, ''But one above the rest in speciall, / That had an hog beene late, hight Grille by name, / Repined greatly, and did him miscall, / That had from hoggish forme him brought to naturall.''<ref>Book 2.12, stanza 86.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dosso Dossi 003.jpg|thumb|[[Dosso Dossi]]'s ''Circe and Her Lovers'' (c. 1525)|alt=]]\n\nTwo other Italians wrote rather different works that centre on the animal within the human. One was [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] in his unfinished long poem, ''L'asino d'oro'' (''The Golden Ass'', 1516). The author meets a beautiful herdswoman surrounded by Circe's herd of beasts. After spending a night of love with him, she explains the characteristics of the animals in her charge: the lions are the brave, the bears are the violent, the wolves are those forever dissatisfied, and so on (Canto 6). In Canto 7 he is introduced to those who experience frustration: a cat that has allowed its prey to escape; an agitated dragon; a fox constantly on the look-out for traps; a dog that bays the moon; Aesop's [[The Lion in Love (fable)|lion in love]] that allowed himself to be deprived of his teeth and claws. There are also emblematic satirical portraits of various Florentine personalities. In the eighth and last canto he has a conversation with a pig that, like the Gryllus of Plutarch, does not want to be changed back and condemns human greed, cruelty and conceit.<ref>There is a French translation in ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes'' X, Paris 1825, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KkgTAAAAQAAJ&hl=fr&pg=PA403 pp. 401\u201353].</ref>\n\nThe other Italian author was the esoteric philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who wrote in Latin. His ''Cantus Circaeus'' (''The Incantation of Circe'') was the fourth work on memory and the association of ideas by him to be published in 1582. It contains a series of poetic dialogues, in the first of which, after a long series of incantations to the seven planets of the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic tradition]], most humans appear changed into different creatures in the scrying bowl. The sorceress Circe is then asked by her handmaiden Moeris about the type of behaviour with which each is associated. According to Circe, for instance, ''fireflies are the learned, wise, and illustrious amidst idiots, asses, and obscure men'' (Question 32). In later sections different characters discuss the use of images in the imagination in order to facilitate use of the [[art of memory]], which is the real aim of the work.<ref>The original and its English translation is available [http://www.tomaszahora.org/CantusCircaeusTranslation.htm online].</ref>\n\nFrench writers were to take their lead from Gelli in the following century.<ref>Much of the information that follows can be found discussed in Brigitte Urbani, ''Vaut-il \"mieux mille fois \u00eatre \u00e2nes qu'\u00eatre hommes\"? Quelques r\u00e9\u00e9critures de La Circe de Giovan Battista Gelli'', INT Chroniques 69/70. 2002 [http://chroniquesitaliennes.univ-paris3.fr/PDF/69-70/69-Urbani.pdf pp. 163\u201381].</ref> [[Antoine Jacob]] wrote a one-act social comedy in rhyme, ''Les Bestes raisonnables'' (''The Reasoning Beasts'', 1661) which allowed him to satirise contemporary manners. On the isle of Circe, Ulysses encounters an ass that was once a doctor, a lion that had been a valet, a female doe and a horse, all of whom denounce the decadence of the times. The ass sees human asses everywhere, ''Asses in the town square, asses in the suburbs, / Asses in the provinces, asses proud at court, / Asses browsing in the meadows, military asses trooping, / Asses tripping it at balls, asses in the theatre stalls.'' To drive the point home, in the end it is only the horse, formerly a courtesan, who wants to return to her former state.\n\n[[File:Schubert Ulysses and Circe.jpg|left|thumb|[[Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg]]'s ''Ulysses at the Palace of Circe'' (1667)]]\n\nThe same theme occupies [[La Fontaine's Fables|La Fontaine's]] late fable, \"The Companions of Ulysses\" (XII.1, 1690), that also echoes Plutarch and Gelli. Once transformed, every animal (which include a lion, a bear, a wolf and a mole) protest that their lot is better and refuse to be restored to human shape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/la_fontaine/jean_de/fables/book12.html#book12.1|title=The Fables of La Fontaine, by Jean de La Fontaine : Book XII.|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au}}</ref> Charles Dennis shifted this fable to stand at the head of his translation of La Fontaine, ''Select Fables'' (1754), but provides his own conclusion that ''When Mortals from the path of Honour stray, / And the strong passions over reason sway, / What are they then but Brutes? / 'Tis vice alone that constitutes / Th'enchanting wand and magic bowl, The exterior form of Man they wear, / But are in fact both Wolf and Bear, / The transformation's in the Soul.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CK4iXvnRAXQC&lpg=PR7s|title=Select Fables|first=Charles|last=Denis|date=2018|publisher=Tonson and Draper|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n[[Louis Fuzelier]] and [[Marc-Antoine Legrand]] titled their comic opera of 1718 ''Les animaux raisonnables''. It had more or less the same scenario transposed into another medium and set to music by [[Jacques Aubert]]. Circe, wishing to be rid of the company of Ulysses, agrees to change back his companions, but only the dolphin is willing. The others, who were formerly a corrupt judge (now a wolf), a financier (a pig), an abused wife (a hen), a deceived husband (a bull) and a flibbertigibbet (a linnet), find their present existence more agreeable.\n\n[[File:Circe by John Collier.jpg|thumb|''Circe'' by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]] (19th century)|alt=]]\n\nThe Venetian [[Gasparo Gozzi]] was another Italian who returned to Gelli for inspiration in the 14 prose ''Dialoghi dell'isola di Circe'' (''Dialogues from Circe's Island'') published as journalistic pieces between 1760 and 1764. In this moral work, the aim of Ulysses in talking to the beasts is to learn more of the human condition. It includes figures from fable ([[The Fox and the Crow (Aesop)|The fox and the crow]], XIII) and from myth to illustrate its vision of society at variance. Far from needing the intervention of Circe, the victims find their natural condition as soon as they set foot on the island. The philosopher here is not Gelli's elephant but the bat that retreats from human contact into the darkness, like Bruno's fireflies (VI). The only one who wishes to change in Gozzi's work is the bear, a satirist who had dared to criticize Circe and had been changed as a punishment (IX).\n\nThere were two more satirical dramas in later centuries. One modelled on the Gryllus episode in Plutarch occurs as a chapter of [[Thomas Love Peacock]]'s late novel, ''[[Gryll Grange]]'' (1861), under the title \"Aristophanes in London\". Half Greek comedy, half Elizabethan masque, it is acted at the Grange by the novel's characters as a Christmas entertainment. In it [[Spiritualist]] [[mediumship|mediums]] raise Circe and Gryllus and try to convince the latter of the superiority of modern times, which he rejects as intellectually and materially regressive.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21514?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Gryll Grange by Thomas Love Peacock|via=www.gutenberg.org|date=2007}}</ref> An Italian work drawing on the transformation theme was the comedy by Ettore Romagnoli, ''La figlia del Sole'' (''The Daughter of the Sun'', 1919). [[Hercules]] arrives on the island of Circe with his servant Cercopo and has to be rescued by the latter when he too is changed into a pig. But, since the naturally innocent other animals had become corrupted by imitating human vices, the others who had been changed were refused when they begged to be rescued.\n\nAlso in England, Austin Dobson engaged more seriously with Homer's account of the transformation of Odysseus' companions when, though ''Head, face and members bristle into swine, / Still cursed with sense, their mind remains alone''.<ref>Pope's translation of the Odyssey, Book X, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IUoIAAAAQAAJ&lpg=PA233&ots=A2clHXZYnt&dq=%22Head%2C%20face%20and%20members%20bristle%20into%20swine%22&pg=PA233#v=onepage&q=%22Head,%20face%20and%20members%20bristle%20into%20swine%22&f=false lines 279\u201380].</ref> Dobson's \"[[s:Littell's Living Age/Volume 127/Issue 1640/The Prayer of the Swine to Circe|The Prayer of the Swine to Circe]]\"<ref>''Vignettes in Rhyme and other verses'', US edition 1880, [https://archive.org/stream/vignettesinrhyme00dobsuoft#page/206/mode/2up/ pp. 206\u201310].</ref> (1640) depicts the horror of being imprisoned in an animal body in this way with the human consciousness unchanged. There appears to be no relief, for only in the final line is it revealed that Odysseus has arrived to free them. But in [[Matthew Arnold]]'s dramatic poem \"The Strayed Reveller\" (1849),<ref>Matthew Arnold, ''The Strayed Reveller and Other Poems'', London 1849, [http://www.telelib.com/authors/A/ArnoldMatthew/verse/strayedreveller/strayedreveller.html pp. 11\u201327].</ref> in which Circe is one of the characters, the power of her potion is differently interpreted. The inner tendencies unlocked by it are not the choice between animal nature and reason but between two types of impersonality, between divine clarity and the poet's participatory and tragic vision of life. In the poem, Circe discovers a youth laid asleep in the portico of her temple by a draught of her ivy-wreathed bowl. On awaking from possession by the poetic frenzy it has induced, he craves for it to be continued.<ref>M. G. Sundell, \"Story and Context in \"The Strayed Reveller\", Victorian Poetry 3.3, West Virginia University 1965, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20171700?seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents pp. 161\u201370].</ref>\n\n===Sexual politics===\nWith the [[Renaissance]] there began to be a reinterpretation of what it was that changed the men, if it was not simply magic. For [[Socrates]], in Classical times, it had been gluttony overcoming their self-control.<ref>Xenophon's ''Memorabilia of Socrates'' [http://thriceholy.net/Texts/Memorabilia.html Book I, 3.7].</ref> But for the influential emblematist [[Andrea Alciato]], it was unchastity. In the second edition of his ''Emblemata'' (1546), therefore, Circe became the type of the [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. His Emblem 76 is titled ''Cavendum a meretricibus''; its accompanying Latin verses mention Picus, Scylla and the companions of Ulysses, and concludes that 'Circe with her famous name indicates a whore and any who loves such a one loses his reason'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/alciato/emblem.php?id=A46a016|title=Alciato at Glasgow: Emblem: Cavendum \u00e0 meretricibus.|website=www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk}}</ref> His English imitator [[Geoffrey Whitney]] used a variation of Alciato's illustration in his own ''Choice of Emblemes'' (1586) but gave it the new title of ''Homines voluptatibus transformantur'', men are transformed by their passions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mun.ca/alciato/whit/w082.html|title=Whitney 82|website=www.mun.ca}}</ref> This explains her appearance in the Nighttown section named after her in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 15, Circe|Ulysses]]''. Written in the form of a stage script, it makes of Circe the brothel madam, Bella Cohen. Bloom, the book's protagonist, fantasizes that she turns into a cruel man-tamer named Mr Bello who makes him get down on all fours and rides him like a horse.<ref>The text is at [http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/ulysses/15 Online Literature].</ref>\n\nBy the 19th century, Circe was ceasing to be a mythical figure. Poets treated her either as an individual or at least as the type of a certain kind of woman. The French poet [[Joseph Albert Alexandre Glatigny|Albert Glatigny]] addresses \"Circ\u00e9\" in his ''Les vignes folles'' (1857) and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream, the magnet of masochistic fantasies.<ref>French text [http://www.mediterranees.net/mythes/ulysse/epreuves/circe/glatigny.html online].</ref> [[Louis-Nicolas M\u00e9nard]]'s sonnet in ''R\u00eaveries d'un pa\u00efen mystique'' (1876) describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look, but appearance belies the accursed reality.<ref>French text [http://www.mediterranees.net/mythes/ulysse/epreuves/circe/menard.html online].</ref> Poets in English were not far behind in this lurid portrayal. [[John Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley|Lord de Tabley]]'s \"Circe\" (1895) is a thing of decadent perversity likened to a tulip, ''A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine... / With freckled cheeks and splotch'd side serpentine, / A gipsy among flowers''.<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/246/757.html ''A Victorian Anthology''] 1837\u201395.</ref>\n\n[[File:'The Kingdom of Sorceress Circe' by Angelo Caroselli and Pseudo Caroselli.jpg|thumb|left|''The Kingdom of Sorceress Circe'' by [[Angelo Caroselli]] (c. 1630)|alt=]]\n\nThat central image is echoed by the blood-striped flower of [[T.S.Eliot]]'s student poem \"Circe's Palace\" (1909) in the [[Harvard Advocate]]. Circe herself does not appear, her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond: panthers, pythons, and peacocks that ''look at us with the eyes of men whom we knew long ago''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.std.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html|title=T.S. Eliot's 'Harvard Advocate' Poems|website=world.std.com}}</ref> Rather than a temptress, she has become an [[Emasculation|emasculatory]] threat.<ref>James E. Miller Jnr, ''T.S. Eliot: The Making Of An American Poet'', Pennsylvania State University 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Aq-lfNXrIDAC&lpg=PA71&ots=XQC16Ht7Cw&dq=%22Circe%22%20%20T.S.Eliot&pg=PA71#v=onepage&q=%22Circe%22%20%20T.S.Eliot&f=false p. 71].</ref>\n\nSeveral female poets make Circe stand up for herself, using the soliloquy form to voice the woman's position. The 19th-century English poet [[Augusta Webster]], much of whose writing explored the female condition, has a dramatic monologue in blank verse titled \"Circe\" in her volume ''Portraits'' (1870).<ref>The whole text can be read on [http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/circe PoemHunter].</ref> There the sorceress anticipates her meeting with Ulysses and his men and insists that she does not turn men into pigs\u2014she merely takes away the disguise that makes them seem human. ''But any draught, pure water, natural wine, / out of my cup, revealed them to themselves / and to each other. Change? there was no change; / only disguise gone from them unawares''. The mythological character of the speaker contributes at a safe remove to the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] discourse on women's sexuality by expressing female desire and criticizing the subordinate role given to women in heterosexual politics.<ref>Christine Sutphin, The representation of women's heterosexual desire in Augusta Webster's \"Circe\" and \"Medea in Athens\", Women's Writing 5.3, 1998, pp. 373\u201393.</ref>\n\nTwo American poets also explored feminine psychology in poems ostensibly about the enchantress. Leigh Gordon Giltner's \"Circe\" was included in her collection ''The Path of Dreams'' (1900), the first stanza of which relates the usual story of men turned to swine by her spell. But then a second stanza presents a sensuous portrait of an unnamed woman, very much in the French vein; once more, it concludes, 'A Circe's spells transform men into swine'.<ref>''The Path of Dreams'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/27024/27024-h/27024-h.htm#Page_54 p. 54].</ref> This is no passive victim of male projections but a woman conscious of her sexual power. So too is [[Hilda Doolittle]]'s \"Circe\", from her collection ''Hymen'' (1921). In her soliloquy she reviews the conquests with which she has grown bored, then mourns the one instance when she failed. In not naming Ulysses himself, Doolittle universalises an emotion with which all women might identify.<ref>''Hymen'', [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/doolittle/hymen/1921-circe.html pp. 21\u201322].</ref> At the end of the century, British poet [[Carol Ann Duffy]] wrote a monologue entitled ''Circe'' which pictures the goddess addressing an audience of 'nereids and nymphs'. In this outspoken episode in the war between the sexes, Circe describes the various ways in which all parts of a pig could and should be cooked.<ref>''The World's Wife'', London 1999; the text is on the [http://www.porkopolis.org/library/pig-poetry/carol-ann-duffy Porkopolis website].</ref>\n\nAnother indication of the progression in interpreting the Circe figure is given by two poems a century apart, both of which engage with paintings of her. The first is the sonnet that [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote in response to [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' \"The Wine of Circe\" in his volume ''Poems'' (1870). It gives a faithful depiction of the painting's [[Pre-Raphaelite]] mannerism but its description of Circe's potion as 'distilled of death and shame' also accords with the contemporary (male) identification of Circe with perversity. This is further underlined by his statement (in a letter) that the black panthers there are 'images of ruined passion' and by his anticipation at the end of the poem of ''passion's tide-strown shore / Where the disheveled seaweed hates the sea''.<ref>Painting and poem are juxtaposed on the [http://preraphaelitesisterhood.com/the-wine-of-circe-by-edward-burne-jones-poem-by-dante-gabriel-rossetti Pre-Raphaelite Sisterhood site]; the letter to Barbara Bodichon is quoted on the [http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/24-1869.raw.html Rossetti Archive site].</ref> The Australian [[A. D. Hope]]'s \"Circe \u2013 after the painting by Dosso Dossi\", on the other hand, frankly admits humanity's animal inheritance as natural and something in which even Circe shares. In the poem, he links the fading rationality and speech of her lovers to her own animal cries in the act of love.<ref>''A Late Picking \u2013 poems 1965\u201374'', quoted in the [http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/hope-a-d/circe-0417019 Australian Poetry Library].</ref>\n\n[[File:Charles Hermans - Circe the temptress.jpg|thumb|upright|''Circe the Temptress'' by [[Charles Hermans]] (c. 1859\u20131924)|alt=]]\n\nThere remain some poems that bear her name that have more to do with their writers' private preoccupations than with reinterpreting her myth. The link with it in [[Margaret Atwood]]'s \"Circe/Mud Poems\", first published in ''You Are Happy'' (1974), is more a matter of allusion and is nowhere overtly stated beyond the title. It is a reflection on contemporary gender politics that scarcely needs the disguises of Augusta Webster's.<ref>''Selected Poems'', Boston 1976 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv2dfKp74sAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=circe&f=false pp. 201\u201323].</ref> With two other poems by male writers it is much the same: [[Louis Macneice]]'s, for example, whose \"Circe\" appeared in his first volume, ''Poems'' (London, 1935); or [[Robert Lowell]]'s, whose \"Ulysses and Circe\" appeared in his last, ''Day by Day'' (New York, 1977).

These generally live in an isolated spot devoted to pleasure, to which lovers are lured and later changed into beasts. They include the following:\n* Alcina in the ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' (''Mad Roland,'' 1516, 1532) of [[Ludovico Ariosto]], set at the time of [[Charlemagne]]. Among its many sub-plots is the episode in which the [[Saracen]] champion Ruggiero is taken captive by the sorceress and has to be freed from her magic island.<ref>There is a translation on the [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/615/pg615.html Gutenberg website].</ref>\n* The lovers of Filidia in ''Il Tancredi'' (1632) by Ascanio Grandi (1567\u20131647) have been changed into monsters and are liberated by the virtuous Tancred.<ref>Merritt Y.

In this case the tables are turned on the character, who is queen of the fairies. She is made to love an ass after, rather than before, he is transformed into his true animal likeness.\n\n[[File:Comus with his revellers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[William Blake]]'s 1815 watercolour of Comus and his animal-headed revellers|alt=|left]]\n\nIt has further been suggested that [[John Milton]]'s [[Comus (John Milton)|''Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle'']] (1634) is a sequel to ''[[Tempe Restored]],'' a masque in which Circe had figured two years earlier, and that the situation presented there is a reversal of the Greek myth.<ref>John G. Demaray, \"Milton's ''Comus:'' The Sequel to a Masque of Circe,\" ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 29 (1966), pp. 245\u201354.</ref> At the start of the [[masque]], the character Comus is described as the son of Circe by [[Dionysus|Bacchus]], god of wine, and the equal of his mother in enchantment. He too changes travelers into beastly forms that 'roll with pleasure in a sensual sty'. Having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair, he stands over her, wand in hand, and presses on her a magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), which she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity.<ref>The text is on the [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19819/19819-h/19819-h.htm Gutenberg website].</ref> The picture presented is a mirror image of the Classical story. In place of the witch who easily seduces the men she meets, a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue.\n\nIn the 20th century, the Circe episode was to be re-evaluated in two poetic sequels to the ''Odyssey''. In the first of these, [[Giovanni Pascoli]]'s ''L'Ultimo Viaggio'' (''The Last Voyage'', 1906), the aging hero sets out to rediscover the emotions of his youth by retracing his journey from [[Troy]], only to discover that the island of Eea is deserted. What in his dream of love he had taken for the roaring of lions and Circe's song was now no more than the sound of the sea-wind in autumnal oaks (Cantos 16\u201317).<ref>The Italian text is at the [http://www.fondazionepascoli.it/Poesie/pc22.htm Fondazioni Pascoli] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721115238/http://www.fondazionepascoli.it/Poesie/pc22.htm |date=2009-07-21 }}; there is a discussion of the work in Mario Truglio, ''Beyond the Family Romance: The Legend of Pascoli'', University of Toronto 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nlOvSf7Of4MC&lpg=PA65&ots=__Y5Ic6qdw&dq=Pascoli%20%20%22Circe%22&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q=Pascoli%20%20%22Circe%22&f=false pp. 65\u201368].</ref>\n\nThis melancholy dispelling of illusion is echoed in ''[[The Odyssey: A Modern Sequel]]'' (1938) by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. The fresh voyage in search of new meaning to life recorded there grows out of the hero's initial rejection of his past experiences in the first two sections. The Circe episode is viewed by him as a narrow escape from death of the spirit: ''With twisted hands and thighs we rolled on burning sands, / a hanging mess of hissing vipers glued in sun!... / Farewell the brilliant voyage, ended! Prow and soul / moored in the muddy port of the contented beast! / O prodigal, much-traveled soul, is this your country?''

There was also a tradition of private performances, with a variety of illustrated works to help with stage properties and costumes. Among these was [[Thomas Jefferys]]' ''A Collection of the Dresses of Different Nations, Antient and Modern'' (1757\u201372) which included a copperplate [[engraving]] of a crowned Circe in loose dress, holding a goblet aloft in her right hand and a long wand in her left.<ref>Published from London, [http://www.albion-prints.com/greece-circe-c1760-costume-print-5656-p.asp p. 240].</ref> Evidence of such performances during the following decades is provided by several portraits in character, of which one of the earliest was the pastel by [[Daniel Gardner]] (1750\u20131805) of \"Miss Elliot as Circe\". The artist had been a pupil of both [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]], who themselves were soon to follow his example. On the 1778 engraving based on Gardner's portrait appear the lines from Milton's ''Comus'': ''The daughter of the Sun, whose charmed cup / Whoever tasted, lost his upright shape / And downward fell into a grovelling swine'', in compliment to the charm of this marriageable daughter of a country house. As in the Jefferys' plate, she wears a silver coronet over tumbled dark hair, with a wand in the right hand and a goblet in the left. In hindsight the frank eyes that look directly at the viewer and the rosebud mouth are too innocent for the role Miss Elliot is playing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://preraphaeliteoftheforest.tumblr.com/post/11755388956/miss-elliott-as-circe-daniel-gardner|title=Binding with Briars My Joys & Desires|website=preraphaeliteoftheforest.tumblr.com}}</ref>\n\nThe subjects of later paintings impersonating Circe have a history of sexual experience behind them, starting with \"Mary Spencer in the character of Circe\" by [[William Caddick]], which was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter [[George Stubbs]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Judy |last=Egerton |title=George Stubbs, Painter: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 |publisher=[[Yale University]] |year=2007 |url={{Google books |mFrO5o2X2EcC|page=482|plainurl=true}}|pages=95, 482 |isbn=978-0300125092}}</ref> A portrait of \"Mrs Nesbitt as Circe\" by Reynolds followed in 1781.

Specially designed, loose-fitting tunics were paired with large shawls or veils as she posed in such a way as to evoke figures from Classical mythology. These developed from mere poses, with the audience guessing the names of the classical characters and scenes that she portrayed, into small, wordless charades.<ref>Julia Peakman, Emma Hamilton, London 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lzn6AzBjE7EC&lpg=PA48&ots=_-by5D0Gr3&dq=%22pose%20plastique%22%20emma%20hamilton&pg=PA47#v=onepage&q=%22pose%20plastique%22%20emma%20hamilton&f=false pp. 47\u201350].</ref>\n\nThe tradition of dressing up in character continued into the following centuries. One of the photographic series by [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], a pupil of the painter [[George Frederic Watts]], was of mythical characters, for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models. Young Kate Keown sat for the head of \"Circe\" in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character's use of wine to bring a change in personality.<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/16773 Victoria and Albert Museum].</ref> The society portrait photographer [[Yevonde Middleton]], also known as Madame Yevonde, was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball as the foundation for her own series of mythological portraits in colour. Its participants were invited to her studio afterwards to pose in their costumes. There Baroness Dacre is pictured as Circe with a leafy headdress about golden ringlets and clasping a large [[Baroque]] porcelain goblet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portraitLarge/mw17333/Lady-Alexandra-Henrietta-Louisa-Haig-as-Circe|title=Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Haig as Circe |publisher=National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nA decade earlier, the illustrator [[Charles Edmund Brock]] extended into the 20th century what is almost a pastiche of the 18th-century [[conversation piece]] in his \"Circe and the Sirens\" (1925).

The earliest was [[Beatrice Offor]] (1864\u20131920), whose sitter's part in her 1911 painting of Circe is suggested by the vine-leaf crown in her long dark hair, the snake-twined goblet she carries and the snake bracelet on her left arm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vintage-ephemera.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/circe-1911.html|title=Vera Violetta|access-date=2019-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417075726/http://vintage-ephemera.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/circe-1911.html|archive-date=2016-04-17|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Mary Cecil Allen]] was of Australian origin<ref>There is a fuller biography in the [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/allen-mary-cecil-5005 Australian Dictionary of Biography].</ref> but was living in the United States at the time \"Miss Audrey Stevenson as Circe\" was painted (1930).

This is [[Franz von Stuck]]'s striking portrait of Tilla Durieux as Circe (1913). She played this part in a Viennese revival of Calderon's play in 1912 and there is a publicity still of her by Isidor Hirsch in which she is draped across a sofa and wearing an elaborate crown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turnofthecentury.tumblr.com/image/1565153826|title=Turn of the Century: Photo|website=turnofthecentury.tumblr.com}}</ref> Her enticing expression and the turn of her head there is almost exactly that of Van Stuck's enchantress as she holds out the poisoned bowl. It suggests the use of certain posed publicity photos in creating the same iconic effect as had paintings in the past. A nearly contemporary example was the 1907 photo of Mme [[Genevi\u00e8ve Vix]] as Circe in the light opera by Lucien Hillenacher at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]] in Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/charmainezoe/5362148286|title=1907 Theatre \u2013 Mme Genevieve Vix as Circe, an opera comique by the Brothers Hillenacher at the Opera Comique, Paris|date=2011-01-16}}</ref> The posing of the actress and the cropping of the image so as to highlight her luxurious costume demonstrates its ambition to create an effect that goes beyond the merely theatrical. A later example is the still of [[Silvana Mangano]] in her part as Circe in the 1954 film ''[[Ulysses (1954 film)|Ulysses]]'', which is as cunningly posed for effect.\n\n==Musical treatments==\n===Cantata and song===\n[[File:Circe by Wright Barker (1889).jpg|thumb|left|Wright Barker's 1889 painting of Circe as musician|alt=]]\n\nBeside the verse dramas, with their lyrical interludes, on which many operas were based, there were poetic texts which were set as secular [[cantata]]s. One of the earliest was [[Alessandro Stradella]]'s ''La Circe'', in a setting for three voices that bordered on the operatic. It was first performed at [[Frascati]] in 1667 to honour Cardinal [[Leopoldo de Medici]] and contained references to its surroundings. In the opening recitative, Circe explains that it was her son Telegonus who founded Frascati. The other characters with whom she enters into dialogue are the south wind (Zeffiro) and the local river Algido.<ref>The entire score can be downloaded from [http://musickshandmade.com/lute/gerbodes/index/La%20Circe/page:1/sort:source/direction:asc Sarge Gerbode's site] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130129071116/http://musickshandmade.com/lute/gerbodes/index/La%20Circe/page:1/sort:source/direction:asc |date=2013-01-29}}</ref> In the following century, [[Antonio Vivaldi]]'s cantata ''All'ombra di sospetto'' (In the shadow of doubt, RV 678) is set for a single voice and depicts Circe addressing Ulysses. The [[countertenor]] part is accompanied by [[flute]], [[harpsichord]], [[cello]], and [[theorbo]] and features two [[recitative]]s and two [[aria]]s. The piece is famous for the dialogue created between flute and voice, conjuring the moment of flirtation before the two become lovers.<ref>There is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsG1mSNHOg0 YouTube]; the score is also available [https://archive.org/stream/imslp-di-sospetto-rv-678-vivaldi-antonio/WIMA.dd52-Vivaldi_cantata_fLsop#page/n0/mode/2up online].</ref>\n\nThe most successful treatment of the Ulysses episode in French was [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]]'s poem ''Circ\u00e9'' (1703), that was specifically written to be a cantata. The different verse forms employed allow the piece to be divided by the musicians that set it in order to express a variety of emotions. The poem opens with the abandoned Circe sitting on a high mountain and mourning the departure of Ulysses. The sorceress then calls on the infernal gods and makes a terrible sacrifice: ''A myriad vapours obscure the light, / The stars of the night interrupt their course, / Astonished rivers retreat to their source / And even Death's god trembles in the dark''. But though the earth is shaken to its core, Love is not to be commanded in this way and the wintery fields come back to life.<ref>''Oeuvres de Jean-Baptiste Rousseau'', Brussels 1743, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IAQ_AAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA321&ots=5CNT4IqlSm&dq=jean%20baptiste%20rousseau%20circ%C3%A9&pg=PA321#v=onepage&q=jean%20baptiste%20rousseau%20circ%C3%A9&f=false Volume 1, pp. 321\u201324].</ref>\n\nThe earliest setting was by Jean-Baptiste Morin in 1706 and was popular for most of the rest of the century. One of its final moralising [[minuet]]s, ''Ce n'est point par effort qu'on aime'' (Love won't be forced) was often performed independently and the score reprinted in many song collections. The flautist [[Michel Blavet]] arranged the music for this and the poem's final stanza, ''Dans les champs que l'Hiver d\u00e9sole'' (In the fields that Winter wastes), for two flutes in 174.The new setting of the cantata three years later by Francois Collin de Blamont was equally successful and made the name of its nineteen-year-old composer. Originally for voice and bass continuo, it was expanded and considerably revised in 1729, with parts for flute, violin and viol added.<ref>Details are on the [http://philidor3.cmbv.fr/Parcourir/Oeuvres/COLIN-DE-BLAMONT-Francois-1690-1760-CIRCE-1725-cantate-francaise Philidor site] and there is a performance on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mN1yx7fh3w YouTube].</ref> Towards the end of the century, the choral setting by Georges Granges de Fontenelle (1769\u20131819) was equally to bring its young composer fame.<ref>Biographical notes on the [http://www.musicologie.org/Biographies/f/fontenelle_granges.html Musicologie website].</ref>\n\nRousseau's poem was also familiar to composers of other nationalities. Set for [[mezzo-soprano]] and full orchestra, it was given almost operatic treatment by the court composer [[Luigi Cherubini]] in 1789. Franz Seydelmann set it for soprano and full orchestra in Dresden in 1787 at the request of the Russian ambassador to the [[Saxony|Saxon]] Court, [[Belosselsky-Belozersky family|Prince Alexander Belosselsky]].

Gerald Humel's song cycle ''Circe'' (1998) grew out of his work on his 1993 ballet with Thomas H\u00f6ft.

The beasts portrayed extend beyond swine and include a goat, a snake, a lion and a deer.<ref>Lisa Allen's photographs of the ballet are available [http://www.exploredance.com/article.htm?id=514 online].</ref> The theme has been described as one of 'highly charged erotic action', although set in 'a world where sexual frustration is rampant'.<ref>Jamake Highwater, ''Dance: Rituals of Experience'', Oxford University 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tZOE1wrlweYC&lpg=PA179&ots=QS-3DzM6Nc&dq=Martha%20Graham%20%20%22Circe%22&pg=PA179#v=onepage&q=Martha%20Graham%20%20%22Circe%22&f=false pp. 179\u201381].</ref> In that same decade [[Rudolf Brucci]] composed his ''Kirka'' (1967) in Croatia.\n\nThere is a Circe episode in [[John Harbison]]'s ''Ulysses'' (Act 1, scene 2, 1983) in which the song of the enchantress is represented by [[ondes Martenot]] and tuned percussion.<ref>There is an excerpt [http://www.emusic.com/listen/#/album/boston-modern-orchestra-project/john-harbison-ulysses/11283351 online].</ref> After the sailors of Ullyses are transformed into animals by her spell, a battle of wills follows between Circe and the hero. Though the men are changed back, Ulysses is charmed by her in his turn. In 1993, a full scale treatment of the story followed in Gerald Humel's two-act ''Circe und Odysseus''. Also psychological in intent, it represents Circe's seduction of the restless hero as ultimately unsuccessful. The part played by the geometrical set in its Berlin production was particularly notable.<ref>Hans Dieter Schaal: Stage Architecture Stuttgart and London 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=spVLtZMGWO0C&lpg=PA49&ots=uVfc64U1ni&dq=Gerald%20Humel%2C%20%22Circe%20und%20Odysseus%22&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q=Gerald%20Humel,%20%22Circe%20und%20Odysseus%22&f=false pp. 48\u201351].</ref>\n\nWhile operas on the subject of Circe did not cease, they were overtaken for a while by the new musical concept of the [[symphonic poem]] which, whilst it does not use a sung text, similarly seeks a union of music and drama.<ref>Stanley Sadie, ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', New York, 1980, 13:544\u2013545.</ref> A number of purely musical works fall into this category from the late 19th century onwards, of which one of the first was [[Heinrich von Herzogenberg]]'s ''Odysseus'' (Op.16, 1873). A [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] symphony for large orchestra, dealing with the hero's return from the Trojan war, its third section is titled \"Circe's Gardens\" (''Die G\u00e4rten der Circe'').\n\nIn the 20th century, Ernst Boehe's cycle ''Aus Odysseus Fahrten'' (''From Odysseus' Voyage'', Op. 6, 1903) was equally programmatic and included the visit to Circe's Isle (''Die Insel der Circe'') as its second long section. After a depiction of the sea voyage, a bass clarinet passage introduces an ensemble of flute, harp and solo violin over a lightly orchestrated accompaniment, suggesting Circe's seductive attempt to hold Odysseus back from traveling further.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/Aus_Odysseus'_Fahrten,_Op.6_(Boehe,_Ernst)|title=Aus Odysseus' Fahrten, Op. 6 (Boehe, Ernst) \u2013 IMSLP/Petrucci Music Library: Free Public Domain Sheet Music|website=imslp.org}}</ref> [[Alan Hovhaness]]' ''Circe Symphony'' (No.18, Op. 204a, 1963) is a late example of such programmatic writing. It is, in fact, only a slightly changed version of his ballet music of that year, with the addition of more strings, a second [[timpani]]st and [[celesta]].\n\nWith the exception of Willem Frederik Bon's prelude for orchestra (1972), most later works have been for a restricted number of instruments. They include Hendrik de Regt's ''Circe'' (Op. 44, 1975) for clarinet, violin and piano; [[Christian Manen]]'s ''Les Enchantements De Circe'' (Op. 96, 1975) for bassoon and piano; and [[Jacques Lenot]]'s ''Cir(c)\u00e9'' (1986) for [[oboe d'amore]]. The German experimental musician [[Dieter Schnebel]]'s ''Circe'' (1988) is a work for harp, the various sections of which are titled ''Signale'' (signals), ''S\u00e4useln'' (whispers), ''Verlockungen'' (enticements), ''Pein'' (pain), ''Schl\u00e4ge'' (strokes) and ''Umgarnen'' (snare), which give some idea of their programmatic intent.\n\nMichael Amann (born 1964) provides notes for his ''Kirke'' for voice, violin, piano and percussion (1995). It is based on four excerpts from Homer's ''Odyssey'' and emphasises a variety of vocal uses for the mezzo-soprano part. He explains that 'the play between the foreseeable (deep structure) and the unexpected (surface) is for me an analogy of Ulysses (who realises Circe is a sorceress, so that the consequence of her magic is ineffective) and Odysseus' companions, whom Circe's enchantments take by surprise'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-amann.at/?id=11&sprache=de&to_include=werk&artcat=4|title=Michael Amann \u2013 Komponist & Musikp\u00e4dagoge|website=Michael Amann \u2013 Komponist & Musikp\u00e4dagoge}}</ref> Questioned in an interview about how this worked in terms of his composition, he explained that this meant disrupting the musical structure once it was established and that the singer's shift between voice tones, singing and non-communicative vocalisation equates to the movement from solitude to self-expression.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musikdokumentation-vorarlberg.at/miamt001.htm|title=Vorarlberg musical documentation centre}}</ref> Dominique Lemaitre's ''Circ\u00e9'' for soprano and eight cellos (1998) is equally programmatic.

Her note on these explains that their purpose is to 'describe some of the personages of ancient Greece' and that Circe was 'the enchantress who changed men into beasts'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theamusgrave.com/html/voices_from_the_ancient_world.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717054620/http://www.theamusgrave.com/html/voices_from_the_ancient_world.html|url-status=dead|title=Composer's website|archivedate=July 17, 2012}}</ref> A recent reference is the harpsichordist [[Fernando De Luca]]'s Sonata II for [[viola da gamba]] titled \"Circe's Cave\" (''L'antro della maga Circe'').\n\n=== Opera ===\n[[Rolf Riehm]] wrote an opera with his own [[libretto]] based on several texts related to the meeting of [[Odysseus]] and Circe, as told in Homer's ''Odyssey'', by [[Karoline von G\u00fcnderrode]], [[Giovanni Pascoli]] and [[Isabelle Eberhardt]], illuminating various aspects of the myth.

The inaugural season was in 2013 with the first episode airing on [[Rai 2]] on March 7, 2013. The show is also broadcast via radio on [[Radio Rai]] and [[RTL 102.5]].\n\nIt was hosted by the TV actor Fabio Troiano and the four judges were [[Raffaella Carr\u00e0]], [[Noemi (singer)|Noemi]], [[Piero Pel\u00f9]] and [[Riccardo Cocciante]]. The winner of the series was [[Elhaida Dani]] from Team Cocciante. The program was renewed for a second season with the first episode broadcast on 12 March 2014 with [[Federico Russo (presenter)|Federico Russo]] hosting the show. Three of the judges returned; Carr\u00e0, Pel\u00f9 and Noemi, however Riccardo Cocciante was replaced by [[J-Ax]].\n\n[[Cristina Scuccia|Sister Cristina Scuccia]] triumphed in the 2014 final for Team J-Ax. The nun, Suor Cristina Scuccia, recited the prayer 'Our Father' on stage after winning. On the third season, [[Raffaella Carr\u00e0]] was replaced by [[Roby Facchinetti|Roby]] and [[Francesco Facchinetti]] as judge, while Fabio Curto was the winner.\n\n== Format ==\nOne of the important premises of the show is the quality of the singing talent. Four coaches, themselves popular performing artists, train the talents in their group and occasionally perform with them. Talents are selected in blind auditions, where the coaches cannot see, but only hear the auditioner.\n\nThe series consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase and live performance shows. Four judges/coaches, all noteworthy recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each judge has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute) to decide if he or she wants that singer on his or her team; if two or more judges want the same singer (as happens frequently), the singer has the final choice of coach.\n\nEach team of singers is mentored and developed by its respective coach. In the second stage, called the battle phase, coaches have two of their team members battle against each other directly by singing the same song together, with the coach choosing which team member to advance from each of four individual \"battles\" into the first live round. Within that first live round, the surviving acts from each team again compete head-to-head, with a combination of public and jury vote deciding who advances onto the next round.\nIn the final phase, the remaining contestants (top 8) compete against each other in live broadcasts. The television audience and the coaches have equal say 50/50 in deciding who moves on to the final 4 phase. With one team member remaining for each coach, the (final 4) contestants compete against each other in the final with the outcome decided solely by the public vote.\n\n==Coaches and hosts==\n=== Coaches ===\nThe four positions in the coaching panel is covered by four singers who are part of the Italian music scene. The original panel consisted of Litfiba singer [[Piero Pel\u00f9]], Italian music icons [[Raffaella Carr\u00e0]] and [[Riccardo Cocciante]] and ex-''[[X Factor (Italian TV series)|The X Factor]]'' contestant [[Noemi (singer)|Noemi]]. After winning as coach in the first season, Cocciante left the show and in the second season and was replaced by rapper [[J-Ax]], former singer of [[Articolo 31]], who was also triumphant at the end of the season with his winner, [[Cristina Scuccia]]. In the third season, Raffaella Carr\u00e0 left the program and her position was filled by the father-and-son duo [[Roby Facchinetti|Roby]] and [[Francesco Facchinetti]], the first-ever duo coach on the show. The fourth season saw the return of Carr\u00e0 and the arrival of three new coaches: rapper [[Emis Killa]], former 883 singer [[Max Pezzali]] and singer-songwriter [[Dolcenera]]. At the end of the fourth season, Carr\u00e0 announced that she was leaving the program forever. None of the season four coaches returned for the next season. In November 2017, [[Al Bano]] announced his retirement as well as his new role as a coach on the fifth season.<ref>https://www.sorrisi.com/musica/news/al-bano-nel-2018-mi-ritiro-ma-prima-faccio-voice/</ref> [[Francesco Renga]] and [[Cristina Scabbia]] were also confirmed as coaches for season five, along with returning coach J-Ax.

The inaugural season was in 2013 with the first episode airing on [[Rai 2]] on March 7, 2013. The show is also broadcast via radio on [[Radio Rai]] and [[RTL 102.5]].\n\nIt was hosted by the TV actor Fabio Troiano and the four judges were [[Raffaella Carr\u00e0]], [[Noemi (singer)|Noemi]], [[Piero Pel\u00f9]] and [[Riccardo Cocciante]]. The winner of the series was [[Elhaida Dani]] from Team Cocciante. The program was renewed for a second season with the first episode broadcast on 12 March 2014 with [[Federico Russo (presenter)|Federico Russo]] hosting the show. Three of the judges returned; Carr\u00e0, Pel\u00f9 and Noemi, however Riccardo Cocciante was replaced by [[J-Ax]].\n\n[[Cristina Scuccia|Sister Cristina Scuccia]] triumphed in the 2014 final for Team J-Ax. The nun, Suor Cristina Scuccia, recited the prayer 'Our Father' on stage after winning. On the third season, [[Raffaella Carr\u00e0]] was replaced by [[Roby Facchinetti|Roby]] and [[Francesco Facchinetti]] as judge, while Fabio Curto was the winner.\n\n== Format ==\nOne of the important premises of the show is the quality of the singing talent. Four coaches, themselves popular performing artists, train the talents in their group and occasionally perform with them. Talents are selected in blind auditions, where the coaches cannot see, but only hear the auditioner.\n\nThe series consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase and live performance shows. Four judges/coaches, all noteworthy recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each judge has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute) to decide if he or she wants that singer on his or her team; if two or more judges want the same singer (as happens frequently), the singer has the final choice of coach.\n\nEach team of singers is mentored and developed by its respective coach. In the second stage, called the battle phase, coaches have two of their team members battle against each other directly by singing the same song together, with the coach choosing which team member to advance from each of four individual \"battles\" into the first live round. Within that first live round, the surviving acts from each team again compete head-to-head, with a combination of public and jury vote deciding who advances onto the next round.\nIn the final phase, the remaining contestants (top 8) compete against each other in live broadcasts. The television audience and the coaches have equal say 50/50 in deciding who moves on to the final 4 phase. With one team member remaining for each coach, the (final 4) contestants compete against each other in the final with the outcome decided solely by the public vote.\n\n==Coaches and hosts==\n=== Coaches ===\nThe four positions in the coaching panel is covered by four singers who are part of the Italian music scene. The original panel consisted of Litfiba singer [[Piero Pel\u00f9]], Italian music icons [[Raffaella Carr\u00e0]] and [[Riccardo Cocciante]] and ex-''[[X Factor (Italian TV series)|The X Factor]]'' contestant [[Noemi (singer)|Noemi]]. After winning as coach in the first season, Cocciante left the show and in the second season and was replaced by rapper [[J-Ax]], former singer of [[Articolo 31]], who was also triumphant at the end of the season with his winner, [[Cristina Scuccia]]. In the third season, Raffaella Carr\u00e0 left the program and her position was filled by the father-and-son duo [[Roby Facchinetti|Roby]] and [[Francesco Facchinetti]], the first-ever duo coach on the show. The fourth season saw the return of Carr\u00e0 and the arrival of three new coaches: rapper [[Emis Killa]], former 883 singer [[Max Pezzali]] and singer-songwriter [[Dolcenera]]. At the end of the fourth season, Carr\u00e0 announced that she was leaving the program forever. None of the season four coaches returned for the next season. In November 2017, [[Al Bano]] announced his retirement as well as his new role as a coach on the fifth season.<ref>https://www.sorrisi.com/musica/news/al-bano-nel-2018-mi-ritiro-ma-prima-faccio-voice/</ref> [[Francesco Renga]] and [[Cristina Scabbia]] were also confirmed as coaches for season five, along with returning coach J-Ax.

{"title_page": "Manfred Kelkel", "text_new": "'''Manfred Kelkel''' (15 January 1929 in {{ill|Siersburg|de}} in [[Saarland]], then under [[Territory of the Saar Basin|French occupation]]<ref>{{harvsp|Jean-Jacques Velly, Pr\u00e9face|2001|p=6}}</ref> \u2013 18 April 1999 in Paris) was a 20th-century French [[musicologist]] and [[composer]] of [[contemporary music]].\n\nA pupil of [[Darius Milhaud]] at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], he got interested in the music of Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]], whose latest works (from ''[[Prometheus: The Poem of Fire]] to [[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'') influenced his own compositions. His work on Scriabin and a certain [[Esoterism|esoteric]] aesthetic of music are authoritative.\n\n=== Studies and publications ===\nAs a student of Darius Milhaud at the Conservatoire de Paris, Manfred Kelkel \"always felt a sincere admiration and almost filial recognition for his former teacher, even if, aesthetically speaking, he followed a divergent path.\"<ref name=JJV8>{{harvsp|Jean-Jacques Velly, Preface|2001|p=8}}</ref>.\n\nFrom 1969 onwards, the composer resumed his university studies, obtaining a doctoral degree and a State doctorate of music and musicology, \"with works that have since become authoritative in their fields\",<ref name=JJV7>{{harvsp|Jean-Jacques Velly, Pr\u00e9face|2001|p=7}}</ref> from his study ''\u00c0 la recherche de la musique polyn\u00e9sienne traditionnelle'', in [[ethnomusicology]], to State doctorate on [[Opera|lyrical music]] at the beginning of the 20th century (''Naturalisme, v\u00e9risme et r\u00e9alisme dans l'op\u00e9ra''). His postgraduate thesis, dedicated to the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (''Scriabine, sa vie, l'\u00e9sot\u00e9risme et le langage musical dans son \u0153uvre''), is a defining moment in his career.<ref name=JJV7/>\n\nIn his memories, [[Jacques Viret]] evokes a man \"of perfect simplicity, modesty and affability\", making him meet [[Marina Scriabin]], daughter of the composer of the ''[[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]]'', of which the ''Acte pr\u00e9alable'' presents a [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone tuning]] which carried him with enthusiasm.<ref name=JV252>{{harvsp|Jacques Viret|2001|p=252}}</ref>\n\nAmong the many publications by Manfred Kelkel, Jean-Jacques Velly mainly retains the book ''Musique des mondes'', published in 1988, \"a unique work of its kind which synthesizes his two activities as a composer and musicologist.\"<ref>{{harvsp|Jean-Jacques Velly, Pr\u00e9face|2001|p=7-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Teaching ===\nManfred Kelkel has held a number of important positions in music publishing and higher education.

Hearing of this, Paolo rescues Santino ''(who is fleeing from the radicals)'' and makes him stay in a secluded countryside villa he rented for his tenure in Bagong Pag-asa. There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries. In the remains of the chapel, he managed to save a baby which died when he thought Jesus would help it. He threw away his habit and abandoned his vocation in despair. At the monastery, the monks and Mario collaborate with each other to find Santino.\n\n*[[Ryan Agoncillo]] as Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor - A journalist and CBN News Reporter who visits Bagong Pag-asa after hearing about the news of Rico's encounter with \"Bro\". He was a former missionary who abandoned his vocation and lost his faith in Christ.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Eight: Amen===\nPaolo turns Santino over to Mario and the police chief before going on an errand. As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more. This occurrence brought back Paolo's faith in God, and Santino lives a normal life thereafter. In the end of the series, Paolo gives a narration on what hope for him is and how Santino changed his life, and is now back on his vocation of priesthood after witnessing the miracle.\n\n*[[Charo Santos-Concio]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] - the mother of Bro.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead? Possibly because the production was scrimping on talent fees. Well, it was a penny-wise pound-foolish decision, because the important sequence was botched.\"<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus \"\u2018May Bukas Pa,\u2019 plus and minus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040119/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus|date=20 March 2009}} by Nestor Torre, 16 March 2009.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=9| 2009 || 1st MTRCB TV Awards || Special Award for Promoting Moral Values || {{won}}\n|-\n| Seoul International Drama Awards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|title=Cristine Reyes attends Seoul International Drama Awards; Eva Fonda wins Special Prize|publisher=Telebisyon.net|date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125820/http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref> || Best Drama Series ||{{nom}}\n|-\n| Catholic Mass Media Awards || Best Drama (tied with [[Tayong Dalawa]]) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya New Face (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya TV Show|| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 18th KBP Golden Dove Awards || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Male New TV Personality (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Drama Actor (Albert Martinez) || {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=4|2010 || 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Special Jury Award for Television || {{won}}\n|-\n| 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Natatanging Gawad TANGLAW para sa Sining ng Telebisyon (Zaijan Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[2010 GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards|41st GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=579374&publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=Chiz: Don't extend Pagcor chief's term &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star|publisher=philstar.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> || TV Program of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| TV Directors of the Year (Jojo Saguin and Jerome Pobocan ) || {{won}}\n|}\n\nMay Bukas Pa also received a special award at the 2009 Catholic Mass Media Awards (besides its Best Drama award), given by Cardinal Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales]].

Incidentally, all these good deeds she has to offer have corresponding prices. Apparently, she is a self-professed material girl, and any thing that could bring her cash is basically worth her while. During one of their conversations, Santino tells Mia about the 1-million-peso reward Enrique is giving out in exchange for him and others are also in pursuit of the reward money; and upon learning about this, the young lady couldn\u2019t help but feel the urge of getting her hand on the said bundle of cash. Upon getting her chance, Mia tricks Santino to go with her, alone. At the last minute, Mia changes her mind about bringing Santino back to Bagong Pag-asa.

Jeff is a crippled businessman who owns a popular toy store and is pretty notorious among his employees and customers, most especially in his toy store, as well as his clients and other people for being irate, cruel, and somehow greedy despite being a good man.

In order to return the said favor, Santino then volunteers to help Libay with her sales; and together they go from town to town asking around for directions towards the small town of Bagong Pag-asa.

Upon learning about this said information, Franco instantly claims custody of the said kid; and in order to successfully do so, he tries seeking Mayor Enrique's help. Without hesitation, Enrique gives his full support to Franco's case. He instantly suggests a DNA test; and once the DNA test results prove that Franco is in fact Santino's biological father, the DSWD will then be awarding Santino's custody to him.

However, she was able to escape under the pretense of labor; while being driven, she got the gun of Dante, the policeman driving the vehicle. Rico was resentful of Santino because of their father's death. Santino then felt sad as he believes he's bad luck due to the death of Enrique and the anger of Rico; Father Jose told him that he was not the Santino who was trying to be happy despite the hardships and trials. Meanwhile, Santino was being told by a voice (possibly Satan's) that he should come to it and he was cursed by Bro. He ends up being helped by angels on his way and ends up at a home for the homeless, run by Lola Milgaros, a blind grandmother. Meanwhile, a Filipino-Chinese businessman named Mr. Chan is trying to put into action his plan to take the house and the land where it stands for his business expansion. He constantly tries to take the place but also fails. Santino meets Mr. Chan and discovers his ailing daughter whom he heals. Mr. Chan continues to do his pursuit despite his daughter's recovery and also still doesn't believe in God.

And to his delight, he alone gets his hands on the most sensational news there is, Rico's exclusive encounters with his so-called Bro ''(later revealed as Satan)''. Though a non-believer of such events, Paulo pursues this rather controversial issue for his show's sake. Santino has now returned to Bagong Pag-asa, but his former petty argument with Rico turns out to be a completely heated dispute. Apparently, Santino tries relaying Bro's real message to Rico, which instantly infuriates the latter. Given the rather controversial situation, Paulo then gets another angle for a truly sensational scoop. And to his surprise, the tension is further heightened up by Tilde's hired con-artist. This results in an accident which endangered Stella's life; but fortunately, Santino is around to save her. Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms. After the commotion in Bagong Pgag-asa Jail ended in a miracle, a group of radicals led by Tilde's con-artist try to get Santino to perform more miracles so they may believe. Their actions however compromise Santino's safety and eventually puts his life in danger. Hearing of this, Paolo rescues Santino ''(who is fleeing from the radicals)'' and makes him stay in a secluded countryside villa he rented for his tenure in Bagong Pag-asa. There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries. In the remains of the chapel, he managed to save a baby which died when he thought Jesus would help it. He threw away his habit and abandoned his vocation in despair. At the monastery, the monks and Mario collaborate with each other to find Santino.\n\n*[[Ryan Agoncillo]] as Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor - A journalist and CBN News Reporter who visits Bagong Pag-asa after hearing about the news of Rico's encounter with \"Bro\".

As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more. This occurrence brought back Paolo's faith in God, and Santino lives a normal life thereafter. In the end of the series, Paolo gives a narration on what hope for him is and how Santino changed his life, and is now back on his vocation of priesthood after witnessing the miracle.\n\n*[[Charo Santos-Concio]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] - the mother of Bro.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead? Possibly because the production was scrimping on talent fees. Well, it was a penny-wise pound-foolish decision, because the important sequence was botched.\"<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus \"\u2018May Bukas Pa,\u2019 plus and minus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040119/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus|date=20 March 2009}} by Nestor Torre, 16 March 2009.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=9| 2009 || 1st MTRCB TV Awards || Special Award for Promoting Moral Values || {{won}}\n|-\n| Seoul International Drama Awards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|title=Cristine Reyes attends Seoul International Drama Awards; Eva Fonda wins Special Prize|publisher=Telebisyon.net|date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125820/http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref> || Best Drama Series ||{{nom}}\n|-\n| Catholic Mass Media Awards || Best Drama (tied with [[Tayong Dalawa]]) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya New Face (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya TV Show|| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 18th KBP Golden Dove Awards || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Male New TV Personality (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Drama Actor (Albert Martinez) || {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=4|2010 || 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Special Jury Award for Television || {{won}}\n|-\n| 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Natatanging Gawad TANGLAW para sa Sining ng Telebisyon (Zaijan Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[2010 GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards|41st GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=579374&publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=Chiz: Don't extend Pagcor chief's term &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star|publisher=philstar.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> || TV Program of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| TV Directors of the Year (Jojo Saguin and Jerome Pobocan ) || {{won}}\n|}\n\nMay Bukas Pa also received a special award at the 2009 Catholic Mass Media Awards (besides its Best Drama award), given by Cardinal Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales]].

Meanwhile, Jaime has a first family residing in Australia and leaves Irene and their child, Mico (Miguel Vergara), behind, forcing her to raise the boy on her own.\n\nFive years later, Irene moves on and reconnects with her high school sweetheart, Natoy ([[Zanjoe Marudo]]). The two get married, but fail to conceive a child after many attempts. On the other hand, Natoy's family could not accept Irene because she has a child from her previous relationship. One day, Irene and Natoy consulted a doctor because she began showing signs of pregnancy. At first, the doctor declared that Irene was pregnant, but on the second ultrasound, the doctor found out that the baby did not have a heartbeat anymore, as Irene had a [[miscarriage]].\n\nMeanwhile, Jaime returned to Irene at a party that Irene organized for Conching ([[Vivian Velez]]). Then, the friends of Conching took a group picture but after they have taken a look at it, they saw Jaime hugging Irene whom they mislead as the third party. Conching then showed Natoy the photo, urging him to follow Irene. After she followed Irene, he saw Jaime holding Irene's hand. After what he saw, he went to Clara ([[Isabelle Daza]]) drunk and because of what he saw on Irene and Jaime, he accidentally gets Clara pregnant.\n\nIrene then saw Clara and Natoy at an apartment that Natoy bought for Clara because her father was always hurting her. Natoy then told Irene the truth that he and Clara will be having a child. When Irene's father, Domeng ([[Lito Pimentel]]) and Tope (Marco Gumabao) knew about Natoy's unfaithfulness, he immediately went to Natoy's house to confront because of lying to Irene. But while Domeng is hitting Natoy, Conching had a [[heart attack]] causing her to die. Lucy ([[Dionne Monsanto]]), Conching's middle child, wants justice for what happened to her mom and files cases against Tope and Domeng. Tope is free from prison because it was proven that he was there to stop Domeng from confronting Natoy.\n\nAt the court trial about cases filed against Domeng, Lucy's testimonies were first, but Lucy lied about the case. She said that Domeng hit Natoy and Conching that caused Conching's heart attack. On the second day of court, Natoy testifies for Irene saying that he was only the one that Domeng attacked, that he did not touch Conching. Irene has finally forgiven Natoy for what he did. On the other hand, Clara boasts the baby to Irene, and she always says that wedding papers are the only reason why Natoy is still with her.\n\n=== Season 2 === \nOne night, Natoy made a plan on a resort to surprise Irene on her birthday and have a vacation. Meanwhile, Clara followed them to ruin Irene's birthday. One night on the resort, Clara put something on Natoy's drink to make him go to sleep. Clara then starts kissing Natoy with her cellphone filming them, Natoy is now half-awake and thinks that Clara is Irene. Emma ([[Ingrid dela Paz]]) went to Clara's room to visit Baby Nathan (Clara's Child) but instead of seeing Nathan, she saw Natoy and Clara kissing each other lying on the sofa. When Natoy was totally awake, he saw Clara and immediately pushed her away.\nAfter that, Natoy and Irene are trying their hardest to conceive a baby. Irene set an appointment to a doctor for conceiving a baby, and Clara offered help to Irene to go with her to the hospital, but Irene passed out in the hospital. Clara called Natoy and Jaime, so Jaime went to Irene bringing a ''[[pampatulog]]'', but Irene woke up before Jaime put it in her nose, and Natoy heard Irene shouting help. Causing Irene to file a [[restraining order]] against Jaime.\nClara is pregnant again and she is saying that Natoy is the father of the baby, Clara also forced Emma to tell Irene that she saw them because Clara knew that Emma was the one who saw them. Emma told Irene the truth of how she saw Clara and Natoy at the resort and that she is sure that something happened to them, causing Irene to be mad at Natoy for the second time and would test their love for each other. Irene then decides to break up with Natoy, saying that she loves Natoy, but love is not enough. Clara, on the other hand, is happy because of the success of her plans.\n\nAfter the break up, Irene discovered that she is pregnant with Natoy's baby. But Irene chose not to tell Natoy about the baby, because she would rather be a single mom than tell Natoy about the baby when her heart is full of madness and pain. Natoy on the other hand, has problem about his business ''Villadolid seafoods'' because of his Aunt Mira (Jean Saburit). Aunt Mira offered help about the shrimp in the business but did not do her job well by mixing unhealthy shrimp and healthy ones that caused healthy shrimp to die and almost caused Natoy's business to fail.\n\nNatoy still did not believe Clara that he is the father of Clara's baby, making him to do the paternity test. The result of the doctor's test shocked Natoy because it turns out that he really is the father of Clara's child, making Irene mad at Natoy, causing her to cut her ties with him. But the day before the paternity test, Jaime had tampered the results by changing the name of the ''alleged'' father from Jaime Agoncillo to Natoy Villadolid, making it look like that Natoy is really the father of Clara's baby.\n\nJaime, gives the tampered results to Irene. That makes Irene very mad and want to go to Natoy angry. Meanwhile, Josie (Ynez Veneracion), Irene's biological mother, followed her and got hit by a car because of Irene. After that, Jaime accompanied Becca to send her to the hospital to go to Irene. Natoy then followed Jaime and discovered that Irene is pregnant, but Irene does not want Natoy to come back to her.\n\nLucy, on the other hand, wants her mom's wealth because Conching gave it all to Clara. Lucy then tries to tamper her mom's last will and testament, but instead of getting the wealth and everything that Conching gave to Clara, the court decided that Lucy has no rights to get her mom's wealth because she was just adopted by Conching.\n\nNatoy then discovered that Jaime is wanted in Australia for the offense of killing his first wife, Nancy ([[Antoinette Taus]]) and for borrowing money from his friends without returning it. He killed Nancy for the sake of returning to Irene. He then brought Irene to an abandoned restaurant and proposed to her. Irene went with Jaime because she thought that it was a client meeting instead of a proposal. But Irene did not accept the proposal and pushed him away. Until Natoy and the police saw them, Jaime, brought Irene in the kitchen of the restaurant to escape from the police, but Irene escaped from Jaime and so as Jaime escaped from the police.\n\nJaime, convinces Lucy to help him meet with Mico. Lucy agrees to help him with his plan, but a tragic accident happened - Natoy saved Mico from getting hit by a motorcycle, which was planned by Clara's father. Natoy was brought to the hospital but still has no consciousness. He is currently in a coma. Meanwhile, Lucy still works against Clara to get the [[will and testament]] of her mom. Emma then helps Lucy because she was the only one who got legal rights. After that, Clara was finally evicted again from the Villadolid house.\n\nJaime, on the other hand, is now sorry for his sins against Natoy and Irene. One night, Jaime told Clara to meet in front of Irene's house to tell the truth that Natoy is not the biological father of Clara's second baby, but Clara realizes that it was Jaime's plan to tell the truth, and when they were in front of Irene's house, Clara gets a bottle and breaks it to stab Jaime. But Jaime still managed to tell the truth to Irene even in his last breath.\n\nClara is now wanted for the offense of [[homicide]] because of killing Jaime. Irene and Lucy now made a scene because of Clara, she killed Jaime and she still even managed to go to his wake. Clara then denies the sin that she made of killing Jaime. She also denied that Jaime is the father of her second baby even though the truth was completely spoiled that Natoy is not the father but Jaime. Reybong ([[Archie Alemania]]) now calls the police to catch Clara before she can escape again. After Jaime's funeral, the ''Villadolids'' and the ''Magdangals'' go to the court for a hearing about their case against Clara. Later that, Clara was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. Mira then received the DNA test that she made about her child. It turns out that Lucy is her child, but Lucy cannot accept Mira as her mother. Irene then gives birth, when Clara mourns for the loss of her child because of a war in prison. Nestor, Clara's father, helps Clara to escape from prison. After that, he teaches Clara how to use a gun for her revenge on Irene and the Villadolid family.\n\nNestor then went to the mansion of the Villadolid to win Nathan back and attacked Lucy and Irene's car in exchange for Nathan. But Lucy was the one who was abducted because she got out of the car because the car windows were tinted, and they could not see Irene and Lucy inside, so Lucy got out of the car thinking of Irene's safety. But hours after Lucy was abducted, she managed to escape from Clara, Nestor and Jun. Mira and Natoy then find Lucy, and Mira finally gained the forgiveness that she is longing from her child, Lucy.\n\nAfterwards, Clara threatened Natoy that she would shoot Irene, Mico or Natoy's new child, Emily. He quickly went to Clara with the police to protect his family. After, Natoy and the police went to the hideout of Nestor, Clara and Jun. Jun offered that he will distract the police, and he will escape. But when he tried to escape, he was shot by the police, causing his death, which angers Clara greatly to plan revenge on Natoy and Irene.\n\n=== Season 3 === \nClara and Nestor are the only ones who are left now that Jun is gone. One night, they prepared a party for Domeng's birthday. But unknown to them, there is a danger that is waiting for them. Clara and Nestor spilled gas all over the house for them to get Nathan. Nestor then let the house explode with Nathan inside. Everyone in the house was safe, but Clara and Nestor still did not stop their evil plans.\n\nNestor went to the hospital, where Natoy and Irene's family are being treated, to get Nathan. But Natoy saw him and ran after him, so as the police. Natoy caught Nestor, and they fought until Nestor was placed inside a machine where he got squeezed and later died.\n\nThe Villadolid family decided to transfer to a safer place where Clara could not find them. Natoy and Irene together with their child Emily went first to the new house. But when Natoy decided to buy food and drinks, he did not notice that Clara is spying on them, and so as Natoy was buying food, Clara entered the car and immediately abducted Irene. Clara brought Irene to where did Natoy and Clara first met. She is unstoppable in killing Irene and Emily, so that Natoy will only love her and Nathan. Natoy saw Irene lying on the ground with Clara pointing a gun on her. Until she saw Natoy's love for Irene and had her conscience and decided to kill herself instead. But Irene and Natoy stopped her from doing that because she has a child. Clara then surrendered to the police.\n\nNatoy asked Irene to marry him again as a sign of a new start now that there are no more worries about Clara or Nestor. They married each other again, and they lived happily ever after.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<!--\nPlease do not add actors/actresses who are not part of the 'Tubig at Langis' show.

[[Vivian Velez]] resigned from the series due to difficulties working with [[Cristine Reyes]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{long plot|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Season 1 === \n<!--please take note that their might be typo(s) in here, kindly fix it if you happen to find one-->\n''Tubig at Langis'' begins with Irene ([[Cristine Reyes]]), a good and responsible daughter, being made pregnant by Jaime ([[Victor Silayan]]). Meanwhile, Jaime has a first family residing in Australia and leaves Irene and their child, Mico (Miguel Vergara), behind, forcing her to raise the boy on her own.\n\nFive years later, Irene moves on and reconnects with her high school sweetheart, Natoy ([[Zanjoe Marudo]]). The two get married, but fail to conceive a child after many attempts. On the other hand, Natoy's family could not accept Irene because she has a child from her previous relationship. One day, Irene and Natoy consulted a doctor because she began showing signs of pregnancy. At first, the doctor declared that Irene was pregnant, but on the second ultrasound, the doctor found out that the baby did not have a heartbeat anymore, as Irene had a [[miscarriage]].\n\nMeanwhile, Jaime returned to Irene at a party that Irene organized for Conching ([[Vivian Velez]]). Then, the friends of Conching took a group picture but after they have taken a look at it, they saw Jaime hugging Irene whom they mislead as the third party. Conching then showed Natoy the photo, urging him to follow Irene. After she followed Irene, he saw Jaime holding Irene's hand. After what he saw, he went to Clara ([[Isabelle Daza]]) drunk and because of what he saw on Irene and Jaime, he accidentally gets Clara pregnant.\n\nIrene then saw Clara and Natoy at an apartment that Natoy bought for Clara because her father was always hurting her. Natoy then told Irene the truth that he and Clara will be having a child. When Irene's father, Domeng ([[Lito Pimentel]]) and Tope (Marco Gumabao) knew about Natoy's unfaithfulness, he immediately went to Natoy's house to confront because of lying to Irene. But while Domeng is hitting Natoy, Conching had a [[heart attack]] causing her to die. Lucy ([[Dionne Monsanto]]), Conching's middle child, wants justice for what happened to her mom and files cases against Tope and Domeng. Tope is free from prison because it was proven that he was there to stop Domeng from confronting Natoy.\n\nAt the court trial about cases filed against Domeng, Lucy's testimonies were first, but Lucy lied about the case. She said that Domeng hit Natoy and Conching that caused Conching's heart attack. On the second day of court, Natoy testifies for Irene saying that he was only the one that Domeng attacked, that he did not touch Conching. Irene has finally forgiven Natoy for what he did. On the other hand, Clara boasts the baby to Irene, and she always says that wedding papers are the only reason why Natoy is still with her.\n\n=== Season 2 === \nOne night, Natoy made a plan on a resort to surprise Irene on her birthday and have a vacation. Meanwhile, Clara followed them to ruin Irene's birthday. One night on the resort, Clara put something on Natoy's drink to make him go to sleep. Clara then starts kissing Natoy with her cellphone filming them, Natoy is now half-awake and thinks that Clara is Irene. Emma ([[Ingrid dela Paz]]) went to Clara's room to visit Baby Nathan (Clara's Child) but instead of seeing Nathan, she saw Natoy and Clara kissing each other lying on the sofa. When Natoy was totally awake, he saw Clara and immediately pushed her away.\nAfter that, Natoy and Irene are trying their hardest to conceive a baby. Irene set an appointment to a doctor for conceiving a baby, and Clara offered help to Irene to go with her to the hospital, but Irene passed out in the hospital. Clara called Natoy and Jaime, so Jaime went to Irene bringing a ''[[pampatulog]]'', but Irene woke up before Jaime put it in her nose, and Natoy heard Irene shouting help. Causing Irene to file a [[restraining order]] against Jaime.\nClara is pregnant again and she is saying that Natoy is the father of the baby, Clara also forced Emma to tell Irene that she saw them because Clara knew that Emma was the one who saw them. Emma told Irene the truth of how she saw Clara and Natoy at the resort and that she is sure that something happened to them, causing Irene to be mad at Natoy for the second time and would test their love for each other. Irene then decides to break up with Natoy, saying that she loves Natoy, but love is not enough. Clara, on the other hand, is happy because of the success of her plans.\n\nAfter the break up, Irene discovered that she is pregnant with Natoy's baby. But Irene chose not to tell Natoy about the baby, because she would rather be a single mom than tell Natoy about the baby when her heart is full of madness and pain. Natoy on the other hand, has problem about his business ''Villadolid seafoods'' because of his Aunt Mira (Jean Saburit). Aunt Mira offered help about the shrimp in the business but did not do her job well by mixing unhealthy shrimp and healthy ones that caused healthy shrimp to die and almost caused Natoy's business to fail.\n\nNatoy still did not believe Clara that he is the father of Clara's baby, making him to do the paternity test. The result of the doctor's test shocked Natoy because it turns out that he really is the father of Clara's child, making Irene mad at Natoy, causing her to cut her ties with him. But the day before the paternity test, Jaime had tampered the results by changing the name of the ''alleged'' father from Jaime Agoncillo to Natoy Villadolid, making it look like that Natoy is really the father of Clara's baby.\n\nJaime, gives the tampered results to Irene. That makes Irene very mad and want to go to Natoy angry. Meanwhile, Josie (Ynez Veneracion), Irene's biological mother, followed her and got hit by a car because of Irene. After that, Jaime accompanied Becca to send her to the hospital to go to Irene. Natoy then followed Jaime and discovered that Irene is pregnant, but Irene does not want Natoy to come back to her.\n\nLucy, on the other hand, wants her mom's wealth because Conching gave it all to Clara. Lucy then tries to tamper her mom's last will and testament, but instead of getting the wealth and everything that Conching gave to Clara, the court decided that Lucy has no rights to get her mom's wealth because she was just adopted by Conching.\n\nNatoy then discovered that Jaime is wanted in Australia for the offense of killing his first wife, Nancy ([[Antoinette Taus]]) and for borrowing money from his friends without returning it. He killed Nancy for the sake of returning to Irene. He then brought Irene to an abandoned restaurant and proposed to her. Irene went with Jaime because she thought that it was a client meeting instead of a proposal. But Irene did not accept the proposal and pushed him away. Until Natoy and the police saw them, Jaime, brought Irene in the kitchen of the restaurant to escape from the police, but Irene escaped from Jaime and so as Jaime escaped from the police.\n\nJaime, convinces Lucy to help him meet with Mico. Lucy agrees to help him with his plan, but a tragic accident happened - Natoy saved Mico from getting hit by a motorcycle, which was planned by Clara's father. Natoy was brought to the hospital but still has no consciousness. He is currently in a coma. Meanwhile, Lucy still works against Clara to get the [[will and testament]] of her mom. Emma then helps Lucy because she was the only one who got legal rights. After that, Clara was finally evicted again from the Villadolid house.\n\nJaime, on the other hand, is now sorry for his sins against Natoy and Irene. One night, Jaime told Clara to meet in front of Irene's house to tell the truth that Natoy is not the biological father of Clara's second baby, but Clara realizes that it was Jaime's plan to tell the truth, and when they were in front of Irene's house, Clara gets a bottle and breaks it to stab Jaime. But Jaime still managed to tell the truth to Irene even in his last breath.\n\nClara is now wanted for the offense of [[homicide]] because of killing Jaime. Irene and Lucy now made a scene because of Clara, she killed Jaime and she still even managed to go to his wake. Clara then denies the sin that she made of killing Jaime. She also denied that Jaime is the father of her second baby even though the truth was completely spoiled that Natoy is not the father but Jaime. Reybong ([[Archie Alemania]]) now calls the police to catch Clara before she can escape again. After Jaime's funeral, the ''Villadolids'' and the ''Magdangals'' go to the court for a hearing about their case against Clara. Later that, Clara was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. Mira then received the DNA test that she made about her child. It turns out that Lucy is her child, but Lucy cannot accept Mira as her mother. Irene then gives birth, when Clara mourns for the loss of her child because of a war in prison. Nestor, Clara's father, helps Clara to escape from prison. After that, he teaches Clara how to use a gun for her revenge on Irene and the Villadolid family.\n\nNestor then went to the mansion of the Villadolid to win Nathan back and attacked Lucy and Irene's car in exchange for Nathan. But Lucy was the one who was abducted because she got out of the car because the car windows were tinted, and they could not see Irene and Lucy inside, so Lucy got out of the car thinking of Irene's safety. But hours after Lucy was abducted, she managed to escape from Clara, Nestor and Jun. Mira and Natoy then find Lucy, and Mira finally gained the forgiveness that she is longing from her child, Lucy.\n\nAfterwards, Clara threatened Natoy that she would shoot Irene, Mico or Natoy's new child, Emily. He quickly went to Clara with the police to protect his family. After, Natoy and the police went to the hideout of Nestor, Clara and Jun. Jun offered that he will distract the police, and he will escape. But when he tried to escape, he was shot by the police, causing his death, which angers Clara greatly to plan revenge on Natoy and Irene.\n\n=== Season 3 === \nClara and Nestor are the only ones who are left now that Jun is gone. One night, they prepared a party for Domeng's birthday. But unknown to them, there is a danger that is waiting for them. Clara and Nestor spilled gas all over the house for them to get Nathan. Nestor then let the house explode with Nathan inside. Everyone in the house was safe, but Clara and Nestor still did not stop their evil plans.\n\nNestor went to the hospital, where Natoy and Irene's family are being treated, to get Nathan. But Natoy saw him and ran after him, so as the police. Natoy caught Nestor, and they fought until Nestor was placed inside a machine where he got squeezed and later died.\n\nThe Villadolid family decided to transfer to a safer place where Clara could not find them. Natoy and Irene together with their child Emily went first to the new house. But when Natoy decided to buy food and drinks, he did not notice that Clara is spying on them, and so as Natoy was buying food, Clara entered the car and immediately abducted Irene. Clara brought Irene to where did Natoy and Clara first met. She is unstoppable in killing Irene and Emily, so that Natoy will only love her and Nathan. Natoy saw Irene lying on the ground with Clara pointing a gun on her. Until she saw Natoy's love for Irene and had her conscience and decided to kill herself instead. But Irene and Natoy stopped her from doing that because she has a child.

[[Robin Padilla]] was the first choice of ABS-CBN for the role \"Noah\" with [[Claudine Barretto]] as \"Lyka\". [[Kristine Hermosa]] and [[Bea Alonzo]] were also considered but these pairings was scrapped when Padilla transferred to [[GMA Network|GMA-7]]. In early 2007, [[John Lloyd Cruz]] and [[Anne Curtis]] were also offered the lead roles but turned them down due to a prior commitment to return to their roles for the sequel to the television drama ''[[Maging Sino Ka Man]]''. The show finally began formal preparations, training, and filming with the transfer of [[Angel Locsin]] to [[ABS-CBN]]. The management decided to pair her with [[Piolo Pascual]]. [[Heart Evangelista]] was also offered \"Gabriella\"'s role now played by [[Shaina Magdayao]]. The choice of the dog who portrays Lyka's white wolf alter-ego brought about ABS-CBN's decision to buy a purebred dog named Brasca all the way from France costing P200,000.\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe plot revolves around young lovers Lyka Raymundo (played by Angel Locsin) and Noah Ortega (played by Piolo Pascual). Lyka is a young woman aspiring to be a fashion designer, working as a fashion assistant in the House of Elle. She lives with her aunt Clara and her step cousin Anton.\n\nNoah is the adopted son of General Leon Cristobal, who took over guardianship of Noah after his real father, Emil Ortega, died in a tragic accident involving an unknown wolf. Noah is a second lieutenant of the Philippine Army, being actively recruited to join the Luna force, an elite team specializing in protecting humans from dangerous werewolves and vampires.\n\nLyka's position as fashion assistant to Lady Elle is foreshadowed by the fact that she is a werewolf who hasn't transformed yet, who doesn't know she is one because her werewolf mother abandoned her as a child.  Her mother is Vanessa Blancaflor Raymundo, daughter of Lorenzo Blancaflor, the twin brother of Eleanor Blancaflor (played by Pilar Pilapil), owner of the fashion house icon, House of Elle.  Secretly, the Blancaflors are a powerful werewolf clan who led the Waya Council for generations.  Destiny brought Lyka to the seat of the Wayas.\n\nLyka is believed to be the last hope, the \u201cHuling Bantay\u201d (\u201cLast hope/Last Guardian\u201d) of her fellow Werewolves.  Lady Elle instantly sensed her presence at a chance encounter, and immediately hired Lyka to work directly with her team so she could closely watch over her and help her through her transformation, which she believed would occur sometime or after her 21st birthday.\n\nAt about the same time when Lyka applied at the House of Elle, the Wayas had been searching for their Huling Bantay who would have the strength and power to save the werewolf population from the deadly rays of the upcoming Red Moon (\u201cPulang Buwan\u201d), a phenomenon that occurred every 500 years, which could potentially purge and destroy all the werewolves.  Only the Last Guardian, the strongest Waya, could save the species by \u201craising the stone of Remus\u201d.  The last \u201cHuling Bantay\u201d was Remus, who kept the talisman for the next Guardian to use.  Lady Elle was certain that Lyka was worthy and strong enough to be their Last Guardian.\n\nIn the House of Elle, Lyka crosses paths with Noah, Lady Elle's bodyguard and driver. Lyka and Noah fall in love, but their relationship is hindered by Noah's deep hatred for werewolves, as he blamed them for killing his father and foster father.  By the time they had fallen deeply in love, Lyka had reached her \u201ctime\u201d - fully accepting her werewolf nature and the bigger responsibility as the Last Guardian.  Despite the many obstacles, Noah and Lyka's love for each other prevailed.  They marry, and together battle and defeat their enemies.\n\nThree other characters create additional conflict: Noah's friend, Gabrielle Dizon (played by Shaina Magdayao), a deep penetration agent tasked to bring Noah over to the Luna Force for the sinister purposes to destroy and rid the country of all werewolves altogether, complicated by the fact that she was in love with Noah and truly cared for him; Anton Rivero, Lyka's step cousin, her protector against his abusive step mother Clara, and obsessively in love with Lyka; and General Silva, a secret rogue werewolf banished by the Wayas, out to seek revenge and destroy the Council.\n\nThere are two opposing groups in the story\u2014the Lunas and the Wayas. The Lunas were organized by the Philippine Army to protect humans against werewolves and vampires, but a small faction led by General Silva, held a personal grudge against the werewolves, aiming to undermine Luna leadership and destroy the entire werewolf population.  Silva had a special interest in Noah, who was recruited not only for his superior skills, but mainly because flowing through his blood was a natural immunity to werewolf bites, a gene inherited from his father.  General Silva, together with Anton, manipulated Noah to join the force to obtain his blood and develop an antidote for the poisonous werewolf bites.\n\nThe other opposing group, the Waya Inc. was led by Lady Elle. Wayas controlled and presided over the affairs of the white werewolves and executed justice over the black werewolves and vampires who preyed on humans. Since the vampires had retreated into hiding, the Waya mostly had to deal with the rogue werewolves, secretly working with the Lunas to provide protection for their species.\n\nAt that time, there were two warring factions among the werewolves that threatened the agreement between the Wayas and the Lunas and disturbed the peace within the population. While the white werewolves respected the human beings in their midst and lived in peace with them, albeit secretly; the black werewolves killed humans, the biggest reason why werewolves were feared. The Wayas controlled and led their species, and imposed justice on werewolves who drank human blood, doing their best to apprehend and kill the black werewolves.\n\nOn the night of the Red Moon, Lyka, who had fully accepted her role as \u201cHuling Bantay\u201d, successfully retrieved the Stone of Remus, narrowly lost her life, and saved her people from the purge.  She exhorts them to co-exist harmoniously with human beings, and to stop the prejudice against the black wolves.  She became their Head Guardian, leading the council for an integrated black and white werewolf population.\n\nLyka later defeats the bigger threat of her stepcousin's metamorphosis into a demon werewolf.  Anton was an accomplished chemist, whose specialty was animal diseases and virus mutations. All his life, he worked towards finding a cure for his werewolf nature, believing that he was infected and did not have an inherited gene.  As a child, he was accidentally bitten by Vanessa, then in werewolf form.  Picked by General Silva to work on the antidote for poisonous werewolf bites, Anton discovered a more potent formulation, a mixture of Lyka's and Noah's blood which he injected into his system, gave him an immunity to werewolf bites, and the ability to heal his wounds quickly.  Using the Stone of Remus which he stole from Lyka, and following instructions from an ancient book General Silva had, he was transformed into a powerful werewolf.  Unfortunately, his distorted love and obsession for Lyka changed his soul and personality, turned him into a formidable enemy, who almost defeated Lyka and Noah in their last battle.\n\nCelebrating their victory, and the peaceful coexistence of humans and werewolves, Lady Elle toasts the pregnancy of Lyka and Noah, showing another foreshadowing of the two sequels, [[Imortal]] and [[La Luna Sangre]].

[[Robin Padilla]] was the first choice of ABS-CBN for the role \"Noah\" with [[Claudine Barretto]] as \"Lyka\". [[Kristine Hermosa]] and [[Bea Alonzo]] were also considered but these pairings was scrapped when Padilla transferred to [[GMA Network|GMA-7]]. In early 2007, [[John Lloyd Cruz]] and [[Anne Curtis]] were also offered the lead roles but turned them down due to a prior commitment to return to their roles for the sequel to the television drama ''[[Maging Sino Ka Man]]''. The show finally began formal preparations, training, and filming with the transfer of [[Angel Locsin]] to [[ABS-CBN]]. The management decided to pair her with [[Piolo Pascual]]. [[Heart Evangelista]] was also offered \"Gabriella\"'s role now played by [[Shaina Magdayao]]. The choice of the dog who portrays Lyka's white wolf alter-ego brought about ABS-CBN's decision to buy a purebred dog named Brasca all the way from France costing P200,000.\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe plot revolves around young lovers Lyka Raymundo (played by Angel Locsin) and Noah Ortega (played by Piolo Pascual). Lyka is a young woman aspiring to be a fashion designer, working as a fashion assistant in the House of Elle. She lives with her aunt Clara and her step cousin Anton.\n\nNoah is the adopted son of General Leon Cristobal, who took over guardianship of Noah after his real father, Emil Ortega, died in a tragic accident involving an unknown wolf. Noah is a second lieutenant of the Philippine Army, being actively recruited to join the Luna force, an elite team specializing in protecting humans from dangerous werewolves and vampires.\n\nLyka's position as fashion assistant to Lady Elle is foreshadowed by the fact that she is a werewolf who hasn't transformed yet, who doesn't know she is one because her werewolf mother abandoned her as a child.  Her mother is Vanessa Blancaflor Raymundo, daughter of Lorenzo Blancaflor, the twin brother of Eleanor Blancaflor (played by Pilar Pilapil), owner of the fashion house icon, House of Elle.  Secretly, the Blancaflors are a powerful werewolf clan who led the Waya Council for generations.  Destiny brought Lyka to the seat of the Wayas.\n\nLyka is believed to be the last hope, the \u201cHuling Bantay\u201d (\u201cLast hope/Last Guardian\u201d) of her fellow Werewolves.  Lady Elle instantly sensed her presence at a chance encounter, and immediately hired Lyka to work directly with her team so she could closely watch over her and help her through her transformation, which she believed would occur sometime or after her 21st birthday.\n\nAt about the same time when Lyka applied at the House of Elle, the Wayas had been searching for their Huling Bantay who would have the strength and power to save the werewolf population from the deadly rays of the upcoming Red Moon (\u201cPulang Buwan\u201d), a phenomenon that occurred every 500 years, which could potentially purge and destroy all the werewolves.  Only the Last Guardian, the strongest Waya, could save the species by \u201craising the stone of Remus\u201d.  The last \u201cHuling Bantay\u201d was Remus, who kept the talisman for the next Guardian to use.  Lady Elle was certain that Lyka was worthy and strong enough to be their Last Guardian.\n\nIn the House of Elle, Lyka crosses paths with Noah, Lady Elle's bodyguard and driver. Lyka and Noah fall in love, but their relationship is hindered by Noah's deep hatred for werewolves, as he blamed them for killing his father and foster father.  By the time they had fallen deeply in love, Lyka had reached her \u201ctime\u201d - fully accepting her werewolf nature and the bigger responsibility as the Last Guardian.  Despite the many obstacles, Noah and Lyka's love for each other prevailed.  They marry, and together battle and defeat their enemies.\n\nThree other characters create additional conflict: Noah's friend, Gabrielle Dizon (played by Shaina Magdayao), a deep penetration agent tasked to bring Noah over to the Luna Force for the sinister purposes to destroy and rid the country of all werewolves altogether, complicated by the fact that she was in love with Noah and truly cared for him; Anton Rivero, Lyka's step cousin, her protector against his abusive step mother Clara, and obsessively in love with Lyka; and General Silva, a secret rogue werewolf banished by the Wayas, out to seek revenge and destroy the Council.\n\nThere are two opposing groups in the story\u2014the Lunas and the Wayas. The Lunas were organized by the Philippine Army to protect humans against werewolves and vampires, but a small faction led by General Silva, held a personal grudge against the werewolves, aiming to undermine Luna leadership and destroy the entire werewolf population.  Silva had a special interest in Noah, who was recruited not only for his superior skills, but mainly because flowing through his blood was a natural immunity to werewolf bites, a gene inherited from his father.  General Silva, together with Anton, manipulated Noah to join the force to obtain his blood and develop an antidote for the poisonous werewolf bites.\n\nThe other opposing group, the Waya Inc. was led by Lady Elle. Wayas controlled and presided over the affairs of the white werewolves and executed justice over the black werewolves and vampires who preyed on humans. Since the vampires had retreated into hiding, the Waya mostly had to deal with the rogue werewolves, secretly working with the Lunas to provide protection for their species.\n\nAt that time, there were two warring factions among the werewolves that threatened the agreement between the Wayas and the Lunas and disturbed the peace within the population. While the white werewolves respected the human beings in their midst and lived in peace with them, albeit secretly; the black werewolves killed humans, the biggest reason why werewolves were feared. The Wayas controlled and led their species, and imposed justice on werewolves who drank human blood, doing their best to apprehend and kill the black werewolves.\n\nOn the night of the Red Moon, Lyka, who had fully accepted her role as \u201cHuling Bantay\u201d, successfully retrieved the Stone of Remus, narrowly lost her life, and saved her people from the purge.  She exhorts them to co-exist harmoniously with human beings, and to stop the prejudice against the black wolves.  She became their Head Guardian, leading the council for an integrated black and white werewolf population.\n\nLyka later defeats the bigger threat of her stepcousin's metamorphosis into a demon werewolf.  Anton was an accomplished chemist, whose specialty was animal diseases and virus mutations. All his life, he worked towards finding a cure for his werewolf nature, believing that he was infected and did not have an inherited gene.  As a child, he was accidentally bitten by Vanessa, then in werewolf form.  Picked by General Silva to work on the antidote for poisonous werewolf bites, Anton discovered a more potent formulation, a mixture of Lyka's and Noah's blood which he injected into his system, gave him an immunity to werewolf bites, and the ability to heal his wounds quickly.  Using the Stone of Remus which he stole from Lyka, and following instructions from an ancient book General Silva had, he was transformed into a powerful werewolf.  Unfortunately, his distorted love and obsession for Lyka changed his soul and personality, turned him into a formidable enemy, who almost defeated Lyka and Noah in their last battle.\n\nCelebrating their victory, and the peaceful coexistence of humans and werewolves, Lady Elle toasts the pregnancy of Lyka and Noah, showing another foreshadowing of the two sequels, [[Imortal]] and [[La Luna Sangre]]. Lyka and Noah are pushing two strollers, indicating they will have twins.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Lobo Episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main cast ===\n{| border=\"0\"  style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-  style=\"background:#e6e9ff; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Cast !! style=\"width:15%;\"|Character !! style=\"width:15px;\"|Summary\n|-\n|| [[Angel Locsin]] || Lyka B.
