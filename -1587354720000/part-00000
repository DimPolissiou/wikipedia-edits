The largest of the Zaza diaspora - about half a million people - is located in Europe, mainly in Germany.\n\n== Ethnogenesis ==\nWhile almost all linguists agree that the Zaza language is not a Kurdish dialect but rather an independent language just like [[Gorani language|Gorani]], they also agree on the fact that Zazas and Kurds are ethnically and culturally linked. This ethnic and culturally linkage though is more of an overshadowing of Kurdish identity upon the Zaza.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> For centuries, the Zaza have been surrounded by the Kurds, a people with a homogeneous language and close culture. Therefore, outside of the region, the Zaza have always been considered to be a part of the Kurds, or a \"Kurdish tribe\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nThis suppression of Zaza autonomy has only been increased in the past century as a result of Kurdish political strivings from multiple resistance movements against the government.

Intense political agitation around them encourages the Zazas to be part of the \"imagined community\" of Kurds, the biggest 'ethnic grouping' to be without nationhood, while simultaneously admitting that its participants are the very mixed product \u2014 an homogenisation or cultural mosaic of \"tribes\" over millennia.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\">{{Cite journal|last=Trompf|first=Garry W.|date=2013|title=Ethno-Religious Minorities in the Near East: Some Macrohistorical Reflections with Special Reference to the Zazas|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=17|issue=3|pages=321\u2013344|jstor=23597500|doi=10.1163/1573384X-20130306}}</ref> Also, Kurdish nationalists play on the point that a large component of so-called Zazas do not want to be called by that name at all, but prefer self-inscribing as [[Kirmanji]], a designation sounding one step away from being [[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanji]] speaking Kurds.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in the Zaza language the term Kirmanji is regarded as a synonym for [[Alevism|Alevi]], which is the main religious group of Zazas living in Dersim separate from Northern Kurds. Among the Armenians, the Zazas are also known as Zaza-Kider, i.e. Zaza-Kurds - the fact, which by no means shows the identification of the Zazas with the Kurds, but rather distinguishes them as a specific group from a common Kurdish background.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> A scientific report from 2005 concluded that Zazas share the same genetical pattern as other 'Kurdish groups'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nasidze|first=Ivan|last2=Quinque|first2=Dominique|last3=Ozturk|first3=Murat|last4=Bendukidze|first4=Nina|last5=Stoneking|first5=Mark|date=2005-03-19|title=MtDNA and Y-chromosome Variation in Kurdish Groups|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|volume=69|issue=4|pages=401\u2013412|doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2005.00174.x|pmid=15996169|issn=0003-4800}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Kurds are not the only group to claim linkage to the Zazas. It is debated that the Zaza may possess roots going back to the [[Hittites]] or derive from a migration from the linguistically-related south Caspian.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/> Similar cultural expressions, and folkloric traditions of the \"Old Women\" in connection with the dead would further suggest a possible deeper connection between the Zazas and Hittites.

Some linguists connect the word Dimil\u00ee with the Daylamites (Gilaks)  in the [[Alborz Mountains]] near the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran and believe that the Zaza have migrated from Daylam towards the west. The Armenians call this people Ddmik, the term which goes Middle Iranian delmik i.e. daylamit, the dweller of the Daylam.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> Today, [[Iranian languages]] are still spoken in southern regions of the Caspian Sea (also called the Caspian languages), including [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], [[Sangsari language|Sangsari]], [[Mazanderani language|Mazanderani]], [[Tati language (Iran)|Tati]], [[Semnani languages|Semnani]], and [[Talysh language|Talysh]], and they are grammatically and lexically very close to Zaza; this supports the argument that Zazas emigrated from the southern regions of the Caspian Sea reaching eastern Anatolia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sims-Williams|first1=ed. by Nicholas|title=Old and middle Iranian studies|date=1998|publisher=Reichert|location=Wiesbaden|isbn=9783895000706|pages=163\u2013177|url=http://zazaki.de/english/articels/Paul-1998-Zaza.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>\nThese claims have already been disproven by genetical studies on Zazaki-speakers.

There is a division between Northern and Southern Zaza, most notably in phonological inventory, but Zaza as a whole forms a dialect continuum, with no recognized standard.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> Northern Zaza is strongly associated with historical Dersim, and is spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of [[Elaz\u0131\u011f|Elazig]] province, eastern and central [[Sivas]], southern [[Erzincan]], western [[Erzurum]] and [[Bing\u00f6l]], and [[Tunceli]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title=DERSIM|doi = 10.1163/9789004206106_eifo_sim_1799}}</ref>\n\nThe first written statements in the Zaza language were compiled by the linguist Peter Lerch in 1850.<ref>{{cite journal|language=German|title=Forschungen \u00fcber die Kurden und die Iranischen Nordchaldaer|last=J.A.

The lack of documentation, and the decline in the number of native Zaza speakers can largely be attributed to the Turkish laws put in place in the mid-1920s, after the creation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. These laws banned the Kurdish language, of which Zaza was often erroneously considered a dialect, from being spoken in public, being written down, and being published. One specific law, the [[Language Ban Act of 1985]], explicitly stated that only Turkish could be spoken in public, not only greatly discouraged the use of Zaza, but it also endangered the cultural identity of the Zaza.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> The consequences of this process of [[turkification]] were so detrimental that under the Alawi-Zaza population the youngest generations hardly speak the language or teaches it to its children.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\">{{Cite web|url=http://zazaki.de/english/index.htm|title=Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza|website=zazaki.de|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> Only until very recently has Zaza been allowed back in the public sphere of Turkey. But the effects of these past policies are still very present as there has been a lack of literature and substantial development in the language.\n\nDuring the 1980s following the passage of these persecutory laws, the Zaza diaspora resulted in a small renaissance following meager efforts by Zazas in Europe.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\"/> This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by alphabetizing were not fruitless: the number of publications in Zaza increased by the multiple. The rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a revival of Zaza language and culture, it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who unfortunately, rarely spoke Zaza as a mothertongue at the time) in favor of modern western in the Zaza language, and thus their interest in the most important inheritance of their ancestors.<ref name=\"elliance\"/>\n\n== Connection to Kurds ==\n[[File:Kurdes Zaza de Diarbekir (Kurdistan).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Zaza Kurds in [[Diyarbakir]] (Kurdistan)\", E.Chantre & C.Barry, 1881]]\nKurds and Zazas have for centuries lived in the same areas in Anatolia.

This ethnic and culturally linkage though is more of an overshadowing of Kurdish identity upon the Zaza.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> For centuries, the Zaza have been surrounded by the Kurds, a people with a homogeneous language and close culture. Therefore, outside of the region, the Zaza have always been considered to be a part of the Kurds, or a \"Kurdish tribe\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nThis suppression of Zaza autonomy has only been increased in the past century as a result of Kurdish political strivings from multiple resistance movements against the government. These political Turko-Kurdish conflicts put significant twin pressure on the Zaza identity. Intense political agitation around them encourages the Zazas to be part of the \"imagined community\" of Kurds, the biggest 'ethnic grouping' to be without nationhood, while simultaneously admitting that its participants are the very mixed product \u2014 an homogenisation or cultural mosaic of \"tribes\" over millennia.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\">{{Cite journal|last=Trompf|first=Garry W.|date=2013|title=Ethno-Religious Minorities in the Near East: Some Macrohistorical Reflections with Special Reference to the Zazas|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=17|issue=3|pages=321\u2013344|jstor=23597500|doi=10.1163/1573384X-20130306}}</ref> Also, Kurdish nationalists play on the point that a large component of so-called Zazas do not want to be called by that name at all, but prefer self-inscribing as [[Kirmanji]], a designation sounding one step away from being [[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanji]] speaking Kurds.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, in the Zaza language the term Kirmanji is regarded as a synonym for [[Alevism|Alevi]], which is the main religious group of Zazas living in Dersim separate from Northern Kurds. Among the Armenians, the Zazas are also known as Zaza-Kider, i.e. Zaza-Kurds - the fact, which by no means shows the identification of the Zazas with the Kurds, but rather distinguishes them as a specific group from a common Kurdish background.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> A scientific report from 2005 concluded that Zazas share the same genetical pattern as other 'Kurdish groups'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nasidze|first=Ivan|last2=Quinque|first2=Dominique|last3=Ozturk|first3=Murat|last4=Bendukidze|first4=Nina|last5=Stoneking|first5=Mark|date=2005-03-19|title=MtDNA and Y-chromosome Variation in Kurdish Groups|journal=Annals of Human Genetics|volume=69|issue=4|pages=401\u2013412|doi=10.1046/j.1529-8817.2005.00174.x|pmid=15996169|issn=0003-4800}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Kurds are not the only group to claim linkage to the Zazas. It is debated that the Zaza may possess roots going back to the [[Hittites]] or derive from a migration from the linguistically-related south Caspian.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/> Similar cultural expressions, and folkloric traditions of the \"Old Women\" in connection with the dead would further suggest a possible deeper connection between the Zazas and Hittites.

The lack of documentation, and the decline in the number of native Zaza speakers can largely be attributed to the Turkish laws put in place in the mid-1920s, after the creation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. These laws banned the Kurdish language, of which Zaza was often erroneously considered a dialect, from being spoken in public, being written down, and being published. One specific law, the [[Language Ban Act of 1985]], explicitly stated that only Turkish could be spoken in public, not only greatly discouraged the use of Zaza, but it also endangered the cultural identity of the Zaza.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> The consequences of this process of [[turkification]] were so detrimental that under the Alawi-Zaza population the youngest generations hardly speak the language or teaches it to its children.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\">{{Cite web|url=http://zazaki.de/english/index.htm|title=Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza|website=zazaki.de|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> Only until very recently has Zaza been allowed back in the public sphere of Turkey. But the effects of these past policies are still very present as there has been a lack of literature and substantial development in the language.\n\nDuring the 1980s following the passage of these persecutory laws, the Zaza diaspora resulted in a small renaissance following meager efforts by Zazas in Europe.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\"/> This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by alphabetizing were not fruitless: the number of publications in Zaza increased by the multiple. The rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a revival of Zaza language and culture, it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who unfortunately, rarely spoke Zaza as a mothertongue at the time) in favor of modern western in the Zaza language, and thus their interest in the most important inheritance of their ancestors.<ref name=\"elliance\"/>\n\n== Connection to Kurds ==\n[[File:Kurdes Zaza de Diarbekir (Kurdistan).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Zaza Kurds in [[Diyarbakir]] (Kurdistan)\", E.Chantre & C.Barry, 1881]]\nKurds and Zazas have for centuries lived in the same areas in Anatolia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Zazas played a key role in the rise of Kurdish nationalism with their rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later the [[Republic of Turkey]].

[[Ebubekir Pamukchu]], the founder of the Zaza national movement expressed this idea in the following sentence: \"From that moment I became Zaza.\"<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> E. Pamukchu was born in Dersim in 1946. Being graduated from a higher college he taught the Turkish language in many parts of the country. At the age of 20 he joined the leftists and was several times imprisoned for his political activities and seditious poems. In 1989 E. Pamukchu emigrated to Sweden where he continued his work until he died in 1991. Ebubekir Pamukchu was the founder of the first periodicals in the Zaza language - \"Ayre\" and \"Piya\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nSome Kurds and international foundations suggest a link between the founder of Zaza nationalism, [[Ebubekir Pamuk\u00e7u]] (d. 1993), and the Turkish intelligence services.<ref name=\"Arakelova\" /> The Zaza nationalistic movement was welcomed and financially supported by certain circles in Turkey's intelligence establishment and Pamukcu has since been accused of having ties to Turkish intelligence. These are not the only claims by Kurds, and others of attempts by the Turkish government to use Zaza nationalism to attack the strength of Kurdish resistance. The Zazas have the attractions of modern Turkey, and the socio-economic (especially educational) benefits it offers other neighboring minorities who eschew involvement in Kurdish separatism (such as the Lazi[c]s to the far north, or Arabic and Syriac-speaking enclaves in and around Mardin).<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nIn an interview with Kurdmedia, Kurdish-Zaza linguist [[Mehemed Malm\u00eesanij]] said the name of this \u201cZazaistan\u201d publisher was the \u201cZaza Culture and Publication House\u201d and was part of the Turkish intelligence services with the task of attacking the Kurdish nationalist movement. \u201cThe conclusion that I draw\u2026 is that these [Zaza nationalist groups] were groups based in the state, or with a more favorable expression, groups that thought in parallel with the state\u201d.{{r|wilgenburg}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Sedat Bucak]]\n*[[Kurdistan]]\n*[[Daylamites]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em|refs=\n<ref name=Lezgin>{{cite web |last=Lezg\u00een |first=Ro\u015fan |title=Among Social Kurdish Groups \u2013 General Glance at Zazas |website=Zazaki.net |url=http://www.zazaki.net/haber/among-social-kurdish-groups-general-glance-at-zazas-503.htm }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Malm\u00eesanij\">{{Cite book |author=Malmisanij |year=1996 |title=Kird, Kirmanc, Dimili or Zaza Kurds |location=Istanbul |publisher=Deng Publishing |url=https://archive.org/details/Kird-Kirmanc-Dimili-Zaza-Kurtleri }}</ref>\n<ref name=Kehl-Bo99>{{cite journal |last=Kehl-Bodrogi |first=Krisztina |date=October 1999 |title=Kurds, Turks, or a People in their own Right?

The conflict split Europe into two coalitions: one was led by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and included the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (also named Hanover), and a few other small German states; while the other was led by the [[Kingdom of France]] and included the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian-led]] [[Holy Roman Empire]], including the [[Electorate of Saxony]] and most of the smaller German states, the [[Russian Empire]] (until 1762), the [[Bourbon Spain|Kingdom of Spain]], and [[Sweden]]. The [[Dutch Republic]], [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], the Italian States, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] did not participate. Meanwhile, in India, some regional polities within the increasingly fragmented [[Mughal Empire]], with the support of the French, failed to defeat a British attempt to conquer [[Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad|Bengal]].\n\nAlthough Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun in 1754, with what became known in the United States as the [[French and Indian War]], the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria's desire to recover [[Silesia]] from Prussia. Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain's and Prussia's ever-growing might, France and Austria put aside their [[French\u2013Habsburg relations|ancient rivalry]] to form a grand coalition of their own, bringing most of the other European powers to their side. Faced with this sudden turn of events, Britain aligned itself with Prussia, in a series of political manoeuvres known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]]. However, French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed, and Britain's rise as among the world's [[superpower|predominant powers]] destroyed France's supremacy in Europe, thus altering the [[European balance of power]].\n\n== Summary ==\nConflict between Great Britain and France broke out in 1754\u20131756 when the British attacked disputed French positions in North America.  Hostilities were heightened when a British unit led by a 22-year-old Lt. Colonel [[George Washington]] ambushed a small French force at the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] on 28 May 1754.  The conflict exploded across the colonial boundaries and extended to the seizure of hundreds of French merchant ships at sea. Meanwhile, Prussia, a rising power, struggled with [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] for dominance within and outside the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in central Europe. In 1756, the four greatest powers (Great Britain, France, Prussia and Austria) \"[[Diplomatic Revolution|switched partners]]\".\n\nRealizing that war was imminent, [[Prussia]] pre-emptively struck [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and quickly [[Siege of Pirna|overran]] it. The result caused uproar across Europe. Because of Austria's [[Treaty of Versailles (1756)|alliance with France]] to recapture [[Silesia]], which had been lost in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Prussia formed an [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|alliance with Britain]]. Reluctantly, by following the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] (Empire), which [[Reichskrieg|declared war on Prussia]] on 17 January 1757, most of the states of the empire joined Austria's cause. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by a few smaller [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]] within the empire (most notably the [[Electorate of Hanover]] but also Brunswick and Hesse-Kassel). [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], seeking to regain Pomerania (most of which had been lost to Prussia in previous wars) joined the coalition, seeing its chance when all the major continental powers of Europe opposed Prussia. [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], bound by the [[Pacte de Famille]], intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an unsuccessful [[Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)|invasion of Portugal]] in 1762. The [[Russian Empire]] was originally aligned with Austria, fearing Prussia's ambition on the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] in 1762.\n \nMany middle and small powers in Europe, as in the previous wars, tried steering away from the escalating conflict, even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents. [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], for instance, was close to being dragged into the war on France's side when [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] became Russian emperor and switched sides; Dano-Norwegian and Russian armies were close to ending up in battle, but the Russian emperor was deposed before war formally broke out. The [[Dutch Republic]], a long-time British ally, kept its neutrality intact, fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe, and even [[Battle of Chinsurah|tried to prevent]] Britain's domination in India. [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]-[[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Savoy]], although sided with the Franco-Spanish alliance, declined to join the coalition under fear of British naval power. The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship, being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] in 1759 to complete her addition to the [[Winter Palace]]. Like Sweden, Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia.\n \nThe war ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] between France, Spain and Great Britain and the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]] between Saxony, Austria and Prussia, in 1763.\n \nThe war was successful for Great Britain, which gained the bulk of [[New France]] in North America, [[Spanish Florida]], some individual [[Caribbean]] islands in the [[West Indies]], the colony of [[Senegal]] on the West African coast, and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American tribes]] were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as [[Pontiac's War]], which was a small scale war between the indigenous tribe known as the [[Odawas]] and the British, where the Odawas claimed seven of the ten forts created or taken by the British to show them that they need to distribute land equally amongst their allies, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status. In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but with a combination of good luck and successful strategy, King [[Frederick the Great]] managed to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''. Prussia solidified its position as a newer European great power. Although Austria failed to retrieve the territory of Silesia from Prussia (its original goal), its military prowess was also noted by the other powers. The involvement of Portugal and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle. Spain lost Florida but gained [[French Louisiana]] and regained control of its colonies, e.g., [[History of Cuba|Cuba]] and [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|the Philippines]], which had been captured by the British during the war.\n\nThe Seven Years' War was perhaps the first true world war, having taken place almost 160 years before [[World War I]], and influenced many major events later around the globe. Winston Churchill described the conflict as the \"first world war\". The war restructured not only the European political order, but also affected events all around the world, paving the way for the beginning of [[Pax Britannica|later British world supremacy]] in the 19th century, the rise of Prussia in Germany (eventually replacing Austria as the leading German State), the beginning of [[American Revolution|tensions in British North America]], as well as a clear sign of [[French Revolution|France's eventual turmoil]]. It was characterized in Europe by sieges and the arson of towns as well as open battles with heavy losses.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nIn the historiography of some countries, the war is named after combatants in its respective theatres. In the present-day United States \u2013 at the time, the southern English-speaking British colonies in North America \u2013 the conflict is known as the '''[[French and Indian War]]''' (1754\u20131763). In English-speaking Canada \u2013 the balance of Britain's former North American colonies \u2013 it is called the '''Seven Years' War''' (1756\u20131763). In French-speaking Canada, it is known as ''La guerre de la Conqu\u00eate'' (the '''War of the Conquest'''). Swedish historiography uses the name ''Pommerska kriget'' ('''[[Pomeranian War|The Pomeranian War]]'''), as the Sweden\u2013Prussian conflict in 1757\u20131762 was limited to [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]] in northern central Germany.<ref name=fuessel7>F\u00fcssel (2010), p. 7.</ref> The '''[[Third Silesian War]]''' involved Prussia and Austria (1756\u20131763). On the Indian subcontinent, the conflict is called the [[Carnatic Wars|'''Third Carnatic War''']] (1757\u20131763).\n\nThe war has been described as the first \"[[world war]]\",<ref name=\"Bowen 1998 7\">{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=HV|year=1998|title=War and British Society 1688\u20131815|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-521-57645-1|page=7}}</ref> although this label was also given to various earlier conflicts like the [[Eighty Years' War]], the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], and to later conflicts like the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The term \"[[Second Hundred Years' War]]\" has been used in order to describe the almost continuous level of worldwide conflict between France and Great Britain during the entire 18th century, reminiscent of the [[Hundred Years' War]] of the 14th and 15th centuries.<ref>Tombs, Robert and Isabelle.

France had long claimed the entire [[Mississippi River]] basin. This was disputed by Britain. In the early 1750s the French began constructing a chain of forts in the [[Ohio River Valley]] to assert their claim and shield the Native American population from increasing British influence.\n\nThe British settlers along the coast were upset that French troops would now be close to the western borders of their colonies. They felt the French would encourage their tribal allies among the North American natives to attack them. Also, the British settlers wanted access to the fertile land of the Ohio River Valley for the new settlers that were flooding into the British colonies seeking farm land.<ref name=\"Anderson, p. 17\">Anderson, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe most important French fort planned was intended to occupy a position at \"the Forks\" where the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River]]s meet to form the [[Ohio River]] (present day [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania). Peaceful British attempts to halt this fort construction were unsuccessful, and the French proceeded to build the fort they named [[Fort Duquesne]]. British colonial militia from Virginia were then sent to drive them out. Led by [[George Washington]], they ambushed a small French force at [[Battle of Jumonville Glen|Jumonville Glen]] on 28 May 1754 killing ten, including commander [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville|Jumonville]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 5\u20137.</ref> The French retaliated by attacking Washington's army at [[Battle of Fort Necessity|Fort Necessity]] on 3 July 1754 and forced Washington to surrender.<ref name=\"AndersonCrucible51_9\">Anderson (2000), pp. 51\u201365.</ref> These were the first engagements of what would become the worldwide Seven Years' War.\n\nNews of this arrived in Europe, where Britain and France unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a solution. The two nations eventually dispatched regular troops to North America to enforce their claims. The first British action was the assault on [[Acadia]] on 16 June 1755 in the [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]],<ref>Anderson, pp. 112\u2013115.</ref> which was immediately followed by their [[expulsion of the Acadians]].<ref>Anderson, p. 114.</ref> In July British Major General [[Edward Braddock]] led about 2,000 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition to retake Fort Duquesne, but [[Braddock Expedition|the expedition]] ended in disastrous defeat.<ref>Anderson, p. 77.</ref> In further action, Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] fired on the French ship ''[[French ship Alcide (1742)|Alcide]]'' [[action of 8 June 1755|on 8 June 1755]], capturing it and two troop ships. In September 1755, British colonial and French troops met in the inconclusive [[Battle of Lake George]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 119\u2013120.</ref>\n\nThe British also harassed French shipping beginning in August 1755, seizing hundreds of ships and capturing thousands of merchant seamen while the two nations were nominally at peace. Incensed, France prepared to attack Hanover, whose [[prince-elector]] was also the King of Great Britain and [[Menorca]]. Britain concluded a treaty whereby Prussia agreed to protect Hanover. In response France concluded an alliance with its long-time enemy Austria, an event known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].\n\n===In Europe===\n{{more citations needed section|date = May 2016}}\n[[File:SevenYearsWar.png|thumb|upright=1.6|All the participants of the Seven Years' War\n{{legend|#4D6DF3|Great Britain, Prussia, Portugal, with allies}}\n{{legend|#22B14C|France, Spain, Austria, Russia, Sweden with allies}}]]\n\nIn the [[War of the Austrian Succession]],<ref>Szabo, p. 2.</ref> which lasted from 1740 to 1748, King [[Frederick&nbsp;II of Prussia]], known as Frederick the Great, seized the prosperous province of [[Silesia]] from Austria. Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] had signed the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748 in order to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances.\n\nThe War of the Austrian Succession had seen the belligerents aligned on a time-honoured basis. France's traditional enemies, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], had coalesced just as they had done against Louis XIV. [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the leading anti-Austrian state in Germany, had been supported by France. Neither group, however, found much reason to be satisfied with its partnership: British subsidies to Austria produced nothing of much help to the British, while the British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria. Prussia, having secured Silesia, came to terms with Austria in disregard of French interests. Even so, France concluded a defensive alliance with Prussia in 1747, and the maintenance of the [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|Anglo-Austrian alignment]] after 1748 was deemed essential by the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]], British secretary of state in the ministry of his brother [[Henry Pelham]]. The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the \"[[diplomatic revolution]]\" or the \"reversal of alliances\".\n\nIn 1756 Austria was making military preparations for war with Prussia and pursuing an alliance with Russia for this purpose. On 2 June 1746, Austria and Russia concluded a defensive alliance that covered their own territory and [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] against attack by Prussia or the Ottoman Empire. They also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of Silesia and the countship of Glatz (now [[K\u0142odzko]], Poland) to Austria in the event of hostilities with Prussia. Their real desire, however, was to destroy Frederick's power altogether, reducing his sway to his electorate of Brandenburg and giving [[East Prussia]] to Poland, an exchange that would be accompanied by the cession of the Polish [[Duchy of Courland]] to Russia. [[Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin]], grand chancellor of Russia under [[Empress Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]], was hostile to both France and Prussia, but he could not persuade Austrian statesman [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] to commit to offensive designs against Prussia so long as Prussia was able to rely on French support.\n\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748]]\n\nThe Hanoverian king [[George II of Great Britain]] was passionately devoted to his family's continental holdings, but his commitments in Germany were counterbalanced by the demands of the British colonies overseas. If war against France for colonial expansion was to be resumed, then Hanover had to be secured against Franco-Prussian attack. France was very much interested in colonial expansion and was willing to exploit the vulnerability of Hanover in war against Great Britain, but it had no desire to divert forces to central Europe for Prussia's interest.\n\nFrench policy was, moreover, complicated by the existence of the ''[[Secret du Roi]]''\u2014a system of private diplomacy conducted by King Louis XV. Unbeknownst to his foreign minister, Louis had established a network of agents throughout Europe with the goal of pursuing personal political objectives that were often at odds with France's publicly stated policies. Louis's goals for ''le Secret du roi'' included the Polish crown for his kinsman [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois de Bourbon, prince de Conti]], and the maintenance of Poland, Sweden, and Turkey as French client states in opposition to Russian and Austrian interests.\n\nFrederick saw [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Royal Prussia|Polish west Prussia]] as potential fields for expansion but could not expect French support if he started an aggressive war for them. If he joined the French against the British in the hope of annexing Hanover, he might fall victim to an Austro-Russian attack. The hereditary elector of Saxony, [[Augustus III]], was also elective King of Poland as Augustus III, but the two territories were physically separated by Brandenburg and Silesia. Neither state could pose as a great power. Saxony was merely a buffer between Prussia and [[Austrian Bohemia]], whereas Poland, despite its union with the ancient lands of Lithuania, was prey to pro-French and pro-Russian factions. A Prussian scheme for compensating Frederick Augustus with Bohemia in exchange for Saxony obviously presupposed further spoliation of Austria.\n\nIn the attempt to satisfy Austria at the time, Britain gave their electoral vote in Hanover for the candidacy of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], as the Holy Roman Emperor, much to the dismay of Frederick and Prussia. Not only that, Britain would soon join the Austro-Russian alliance, but complications arose. Britain's basic framework for the alliance itself was to protect Hanover's interests against France. At the same time, Kaunitz kept approaching the French in the hope of establishing just such an alliance with Austria. Not only that, France had no intention to ally with Russia, who, years earlier, had meddled in France's affairs during Austria's succession war.  France also saw the dismemberment of Prussia as threatening to the stability of Central Europe.\n\nYears later, Kaunitz kept trying to establish France's alliance with Austria. He tried as hard as he could to avoid Austrian entanglement in Hanover's political affairs, and was even willing to trade [[Austrian Netherlands]] for France's aid in recapturing Silesia. Frustrated by this decision and by the [[Dutch Republic]]'s insistence on neutrality, Britain soon turned to Russia. On 30 September 1755, Britain pledged financial aid to Russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the Livonian-Lithuanian border, so they could defend Britain's interests in Hanover immediately. Besthuzev, assuming the preparation was directed against Prussia, was more than happy to obey the request of the British. Unbeknownst to the other powers, King George II also made overtures to the Prussian king, Frederick, who, fearing the Austro-Russian intentions, was also desirous of a rapprochement with Britain. On 16 January 1756, the [[Convention of Westminster]] was signed, whereby Britain and Prussia promised to aid one another; the parties hoped to achieve lasting peace and stability in Europe.\n\nThe carefully coded word in the agreement proved no less catalytic for the other European powers. The results were absolute chaos. Empress Elizabeth of Russia was outraged at the duplicity of Britain's position. Not only that, but France was enraged, and terrified, by the sudden betrayal of its only ally, Prussia. Austria, particularly Kaunitz, used this situation to their utmost advantage. Now-isolated France was forced to accede to the Austro-Russian alliance or face ruin. Thereafter, on 1 May 1756, the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] was signed, in which both nations pledged 24,000 troops to defend each other in the case of an attack. This diplomatic revolution proved to be an important cause of the war; although both treaties were ostensibly defensive in nature, the actions of both coalitions made the war virtually inevitable.\n\n===Methods and technologies===\n{{Further|Early modern warfare}}\nEuropean warfare in the [[early modern period]] was characterised by the widespread adoption of [[firearm]]s in combination with more traditional [[bladed weapons]]. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed [[infantry]] armed with [[smoothbore]] [[flintlock musket]]s and [[bayonet]]s. [[Cavalry]] units of various weights armed with [[sabre]]s and [[pistol]]s were used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[shock tactics]]. Smoothbore [[artillery]] provided [[fire support]] and played the leading role in [[siege warfare]].<ref name=\"Black 38\">{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=38\u201352}}</ref> Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key [[fortification]]s positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict, and decisive field battles relatively rare.<ref>{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=67\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe Seven Years' War and most European wars of the eighteenth century were fought as so-called [[cabinet wars]] in which disciplined [[regular armies]] were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|209}}</ref> [[Military logistics]] was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised [[Supply depot|magazines]] and distributed by [[baggage train]]s that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids.<ref>{{Harvp|Creveld|1977|pp=26\u201328}}</ref> Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established [[Cantonment|winter quarters]] in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring.<ref name=\"Black 38\"/>\n\n==Strategies==\n[[File:Erstes pr.

On 29 August 1756, he led Prussian troops across the border of Saxony, one of the small German states in league with Austria. He intended this as a bold pre-emption of an anticipated Austro-French invasion of Silesia. He had three goals in his new war on Austria. First, he would seize Saxony and eliminate it as a threat to Prussia, then use the Saxon army and treasury to aid the Prussian war effort. His second goal was to advance into Bohemia, where he might set up winter quarters at Austria's expense. Thirdly, he wanted to invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at Olm\u00fctz, and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 427.\">Asprey, p. 427.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Lobositz.png|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Battle of Lobositz]].

The Prussian army marched in three columns. On the right was a column of about 15,000 men under the command of [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]. On the left was a column of 18,000 men under the command of the [[Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Bevern|Duke of Brunswick-Bevern]]. In the centre was Frederick II, himself with Field Marshal [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]] commanding a corps of 30,000 troops.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 427.\" /> Ferdinand of Brunswick was to close in on the town of [[Chemnitz]]. The Duke of Brunswick-Bevern was to traverse [[Lusatia]] to close in on [[Bautzen]]. Meanwhile, Frederick and Keith would make for [[Dresden]].\n\nThe Saxon and Austrian armies were unprepared, and their forces were scattered. Frederick occupied Dresden with little or no opposition from the Saxons.<ref>Asprey, p. 428.</ref> At the [[Battle of Lobositz]] on 1 October 1756, Frederick prevented the isolated Saxon army from being reinforced by an Austrian army under General [[Maximilian Ulysses Browne|Browne]].<ref>Asprey, pp. 430\u2013438.</ref> The Prussians then occupied Saxony; after the [[Siege of Pirna]], the Saxon army surrendered in October 1756, and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. The attack on neutral Saxony caused outrage across Europe and led to the strengthening of the anti-Prussian coalition.<ref>Dull, p. 71.</ref> The only significant Austrian success was the partial occupation of Silesia. Far from being easy, Frederick's early successes proved indecisive and very costly for Prussia's smaller army.

With this army he slowly moved to relieve Prague. The Prussian army was too weak to simultaneously besiege Prague and keep von Daun away, and Frederick was forced to attack prepared positions. The resulting [[Battle of Kolin]] was a sharp defeat for Frederick, his first. His losses further forced him to lift the siege and withdraw from Bohemia altogether.<ref>Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'', p. 6.</ref>\n\nLater that summer, the Russians under Field Marshal [[Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin]] besieged [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] with 75,000 troops. Memel had one of the strongest fortresses in Prussia. However, after five days of artillery bombardment the Russian army was able to storm it.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 460\">Asprey, p. 460.</ref> The Russians then used Memel as a base to invade [[East Prussia]] and defeated a smaller Prussian force in the fiercely contested [[Battle of Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf]] on 30 August 1757. In the words of the American historian Daniel Marston, Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf left the Prussians with \"a newfound respect for the fighting capabilities of the Russians that was reinforced in the later battles of Zorndorf and Kunersdorf\".<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 pages 40\u201341.</ref> However, the Russians were not yet able to take K\u00f6nigsberg after using up their supplies of cannonballs at Memel and Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf and retreated soon afterwards.\n\n[[File:Schlacht bei Ro\u00dfbach.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Rossbach]]]]\n\nLogistics was a recurring problem for the Russians throughout the war.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 22\">Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 22.</ref> The Russians lacked a quartermaster's department capable of keeping armies operating in Central Europe properly supplied over the primitive mud roads of eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 22\"/> The tendency of Russian armies to break off operations after fighting a major battle, even when they were not defeated, was less about their casualties and more about their supply lines; after expending much of their munitions in a battle, Russian generals did not wish to risk another battle knowing resupply would be a long time coming.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 22\"/> This long-standing weakness was evident in the [[Austro-Russian\u2013Turkish War (1735\u201339)|Russian-Ottoman War]] of 1735\u20131739, where Russian battle victories led to only modest war gains due to problems supplying their armies.<ref name=\"Stone, David page 70\">Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 70</ref> The Russian quartermasters department had not improved, so the same problems reoccurred in Prussia.<ref name=\"Stone, David page 70\"/> Still, the Imperial Russian Army was a new threat to Prussia. Not only was Frederick forced to break off his invasion of Bohemia, he was now forced to withdraw further into Prussian-controlled territory.<ref>Anderson, p. 176.</ref> His defeats on the battlefield brought still more opportunistic nations into the war. Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000 men.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 460\"/> Sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania and felt the Swedish army would not need to engage with the Prussians because the Prussians were occupied on so many other fronts.\n\n[[File:Batte of Leuthen.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Leuthen]] by [[Carl R\u00f6chling]]]]\n[[File:Frederick the Great and his staff at the Battle of Leuthen by Hugo Ungewitter.jpg|thumb|Frederick and staff at Leuthen]]\n\nThings were looking grim for Prussia now, with the Austrians mobilising to attack Prussian-controlled soil and a combined French and ''[[Reichsarmee]]'' army under [[Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise|Prince Soubise]] approaching from the west. The ''Reichsarmee'' was a collection of armies from the smaller German states that had banded together to heed the appeal of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz I]] of Austria against Frederick.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 41\">Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 41.</ref> However, in November and December 1757, the whole situation in Germany was reversed. First, Frederick devastated Soubise's forces at the [[Battle of Rossbach]] on 5 November 1757<ref>Asprey, pp. 469\u2013472.</ref> and then routed a vastly superior Austrian force at the [[Battle of Leuthen]] on 5 December 1757.<ref>Asprey, pp. 476\u2013481.</ref> Rossbach was the only battle between the French and the Prussians during the entire war.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 41\"/> At Rossbach, the Prussians lost about 548 men killed while the Franco-''Reichsarmee'' force under Soubise lost about 10,000 killed.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 42\">Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 42.</ref> Frederick always called Leuthen his greatest victory, an assessment shared by many at the time as the Austrian Army was considered to be a highly professional force.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 42\"/> With these victories, Frederick once again established himself as Europe's premier general and his men as Europe's most accomplished soldiers.  However, Frederick missed an opportunity to completely destroy the Austrian army at Leuthen; although depleted, it escaped back into Bohemia.  He hoped the two smashing victories would bring Maria Theresa to the peace table, but she was determined not to negotiate until she had re-taken Silesia.  Maria Theresa also improved the Austrians' command after Leuthen by replacing her incompetent brother-in-law, [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]], with von Daun, who was now a field marshal.\n\nThis problem was compounded when the main Hanoverian army under Cumberland, which include Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick troops, was defeated at the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] and forced to surrender entirely at the [[Convention of Klosterzeven]] following a [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|French Invasion of Hanover]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 211\u201312.</ref> The convention removed Hanover from the war, leaving the western approach to Prussian territory extremely vulnerable. Frederick sent urgent requests to Britain for more substantial assistance, as he was now without any outside military support for his forces in Germany.<ref>Anderson, pp. 176\u201377.</ref>\n\nCalculating that no further Russian advance was likely until 1758, Frederick moved the bulk of his eastern forces to Pomerania under the command of Marshal Lehwaldt, where they were to repel the Swedish invasion. In short order, the Prussian army drove the Swedes back, occupied most of [[Swedish Pomerania]], and blockaded its capital [[Stralsund]].<ref>Asprey, p. 473.</ref> [[George&nbsp;II of Great Britain]], on the advice of his British ministers after the battle of Rossbach, revoked the Convention of Klosterzeven, and Hanover reentered the war.<ref>Anderson, pp. 215\u201316.</ref> Over the winter the new commander of the Hanoverian forces, [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick]] (until immediately before a commander in the Prussian Army), regrouped his army and launched a series of offensives that drove the French back across the [[River Rhine]].  Ferdinand's forces kept Prussia's western flank secure for the rest of the war.<ref>Asprey, p. 486.</ref>\nThe British had suffered further defeats in North America, particularly at [[Fort William Henry]]. At home, however, stability had been established. Since 1756, successive governments led by [[Thomas Pelham-Holles|Newcastle]] and Pitt had fallen. In August 1757, the two men agreed to a political partnership and formed a [[coalition government]] that gave new, firmer direction to the war effort. The new strategy emphasised both Newcastle's commitment to British involvement on the continent, particularly in defence of its German possessions, and Pitt's determination to use naval power to seize [[French colonies]] around the globe. This \"dual strategy\" would dominate British policy for the next five years.\n\nBetween 10 and 17 October 1757, a Hungarian general, Count [[Andr\u00e1s Hadik]], serving in the Austrian army, executed what may be the most famous [[hussar]] action in history. When the Prussian king, Frederick, was marching south with his powerful armies, the Hungarian general unexpectedly swung his force of 5,000, mostly hussars, around the Prussians and occupied part of their capital, Berlin, for one night.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 467.\">Asprey, p. 467.</ref> The city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 200,000 thalers.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 467.\"/> When Frederick heard about this humiliating occupation, he immediately sent a larger force to free the city. Hadik, however, left the city with his hussars and safely reached the Austrian lines. Subsequently, Hadik was promoted to the rank of marshal in the Austrian Army.\n\n===1758===\nIn early 1758, Frederick launched an invasion of [[Moravia]] and laid siege to [[Olm\u00fctz]] (now [[Olomouc]], Czech Republic).<ref>Asprey, p. 489.</ref> Following an Austrian victory at the [[Battle of Domstadtl]] that wiped out a supply convoy destined for Olm\u00fctz, Frederick broke off the siege and withdrew from Moravia. It marked the end of his final attempt to launch a major invasion of Austrian territory.<ref>Szabo, pp. 148\u201355.</ref> In January 1758, the Russians invaded [[East Prussia]], where the province, almost denuded of troops, put up little opposition.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 41\"/> East Prussia had been occupied by Russian forces over the winter and would remain under their control until 1762, although it was far less strategically valuable to Prussia than Brandenburg or Silesia.  In any case, Frederick did not see the Russians as an immediate threat and instead entertained hopes of first fighting a decisive battle against Austria that would knock them out of the war.\n\n[[File:Battle of Krefeld - Map of the area printed in The Gentleman's Magazine.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Krefeld \u2013 a map of the area in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'']]\n\nIn April 1758, the British concluded the [[Anglo-Prussian Convention]] with Frederick in which they committed to pay him [[Golden Cavalry of St George|an annual subsidy]] of \u00a3670,000. Britain also dispatched 9,000 troops to reinforce Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, the first British troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of Pitt. Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, supplemented by some Prussian troops, had succeeded in driving the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of [[Emden]] in March 1758 before crossing the Rhine with his own forces, which caused alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the [[Battle of Krefeld]] and the brief occupation of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], he was compelled by the successful manoeuvering of larger French forces to withdraw across the Rhine.<ref>Szabo, pp. 179\u201382.</ref>\n\nBy this point Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder in Brandenburg-[[Neumark]], at the [[Battle of Zorndorf]] (now Sarbinowo, Poland), a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick on 25 August 1758, fought a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count [[William Fermor]].<ref>Asprey, pp. 494\u2013499.</ref> Both sides suffered heavy casualties \u2013 the Prussians 12,800, the Russians 18,000 \u2013 but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory.<ref>Szabo pp. 162\u201369.</ref> The American historian Daniel Marston described Zorndorf as a \"draw\" as both sides were too exhausted and had taken such losses that neither wished to fight another battle with the other.<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 54.</ref> In the undecided [[Battle of Tornow]] on 25 September, a Swedish army repulsed six assaults by a Prussian army but did not push on Berlin following the [[Battle of Fehrbellin (1758)|Battle of Fehrbellin]].<ref>Asprey, p. 500.</ref>\n\n[[File:La Pegna \u00dcberfall bei Hochkirch.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Hochkirch]]]]\n\nThe war was continuing indecisively when on 14 October Marshal Daun's Austrians surprised the main Prussian army at the [[Battle of Hochkirch]] in Saxony.<ref>Asprey, pp. 501\u2013506.</ref> Frederick lost much of his artillery but retreated in good order, helped by dense woods. The Austrians had ultimately made little progress in the campaign in Saxony despite Hochkirch and had failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. After a thwarted attempt to take Dresden, Daun's troops were forced to withdraw to Austrian territory for the winter, so that Saxony remained under Prussian occupation.<ref>Szabo, pp. 195\u2013202.</ref> At the same time, the Russians failed in an attempt to take [[Kolberg]] in Pomerania (now [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], Poland) from the Prussians.<ref>''The seven years war in Europe'', Szabo</ref>\n\nIn France, 1758 had been disappointing, and in the wake of this a new chief minister, the [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul|Duc de Choiseul]], was appointed. Choiseul planned to end the war in 1759 by making strong attacks on Britain and Hanover.\n\n===1759\u201360===\n[[File:HGM Findenigg Gefecht bei Maxen.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Maxen]]]]\n[[File:Kunersdorff.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Kunersdorf]]]]\n\nPrussia suffered several defeats in 1759. At the [[Battle of Kay]], or Paltzig, the Russian Count [[Pyotr Semyonovich Saltykov|Saltykov]] with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General [[Carl Heinrich von Wedel]]. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at [[Battle of Minden|Minden]], Austrian general [[Leopold Josef Graf Daun|Daun]] forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the [[Battle of Maxen]]. Frederick himself lost half his army in the [[Battle of Kunersdorf]] (now [[Kunowice]] Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at [[Battle of Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf|Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf]] (now Motornoye, Russia), and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.  However, disagreements with the Austrians over logistics and supplies resulted in the Russians withdrawing east yet again after Kunersdorf, ultimately enabling Frederick to re-group his shattered forces.\n\n[[File:Bataille des Cardinaux en 1759 peinte par Richard Paton.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Quiberon Bay]]]]\n[[File:Menzel - Battle of Liegnitz.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Liegnitz (1760)]]]]\n\nThe French [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|planned to invade the British Isles]] during 1759 by accumulating troops near the mouth of the Loire and concentrating their Brest and Toulon fleets. However, two sea defeats prevented this. In August, the Mediterranean fleet under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Clue-Sabran]] was scattered by a larger British fleet under [[Edward Boscawen]] at the [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Battle of Lagos]]. In the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] on 20 November, the British admiral [[Edward Hawke]] with 23 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] caught the French Brest fleet with 21 ships of the line under [[Marshal de Conflans]] and sank, captured, or forced many of them aground, putting an end to the French plans.\n\nThe year 1760 brought yet more Prussian disasters. The general [[Heinrich August, Baron de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9|Fouqu\u00e9]] was defeated by the Austrians in the [[Battle of Landshut (1760)|Battle of Landshut]]. The French captured [[Marburg]] in Hesse and the Swedes part of [[Pomerania]]. The Hanoverians were victorious over the French at the [[Battle of Warburg]], their continued success preventing France from sending troops to aid the Austrians against Prussia in the east.\n\nDespite this, the Austrians, under the command of [[Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon|General Laudon]], captured [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]] (now [[K\u0142odzko]], Poland) in Silesia. In the [[Battle of Liegnitz (1760)|Battle of Liegnitz]] Frederick scored a strong victory despite being outnumbered three to one. The Russians under [[Pyotr Saltykov|General Saltykov]] and Austrians under [[Franz Moritz Graf von Lacy|General Lacy]] briefly occupied his capital, Berlin, in October, but could not hold it for long. Still, the loss of Berlin to the Russians and Austrians was a great blow to Frederick's prestige as many pointed out that the Prussians had no hope of occupying temporarily or otherwise St. Petersburg or Vienna. In November 1760 Frederick was once more victorious, defeating the able Daun in the [[Battle of Torgau]], but he suffered very heavy casualties, and the Austrians retreated in good order.\n\nMeanwhile, after the battle of Kunersdorf, the Russian army was mostly inactive due mostly to their tenuous supply lines.<ref>Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 74.</ref> Russian logistics were so poor that in October 1759, an agreement was signed under which the Austrians undertook to supply the Russians as the quartermaster's department of the Russian Army was badly strained by the demands of Russian armies operating so far from home.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 22\"/> As it was, the requirement that the Austrian quartermaster's department supply both the Austrian and Russian armies proved beyond its capacity, and in practice, the Russians received little in the way of supplies from the Austrians.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 22\"/> At [[Liegnitz]] (now [[Legnica]], Poland), the Russians arrived too late to participate in the battle. They made two attempts to storm the fortress of Kolberg, but neither succeeded. The tenacious resistance of Kolberg allowed Frederick to focus on the Austrians instead of having to split his forces.\n\n===1761\u201362===\n{{See also|Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)}}\n[[File:7yearswar.PNG|thumb|Operations of Russian army on Polish-Lithuanian territory, 1756\u20131763]]\n\nPrussia began the 1761 campaign with just 100,000 available troops, many of them new recruits, and its situation seemed desperate.<ref>Anderson, p. 491.</ref> However, the Austrian and Russian forces were also heavily depleted and could not launch a major offensive.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\nIn February 1761 [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick]] surprised French troops at [[Battle of Langensalza (1761)|Langensalza]] and then advanced to [[Siege of Cassel (1761)|besiege Cassel]] in March. He was forced to lift the siege and retreat after French forces regrouped and captured several thousand of his men at the [[Battle of Gr\u00fcnberg]]. At the [[Battle of Villinghausen]], forces under Ferdinand defeated a 92,000-man French army.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\nOn the eastern front, progress was very slow. The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland, and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them. One of them, led by general Platen in September resulted in the loss of 2,000 Russians, mostly captured, and the destruction of 5,000 wagons.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War, 1756\u20131763'', Herbert Redman</ref> Deprived of men, the Prussians had to resort to this new sort of warfare, raiding, to delay the advance of their enemies.  Frederick's army, though depleted, was left unmolested at its headquarters in Brunzelwitz, as both the Austrians and the Russians were hesitant to attack it. Nonetheless, at the end of 1761, Prussia suffered two critical setbacks. The Russians under [[Zakhar Chernyshev]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|stormed Kolberg in Pomerania]], while the Austrians captured [[Schweidnitz]]. The loss of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>Anderson, p. 492.</ref> A major problem for the Russians throughout the war had always been their weak logistics, which prevented their generals from following up their victories, and now with the fall of Kolberg, the Russians could at long last supply their armies in Central Europe via the sea.<ref name=\"Stone, David page 75\">Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 75.</ref> The fact that the Russians could now supply their armies over the sea, which was considerably faster and safer (Prussian cavalry could not intercept Russian ships in the Baltic) than over the land threatened to swing the balance of power decisively against Prussia, as Frederick could not spare any troops to protect his capital.<ref name=\"Stone, David page 75\"/> In Britain, it was speculated that a total Prussian collapse was now imminent.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\n[[File:Fall of Kolberg in 1761.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siege of Kolberg (1761)]]]]\n\nBritain now threatened to withdraw its subsidies if Frederick did not consider offering concessions to secure peace. As the Prussian armies had dwindled to just 60,000 men and with Berlin itself about to come under siege, the survival of both Prussia and its King was severely threatened. Then on 5 January 1762 the Russian [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] died. Her Prussophile successor, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], at once ended the Russian occupation of East Prussia and Pomerania (see: the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)]]) and mediated Frederick's truce with Sweden.  He also placed a corps of his own troops under Frederick's command. Frederick was then able to muster a larger army, of 120,000 men, and concentrate it against Austria.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He drove them from much of Silesia after [[Siege of Schweidnitz (1762)|recapturing Schweidnitz]], while his brother Henry won a victory in Saxony in the [[Battle of Freiberg]] (29 October 1762). At the same time, his Brunswick allies captured the key town of [[G\u00f6ttingen]] and compounded this by [[Siege of Cassel|taking Cassel]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\nIn 1762 two new countries entered the war. Britain declared war against [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] on 4 January 1762; Spain reacted by issuing its own declaration of war against Britain on 18 January.<ref name=Fish2003p2>{{Harvnb|Fish|2003|p=2}}</ref> Portugal followed by joining the war on Britain's side. Spain, aided by the French, [[Invasion of Portugal (1762)|launched an invasion]] of Portugal and succeeded in [[Siege of Almeida (1762)|capturing Almeida]].

He therefore made peace with Frederick and evacuated Prussia's Rhineland territories, ending France's involvement in the war in Germany.{{sfn|Mitford|2013|p=242\u2013243}}\n\n===1763===\n{{further|Treaty of Hubertusburg|Treaty of Paris (1763)}}\n[[File:Hubertusburg Allegorie.jpg|thumb|[[Treaty of Hubertusburg]]]]\n\nBy 1763, the war in central Europe was essentially a stalemate between Prussia and Austria. Prussia had retaken nearly all of Silesia from the Austrians after Frederick's narrow victory over Daun at the Battle of Burkersdorf.  After his brother Henry's 1762 victory at the Battle of Freiberg, Frederick held most of Saxony but not its capital, Dresden. His financial situation was not dire, but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened. His manpower had dramatically decreased, and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that an offensive against Dresden seemed impossible.<ref name=\"Frederick II, Jean-Paul Bled\"/> British subsidies had been stopped by the new prime minister, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], and the Russian emperor had been overthrown by his wife, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]], who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war. Austria, however, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army, which greatly affected its offensive power.<ref name=\"Frederick II, Jean-Paul Bled\"/> Indeed, after having effectively sustained a long war, its administration was in disarray.<ref>''The emergence of the Eastern powers'', Hamish Scott</ref> By that time, it still held Dresden, the southeastern parts of Saxony, and the county of Glatz in southern Silesia, but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support, and Maria Theresa had largely given up her hopes of re-conquering Silesia; her Chancellor, husband and eldest son were all urging her to make peace, while Daun was hesitant to attack Frederick. In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], in which Glatz was returned to Prussia in exchange for the Prussian evacuation of Saxony. This ended the war in central Europe.\n\nThe stalemate had really been reached by 1759\u20131760, and Prussia and Austria were nearly out of money. The materials of both sides had been largely consumed. Frederick was no longer receiving subsidies from Britain; the Golden Cavalry of St. George had produced nearly 13 million dollars (equivalent). He had melted and coined most of the church silver, had ransacked the palaces of his kingdom and coined that silver, and reduced his purchasing power by mixing it with copper. His banks' capital was exhausted, and he had pawned nearly everything of value from his own estate. While Frederick still had a significant amount of money left from the prior British subsidies, he hoped to use it to restore his kingdom's prosperity in peacetime; in any case, Prussia's population was so depleted that he could not sustain another long campaign.<ref>Alexander J.

The expedition set out on 8 September 1757, [[John Mordaunt (general)|Sir John Mordaunt]] commanding the troops and [[Edward Hawke|Sir Edward Hawke]] the fleet. On 23 September the [[Isle d'Aix]] was taken, but military staff dithered and lost so much time that Rochefort became unassailable.<ref name=\"Combined1\">Julian Corbett, ''England in the Seven Years' War: A Study in Combined Strategy'', 2 Vols., (London, 1918).</ref> The expedition abandoned the Isle d'Aix, returning to Great Britain on 1 October.\n\n[[File:William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by William Hoare.jpg|thumb|Under Pitt's leadership, Britain's position as the leading colonial power was confirmed by the Seven Years' War.]]\n\nDespite the debatable strategic success and the operational failure of the descent on Rochefort, William Pitt\u2014who saw purpose in this type of asymmetric enterprise\u2014prepared to continue such operations.<ref name=\"Combined1\"/> An army was assembled under the command of [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough]]; he was aided by [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Sackville]]. The naval squadron and transports for the expedition were commanded by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]]. The army landed on 5 June 1758 at [[Cancalle Bay]], proceeded to [[St.&nbsp;Malo]], and, finding that it would take prolonged siege to capture it, instead attacked the nearby port of St.&nbsp;Servan. It burned shipping in the harbor, roughly 80 French privateers and merchantmen, as well as four warships which were under construction.<ref>N. A. M. Rodger, ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain'', 1649\u20131815, (London, 2004)</ref> The force then re-embarked under threat of the arrival of French relief forces. An attack on [[Le Havre|Havre de Grace]] was called off, and the fleet sailed on to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]; the weather being bad and provisions low, that too was abandoned, and the expedition returned having damaged French privateering and provided further strategic demonstration against the French coast.\n\nPitt now prepared to send troops into Germany; and both Marlborough and Sackville, disgusted by what they perceived as the futility of the \"descents\", obtained commissions in that army. The elderly [[Thomas Bligh|General Bligh]] was appointed to command a new \"descent\", escorted by Howe. The campaign began propitiously with the [[Raid on Cherbourg]]. Covered by naval bombardment, the army drove off the French force detailed to oppose their landing, captured Cherbourg, and destroyed its fortifications, docks, and shipping.\n\nThe troops were reembarked and moved to the [[Bay of St.&nbsp;Lunaire]] in Brittany where, on 3 September, they were landed to operate against St.&nbsp;Malo; however, this action proved impractical. Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate: the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of [[Saint-Cast-le-Guildo|St.&nbsp;Cast]], while the army proceeded overland. The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops. At the [[battle of Saint Cast]] a rear-guard of 1,400 under [[Alexander Dury|Dury]] held off the French while the rest of the army embarked. They could not be saved; 750, including Dury, were killed and the rest captured.\n\n==Colonies==\n{{Campaignbox Seven Years' War: West Indies}}\nThe colonial conflict mainly between France and Britain took place in India, North America, Europe, the [[Caribbean]] isles, the [[Philippines]], and coastal Africa. Over the course of the war, Great Britain gained enormous areas of land and influence at the expense of the French.\n\nGreat Britain lost [[Menorca]] in the Mediterranean to the French in 1756 but captured the French colonies in [[Senegal]] in 1758. The British [[Royal Navy]] took the French sugar colonies of [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1759)|Guadeloupe]] in 1759 and [[British expedition against Martinique|Martinique]] in 1762 as well as the Spanish cities of [[British expedition against Cuba|Havana in Cuba]], and [[Battle of Manila (1762)|Manila]] in the Philippines, both prominent Spanish colonial cities. However, expansion into the hinterlands of both cities met with stiff resistance. In the Philippines, the British were [[British occupation of Manila|confined to Manila]] until their agreed upon withdrawal at the war's end.\n\n===North America===\n{{Main|French and Indian War}}\n{{Campaignbox French and Indian War}}\n{{Campaignbox French and Indian War: Maritimes}}\n{{Campaignbox French and Indian War: Ohio Valley}}\n[[File:Carte Guerre de 7 ans Am\u00e9rique du nord.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.4|French and British positions during the first four years of the war\n{{legend|#F4A8C8|British territory, forts and settlements |textcolor=#FF002F |text=\u25a0 \u25d8 }}\n{{legend|#A8C4F4|French territory, forts and settlements |textcolor=#425BFC |text=\u25a0 \u25d8 }}\n]]\n\nDuring the war, the [[Iroquois#French and Indian Wars|Seven Nations of The Iroquois Confederacy]] were allied with the British. Native Americans of the Laurentian valley\u2014the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], the [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]], the [[Huron people|Huron]], and others, were allied with the French. Although the Algonquin tribes living north of the Great Lakes and along the St. Lawrence River were not directly concerned with the fate of the Ohio River Valley tribes, they had been victims of the Iroquois Confederation which included the Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Tuscarora tribes of central New York. The Iroquois had encroached on Algonquin territory and pushed the Algonquins west beyond Lake Michigan and to the shore of the St. Lawrence.<ref>Anderson, p. 14.</ref> Therefore, the Algonquin tribes were interested in fighting against the Iroquois. Throughout New England, New York, and the North-west Native American tribes formed differing alliances with the major belligerents.\n\nIn 1756 and 1757 the French captured forts [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)|Oswego]]<ref>Anderson, pp. 150\u2013157.</ref> and [[Siege of Fort William Henry|William Henry]] from the British.<ref>Anderson, pp. 185\u2013201.</ref> The latter victory was marred when France's native allies broke the terms of capitulation and attacked the retreating British column, which was under French guard, slaughtering and scalping soldiers and taking captive many men, women and children while the French refused to protect their captives.<ref name=\"Dodge91_2\">Dodge, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> French naval deployments in 1757 also [[Louisbourg Expedition (1757)|successfully defended]] the key [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] on [[Cape Breton Island]] called Ile du Roi by the French, securing the seaward approaches to Quebec.<ref>Anderson, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref>\n\nBritish Prime Minister William Pitt's focus on the colonies for the 1758 campaign paid off with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|taking of Louisbourg]] after French reinforcements were blocked by British naval victory in the [[Battle of Cartagena (1758)|Battle of Cartagena]] and in the successful [[Forbes Expedition|capture of Fort Duquesne]]<ref>Anderson, p. 280\u2013283.</ref> and [[Battle of Fort Frontenac|Fort Frontenac]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 258\u2013266.</ref> The British also continued the process of deporting the Acadian population with a wave of major operations against [[Ile Saint-Jean Campaign|\u00cele Saint-Jean]] (present-day [[Prince Edward Island]]), the [[St. John River Campaign|St.&nbsp;John River valley]], and the [[Petitcodiac River Campaign|Petitcodiac River valley]]. The celebration of these successes was dampened by their embarrassing defeat in the [[Battle of Carillon]] (Ticonderoga), in which 4,000 French troops repulsed 16,000 British. When the British led by generals [[James Abercrombie (British Army officer, born 1706)|James Abercrombie]] and [[George Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe|George Howe]] attacked, they believed that the French led by general [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Marquis de Montcalm]] were defended only by a small [[abatis]] which could be taken easily given the British force's significant numerical advantage. The British offensive which was supposed to advance in tight columns and overwhelm the French defenders fell into confusion and scattered, leaving large spaces in their ranks. When the French [[Chevalier de Levis]] sent 1,000 soldiers to reinforce Montcalm's struggling troops, the British were pinned down in the brush by intense French musket fire and they were forced to retreat.\n\nAll of Britain's campaigns against New France succeeded in 1759, part of what became known as an [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|''Annus Mirabilis'']]. [[Battle of Fort Niagara|Fort Niagara]]<ref>Anderson, pp. 330\u2013339.</ref> and [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|Fort Carillon]]<ref>Anderson, pp. 240\u2013249.</ref> on 8 July 1758 fell to sizable British forces, cutting off French frontier forts further west. Starting in June 1759, the British under [[James Wolfe]] and [[James Murray (British Army officer, born 1721)|James Murray]] set up camp on the Ile d'Orleans across the St. Lawrence River from Quebec, enabling them to commence the 3-month siege that ensued. The French under the Marquis de Montcalm anticipated a British assault to the east of Quebec so he ordered his soldiers to fortify the region of [[Beauport, Quebec City|Beauport]]. On 31 July the [[Battle of Beauport|British attacked]] with 4,000 soldiers but the French positioned high up on the cliffs overlooking the [[Montmorency Falls]] forced the British forces to withdraw to the Ile D'Orleans. While Wolfe and Murray planned a second offensive, British rangers raided French settlements along the St. Lawrence, destroying food supplies, ammunition and other goods in an attempt to vanquish the French through starvation.\n\n[[File:The Death of General Wolfe B.West,1770.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771), on the Plains of Abraham, near Quebec]]\n\nOn 13 September 1759, General James Wolfe led 5,000 troops up a goat path to the [[Plains of Abraham]], 1 mile west of Quebec City. <!--the following passage seems to go into far too much detail about one battle for an article on an entire war-->\nHe had positioned his army between Montcalm's forces an hour's march to the east and [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]]'s regiments to the west, which could be mobilised within 3 hours. Instead of waiting for a coordinated attack with Bougainville, Montcalm attacked immediately.  When his 3,500 troops advanced, their lines became scattered in a disorderly formation.  Many French soldiers fired before they were within range of striking the British.  Wolfe organised his troops in two lines stretching 1 mile across the Plains of Abraham.  They were ordered to load their Brown Bess muskets with two bullets to obtain maximum power and hold their fire until the French soldiers came within 40 paces of the British ranks.  When Montcalm's army was within range of the British, their volley was powerful and nearly all bullets hit their targets, devastating the French ranks.  The French fled the Plains of Abraham in a state of utter confusion while they were pursued by members of the Scottish Fraser regiment and other British forces.  Despite being cut down by musket fire from the Canadiens and their indigenous allies, the British vastly outnumbered these opponents and won the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 355\u2013360.</ref> General Wolfe was mortally wounded in the chest early in the battle so the command fell to James Murray, who would become the lieutenant governor of Quebec after the war.  The Marquis de Montcalm was also severely wounded later in the battle and died the following day.  The French Canadians led by the Chevalier de Levis staged a counteroffensive on the Plains of Abraham in the spring of 1760, with initial success at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 392\u2013393.</ref> During the subsequent [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|siege of Quebec]] however L\u00e9vis was unable to retake the city, due to British naval superiority following the [[Battle of Neuville]] and the [[Battle of Restigouche]]. The French forces retreated to [[Montreal]], and after a [[Montreal Campaign|two month campaign]] by overwhelming British forces on 8 September, they surrendered.\n\nSeeing French and Indian defeat, in 1760 the Seven Nations of The Iroquois Confederacy resigned from the war and negotiated the [[Treaty of Kahnawake]] with the British. Among its conditions was their unrestricted travel between Canada and New York, as the nations had extensive trade between Montreal and Albany as well as populations living throughout the area.<ref>[http://www3.sympatico.ca/donald.macleod2/border.html D.

Retrieved 31 January 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 1762, towards the end of the war, French forces attacked [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St.&nbsp;John's, Newfoundland]]. If successful, the expedition would have strengthened France's hand at the negotiating table. Although they took St. John's and raided nearby settlements, the French forces were eventually defeated by British troops at the [[Battle of Signal Hill]]. This was the final battle of the war in North America, and it forced the French to surrender to [[William Amherst (British Army officer)|Lieutenant Colonel William Amherst]]. The victorious British now controlled all of eastern North America.\n\nThe history of the Seven Years' War in North America, particularly the expulsion of the Acadians, the siege of Quebec, the death of Wolfe, and the Battle of Fort William Henry generated a vast number of ballads, broadsides, images, and novels (see [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s ''[[Evangeline]]'', [[Benjamin West]]'s ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'', [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''), maps and other printed materials, which testify to how this event held the imagination of the British and North American public long after Wolfe's death in 1759.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=People&PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault: \"Canadiana\"], Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===South America===\n{{See also|Fantastic War|First Cevallos expedition}}\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|The bombardment of [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]] on [[Havana]], 1763]]\n\nIn South America (1763), the Portuguese conquered most of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] valley from Spain,<ref>Ojer, Pablo- [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22de+los+cuales+fueron+desalojados+por+los+portugueses%22&btnG=Pesquisar+livros&tbm=bks&tbo=1&hl=pt-PT&gws_rd=ssl  '' La D\u00e9cada Fundamental en la Controversia de L\u00edmites entre Venezuela y Colombia, 1881\u20131891''] (in Spanish), Academia Nacional de la Historia, 1988, [https://books.google.com/books?id=l4dsAAAAMAAJ&q=%22de+los+cuales+fueron+desalojados+por+los+portugueses%22&dq=%22de+los+cuales+fueron+desalojados+por+los+portugueses%22 p. 292].</ref><ref>United States Army Corps of Engineers- [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22S%C3%A3o+Gabriel+was+founded+during+the+Portuguese+conquest+in+1763%2C%22&btnG=Pesquisar+livros&tbm=bks&tbo=1 ''Report on Orinoco-Casiquiare-Negro Waterway.

Negotiations had started there on 31 December 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.  Saxony emerged from the war weakened and bankrupt; despite losing no territory, Saxony had essentially been a battleground between Prussia and Austria throughout the conflict, with many of its towns and cities (including the capital of Dresden) damaged by bombardment and looting.\n\nAustria was not able to retake Silesia or make any significant territorial gain. However, it did prevent Prussia from invading parts of Saxony. More significantly, its military performance proved far better than during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms. Hence, Austria's prestige was restored in great part and the empire secured its position as a major player in the European system.<ref>Maria Teresa of Austria; Jean-Paul Bled</ref> Also, by promising to vote for Joseph II in the Imperial elections, Frederick II accepted the Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire. The survival of Prussia as a first-rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and its army, however, was potentially damaging in the long run to Austria's influence in Germany.\n\nNot only that, Austria now found herself estranged with the new developments within the empire itself. Beside the rise of Prussia, [[Augustus III]], although ineffective, could muster an army not only from Saxony, but also Poland, since he was also the King of Poland as well as Elector of Saxony. Bavaria's growing power and independence was also apparent as it asserted more control on the deployment of its army, and managed to disengage from the war at its own will. Most importantly, with the now belligerent Hanover united personally under [[George III of Great Britain]], It amassed a considerable power, and even brought Britain in on future conflicts. This power dynamic was important to the future and the latter conflicts of the ''Reich''. The war also proved that Maria Theresa's reforms were still insufficient to compete with Prussia: unlike its enemy, the Austrians were almost bankrupt at the end of war. Hence, she dedicated the next two decades to the consolidation of her administration.\n\nPrussia emerged from the war as a great power whose importance could no longer be challenged. Frederick the Great's personal reputation was enormously enhanced, as his debt to fortune (Russia's volte-face after Elizabeth's death) and to British financial support were soon forgotten, while the memory of his energy and his military genius was strenuously kept alive.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> Though depicted as a key moment in Prussia's rise to greatness, the war weakened Prussia.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> Prussia's lands and population were devastated, though Frederick's extensive agrarian reforms and encouragement of immigration soon solved both these problems.  Unfortunately for Prussia, its army had taken heavy losses (particularly the officer corps), and in the war's aftermath, Frederick could not afford to rebuild the Prussian Army to what it was before the war.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> In the War of the Bavarian Succession, the Prussians fought poorly despite being led by Frederick in person.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> During the war with France in 1792\u20131795, the Prussian Army did not fare well against revolutionary France, and in 1806, the Prussians were annihilated by the French at the Battle of Jena.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> It was only after 1806 when Prussian government brought in reforms to recover from the disaster of Jena that Prussia's rise to greatness later in the 19th century was realized.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> However, none of this had happened yet, and after 1763, various nations all sent officers to Prussia to learn the secrets of Prussia's military power.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> After the Seven Years' War, Prussia become one of the most imitated powers in Europe.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> \n \nRussia, on the other hand, made one great invisible gain from the war: the elimination of French influence in Poland.

In 1763, [[Pontiac's War]] broke out as a group of Indian tribes in the Great Lakes region and the Northwest (the modern American Midwest) said to have been led by the Ottawa chief Pontiac (whose role as the leader of the confederation seems to have been exaggerated by the British), unhappy with the eclipse of French power, rebelled against British rule. The Indians had long established congenial and friendly relations with the French fur traders, and the Anglo-American fur traders who had replaced the French had engaged in business practices that enraged the Indians, who complained about being cheated when they sold their furs.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel pages 84-85\">Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 pages 84\u201385.</ref> Moreover, the Indians feared that with the coming of British rule might lead to white settlers displacing them off their land, whereas it was known that the French had only come as fur traders.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel pages 84-85\"/> Pontiac's War was a major conflict in which the British temporarily lost control of the Great Lakes-Northwest regions to the Indians.<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 pages 85\u201387.</ref> By the middle of 1763, the only forts the British held in the region were Fort Detroit (modern Detroit, Michigan ), Fort Niagara (modern Youngstown, New York) and Fort Pitt (modern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) with the rest all being lost to the Indians.<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 page 86.</ref> It was only with the British victory at the [[Battle of Bushy Run]] that prevented a complete collapse of British power in the Great Lakes region.<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 page 87.</ref> King George&nbsp;III's [[Proclamation of 1763]], which forbade white settlement beyond the crest of the Appalachians, was intended to appease the Indians but led to considerable outrage in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], whose inhabitants were eager to acquire native lands.

It involved all five European [[great power]]s of the time plus many of the [[middle powers]] and spanned five continents, affecting Europe, the Americas, West Africa, India, and the Philippines. The conflict split Europe into two coalitions: one was led by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and included the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], the [[Electorate of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (also named Hanover), and a few other small German states; while the other was led by the [[Kingdom of France]] and included the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian-led]] [[Holy Roman Empire]], including the [[Electorate of Saxony]] and most of the smaller German states, the [[Russian Empire]] (until 1762), the [[Bourbon Spain|Kingdom of Spain]], and [[Sweden]]. The [[Dutch Republic]], [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], the Italian States, and the [[Ottoman Empire]] did not participate. Meanwhile, in India, some regional polities within the increasingly fragmented [[Mughal Empire]], with the support of the French, failed to defeat a British attempt to conquer [[Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad|Bengal]].\n\nAlthough Anglo-French skirmishes over their American colonies had begun in 1754, with what became known in the United States as the [[French and Indian War]], the large-scale conflict that drew in most of the European powers was centered on Austria's desire to recover [[Silesia]] from Prussia. Seeing the opportunity to curtail Britain's and Prussia's ever-growing might, France and Austria put aside their [[French\u2013Habsburg relations|ancient rivalry]] to form a grand coalition of their own, bringing most of the other European powers to their side. Faced with this sudden turn of events, Britain aligned itself with Prussia, in a series of political manoeuvres known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]]. However, French efforts ended in failure when the Anglo-Prussian coalition prevailed, and Britain's rise as among the world's [[superpower|predominant powers]] destroyed France's supremacy in Europe, thus altering the [[European balance of power]].\n\n== Summary ==\nConflict between Great Britain and France broke out in 1754\u20131756 when the British attacked disputed French positions in North America.  Hostilities were heightened when a British unit led by a 22-year-old Lt. Colonel [[George Washington]] ambushed a small French force at the [[Battle of Jumonville Glen]] on 28 May 1754.  The conflict exploded across the colonial boundaries and extended to the seizure of hundreds of French merchant ships at sea. Meanwhile, Prussia, a rising power, struggled with [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] for dominance within and outside the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in central Europe. In 1756, the four greatest powers (Great Britain, France, Prussia and Austria) \"[[Diplomatic Revolution|switched partners]]\".\n\nRealizing that war was imminent, [[Prussia]] pre-emptively struck [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and quickly [[Siege of Pirna|overran]] it. The result caused uproar across Europe. Because of Austria's [[Treaty of Versailles (1756)|alliance with France]] to recapture [[Silesia]], which had been lost in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Prussia formed an [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|alliance with Britain]]. Reluctantly, by following the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial diet of the Holy Roman Empire]] (Empire), which [[Reichskrieg|declared war on Prussia]] on 17 January 1757, most of the states of the empire joined Austria's cause. The Anglo-Prussian alliance was joined by a few smaller [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|German states]] within the empire (most notably the [[Electorate of Hanover]] but also Brunswick and Hesse-Kassel). [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], seeking to regain Pomerania (most of which had been lost to Prussia in previous wars) joined the coalition, seeing its chance when all the major continental powers of Europe opposed Prussia. [[Bourbon Spain|Spain]], bound by the [[Pacte de Famille]], intervened on behalf of France and together they launched an unsuccessful [[Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)|invasion of Portugal]] in 1762. The [[Russian Empire]] was originally aligned with Austria, fearing Prussia's ambition on the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but switched sides upon the succession of Tsar [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] in 1762.\n \nMany middle and small powers in Europe, as in the previous wars, tried steering away from the escalating conflict, even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents. [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], for instance, was close to being dragged into the war on France's side when [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]] became Russian emperor and switched sides; Dano-Norwegian and Russian armies were close to ending up in battle, but the Russian emperor was deposed before war formally broke out. The [[Dutch Republic]], a long-time British ally, kept its neutrality intact, fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe, and even [[Battle of Chinsurah|tried to prevent]] Britain's domination in India. [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]-[[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Savoy]], although sided with the Franco-Spanish alliance, declined to join the coalition under fear of British naval power. The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship, being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] in 1759 to complete her addition to the [[Winter Palace]]. Like Sweden, Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia.\n \nThe war ended with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] between France, Spain and Great Britain and the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]] between Saxony, Austria and Prussia, in 1763.\n \nThe war was successful for Great Britain, which gained the bulk of [[New France]] in North America, [[Spanish Florida]], some individual [[Caribbean]] islands in the [[West Indies]], the colony of [[Senegal]] on the West African coast, and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent. The [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American tribes]] were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as [[Pontiac's War]], which was a small scale war between the indigenous tribe known as the [[Odawas]] and the British, where the Odawas claimed seven of the ten forts created or taken by the British to show them that they need to distribute land equally amongst their allies, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status. In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but with a combination of good luck and successful strategy, King [[Frederick the Great]] managed to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''. Prussia solidified its position as a newer European great power. Although Austria failed to retrieve the territory of Silesia from Prussia (its original goal), its military prowess was also noted by the other powers. The involvement of Portugal and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle. Spain lost Florida but gained [[French Louisiana]] and regained control of its colonies, e.g., [[History of Cuba|Cuba]] and [[Captaincy General of the Philippines|the Philippines]], which had been captured by the British during the war.\n\nThe Seven Years' War was perhaps the first true world war, having taken place almost 160 years before [[World War I]], and influenced many major events later around the globe. Winston Churchill described the conflict as the \"first world war\". The war restructured not only the European political order, but also affected events all around the world, paving the way for the beginning of [[Pax Britannica|later British world supremacy]] in the 19th century, the rise of Prussia in Germany (eventually replacing Austria as the leading German State), the beginning of [[American Revolution|tensions in British North America]], as well as a clear sign of [[French Revolution|France's eventual turmoil]]. It was characterized in Europe by sieges and the arson of towns as well as open battles with heavy losses.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nIn the historiography of some countries, the war is named after combatants in its respective theatres. In the present-day United States \u2013 at the time, the southern English-speaking British colonies in North America \u2013 the conflict is known as the '''[[French and Indian War]]''' (1754\u20131763). In English-speaking Canada \u2013 the balance of Britain's former North American colonies \u2013 it is called the '''Seven Years' War''' (1756\u20131763). In French-speaking Canada, it is known as ''La guerre de la Conqu\u00eate'' (the '''War of the Conquest'''). Swedish historiography uses the name ''Pommerska kriget'' ('''[[Pomeranian War]]'''), as the Sweden\u2013Prussian conflict in 1757\u20131762 was limited to [[Swedish Pomerania|Pomerania]] in northern central Germany.<ref name=fuessel7>F\u00fcssel (2010), p. 7.</ref> The '''[[Third Silesian War]]''' involved Prussia and Austria (1756\u20131763). On the Indian subcontinent, the conflict is called the [[Carnatic Wars|'''Third Carnatic War''']] (1757\u20131763).\n\nThe war has been described as the first \"[[world war]]\",<ref name=\"Bowen 1998 7\">{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=HV|year=1998|title=War and British Society 1688\u20131815|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-521-57645-1|page=7}}</ref> although this label was also given to various earlier conflicts like the [[Eighty Years' War]], the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], and to later conflicts like the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The term \"[[Second Hundred Years' War]]\" has been used in order to describe the almost continuous level of worldwide conflict between France and Great Britain during the entire 18th century, reminiscent of the [[Hundred Years' War]] of the 14th and 15th centuries.<ref>Tombs, Robert and Isabelle.

France had long claimed the entire [[Mississippi River]] basin. This was disputed by Britain. In the early 1750s the French began constructing a chain of forts in the [[Ohio River Valley]] to assert their claim and shield the Native American population from increasing British influence.\n\nThe British settlers along the coast were upset that French troops would now be close to the western borders of their colonies. They felt the French would encourage their tribal allies among the North American natives to attack them. Also, the British settlers wanted access to the fertile land of the Ohio River Valley for the new settlers that were flooding into the British colonies seeking farm land.<ref name=\"Anderson, p. 17\">Anderson, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe most important French fort planned was intended to occupy a position at \"the Forks\" where the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] and [[Monongahela River]]s meet to form the [[Ohio River]] (present day [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania). Peaceful British attempts to halt this fort construction were unsuccessful, and the French proceeded to build the fort they named [[Fort Duquesne]]. British colonial militia from Virginia were then sent to drive them out. Led by [[George Washington]], they ambushed a small French force at [[Battle of Jumonville Glen|Jumonville Glen]] on 28 May 1754 killing ten, including commander [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville|Jumonville]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 5\u20137.</ref> The French retaliated by attacking Washington's army at [[Battle of Fort Necessity|Fort Necessity]] on 3 July 1754 and forced Washington to surrender.<ref name=\"AndersonCrucible51_9\">Anderson (2000), pp. 51\u201365.</ref> These were the first engagements of what would become the worldwide Seven Years' War.\n\nNews of this arrived in Europe, where Britain and France unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a solution. The two nations eventually dispatched regular troops to North America to enforce their claims. The first British action was the assault on [[Acadia]] on 16 June 1755 in the [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]],<ref>Anderson, pp. 112\u2013115.</ref> which was immediately followed by their [[expulsion of the Acadians]].<ref>Anderson, p. 114.</ref> In July British Major General [[Edward Braddock]] led about 2,000 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition to retake Fort Duquesne, but [[Braddock Expedition|the expedition]] ended in disastrous defeat.<ref>Anderson, p. 77.</ref> In further action, Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] fired on the French ship ''[[French ship Alcide (1742)|Alcide]]'' [[action of 8 June 1755|on 8 June 1755]], capturing it and two troop ships. In September 1755, British colonial and French troops met in the inconclusive [[Battle of Lake George]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 119\u2013120.</ref>\n\nThe British also harassed French shipping beginning in August 1755, seizing hundreds of ships and capturing thousands of merchant seamen while the two nations were nominally at peace. Incensed, France prepared to attack Hanover, whose [[prince-elector]] was also the King of Great Britain and [[Menorca]]. Britain concluded a treaty whereby Prussia agreed to protect Hanover. In response France concluded an alliance with its long-time enemy Austria, an event known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].\n\n===In Europe===\n{{more citations needed section|date = May 2016}}\n[[File:SevenYearsWar.png|thumb|upright=1.6|All the participants of the Seven Years' War\n{{legend|#4D6DF3|Great Britain, Prussia, Portugal, with allies}}\n{{legend|#22B14C|France, Spain, Austria, Russia, Sweden with allies}}]]\n\nIn the [[War of the Austrian Succession]],<ref>Szabo, p. 2.</ref> which lasted from 1740 to 1748, King [[Frederick&nbsp;II of Prussia]], known as Frederick the Great, seized the prosperous province of [[Silesia]] from Austria. Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] had signed the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748 in order to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances.\n\nThe War of the Austrian Succession had seen the belligerents aligned on a time-honoured basis. France's traditional enemies, [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]], had coalesced just as they had done against Louis XIV. [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the leading anti-Austrian state in Germany, had been supported by France. Neither group, however, found much reason to be satisfied with its partnership: British subsidies to Austria produced nothing of much help to the British, while the British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria. Prussia, having secured Silesia, came to terms with Austria in disregard of French interests. Even so, France concluded a defensive alliance with Prussia in 1747, and the maintenance of the [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|Anglo-Austrian alignment]] after 1748 was deemed essential by the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]], British secretary of state in the ministry of his brother [[Henry Pelham]]. The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the \"[[diplomatic revolution]]\" or the \"reversal of alliances\".\n\nIn 1756 Austria was making military preparations for war with Prussia and pursuing an alliance with Russia for this purpose. On 2 June 1746, Austria and Russia concluded a defensive alliance that covered their own territory and [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] against attack by Prussia or the Ottoman Empire. They also agreed to a secret clause that promised the restoration of Silesia and the countship of Glatz (now [[K\u0142odzko]], Poland) to Austria in the event of hostilities with Prussia. Their real desire, however, was to destroy Frederick's power altogether, reducing his sway to his electorate of Brandenburg and giving [[East Prussia]] to Poland, an exchange that would be accompanied by the cession of the Polish [[Duchy of Courland]] to Russia. [[Alexey Bestuzhev-Ryumin]], grand chancellor of Russia under [[Empress Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]], was hostile to both France and Prussia, but he could not persuade Austrian statesman [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] to commit to offensive designs against Prussia so long as Prussia was able to rely on French support.\n\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|upright=1.25|left|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748]]\n\nThe Hanoverian king [[George II of Great Britain]] was passionately devoted to his family's continental holdings, but his commitments in Germany were counterbalanced by the demands of the British colonies overseas. If war against France for colonial expansion was to be resumed, then Hanover had to be secured against Franco-Prussian attack. France was very much interested in colonial expansion and was willing to exploit the vulnerability of Hanover in war against Great Britain, but it had no desire to divert forces to central Europe for Prussia's interest.\n\nFrench policy was, moreover, complicated by the existence of the ''[[Secret du Roi]]''\u2014a system of private diplomacy conducted by King Louis XV. Unbeknownst to his foreign minister, Louis had established a network of agents throughout Europe with the goal of pursuing personal political objectives that were often at odds with France's publicly stated policies. Louis's goals for ''le Secret du roi'' included the Polish crown for his kinsman [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois de Bourbon, prince de Conti]], and the maintenance of Poland, Sweden, and Turkey as French client states in opposition to Russian and Austrian interests.\n\nFrederick saw [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Royal Prussia|Polish west Prussia]] as potential fields for expansion but could not expect French support if he started an aggressive war for them. If he joined the French against the British in the hope of annexing Hanover, he might fall victim to an Austro-Russian attack. The hereditary elector of Saxony, [[Augustus III]], was also elective King of Poland as Augustus III, but the two territories were physically separated by Brandenburg and Silesia. Neither state could pose as a great power. Saxony was merely a buffer between Prussia and [[Austrian Bohemia]], whereas Poland, despite its union with the ancient lands of Lithuania, was prey to pro-French and pro-Russian factions. A Prussian scheme for compensating Frederick Augustus with Bohemia in exchange for Saxony obviously presupposed further spoliation of Austria.\n\nIn the attempt to satisfy Austria at the time, Britain gave their electoral vote in Hanover for the candidacy of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], as the Holy Roman Emperor, much to the dismay of Frederick and Prussia. Not only that, Britain would soon join the Austro-Russian alliance, but complications arose. Britain's basic framework for the alliance itself was to protect Hanover's interests against France. At the same time, Kaunitz kept approaching the French in the hope of establishing just such an alliance with Austria. Not only that, France had no intention to ally with Russia, who, years earlier, had meddled in France's affairs during Austria's succession war.  France also saw the dismemberment of Prussia as threatening to the stability of Central Europe.\n\nYears later, Kaunitz kept trying to establish France's alliance with Austria. He tried as hard as he could to avoid Austrian entanglement in Hanover's political affairs, and was even willing to trade [[Austrian Netherlands]] for France's aid in recapturing Silesia. Frustrated by this decision and by the [[Dutch Republic]]'s insistence on neutrality, Britain soon turned to Russia. On 30 September 1755, Britain pledged financial aid to Russia in order to station 50,000 troops on the Livonian-Lithuanian border, so they could defend Britain's interests in Hanover immediately. Besthuzev, assuming the preparation was directed against Prussia, was more than happy to obey the request of the British. Unbeknownst to the other powers, King George II also made overtures to the Prussian king, Frederick, who, fearing the Austro-Russian intentions, was also desirous of a rapprochement with Britain. On 16 January 1756, the [[Convention of Westminster]] was signed, whereby Britain and Prussia promised to aid one another; the parties hoped to achieve lasting peace and stability in Europe.\n\nThe carefully coded word in the agreement proved no less catalytic for the other European powers. The results were absolute chaos. Empress Elizabeth of Russia was outraged at the duplicity of Britain's position. Not only that, but France was enraged, and terrified, by the sudden betrayal of its only ally, Prussia. Austria, particularly Kaunitz, used this situation to their utmost advantage. Now-isolated France was forced to accede to the Austro-Russian alliance or face ruin. Thereafter, on 1 May 1756, the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] was signed, in which both nations pledged 24,000 troops to defend each other in the case of an attack. This diplomatic revolution proved to be an important cause of the war; although both treaties were ostensibly defensive in nature, the actions of both coalitions made the war virtually inevitable.\n\n===Methods and technologies===\n{{Further|Early modern warfare}}\nEuropean warfare in the [[early modern period]] was characterised by the widespread adoption of [[firearm]]s in combination with more traditional [[bladed weapons]]. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed [[infantry]] armed with [[smoothbore]] [[flintlock musket]]s and [[bayonet]]s. [[Cavalry]] units of various weights armed with [[sabre]]s and [[pistol]]s were used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[shock tactics]]. Smoothbore [[artillery]] provided [[fire support]] and played the leading role in [[siege warfare]].<ref name=\"Black 38\">{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=38\u201352}}</ref> Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key [[fortification]]s positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict, and decisive field battles relatively rare.<ref>{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=67\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe Seven Years' War and most European wars of the eighteenth century were fought as so-called [[cabinet wars]] in which disciplined [[regular armies]] were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|209}}</ref> [[Military logistics]] was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised [[Supply depot|magazines]] and distributed by [[baggage train]]s that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids.<ref>{{Harvp|Creveld|1977|pp=26\u201328}}</ref> Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established [[Cantonment|winter quarters]] in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring.<ref name=\"Black 38\"/>\n\n==Strategies==\n[[File:Erstes pr. Bataillon Leibgarde in Schlacht bei Kollin.jpg|thumb|Prussian [[Leibgarde (military)|Leibgarde]] battalion at Kolin, 1757]]\n\nFor much of the eighteenth century, France approached its wars in the same way. It would let colonies defend themselves or would offer only minimal help (sending them limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating that fights for the colonies would most likely be lost anyway.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pritchard|first=James|title=In Search of Empire: The French in the Americas, 1670\u20131730|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-82742-3|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kK9wa98I4eEC }}</ref> This strategy was to a degree forced upon France: geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to overseas colonies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dull|first=Jonathan R.|title=The French Navy and the Seven Years' War|year=2007|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln NE|isbn=978-0-8032-1731-7|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcsnvXeOdW4C }}</ref> Similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any French ruler.<ref name=borneman>{{cite book|last=Borneman|first=Walter R.|title=The French and Indian War: Deciding the Fate of North America|year=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-076184-4|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O7TZqbj_6BYC }}</ref> Given these military necessities, the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the continent, hoping for victories closer to home.<ref name=borneman/> The plan was to fight to the end of hostilities and then, in treaty negotiations, to trade territorial acquisitions in Europe to regain lost overseas possessions (as had happened in, ''e.g.'', the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)]]).

He also planned to use colonial forces from the thirteen American colonies, working under the command of British [[Regular army|regulars]], to invade New France.

On 29 August 1756, he led Prussian troops across the border of Saxony, one of the small German states in league with Austria. He intended this as a bold pre-emption of an anticipated Austro-French invasion of Silesia. He had three goals in his new war on Austria. First, he would seize Saxony and eliminate it as a threat to Prussia, then use the Saxon army and treasury to aid the Prussian war effort. His second goal was to advance into Bohemia, where he might set up winter quarters at Austria's expense. Thirdly, he wanted to invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at Olm\u00fctz, and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 427.\">Asprey, p. 427.</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle of Lobositz.png|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Battle of Lobositz]].

Sweden declared war on Prussia and invaded Pomerania with 17,000 men.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 460\"/> Sweden felt this small army was all that was needed to occupy Pomerania and felt the Swedish army would not need to engage with the Prussians because the Prussians were occupied on so many other fronts.\n\n[[File:Batte of Leuthen.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Leuthen]] by [[Carl R\u00f6chling]]]]\n[[File:Frederick the Great and his staff at the Battle of Leuthen by Hugo Ungewitter.jpg|thumb|Frederick and staff at Leuthen]]\n\nThings were looking grim for Prussia now, with the Austrians mobilising to attack Prussian-controlled soil and a combined French and ''[[Reichsarmee]]'' army under [[Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise|Prince Soubise]] approaching from the west. The ''Reichsarmee'' was a collection of armies from the smaller German states that had banded together to heed the appeal of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz I]] of Austria against Frederick.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 41\">Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 41.</ref> However, in November and December 1757, the whole situation in Germany was reversed. First, Frederick devastated Soubise's forces at the [[Battle of Rossbach]] on 5 November 1757<ref>Asprey, pp. 469\u2013472.</ref> and then routed a vastly superior Austrian force at the [[Battle of Leuthen]] on 5 December 1757.<ref>Asprey, pp. 476\u2013481.</ref> Rossbach was the only battle between the French and the Prussians during the entire war.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 41\"/> At Rossbach, the Prussians lost about 548 men killed while the Franco-''Reichsarmee'' force under Soubise lost about 10,000 killed.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 42\">Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 42.</ref> Frederick always called Leuthen his greatest victory, an assessment shared by many at the time as the Austrian Army was considered to be a highly professional force.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 42\"/> With these victories, Frederick once again established himself as Europe's premier general and his men as Europe's most accomplished soldiers.  However, Frederick missed an opportunity to completely destroy the Austrian army at Leuthen; although depleted, it escaped back into Bohemia.  He hoped the two smashing victories would bring Maria Theresa to the peace table, but she was determined not to negotiate until she had re-taken Silesia.  Maria Theresa also improved the Austrians' command after Leuthen by replacing her incompetent brother-in-law, [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]], with von Daun, who was now a field marshal.\n\nThis problem was compounded when the main Hanoverian army under Cumberland, which include Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick troops, was defeated at the [[Battle of Hastenbeck]] and forced to surrender entirely at the [[Convention of Klosterzeven]] following a [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|French Invasion of Hanover]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 211\u201312.</ref> The convention removed Hanover from the war, leaving the western approach to Prussian territory extremely vulnerable. Frederick sent urgent requests to Britain for more substantial assistance, as he was now without any outside military support for his forces in Germany.<ref>Anderson, pp. 176\u201377.</ref>\n\nCalculating that no further Russian advance was likely until 1758, Frederick moved the bulk of his eastern forces to Pomerania under the command of Marshal Lehwaldt, where they were to repel the Swedish invasion. In short order, the Prussian army drove the Swedes back, occupied most of [[Swedish Pomerania]], and blockaded its capital [[Stralsund]].<ref>Asprey, p. 473.</ref> [[George&nbsp;II of Great Britain]], on the advice of his British ministers after the battle of Rossbach, revoked the Convention of Klosterzeven, and Hanover reentered the war.<ref>Anderson, pp. 215\u201316.</ref> Over the winter the new commander of the Hanoverian forces, [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick]] (until immediately before a commander in the Prussian Army), regrouped his army and launched a series of offensives that drove the French back across the [[River Rhine]].  Ferdinand's forces kept Prussia's western flank secure for the rest of the war.<ref>Asprey, p. 486.</ref>\nThe British had suffered further defeats in North America, particularly at [[Fort William Henry]]. At home, however, stability had been established. Since 1756, successive governments led by [[Thomas Pelham-Holles|Newcastle]] and Pitt had fallen. In August 1757, the two men agreed to a political partnership and formed a [[coalition government]] that gave new, firmer direction to the war effort. The new strategy emphasised both Newcastle's commitment to British involvement on the continent, particularly in defence of its German possessions, and Pitt's determination to use naval power to seize [[French colonies]] around the globe. This \"dual strategy\" would dominate British policy for the next five years.\n\nBetween 10 and 17 October 1757, a Hungarian general, Count [[Andr\u00e1s Hadik]], serving in the Austrian army, executed what may be the most famous [[hussar]] action in history. When the Prussian king, Frederick, was marching south with his powerful armies, the Hungarian general unexpectedly swung his force of 5,000, mostly hussars, around the Prussians and occupied part of their capital, Berlin, for one night.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 467.\">Asprey, p. 467.</ref> The city was spared for a negotiated ransom of 200,000 thalers.<ref name=\"Asprey, p. 467.\"/> When Frederick heard about this humiliating occupation, he immediately sent a larger force to free the city. Hadik, however, left the city with his hussars and safely reached the Austrian lines. Subsequently, Hadik was promoted to the rank of marshal in the Austrian Army.\n\n===1758===\nIn early 1758, Frederick launched an invasion of [[Moravia]] and laid siege to [[Olm\u00fctz]] (now [[Olomouc]], Czech Republic).<ref>Asprey, p. 489.</ref> Following an Austrian victory at the [[Battle of Domstadtl]] that wiped out a supply convoy destined for Olm\u00fctz, Frederick broke off the siege and withdrew from Moravia. It marked the end of his final attempt to launch a major invasion of Austrian territory.<ref>Szabo, pp. 148\u201355.</ref> In January 1758, the Russians invaded [[East Prussia]], where the province, almost denuded of troops, put up little opposition.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 41\"/> East Prussia had been occupied by Russian forces over the winter and would remain under their control until 1762, although it was far less strategically valuable to Prussia than Brandenburg or Silesia.  In any case, Frederick did not see the Russians as an immediate threat and instead entertained hopes of first fighting a decisive battle against Austria that would knock them out of the war.\n\n[[File:Battle of Krefeld - Map of the area printed in The Gentleman's Magazine.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of Krefeld \u2013 a map of the area in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'']]\n\nIn April 1758, the British concluded the [[Anglo-Prussian Convention]] with Frederick in which they committed to pay him [[Golden Cavalry of St George|an annual subsidy]] of \u00a3670,000. Britain also dispatched 9,000 troops to reinforce Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, the first British troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of Pitt. Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, supplemented by some Prussian troops, had succeeded in driving the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of [[Emden]] in March 1758 before crossing the Rhine with his own forces, which caused alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the [[Battle of Krefeld]] and the brief occupation of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], he was compelled by the successful manoeuvering of larger French forces to withdraw across the Rhine.<ref>Szabo, pp. 179\u201382.</ref>\n\nBy this point Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder in Brandenburg-[[Neumark]], at the [[Battle of Zorndorf]] (now Sarbinowo, Poland), a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick on 25 August 1758, fought a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count [[William Fermor]].<ref>Asprey, pp. 494\u2013499.</ref> Both sides suffered heavy casualties \u2013 the Prussians 12,800, the Russians 18,000 \u2013 but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory.<ref>Szabo pp. 162\u201369.</ref> The American historian Daniel Marston described Zorndorf as a \"draw\" as both sides were too exhausted and had taken such losses that neither wished to fight another battle with the other.<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 page 54.</ref> In the undecided [[Battle of Tornow]] on 25 September, a Swedish army repulsed six assaults by a Prussian army but did not push on Berlin following the [[Battle of Fehrbellin (1758)|Battle of Fehrbellin]].<ref>Asprey, p. 500.</ref>\n\n[[File:La Pegna \u00dcberfall bei Hochkirch.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Hochkirch]]]]\n\nThe war was continuing indecisively when on 14 October Marshal Daun's Austrians surprised the main Prussian army at the [[Battle of Hochkirch]] in Saxony.<ref>Asprey, pp. 501\u2013506.</ref> Frederick lost much of his artillery but retreated in good order, helped by dense woods. The Austrians had ultimately made little progress in the campaign in Saxony despite Hochkirch and had failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. After a thwarted attempt to take Dresden, Daun's troops were forced to withdraw to Austrian territory for the winter, so that Saxony remained under Prussian occupation.<ref>Szabo, pp. 195\u2013202.</ref> At the same time, the Russians failed in an attempt to take [[Kolberg]] in Pomerania (now [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], Poland) from the Prussians.<ref>''The seven years war in Europe'', Szabo</ref>\n\nIn France, 1758 had been disappointing, and in the wake of this a new chief minister, the [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul|Duc de Choiseul]], was appointed. Choiseul planned to end the war in 1759 by making strong attacks on Britain and Hanover.\n\n===1759\u201360===\n[[File:HGM Findenigg Gefecht bei Maxen.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Maxen]]]]\n[[File:Kunersdorff.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Kunersdorf]]]]\n\nPrussia suffered several defeats in 1759. At the [[Battle of Kay]], or Paltzig, the Russian Count [[Pyotr Semyonovich Saltykov|Saltykov]] with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General [[Carl Heinrich von Wedel]]. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at [[Battle of Minden|Minden]], Austrian general [[Leopold Josef Graf Daun|Daun]] forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the [[Battle of Maxen]]. Frederick himself lost half his army in the [[Battle of Kunersdorf]] (now [[Kunowice]] Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at [[Battle of Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf|Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf]] (now Motornoye, Russia), and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.  However, disagreements with the Austrians over logistics and supplies resulted in the Russians withdrawing east yet again after Kunersdorf, ultimately enabling Frederick to re-group his shattered forces.\n\n[[File:Bataille des Cardinaux en 1759 peinte par Richard Paton.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Quiberon Bay]]]]\n[[File:Menzel - Battle of Liegnitz.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Liegnitz (1760)]]]]\n\nThe French [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|planned to invade the British Isles]] during 1759 by accumulating troops near the mouth of the Loire and concentrating their Brest and Toulon fleets. However, two sea defeats prevented this. In August, the Mediterranean fleet under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Clue-Sabran]] was scattered by a larger British fleet under [[Edward Boscawen]] at the [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Battle of Lagos]]. In the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]] on 20 November, the British admiral [[Edward Hawke]] with 23 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] caught the French Brest fleet with 21 ships of the line under [[Marshal de Conflans]] and sank, captured, or forced many of them aground, putting an end to the French plans.\n\nThe year 1760 brought yet more Prussian disasters. The general [[Heinrich August, Baron de la Motte Fouqu\u00e9|Fouqu\u00e9]] was defeated by the Austrians in the [[Battle of Landshut (1760)|Battle of Landshut]]. The French captured [[Marburg]] in Hesse and the Swedes part of [[Pomerania]]. The Hanoverians were victorious over the French at the [[Battle of Warburg]], their continued success preventing France from sending troops to aid the Austrians against Prussia in the east.\n\nDespite this, the Austrians, under the command of [[Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon|General Laudon]], captured [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]] (now [[K\u0142odzko]], Poland) in Silesia. In the [[Battle of Liegnitz (1760)|Battle of Liegnitz]] Frederick scored a strong victory despite being outnumbered three to one. The Russians under [[Pyotr Saltykov|General Saltykov]] and Austrians under [[Franz Moritz Graf von Lacy|General Lacy]] briefly occupied his capital, Berlin, in October, but could not hold it for long. Still, the loss of Berlin to the Russians and Austrians was a great blow to Frederick's prestige as many pointed out that the Prussians had no hope of occupying temporarily or otherwise St. Petersburg or Vienna. In November 1760 Frederick was once more victorious, defeating the able Daun in the [[Battle of Torgau]], but he suffered very heavy casualties, and the Austrians retreated in good order.\n\nMeanwhile, after the battle of Kunersdorf, the Russian army was mostly inactive due mostly to their tenuous supply lines.<ref>Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 74.</ref> Russian logistics were so poor that in October 1759, an agreement was signed under which the Austrians undertook to supply the Russians as the quartermaster's department of the Russian Army was badly strained by the demands of Russian armies operating so far from home.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 22\"/> As it was, the requirement that the Austrian quartermaster's department supply both the Austrian and Russian armies proved beyond its capacity, and in practice, the Russians received little in the way of supplies from the Austrians.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 22\"/> At [[Liegnitz]] (now [[Legnica]], Poland), the Russians arrived too late to participate in the battle. They made two attempts to storm the fortress of Kolberg, but neither succeeded. The tenacious resistance of Kolberg allowed Frederick to focus on the Austrians instead of having to split his forces.\n\n===1761\u201362===\n{{See also|Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)}}\n[[File:7yearswar.PNG|thumb|Operations of Russian army on Polish-Lithuanian territory, 1756\u20131763]]\n\nPrussia began the 1761 campaign with just 100,000 available troops, many of them new recruits, and its situation seemed desperate.<ref>Anderson, p. 491.</ref> However, the Austrian and Russian forces were also heavily depleted and could not launch a major offensive.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\nIn February 1761 [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick]] surprised French troops at [[Battle of Langensalza (1761)|Langensalza]] and then advanced to [[Siege of Cassel (1761)|besiege Cassel]] in March. He was forced to lift the siege and retreat after French forces regrouped and captured several thousand of his men at the [[Battle of Gr\u00fcnberg]]. At the [[Battle of Villinghausen]], forces under Ferdinand defeated a 92,000-man French army.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\nOn the eastern front, progress was very slow. The Russian army was heavily dependent upon its main magazines in Poland, and the Prussian army launched several successful raids against them. One of them, led by general Platen in September resulted in the loss of 2,000 Russians, mostly captured, and the destruction of 5,000 wagons.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War, 1756\u20131763'', Herbert Redman</ref> Deprived of men, the Prussians had to resort to this new sort of warfare, raiding, to delay the advance of their enemies.  Frederick's army, though depleted, was left unmolested at its headquarters in Brunzelwitz, as both the Austrians and the Russians were hesitant to attack it. Nonetheless, at the end of 1761, Prussia suffered two critical setbacks. The Russians under [[Zakhar Chernyshev]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|stormed Kolberg in Pomerania]], while the Austrians captured [[Schweidnitz]]. The loss of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the [[Baltic Sea]].<ref>Anderson, p. 492.</ref> A major problem for the Russians throughout the war had always been their weak logistics, which prevented their generals from following up their victories, and now with the fall of Kolberg, the Russians could at long last supply their armies in Central Europe via the sea.<ref name=\"Stone, David page 75\">Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 75.</ref> The fact that the Russians could now supply their armies over the sea, which was considerably faster and safer (Prussian cavalry could not intercept Russian ships in the Baltic) than over the land threatened to swing the balance of power decisively against Prussia, as Frederick could not spare any troops to protect his capital.<ref name=\"Stone, David page 75\"/> In Britain, it was speculated that a total Prussian collapse was now imminent.{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\n[[File:Fall of Kolberg in 1761.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siege of Kolberg (1761)]]]]\n\nBritain now threatened to withdraw its subsidies if Frederick did not consider offering concessions to secure peace. As the Prussian armies had dwindled to just 60,000 men and with Berlin itself about to come under siege, the survival of both Prussia and its King was severely threatened. Then on 5 January 1762 the Russian [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]] died. Her Prussophile successor, [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], at once ended the Russian occupation of East Prussia and Pomerania (see: the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)]]) and mediated Frederick's truce with Sweden.  He also placed a corps of his own troops under Frederick's command. Frederick was then able to muster a larger army, of 120,000 men, and concentrate it against Austria.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He drove them from much of Silesia after [[Siege of Schweidnitz (1762)|recapturing Schweidnitz]], while his brother Henry won a victory in Saxony in the [[Battle of Freiberg]] (29 October 1762). At the same time, his Brunswick allies captured the key town of [[G\u00f6ttingen]] and compounded this by [[Siege of Cassel|taking Cassel]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2018}}\n\nIn 1762 two new countries entered the war. Britain declared war against [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] on 4 January 1762; Spain reacted by issuing its own declaration of war against Britain on 18 January.<ref name=Fish2003p2>{{Harvnb|Fish|2003|p=2}}</ref> Portugal followed by joining the war on Britain's side. Spain, aided by the French, [[Invasion of Portugal (1762)|launched an invasion]] of Portugal and succeeded in [[Siege of Almeida (1762)|capturing Almeida]]. The arrival of British reinforcements stalled a further Spanish advance, and in the [[Battle of Valencia de Alc\u00e1ntara]] British-Portuguese forces overran a major Spanish supply base.

He therefore made peace with Frederick and evacuated Prussia's Rhineland territories, ending France's involvement in the war in Germany.{{sfn|Mitford|2013|p=242\u2013243}}\n\n===1763===\n{{further|Treaty of Hubertusburg|Treaty of Paris (1763)}}\n[[File:Hubertusburg Allegorie.jpg|thumb|[[Treaty of Hubertusburg]]]]\n\nBy 1763, the war in central Europe was essentially a stalemate between Prussia and Austria. Prussia had retaken nearly all of Silesia from the Austrians after Frederick's narrow victory over Daun at the Battle of Burkersdorf.  After his brother Henry's 1762 victory at the Battle of Freiberg, Frederick held most of Saxony but not its capital, Dresden. His financial situation was not dire, but his kingdom was devastated and his army severely weakened. His manpower had dramatically decreased, and he had lost so many effective officers and generals that an offensive against Dresden seemed impossible.<ref name=\"Frederick II, Jean-Paul Bled\"/> British subsidies had been stopped by the new prime minister, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], and the Russian emperor had been overthrown by his wife, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]], who ended Russia's alliance with Prussia and withdrew from the war. Austria, however, like most participants, was facing a severe financial crisis and had to decrease the size of its army, which greatly affected its offensive power.<ref name=\"Frederick II, Jean-Paul Bled\"/> Indeed, after having effectively sustained a long war, its administration was in disarray.<ref>''The emergence of the Eastern powers'', Hamish Scott</ref> By that time, it still held Dresden, the southeastern parts of Saxony, and the county of Glatz in southern Silesia, but the prospect of victory was dim without Russian support, and Maria Theresa had largely given up her hopes of re-conquering Silesia; her Chancellor, husband and eldest son were all urging her to make peace, while Daun was hesitant to attack Frederick. In 1763 a peace settlement was reached at the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], in which Glatz was returned to Prussia in exchange for the Prussian evacuation of Saxony. This ended the war in central Europe.\n\nThe stalemate had really been reached by 1759\u20131760, and Prussia and Austria were nearly out of money. The materials of both sides had been largely consumed. Frederick was no longer receiving subsidies from Britain; the Golden Cavalry of St. George had produced nearly 13 million dollars (equivalent). He had melted and coined most of the church silver, had ransacked the palaces of his kingdom and coined that silver, and reduced his purchasing power by mixing it with copper. His banks' capital was exhausted, and he had pawned nearly everything of value from his own estate.

The expedition set out on 8 September 1757, [[John Mordaunt (general)|Sir John Mordaunt]] commanding the troops and [[Edward Hawke|Sir Edward Hawke]] the fleet. On 23 September the [[Isle d'Aix]] was taken, but military staff dithered and lost so much time that Rochefort became unassailable.<ref name=\"Combined1\">Julian Corbett, ''England in the Seven Years' War: A Study in Combined Strategy'', 2 Vols., (London, 1918).</ref> The expedition abandoned the Isle d'Aix, returning to Great Britain on 1 October.\n\n[[File:William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham by William Hoare.jpg|thumb|Under Pitt's leadership, Britain's position as the leading colonial power was confirmed by the Seven Years' War.]]\n\nDespite the debatable strategic success and the operational failure of the descent on Rochefort, William Pitt\u2014who saw purpose in this type of asymmetric enterprise\u2014prepared to continue such operations.<ref name=\"Combined1\"/> An army was assembled under the command of [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough]]; he was aided by [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Sackville]]. The naval squadron and transports for the expedition were commanded by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]]. The army landed on 5 June 1758 at [[Cancalle Bay]], proceeded to [[St.&nbsp;Malo]], and, finding that it would take prolonged siege to capture it, instead attacked the nearby port of St.&nbsp;Servan. It burned shipping in the harbor, roughly 80 French privateers and merchantmen, as well as four warships which were under construction.<ref>N. A. M. Rodger, ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain'', 1649\u20131815, (London, 2004)</ref> The force then re-embarked under threat of the arrival of French relief forces. An attack on [[Le Havre|Havre de Grace]] was called off, and the fleet sailed on to [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]; the weather being bad and provisions low, that too was abandoned, and the expedition returned having damaged French privateering and provided further strategic demonstration against the French coast.\n\nPitt now prepared to send troops into Germany; and both Marlborough and Sackville, disgusted by what they perceived as the futility of the \"descents\", obtained commissions in that army. The elderly [[Thomas Bligh|General Bligh]] was appointed to command a new \"descent\", escorted by Howe. The campaign began propitiously with the [[Raid on Cherbourg]]. Covered by naval bombardment, the army drove off the French force detailed to oppose their landing, captured Cherbourg, and destroyed its fortifications, docks, and shipping.\n\nThe troops were reembarked and moved to the [[Bay of St.&nbsp;Lunaire]] in Brittany where, on 3 September, they were landed to operate against St.&nbsp;Malo; however, this action proved impractical. Worsening weather forced the two armies to separate: the ships sailed for the safer anchorage of [[Saint-Cast-le-Guildo|St.&nbsp;Cast]], while the army proceeded overland. The tardiness of Bligh in moving his forces allowed a French force of 10,000 from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to catch up with him and open fire on the reembarkation troops. At the [[battle of Saint Cast]] a rear-guard of 1,400 under [[Alexander Dury|Dury]] held off the French while the rest of the army embarked. They could not be saved; 750, including Dury, were killed and the rest captured.\n\n==Colonies==\n{{Campaignbox Seven Years' War: West Indies}}\nThe colonial conflict mainly between France and Britain took place in India, North America, Europe, the [[Caribbean]] isles, the [[Philippines]], and coastal Africa. Over the course of the war, Great Britain gained enormous areas of land and influence at the expense of the French.\n\nGreat Britain lost [[Menorca]] in the Mediterranean to the French in 1756 but captured the French colonies in [[Senegal]] in 1758. The British [[Royal Navy]] took the French sugar colonies of [[Invasion of Guadeloupe (1759)|Guadeloupe]] in 1759 and [[British expedition against Martinique|Martinique]] in 1762 as well as the Spanish cities of [[British expedition against Cuba|Havana in Cuba]], and [[Battle of Manila (1762)|Manila]] in the Philippines, both prominent Spanish colonial cities. However, expansion into the hinterlands of both cities met with stiff resistance. In the Philippines, the British were [[British occupation of Manila|confined to Manila]] until their agreed upon withdrawal at the war's end.\n\n===North America===\n{{Main|French and Indian War}}\n{{Campaignbox French and Indian War}}\n{{Campaignbox French and Indian War: Maritimes}}\n{{Campaignbox French and Indian War: Ohio Valley}}\n[[File:Carte Guerre de 7 ans Am\u00e9rique du nord.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.4|French and British positions during the first four years of the war\n{{legend|#F4A8C8|British territory, forts and settlements |textcolor=#FF002F |text=\u25a0 \u25d8 }}\n{{legend|#A8C4F4|French territory, forts and settlements |textcolor=#425BFC |text=\u25a0 \u25d8 }}\n]]\n\nDuring the war, the [[Iroquois#French and Indian Wars|Seven Nations of The Iroquois Confederacy]] were allied with the British. Native Americans of the Laurentian valley\u2014the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], the [[Abenaki people|Abenaki]], the [[Huron people|Huron]], and others, were allied with the French. Although the Algonquin tribes living north of the Great Lakes and along the St. Lawrence River were not directly concerned with the fate of the Ohio River Valley tribes, they had been victims of the Iroquois Confederation which included the Seneca, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Tuscarora tribes of central New York. The Iroquois had encroached on Algonquin territory and pushed the Algonquins west beyond Lake Michigan and to the shore of the St. Lawrence.<ref>Anderson, p. 14.</ref> Therefore, the Algonquin tribes were interested in fighting against the Iroquois. Throughout New England, New York, and the North-west Native American tribes formed differing alliances with the major belligerents.\n\nIn 1756 and 1757 the French captured forts [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)|Oswego]]<ref>Anderson, pp. 150\u2013157.</ref> and [[Siege of Fort William Henry|William Henry]] from the British.<ref>Anderson, pp. 185\u2013201.</ref> The latter victory was marred when France's native allies broke the terms of capitulation and attacked the retreating British column, which was under French guard, slaughtering and scalping soldiers and taking captive many men, women and children while the French refused to protect their captives.<ref name=\"Dodge91_2\">Dodge, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> French naval deployments in 1757 also [[Louisbourg Expedition (1757)|successfully defended]] the key [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] on [[Cape Breton Island]] called Ile du Roi by the French, securing the seaward approaches to Quebec.<ref>Anderson, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref>\n\nBritish Prime Minister William Pitt's focus on the colonies for the 1758 campaign paid off with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|taking of Louisbourg]] after French reinforcements were blocked by British naval victory in the [[Battle of Cartagena (1758)|Battle of Cartagena]] and in the successful [[Forbes Expedition|capture of Fort Duquesne]]<ref>Anderson, p. 280\u2013283.</ref> and [[Battle of Fort Frontenac|Fort Frontenac]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 258\u2013266.</ref> The British also continued the process of deporting the Acadian population with a wave of major operations against [[Ile Saint-Jean Campaign|\u00cele Saint-Jean]] (present-day [[Prince Edward Island]]), the [[St. John River Campaign|St.&nbsp;John River valley]], and the [[Petitcodiac River Campaign|Petitcodiac River valley]]. The celebration of these successes was dampened by their embarrassing defeat in the [[Battle of Carillon]] (Ticonderoga), in which 4,000 French troops repulsed 16,000 British. When the British led by generals [[James Abercrombie (British Army officer, born 1706)|James Abercrombie]] and [[George Howe, 3rd Viscount Howe|George Howe]] attacked, they believed that the French led by general [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm|Marquis de Montcalm]] were defended only by a small [[abatis]] which could be taken easily given the British force's significant numerical advantage. The British offensive which was supposed to advance in tight columns and overwhelm the French defenders fell into confusion and scattered, leaving large spaces in their ranks. When the French [[Chevalier de Levis]] sent 1,000 soldiers to reinforce Montcalm's struggling troops, the British were pinned down in the brush by intense French musket fire and they were forced to retreat.\n\nAll of Britain's campaigns against New France succeeded in 1759, part of what became known as an [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|''Annus Mirabilis'']]. [[Battle of Fort Niagara|Fort Niagara]]<ref>Anderson, pp. 330\u2013339.</ref> and [[Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)|Fort Carillon]]<ref>Anderson, pp. 240\u2013249.</ref> on 8 July 1758 fell to sizable British forces, cutting off French frontier forts further west. Starting in June 1759, the British under [[James Wolfe]] and [[James Murray (British Army officer, born 1721)|James Murray]] set up camp on the Ile d'Orleans across the St. Lawrence River from Quebec, enabling them to commence the 3-month siege that ensued. The French under the Marquis de Montcalm anticipated a British assault to the east of Quebec so he ordered his soldiers to fortify the region of [[Beauport, Quebec City|Beauport]]. On 31 July the [[Battle of Beauport|British attacked]] with 4,000 soldiers but the French positioned high up on the cliffs overlooking the [[Montmorency Falls]] forced the British forces to withdraw to the Ile D'Orleans. While Wolfe and Murray planned a second offensive, British rangers raided French settlements along the St. Lawrence, destroying food supplies, ammunition and other goods in an attempt to vanquish the French through starvation.\n\n[[File:The Death of General Wolfe B.West,1770.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771), on the Plains of Abraham, near Quebec]]\n\nOn 13 September 1759, General James Wolfe led 5,000 troops up a goat path to the [[Plains of Abraham]], 1 mile west of Quebec City. <!--the following passage seems to go into far too much detail about one battle for an article on an entire war-->\nHe had positioned his army between Montcalm's forces an hour's march to the east and [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville|Bougainville]]'s regiments to the west, which could be mobilised within 3 hours. Instead of waiting for a coordinated attack with Bougainville, Montcalm attacked immediately.  When his 3,500 troops advanced, their lines became scattered in a disorderly formation.  Many French soldiers fired before they were within range of striking the British.  Wolfe organised his troops in two lines stretching 1 mile across the Plains of Abraham.  They were ordered to load their Brown Bess muskets with two bullets to obtain maximum power and hold their fire until the French soldiers came within 40 paces of the British ranks.  When Montcalm's army was within range of the British, their volley was powerful and nearly all bullets hit their targets, devastating the French ranks.  The French fled the Plains of Abraham in a state of utter confusion while they were pursued by members of the Scottish Fraser regiment and other British forces.  Despite being cut down by musket fire from the Canadiens and their indigenous allies, the British vastly outnumbered these opponents and won the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 355\u2013360.</ref> General Wolfe was mortally wounded in the chest early in the battle so the command fell to James Murray, who would become the lieutenant governor of Quebec after the war.  The Marquis de Montcalm was also severely wounded later in the battle and died the following day.  The French Canadians led by the Chevalier de Levis staged a counteroffensive on the Plains of Abraham in the spring of 1760, with initial success at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]].<ref>Anderson, pp. 392\u2013393.</ref> During the subsequent [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|siege of Quebec]] however L\u00e9vis was unable to retake the city, due to British naval superiority following the [[Battle of Neuville]] and the [[Battle of Restigouche]]. The French forces retreated to [[Montreal]], and after a [[Montreal Campaign|two month campaign]] by overwhelming British forces on 8 September, they surrendered.\n\nSeeing French and Indian defeat, in 1760 the Seven Nations of The Iroquois Confederacy resigned from the war and negotiated the [[Treaty of Kahnawake]] with the British. Among its conditions was their unrestricted travel between Canada and New York, as the nations had extensive trade between Montreal and Albany as well as populations living throughout the area.<ref>[http://www3.sympatico.ca/donald.macleod2/border.html D.

If successful, the expedition would have strengthened France's hand at the negotiating table. Although they took St. John's and raided nearby settlements, the French forces were eventually defeated by British troops at the [[Battle of Signal Hill]]. This was the final battle of the war in North America, and it forced the French to surrender to [[William Amherst (British Army officer)|Lieutenant Colonel William Amherst]]. The victorious British now controlled all of eastern North America.\n\nThe history of the Seven Years' War in North America, particularly the expulsion of the Acadians, the siege of Quebec, the death of Wolfe, and the Battle of Fort William Henry generated a vast number of ballads, broadsides, images, and novels (see [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s ''[[Evangeline]]'', [[Benjamin West]]'s ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'', [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''), maps and other printed materials, which testify to how this event held the imagination of the British and North American public long after Wolfe's death in 1759.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=People&PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454 Virtual Vault: \"Canadiana\"], Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===South America===\n{{See also|Fantastic War|First Cevallos expedition}}\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|The bombardment of [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]] on [[Havana]], 1763]]\n\nIn South America (1763), the Portuguese conquered most of the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] valley from Spain,<ref>Ojer, Pablo- [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22de+los+cuales+fueron+desalojados+por+los+portugueses%22&btnG=Pesquisar+livros&tbm=bks&tbo=1&hl=pt-PT&gws_rd=ssl  '' La D\u00e9cada Fundamental en la Controversia de L\u00edmites entre Venezuela y Colombia, 1881\u20131891''] (in Spanish), Academia Nacional de la Historia, 1988, [https://books.google.com/books?id=l4dsAAAAMAAJ&q=%22de+los+cuales+fueron+desalojados+por+los+portugueses%22&dq=%22de+los+cuales+fueron+desalojados+por+los+portugueses%22 p. 292].</ref><ref>United States Army Corps of Engineers- [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22S%C3%A3o+Gabriel+was+founded+during+the+Portuguese+conquest+in+1763%2C%22&btnG=Pesquisar+livros&tbm=bks&tbo=1 ''Report on Orinoco-Casiquiare-Negro Waterway.

At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.  Saxony emerged from the war weakened and bankrupt; despite losing no territory, Saxony had essentially been a battleground between Prussia and Austria throughout the conflict, with many of its towns and cities (including the capital of Dresden) damaged by bombardment and looting.\n\nAustria was not able to retake Silesia or make any significant territorial gain. However, it did prevent Prussia from invading parts of Saxony. More significantly, its military performance proved far better than during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms. Hence, Austria's prestige was restored in great part and the empire secured its position as a major player in the European system.<ref>Maria Teresa of Austria; Jean-Paul Bled</ref> Also, by promising to vote for Joseph II in the Imperial elections, Frederick II accepted the Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire. The survival of Prussia as a first-rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and its army, however, was potentially damaging in the long run to Austria's influence in Germany.\n\nNot only that, Austria now found herself estranged with the new developments within the empire itself. Beside the rise of Prussia, [[Augustus III]], although ineffective, could muster an army not only from Saxony, but also Poland, since he was also the King of Poland as well as Elector of Saxony. Bavaria's growing power and independence was also apparent as it asserted more control on the deployment of its army, and managed to disengage from the war at its own will. Most importantly, with the now belligerent Hanover united personally under [[George III of Great Britain]], It amassed a considerable power, and even brought Britain in on future conflicts. This power dynamic was important to the future and the latter conflicts of the ''Reich''. The war also proved that Maria Theresa's reforms were still insufficient to compete with Prussia: unlike its enemy, the Austrians were almost bankrupt at the end of war. Hence, she dedicated the next two decades to the consolidation of her administration.\n\nPrussia emerged from the war as a great power whose importance could no longer be challenged. Frederick the Great's personal reputation was enormously enhanced, as his debt to fortune (Russia's volte-face after Elizabeth's death) and to British financial support were soon forgotten, while the memory of his energy and his military genius was strenuously kept alive.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> Though depicted as a key moment in Prussia's rise to greatness, the war weakened Prussia.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> Prussia's lands and population were devastated, though Frederick's extensive agrarian reforms and encouragement of immigration soon solved both these problems.  Unfortunately for Prussia, its army had taken heavy losses (particularly the officer corps), and in the war's aftermath, Frederick could not afford to rebuild the Prussian Army to what it was before the war.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> In the War of the Bavarian Succession, the Prussians fought poorly despite being led by Frederick in person.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> During the war with France in 1792\u20131795, the Prussian Army did not fare well against revolutionary France, and in 1806, the Prussians were annihilated by the French at the Battle of Jena.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> It was only after 1806 when Prussian government brought in reforms to recover from the disaster of Jena that Prussia's rise to greatness later in the 19th century was realized.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> However, none of this had happened yet, and after 1763, various nations all sent officers to Prussia to learn the secrets of Prussia's military power.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> After the Seven Years' War, Prussia become one of the most imitated powers in Europe.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> \n \nRussia, on the other hand, made one great invisible gain from the war: the elimination of French influence in Poland. The [[First Partition of Poland]] (1772) was to be a Russo-Prussian transaction, with Austria only reluctantly involved and with France simply ignored.<ref name=\"Eric Robson 1957\"/> Though the war had ended in a draw, the performance of the Imperial Russian Army against Prussia had improved Russia's reputation as a factor in European politics, as many had not expected the Russians to hold their own against the Prussians in campaigns fought on Prussian soil.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel page 90\"/> The American historian David Stone observed that Russian soldiers proved capable of going head-on against the Prussians, inflicting and taking one bloody volley after another \"without flinching\", and though the quality of Russian generalship was quite variable, the Russians were never decisively defeated once in the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 page 70.</ref> The Russians defeated the Prussians several times in the war, but the Russians lacked the necessary logistical capability to follow up their victories with lasting gains, and in this sense, the salvation of the House of Hohenzollern was due more to Russian weakness with respect to logistics than to Prussian strength on the battlefield.<ref>Stone, David ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya'', New York; Praeger, 2006 pages 70\u201371.</ref> Still, the fact that the Russians proved capable of defeating in battle the army of a \"first-rate\" European power on its own soil despite the often indifferent quality of their generals improved Russia's standing in Europe.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> A lasting legacy of the war was that it awakened the Russians to their logistic weaknesses, and led to major reforms of the Imperial Russian Army's quartermaster department.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel pages 90-91\">Marston, Daniel ''The Seven Years' War'', London; Osprey, 2001 pages 90\u201391.</ref> The supply system that allowed the Russians to advance into the Balkans during the war with the Ottomans in 1787\u201392, Marshal Alexander Suvorov to campaign effectively in Italy and Switzerland in 1798\u201399, and for the Russians to fight across Germany and France in 1813\u201314 to take Paris was created directly in response to the logistic problems experienced by the Russians in the Seven Years' War.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel pages 90-91\"/>\n\nThe British government was close to bankruptcy, and Britain now faced the delicate task of pacifying its new French-Canadian subjects as well as the many American Indian tribes who had supported France. In 1763, [[Pontiac's War]] broke out as a group of Indian tribes in the Great Lakes region and the Northwest (the modern American Midwest) said to have been led by the Ottawa chief Pontiac (whose role as the leader of the confederation seems to have been exaggerated by the British), unhappy with the eclipse of French power, rebelled against British rule. The Indians had long established congenial and friendly relations with the French fur traders, and the Anglo-American fur traders who had replaced the French had engaged in business practices that enraged the Indians, who complained about being cheated when they sold their furs.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel pages 84-85\">Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 pages 84\u201385.</ref> Moreover, the Indians feared that with the coming of British rule might lead to white settlers displacing them off their land, whereas it was known that the French had only come as fur traders.<ref name=\"Marston, Daniel pages 84-85\"/> Pontiac's War was a major conflict in which the British temporarily lost control of the Great Lakes-Northwest regions to the Indians.<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 pages 85\u201387.</ref> By the middle of 1763, the only forts the British held in the region were Fort Detroit (modern Detroit, Michigan ), Fort Niagara (modern Youngstown, New York) and Fort Pitt (modern Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) with the rest all being lost to the Indians.<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 page 86.</ref> It was only with the British victory at the [[Battle of Bushy Run]] that prevented a complete collapse of British power in the Great Lakes region.<ref>Marston, Daniel ''The French and Indian War'', London; Osprey, 2002 page 87.</ref> King George&nbsp;III's [[Proclamation of 1763]], which forbade white settlement beyond the crest of the Appalachians, was intended to appease the Indians but led to considerable outrage in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], whose inhabitants were eager to acquire native lands. The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774, similarly intended to win over the loyalty of French Canadians, also spurred resentment among American colonists.<ref>{{cite book |first=D. Peter |last=MacLeod |title=Northern Armageddon: The Battle of the Plains of Abraham |location=Vancouver |publisher=Douglas & McIntyre |year=2008 |isbn=9781553654124 }}</ref> The act protected Catholic religion and French language, which enraged the Americans, but the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois remained loyal to the British Crown during the American Revolution and did not rebel.\n\nThe war also brought to an end the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|\"Old System\" of alliances in Europe]],<ref name=os>I.e., a structure of alliances with European powers, in which Britain had formed grand coalitions against [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] ambitions in Europe</ref> In the years after the war, under the direction of [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], the British attempted to re-establish this system. But after her surprising grand success against a coalition of great powers, European states such as Austria, The Dutch Republic, Sweden, Denmark-Norway, Ottoman Empire, and Russia now saw Britain as a greater threat than France and did not join them, while the Prussians were angered by what they considered a British betrayal in 1762. Consequently, when the [[American War of Independence]] turned into a global war between 1778\u201383, Britain found itself opposed by a strong coalition of European powers, and lacking any substantial ally.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2144276|title = The American Revolution as an Aftermath of the Great War for the Empire, 1754\u20131763|journal = Political Science Quarterly|volume = 65|issue = 1|pages = 86\u2013104|last1 = Gipson|first1 = Lawrence Henry|year = 1950|doi = 10.2307/2144276}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\n* The novel ''[[The Luck of Barry Lyndon]]'' (1844) by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] is set against the Seven Years' War.
