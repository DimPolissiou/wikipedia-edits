One of its most popular artists was [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] It has been home to many artists, including [[Craig Mack]], [[French Montana]], [[Mase]], [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]], [[112 (band)|112]], [[Total (girl group)|Total]], [[The Lox]], [[Danity Kane]], [[Day26|Day 26]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]] and many others.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nAfter his climb from a non-paid [[internship]] to becoming an [[A&R]] executive at [[Uptown Records|Uptown]], Sean \"Puffy\" Combs was fired in mid-1993 by [[Andre Harrell]] and founded his own label, Bad Boy Records, in late 1993.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The label's first release was \"[[Flava in Ya Ear]]\" by [[Craig Mack]], followed quickly by Mack's debut album, ''[[Project Funk da World]]'' in 1994. On the heels of these releases came \"Juicy\" and ''[[Ready to Die]]'', the lead single and debut album from [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] (a.k.a. Biggie Smalls), released the same year. While Mack's album went Gold, ''Ready to Die'' achieved multi-platinum success. Dominating the charts in 1995, B.I.G. became one of the genre's biggest names of the day and Bad Boy's premier star. Also in 1995, the label continued its success with platinum releases by [[Total (group)|Total]] and [[Faith Evans]]. Bad Boy, meanwhile, staffed a bevy of in-house writer/producers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobel.osd.wednet.edu/wiki/pages/69D8c3R9r/Sean_Combs_Legacy_in_Hip_Hop.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022042254/http://nobel.osd.wednet.edu/wiki/pages/69D8c3R9r/Sean_Combs_Legacy_in_Hip_Hop.html |archivedate=2013-10-22 }}</ref> including: [[Easy Mo Bee]], [[Chucky Thompson]] and [[D-Dot|D Dot]]\u2014all of whom were instrumental in producing many of Bad Boy's most noted releases during this time.\n\n===Feud with Death Row===\n{{further|East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry}}\nThe rapid success of The Notorious B.I.G., and Bad Boy as a company, raised some tensions, especially with the [[Los Angeles, California]]-based [[Death Row Records|Death Row]].  For 3 years leading up to 1995, [[West Coast hip hop]], dominated by labels such as Death Row, had been preeminent in mainstream Rap. [[Suge Knight]], CEO of Death Row, held Sean Combs responsible for the shooting death of his friend Jake Robles, allegedly at the hands of Sean Combs' bodyguard.  Tensions were heightened when Death Row signed [[2Pac]], who alleged that Bad Boy, notably The Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, had been complicit in the November 1994 shooting of Tupac in the lobby of Quad Studios in [[Times Square]].\n\nAfter the June 1996 release of 2Pac's \"[[Hit 'Em Up]]\", smearing Bad Boy, tensions escalated. 2Pac was shot in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on September 7, 1996, and died September 13. Bad Boy issued a statement of condolences. On March 9, 1997, while Bad Boy were preparing the release of The Notorious B.I.G.'s double album ''[[Life After Death]]'', he was killed in Los Angeles, California.  Their deaths left many to speculate if the coastal hostility had been responsible for their deaths.  The police investigations were criticized by public and judicial sources. Both cases remain officially unsolved.\n\n===Life after The Notorious B.I.G. and rebuilding the label===\nPosthumously, Biggie's ''Life After Death'' reached number one on the Billboard Top 200. Its first two singles, \"Hypnotize\" and \"Mo Money, Mo Problems\" also topped the singles charts. The album eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and is one of the highest selling rap albums ever in the U.S..\n\nIn 1996, Puff Daddy had begun recording his own solo debut album. The 1st single, \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down,\" peaked at #1 on the Rap, R&B, and pop charts that spring. In response to Biggie's death, the label rush-released a Puff Daddy tribute song, \"[[I'll Be Missing You]]\", which featured Biggie's widow, Faith Evans, and Bad Boy's R&B singing group [[112 (group)|112]]. The single topped the charts for eleven weeks and became the hasty second single from Combs\u2019 album, ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'', which was released in the summer and sold 7 million copies in the U.S.. [[Mase]], Combs\u2019 newest prot\u00e9g\u00e9, in the meantime was immediately thrust into the void that The Notorious B.I.G. left. His own debut album, ''[[Harlem World]]'', also released the same year, would go Quadruple Platinum. Due to the successive successes of ''Life After Death'', ''No Way Out'' and ''Harlem World'', by the end of 1997, Bad Boy as a label and brand name had hit a commercial peak. During this time, the label began to promote its latest signing [[The L.O.X.]], who had been prominently featured on various Bad Boy releases that year. Highly anticipated, their 1998 debut album, ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]'' was certified Platinum by the RIAA. Shortly thereafter, the group departed the label and entered into a long-standing publishing dispute with Combs over the latter receiving 50% of their publishing that would continue until 2005.\n\nIn 1998, Combs decided to expand Bad Boy's roster to genres other than hip-hop and R&B, and subsequently signed [[Fuzzbubble]] to the label as its 1st rock act.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite news|title= Puffy, Jimmy Page To Share \"SNL\" Stage |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427377/19980506/puff_daddy.jhtml |publisher= [[MTV News]]. [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] |accessdate= 13 August 2008}}</ref> The group appeared on the rock remix of Puff Daddy's \"[[It's All About the Benjamins]]\", but parted ways with the label before releasing a full-length album.<ref>{{cite web|first= Gary |last= Glauber |work= [[PopMatters]] |title= Fuzzbubble: Demos, Out-takes and Rarities |url= http://www.popmatters.com/review/fuzzbubble-demos/ |date= 5 January 2003 |accessdate= 15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the years to follow, Bad Boy saw a commercial decline. In 1999, Mase became religious and abruptly retired from the business, leaving a serious dent in the company, especially since his 2nd album had just been released. Bad Boy found some success with [[Shyne]], a young rapper from [[Brooklyn]], who garnered generally mixed reviews for his deep voice and slow flow\u2014which many considered to be too reminiscent to, and perhaps a rip-off of The Notorious B.I.G., meanwhile, Combs' later albums failed to generate the same kind of acclaim that his debut had. In an attempt to further market himself, he underwent several name changes; from \"Puff Daddy\" to \"Puffy\" to \"P. Diddy,\" to simply just \"Diddy\" then shortly Diddy- Dirty Money.\" But with the split of the group he abruptly returned to \"Diddy.\"\n\nAs the 2000s emerged, Bad Boy had noticeably floundered. Many of its more noted acts would eventually vacate the label, while those who remained saw their album sales dwindle as time went on. In spite of continually releasing new material, and various attempts at building artists to the status of Bad Boy's The Notorious B.I.G., few proved as successful as the company hoped.\n\n[[Southern rap]] duo [[8Ball & MJG]] released an album called ''Living Legends'' to some success in 2004, prompting the creation of Bad Boy South\u2014which would eventually house acts such as [[Yung Joc]]. In 2002, Combs\u2019 participated in [[MTV]]'s [[Making The Band|Making The Band 2]], which spun off the Bad Boy assembled act, [[Da Band]]. Their MTV exposure lead to a Gold selling debut album. At this time, the label also signed a rapper named [[Aasim]], whose Bad Boy debut (as of 2013) still has not been released.\n\n===Resurgence===\nBad Boy saw its fortunes improve in 2005,<ref>Tamara Conniff and Bill Werde (October 4, 2006). [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57050/diddy-the-saga-continues Diddy: The Saga Continues]. Billboard.com. Accessed 2006-11-22.</ref> with the success of releases from new signees: [[Cassie Ventura|Cassie]] and [[Yung Joc]] (both of whom would score top five singles/debut albums). Also in 2006, Bad Boy hit paydirt with [[Making The Band|Making The Band 3's]] [[Danity Kane]], whose debut album topped the charts at #1 (the label's first chart topping album since the [[Bad Boys II (soundtrack)|Bad Boys II soundtrack]] three years prior), and spun off a top five single. Their second album, [[Welcome to the Dollhouse (album)|Welcome to the Dollhouse]] also debuted at #1, and contained the group's second top ten single \"[[Damaged (Danity Kane song)|Damaged]]\". Diddy also signed [[Day26]] and [[Donnie Klang]] to the label.\n\nHowever, by 2009, Combs had dissolved Danity Kane, terminating Aubrey O'Day's, D. Woods', Shannon Bex's and Aundrea Fimbres' contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609473/20090417/kane__danity.jhtml|title=Danity Kane\u2019s Aundrea Fimbres Fired By Diddy|work=MTV News|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> Dawn Richard remained signed working as solo artist and songwriter for Bad Boy. In March 2009, it was reported that Richard and Combs were assembling a new girl group but later formed [[Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money]], composed of Combs, Richard and a singer-songwriter named [[Kalenna Harper]]. In April 2009, Bad Boy also signed Red Cafe.\n\nIn September 2009, it was announced that Combs would be leaving [[Warner Music Group|Warner]], inking a new deal with Universal's [[Interscope]]. Under the terms of the new deal, Combs rebooted the Bad Boy name and trademark, to be operated through Interscope.  The previous Bad Boy catalog and roster, however, remains under the control of Warner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267267/diddy-exits-warner-music-last-train-coming-on-interscope|title=Diddy Exits Warner, 'Last Train' Coming On Interscope|work=Billboard|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn 2010, Diddy offered Mase a 1-year release from Bad Boy to settle their differences after the 2009 incident with Mase wanting to be released from Bad Boy. With this Mase decided to retire from rap for good, although he was to be reassigned to Bad Boy after his year break was done. In 2011, under his new deal with [[Interscope-Geffen-A&M]], Diddy stated he was looking for new talent to add to his new Bad Boy roster. [[Jay Electronica]], who had close ties with Diddy, was originally planned to be signed to the label but had signed with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] imprint instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ruthlessblogs.com/2011/04/11/tyler-the-creator-speaks-on-odd-future-bidding-war/|title=Ruthlessblogs.com|accessdate=4 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101711/http://ruthlessblogs.com/2011/04/11/tyler-the-creator-speaks-on-odd-future-bidding-war/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://yodonbleekraps.com/2011/03/21/is-lil-b-signing-to-diddys-bad-boy-records/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727155617/http://yodonbleekraps.com/2011/03/21/is-lil-b-signing-to-diddys-bad-boy-records/ |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref> [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] announced that he signed to Bad Boy/Interscope on August 3, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/posts/machine-gun-kelly-announces-deal-bad-boyinterscope-they-understood-our-idea|title=Machine Gun Kelly Announces Deal With Bad Boy/Interscope: \u2018They Understood Our Idea\u2019|work=Vibe|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> [[French Montana]] and [[Los (rapper)|Los]] also were announced as signees to the label in 2012.\n\nOn April 25, 2012, Mase featured alongside Diddy on [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]'s \"Slight Work\" remix, marking the first appearance of the Harlem rapper on record since 2010. Rumors began to start that Mase, as well as singer [[Omarion]], were both signing to Rick Ross' [[Maybach Music Group]]. It was later revealed that Bad Boy artist French Montana was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. According to Montana, Mase is serving as an [[A&R]] representative on Montana's forthcoming Bad Boy debut, \"[[Excuse My French (album)|Excuse My French]],\" as well as appearing on the remix of Montana's \"Everything's a Go.\" \"I'm not sure what kind of decisions he's going to make,\" Montana says, \"[but] I would love to see him in my camp.\" Mase is currently resigned to Bad Boy Records but has yet to announce whether he is resigned as part of a joint venture deal between Bad Boy and MMG. He later announced he had gotten his release from Bad Boy.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In April 2013, Cassie released her first full-length project seven years after her debut album, a mixtape titled ''[[RockaByeBaby]]'', to positive reception.

On the heels of these releases came \"Juicy\" and ''[[Ready to Die]]'', the lead single and debut album from [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] (a.k.a. Biggie Smalls), released the same year. While Mack's album went Gold, ''Ready to Die'' achieved multi-platinum success. Dominating the charts in 1995, B.I.G. became one of the genre's biggest names of the day and Bad Boy's premier star. Also in 1995, the label continued its success with platinum releases by [[Total (group)|Total]] and [[Faith Evans]].

For 3 years leading up to 1995, [[West Coast hip hop]], dominated by labels such as Death Row, had been preeminent in mainstream Rap. [[Suge Knight]], CEO of Death Row, held Sean Combs responsible for the shooting death of his friend Jake Robles, allegedly at the hands of Sean Combs' bodyguard.  Tensions were heightened when Death Row signed [[2Pac]], who alleged that Bad Boy, notably The Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, had been complicit in the November 1994 shooting of Tupac in the lobby of Quad Studios in [[Times Square]].\n\nAfter the June 1996 release of 2Pac's \"[[Hit 'Em Up]]\", smearing Bad Boy, tensions escalated. 2Pac was shot in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on September 7, 1996, and died September 13. Bad Boy issued a statement of condolences. On March 9, 1997, while Bad Boy were preparing the release of The Notorious B.I.G.'s double album ''[[Life After Death]]'', he was killed in Los Angeles, California.  Their deaths left many to speculate if the coastal hostility had been responsible for their deaths.  The police investigations were criticized by public and judicial sources. Both cases remain officially unsolved.\n\n===Life after The Notorious B.I.G. and rebuilding the label===\nPosthumously, Biggie's ''Life After Death'' reached number one on the Billboard Top 200. Its first two singles, \"Hypnotize\" and \"Mo Money, Mo Problems\" also topped the singles charts. The album eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and is one of the highest selling rap albums ever in the U.S..\n\nIn 1996, Puff Daddy had begun recording his own solo debut album. The 1st single, \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down,\" peaked at #1 on the Rap, R&B, and pop charts that spring. In response to Biggie's death, the label rush-released a Puff Daddy tribute song, \"[[I'll Be Missing You]]\", which featured Biggie's widow, Faith Evans, and Bad Boy's R&B singing group [[112 (group)|112]]. The single topped the charts for eleven weeks and became the hasty second single from Combs\u2019 album, ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'', which was released in the summer and sold 7 million copies in the U.S.. [[Mase]], Combs\u2019 newest prot\u00e9g\u00e9, in the meantime was immediately thrust into the void that The Notorious B.I.G. left. His own debut album, ''[[Harlem World]]'', also released the same year, would go Quadruple Platinum. Due to the successive successes of ''Life After Death'', ''No Way Out'' and ''Harlem World'', by the end of 1997, Bad Boy as a label and brand name had hit a commercial peak. During this time, the label began to promote its latest signing [[The L.O.X.]], who had been prominently featured on various Bad Boy releases that year. Highly anticipated, their 1998 debut album, ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]'' was certified Platinum by the RIAA. Shortly thereafter, the group departed the label and entered into a long-standing publishing dispute with Combs over the latter receiving 50% of their publishing that would continue until 2005.\n\nIn 1998, Combs decided to expand Bad Boy's roster to genres other than hip-hop and R&B, and subsequently signed [[Fuzzbubble]] to the label as its 1st rock act.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite news|title= Puffy, Jimmy Page To Share \"SNL\" Stage |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427377/19980506/puff_daddy.jhtml |publisher= [[MTV News]].

In 1999, Mase became religious and abruptly retired from the business, leaving a serious dent in the company, especially since his 2nd album had just been released. Bad Boy found some success with [[Shyne]], a young rapper from [[Brooklyn]], who garnered generally mixed reviews for his deep voice and slow flow\u2014which many considered to be too reminiscent to, and perhaps a rip-off of The Notorious B.I.G., meanwhile, Combs' later albums failed to generate the same kind of acclaim that his debut had. In an attempt to further market himself, he underwent several name changes; from \"Puff Daddy\" to \"Puffy\" to \"P. Diddy,\" to simply just \"Diddy\" then shortly Diddy- Dirty Money.\" But with the split of the group he abruptly returned to \"Diddy.\"\n\nAs the 2000s emerged, Bad Boy had noticeably floundered. Many of its more noted acts would eventually vacate the label, while those who remained saw their album sales dwindle as time went on. In spite of continually releasing new material, and various attempts at building artists to the status of Bad Boy's The Notorious B.I.G., few proved as successful as the company hoped.\n\n[[Southern rap]] duo [[8Ball & MJG]] released an album called ''Living Legends'' to some success in 2004, prompting the creation of Bad Boy South\u2014which would eventually house acts such as [[Yung Joc]]. In 2002, Combs\u2019 participated in [[MTV]]'s [[Making The Band|Making The Band 2]], which spun off the Bad Boy assembled act, [[Da Band]]. Their MTV exposure lead to a Gold selling debut album. At this time, the label also signed a rapper named [[Aasim]], whose Bad Boy debut (as of 2013) still has not been released.\n\n===Resurgence===\nBad Boy saw its fortunes improve in 2005,<ref>Tamara Conniff and Bill Werde (October 4, 2006).

Accessed 2006-11-22.</ref> with the success of releases from new signees: [[Cassie Ventura|Cassie]] and [[Yung Joc]] (both of whom would score top five singles/debut albums). Also in 2006, Bad Boy hit paydirt with [[Making The Band|Making The Band 3's]] [[Danity Kane]], whose debut album topped the charts at #1 (the label's first chart topping album since the [[Bad Boys II (soundtrack)|Bad Boys II soundtrack]] three years prior), and spun off a top five single. Their second album, [[Welcome to the Dollhouse (album)|Welcome to the Dollhouse]] also debuted at #1, and contained the group's second top ten single \"[[Damaged (Danity Kane song)|Damaged]]\". Diddy also signed [[Day26]] and [[Donnie Klang]] to the label.\n\nHowever, by 2009, Combs had dissolved Danity Kane, terminating Aubrey O'Day's, D. Woods', Shannon Bex's and Aundrea Fimbres' contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609473/20090417/kane__danity.jhtml|title=Danity Kane\u2019s Aundrea Fimbres Fired By Diddy|work=MTV News|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> Dawn Richard remained signed working as solo artist and songwriter for Bad Boy. In March 2009, it was reported that Richard and Combs were assembling a new girl group but later formed [[Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money]], composed of Combs, Richard and a singer-songwriter named [[Kalenna Harper]]. In April 2009, Bad Boy also signed Red Cafe.\n\nIn September 2009, it was announced that Combs would be leaving [[Warner Music Group|Warner]], inking a new deal with Universal's [[Interscope]]. Under the terms of the new deal, Combs rebooted the Bad Boy name and trademark, to be operated through Interscope.  The previous Bad Boy catalog and roster, however, remains under the control of Warner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267267/diddy-exits-warner-music-last-train-coming-on-interscope|title=Diddy Exits Warner, 'Last Train' Coming On Interscope|work=Billboard|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn 2010, Diddy offered Mase a 1-year release from Bad Boy to settle their differences after the 2009 incident with Mase wanting to be released from Bad Boy. With this Mase decided to retire from rap for good, although he was to be reassigned to Bad Boy after his year break was done. In 2011, under his new deal with [[Interscope-Geffen-A&M]], Diddy stated he was looking for new talent to add to his new Bad Boy roster. [[Jay Electronica]], who had close ties with Diddy, was originally planned to be signed to the label but had signed with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] imprint instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ruthlessblogs.com/2011/04/11/tyler-the-creator-speaks-on-odd-future-bidding-war/|title=Ruthlessblogs.com|accessdate=4 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101711/http://ruthlessblogs.com/2011/04/11/tyler-the-creator-speaks-on-odd-future-bidding-war/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://yodonbleekraps.com/2011/03/21/is-lil-b-signing-to-diddys-bad-boy-records/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727155617/http://yodonbleekraps.com/2011/03/21/is-lil-b-signing-to-diddys-bad-boy-records/ |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref> [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] announced that he signed to Bad Boy/Interscope on August 3, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/posts/machine-gun-kelly-announces-deal-bad-boyinterscope-they-understood-our-idea|title=Machine Gun Kelly Announces Deal With Bad Boy/Interscope: \u2018They Understood Our Idea\u2019|work=Vibe|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> [[French Montana]] and [[Los (rapper)|Los]] also were announced as signees to the label in 2012.\n\nOn April 25, 2012, Mase featured alongside Diddy on [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]'s \"Slight Work\" remix, marking the first appearance of the Harlem rapper on record since 2010. Rumors began to start that Mase, as well as singer [[Omarion]], were both signing to Rick Ross' [[Maybach Music Group]]. It was later revealed that Bad Boy artist French Montana was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. According to Montana, Mase is serving as an [[A&R]] representative on Montana's forthcoming Bad Boy debut, \"[[Excuse My French (album)|Excuse My French]],\" as well as appearing on the remix of Montana's \"Everything's a Go.\" \"I'm not sure what kind of decisions he's going to make,\" Montana says, \"[but] I would love to see him in my camp.\" Mase is currently resigned to Bad Boy Records but has yet to announce whether he is resigned as part of a joint venture deal between Bad Boy and MMG. He later announced he had gotten his release from Bad Boy.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In April 2013, Cassie released her first full-length project seven years after her debut album, a mixtape titled ''[[RockaByeBaby]]'', to positive reception.

That date is more congruent with images of her in the early 1850s and with the timeline of her career.}} \u2013 31 March 1878)  was an Italian opera singer who sang leading soprano roles in the opera houses of Italy and abroad from the early 1850s. She left Europe in 1867, first to sing with Annibale Biacchi's Italian opera company in Cuba and then to tour with Augusto Cagli's Italian opera company in Australasia. She remained with Cagli's company in its various incarnations until 1877, singing in India, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. She died in Turin, her native city, less than a year after her return from South Africa.{{r|Hale}}\n\n==Early life and Italian career==\nZenoni was born in Turin. She was initially self-taught and began her career in the late 1840s singing secondary roles in small theatres. Unable to make a breakthrough but possessed of a promising voice and stage presence, she was encouraged by music critics to get formal training. She became a pupil of [[Marco Marcelliano Marcello|Marcelliano Marcello]] who had opened a singing school in Turin and went on to further training with Carlo Boniforti at the [[Milan Conservatory]].{{r|Reg}} She made rapid progress and by the early 1850s was signed to various northern Italian opera houses as the ''[[Prima donna|prima donna assoluta]]''. She had a triumphant debut at the [[Teatro Regio (Turin)|Teatro Regio]] in Turin in 1854 in the title role of Donizetti's ''[[Gemma di Vergy]]''.{{r|Scara}} Later in her career she also sang the title roles in his ''[[La Favorita]]'', ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'', and ''[[Anna Bolena]]''. She went on to sing many leading roles in Verdi's operas, including some of the earliest performances of his ''[[La traviata]]'' (as Violetta), ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (as Gilda) and ''[[Il trovatore]]'' (as Leonora). She also appeared in Verdi's ''[[I masnadieri]]'' (as Amalia), ''[[Nabucco]]'' (as Abigaille), ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (as Lady Macbeth), ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' (as Odabella), ''[[Ballo in Maschera]]'' (as Amelia), and ''[[I due Foscari]]'' (as Lucrezia).{{r|GSL}}\n\n[[Francesco Regli]] wrote of her in 1860:\n<blockquote>Wherever she sings she has shown herself to be an artist worthy of every praise, for she unites an exquisite sentiment, an ardent spirit and a dramatic talent that has few equals with a beautiful and charming voice. Margherita Zenoni is not only an impeccable singer. She is also an excellent actress.{{r|Reg}}{{efn|Original Italian: \"In ogni luogo mostr\u00f2 di essere un'artista degna di ogni encomio, poich\u00e8 riunisce ad una bella e simpatica voce, educata alla pura scuola, uno squisito sentimento, un'anima ardente ed un valore drammatico a poche secondo. Margherita Zenoni, se \u00e8 inappuntabile cantante, \u00e8 un' attrice eziandio eccellente.\"}}</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Italian press articles on her benefit performances in several northern Italian opera houses, they were lavish affairs.{{efn|Benefit performances, where one of the opera's singers or its composer received the box-office takings for a particular performance in addition to their salary, were a common practice in the 18th and 19th century opera world as was the presentation of gifts from the audience to the singer.{{r|Price}}{{r|Rosse}}}} An account of her benefit night in 1857 at the Teatro Sociale in Rovereto described the audience screaming wildly and throwing flowers; garlands of roses, laurel, and carnations; gold coins; and poems in her honour onto the stage at the end of the performance. A large cornucopia filled with ribbons and flowers was brought onto the stage as well as a silk banner carried by an angel. She was then escorted to her lodgings by a torch-light parade composed of still-cheering audience members and the city's orchestra and chorus who proceeded to serenade her under her window.{{r|EdF}}\n\nAlthough Zenoni's career up to 1867 was primarily concentrated in the opera houses of northern Italy, she also sang in southern Italy at the [[Teatro San Carlo]] in Naples and the [[Teatro Piccinni]] in [[Bari]] and appeared abroad with touring Italian opera companies in [[Bucharest]], [[Constantinople]], [[Valencia]], and [[Oviedo]]. In a gala performance at the Teatro del Font\u00e1n in Oviedo in 1864, she sang Abigaille in ''Nabucco'' opposite [[Giorgio Ronconi]] who had created the title role at its world premiere in 1842.{{r|Cona}}{{r|GSL}}{{r|Fons}}\n\n==India, Australasia, and South Africa==\nIn December 1867 Zenoni sailed to New York and then on to Cuba were she appeared at the [[Teatro Tac\u00f3n]] in Havana with an Italian opera troupe organized by Annibale Biacchi. After Havana she proceeded to India to join Augusto Cagli's Italian opera company as its ''prima donna assoluta'' for the 1868-69 season in Calcutta. She was an immediate success  with the audiences, and Cagli tailored the company's repertoire to reflect her greatest successes on the Italian stage \u2013 modern, tragic  operas. She remained with Cagli's troupe for the 1869-70 season and then signed with Giovanni Pompei's rival company who were performing in Bombay and the Dutch East Indies. Cagli and Pompei subsequently joined forces to create a composite company. Zenoni toured both Australia and New Zealand with them. While in Sydney she married Annibal Luis Gamboa on 23 September 1873. According to the marriage announcement in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Gamboa was from [[Cadiz]], Spain. He had also been on the ship with her when she sailed to New York on her way to Cuba in 1867.{{r|Rocha}}{{r|Sign}}{{r|SMH1}}{{r|NYT1}}\n\nZenoni performed in Australia through the 1875 season appearing as Griselda in ''[[I Lombardi]]'', Leonora in ''Il trovatore'', Paolina in ''[[Poliuto]]'', Amelia in ''Un ballo in maschera'', and in the title roles of ''[[La Juive]]'', ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'', and ''[[Anna Bolena]]''. Her next stop was South Africa where Cagli had begun producing opera seasons for [[Cape Town]] in 1876. For the 1877 season his latest venture was ''al fresco'' opera in the gardens of the Good Hope Masonic Lodge. The season proved disastrous. In January Zenoni had to sing through a cold in ''Lucrezia  Borgia'' while strong winds buffeted singers and audience alike. Cagli then built a pavilion to partially enclose the performances, but in April a fire broke out which destroyed not only the pavilion and its stage but all of the company's scenery and props as well as the lead tenor's costume collection. Zenoni set sail for her native Italy in July 1877, a fact much lamented by the editor of ''[[The South African Commercial Advertiser|The Cape Standard and Mail]]''. She died in Turin in March of the following year. Her husband later remarried and died in Turin in 1899.{{r|Hale}}{{r|ODT1}}\n\nAfter her death, Zenoni's name briefly lived on in the entertainment world, albeit in [[vaudeville]] rather than opera. In 1878 the impresario [[Harry Rickards]] discovered that an artiste from another troupe was performing under the same name as [[Kate Rickards|Katie Angell]], a young Australian trapeze artist who worked for Rickards and later became his second wife. He considered a lawsuit, but instead Angell changed her own stage name, and Rickards billed her as \"Mademoiselle Zenoni. The Premier Lady Gymnast of the World.\"  According to the ''[[Dictionary of Sydney]]'', the name was inspired by the celebrity of Margherita Zenoni who was singing in Australia when Angell began her career.{{r|DoS}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs =\n\n<ref name=\"Reg\">Regli, Francesco (1860).

She left Europe in 1867, first to sing with Annibale Biacchi's Italian opera company in Cuba and then to tour with Augusto Cagli's Italian opera company in Australasia. She remained with Cagli's company in its various incarnations until 1877, singing in India, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. She died in Turin, her native city, less than a year after her return from South Africa.{{r|Hale}}\n\n==Early life and Italian career==\nZenoni was born in Turin. She was initially self-taught and began her career in the late 1840s singing secondary roles in small theatres. Unable to make a breakthrough but possessed of a promising voice and stage presence, she was encouraged by music critics to get formal training. She became a pupil of [[Marco Marcelliano Marcello|Marcelliano Marcello]] who had opened a singing school in Turin and went on to further training with Carlo Boniforti at the [[Milan Conservatory]].{{r|Reg}} She made rapid progress and by the early 1850s was signed to various northern Italian opera houses as the ''[[Prima donna|prima donna assoluta]]''. She had a triumphant debut at the [[Teatro Regio (Turin)|Teatro Regio]] in Turin in 1854 in the title role of Donizetti's ''[[Gemma di Vergy]]''.{{r|Scara}} Later in her career she also sang the title roles in his ''[[La Favorita]]'', ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia  Borgia]]'', and ''[[Anna Bolena]]''. She went on to sing many leading roles in Verdi's operas, including some of the earliest performances of his ''[[La traviata]]'' (as Violetta), ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (as Gilda) and ''[[Il trovatore]]'' (as Leonora). She also appeared in Verdi's ''[[I masnadieri]]'' (as Amalia), ''[[Nabucco]]'' (as Abigaille), ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (as Lady Macbeth), ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' (as Odabella), ''[[Ballo in Maschera]]'' (as Amelia), and ''[[I due Foscari]]'' (as Lucrezia).{{r|GSL}}\n\n[[Francesco Regli]] wrote of her in 1860:\n<blockquote>Wherever she sings she has shown herself to be an artist worthy of every praise, for she unites an exquisite sentiment, an ardent spirit and a dramatic talent that has few equals with a beautiful and charming voice. Margherita Zenoni is not only an impeccable singer. She is also an excellent actress.{{r|Reg}}{{efn|Original Italian: \"In ogni luogo mostr\u00f2 di essere un'artista degna di ogni encomio, poich\u00e8 riunisce ad una bella e simpatica voce, educata alla pura scuola, uno squisito sentimento, un'anima ardente ed un valore drammatico a poche secondo. Margherita Zenoni, se \u00e8 inappuntabile cantante, \u00e8 un' attrice eziandio eccellente.\"}}</blockquote>\n\nAccording to Italian press articles on her benefit performances in several northern Italian opera houses, they were lavish affairs.{{efn|Benefit performances, where one of the opera's singers or its composer received the box-office takings for a particular performance in addition to their salary, were a common practice in the 18th and 19th century opera world as was the presentation of gifts from the audience to the singer.{{r|Price}}{{r|Rosse}}}} An account of her benefit night in 1857 at the Teatro Sociale in Rovereto described the audience screaming wildly and throwing flowers; garlands of roses, laurel, and carnations; gold coins; and poems in her honour onto the stage at the end of the performance. A large cornucopia filled with ribbons and flowers was brought onto the stage as well as a silk banner carried by an angel. She was then escorted to her lodgings by a torch-light parade composed of still-cheering audience members and the city's orchestra and chorus who proceeded to serenade her under her window.{{r|EdF}}\n\nAlthough Zenoni's career up to 1867 was primarily concentrated in the opera houses of northern Italy, she also sang in southern Italy at the [[Teatro San Carlo]] in Naples and the [[Teatro Piccinni]] in [[Bari]] and appeared abroad with touring Italian opera companies in [[Bucharest]], [[Constantinople]], [[Valencia]], and [[Oviedo]]. In a gala performance at the Teatro del Font\u00e1n in Oviedo in 1864, she sang Abigaille in ''Nabucco'' opposite [[Giorgio Ronconi]] who had created the title role at its world premiere in 1842.{{r|Cona}}{{r|GSL}}{{r|Fons}}\n\n==India, Australasia, and South Africa==\nIn December 1867 Zenoni sailed to New York and then on to Cuba were she appeared at the [[Teatro Tac\u00f3n]] in Havana with an Italian opera troupe organized by Annibale Biacchi. After Havana she proceeded to India to join Augusto Cagli's Italian opera company as its ''prima donna assoluta'' for the 1868-69 season in Calcutta. She was an immediate success  with the audiences, and Cagli tailored the company's repertoire to reflect her greatest successes on the Italian stage \u2013 modern, tragic  operas. She remained with Cagli's troupe for the 1869-70 season and then signed with Giovanni Pompei's rival company who were performing in Bombay and the Dutch East Indies. Cagli and Pompei subsequently joined forces to create a composite company. Zenoni toured both Australia and New Zealand with them. While in Sydney she married Annibal Luis Gamboa on 23 September 1873. According to the marriage announcement in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Gamboa was from [[Cadiz]], Spain. He had also been on the ship with her when she sailed to New York on her way to Cuba in 1867.{{r|Rocha}}{{r|Sign}}{{r|SMH1}}{{r|NYT1}} \n\nZenoni performed in Australia through the 1875 season appearing as Griselda in ''[[I Lombardi]]'', Leonora in ''Il trovatore'', Paolina in ''[[Poliuto]]'', Amelia in ''Un ballo in maschera'', and in the title roles of ''[[La Juive]]'', ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia  Borgia]]'', and ''[[Anna Bolena]]''. Her next stop was South Africa where Cagli had begun producing opera seasons for [[Cape Town]] in 1876. For the 1877 season his latest venture was ''al fresco'' opera in the gardens of the Good Hope Masonic Lodge. The season proved disastrous. In January Zenoni had to sing through a cold in ''Lucrezia  Borgia'' while strong winds buffeted singers and audience alike. Cagli then built a pavilion to partially enclose the performances, but in April a fire broke out which destroyed not only the pavilion and its stage but all of the company's scenery and props as well as the lead tenor's costume collection. Zenoni set sail for her native Italy in July 1877, a fact much lamented by the editor of ''[[The South African Commercial Advertiser|The Cape Standard and Mail]]''. She died in Turin in March of the following year. Her husband later remarried and died in Turin in 1899.{{r|Hale}}{{r|ODT1}}\n\nAfter her death, Zenoni's name briefly lived on in the entertainment world, albeit in [[vaudeville]] rather than opera. In 1878 the impresario [[Harry Rickards]] discovered that an artiste from another troupe was performing under the same name as [[Kate Rickards|Katie Angell]], a young Australian trapeze artist who worked for Rickards and later became his second wife. He considered a lawsuit, but instead Angell changed her own stage name, and Rickards billed her as \"Mademoiselle Zenoni. The Premier Lady Gymnast of the World.\"  According to the ''[[Dictionary of Sydney]]'', the name was inspired by the celebrity of Margherita Zenoni who was singing in Australia when Angell began her career.{{r|DoS}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs =\n\n<ref name=\"Reg\">Regli, Francesco (1860).

He managed three major league teams: the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (1980\u201382), [[Montreal Expos]] (1985\u201391) and [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] (1991\u201394), compiling a career won-lost mark of 784\u2013773 (.504).\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Delaware, Ohio]], Rodgers graduated from Prospect High School in 1956 and was a star basketball player as well scoring over 1,700 points in his career and averaging 25 points per game over his Junior and Senior seasons with a high of 55 in 1956.  He attended [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] and [[Ohio Northern University]]. As a player, he signed his first professional contract with the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1956, spent five years in their [[farm system]], and was selected by the Angels in the [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft]]. \n\nHe was a top defensive catcher and a [[switch-hitter]] who played nine major league seasons (1961\u201369), all with the Angels, compiling a .232 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] with 704 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], 114 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 18 [[triple (baseball)|triples]] and 31 [[home run]]s in 932 [[games played]]. As a player, Rodgers caught [[Bo Belinsky]]'s [[no-hitter]] on May 5, 1962.<ref>http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1962/B05050LAA1962.htm</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\nIn between his playing and managing careers, Rodgers served as a coach for the [[Minnesota Twins]] (1970\u201374), [[San Francisco Giants]] (1976), and the Brewers (1978\u201380). He managed in the Angels' [[farm system]] in 1975 and 1977. His managerial career was book-ended by unusual circumstances.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nHe first became manager of the Brewers (then a contending team in the [[American League East Division]]) on an acting basis at the outset of the [[1980 Milwaukee Brewers season|1980]] season. He was serving as the club's third-base coach when the manager [[George Bamberger]] suffered a heart attack. Rodgers posted a record of 26\u201321 as acting field boss until Bamberger was able to return June 4. However, with the Brewers treading water under Bamberger with a record of 47\u201345, the manager stepped down on September 9, 1980, and Rodgers resumed the helm, the team winning 13 of its last 23 games to ultimately finish third. The [[1981 Milwaukee Brewers season|1981 campaign]] was disrupted for six weeks by an in-season [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]], which caused the major leagues to adopt a split-season format. Rodgers led the Brewers to the best overall record in the AL East at 62\u201347 and the second half title, but Milwaukee lost the divisional playoff to the [[1981 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], three games to two. It would be Rodgers' only postseason appearance as a manager. In 1982, the [[1982 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] started slowly under Rodgers and he was fired June 1 with the team's record a poor 23\u201324. The Brewers then turned their season around under his successor, batting coach [[Harvey Kuenn]], to finish with 95 wins and went on to win their only American League pennant as \"Harvey's Wallbangers.\"\n\n===Montreal Expos===\nAfter guiding the [[Indianapolis Indians]] of the AAA [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] to the 1984 regular season championship, Rodgers was promoted to manager of the parent Expos, replacing [[Jim Fanning]]. His first six years ([[1985 Montreal Expos season|1985]]\u2013[[1990 Montreal Expos season|90]]) in Montreal were largely successful, with the Expos averaging almost 84 wins per season, but when the team faltered in 1991, winning only 20 of its first 49 games, Rodgers was replaced as manager by [[Tom Runnells]] on June 2.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19910603&id=yuMPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xosDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2399,447391&hl=en Rodgers fired as Expos' boss]</ref>\n\n===California Angels===\nHe was not out of work long. On August 26, 1991, the Angels fired [[Doug Rader]] and hired Rodgers as their new pilot.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19910827&id=wD9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TuoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6292,9089520 Angels fire Doug Rader]</ref> Rodgers\u2014still well-known from his playing days with the Angel teams of the 1960s\u2014led the Halos to a 20\u201318 record for the remainder of the campaign, and was 39 games into his first full season as Angel manager in 1992 when a bus carrying the California club was involved in an expressway accident in [[New Jersey]] on May 20; Rodgers was seriously injured and missed almost 90 games. He returned late August, but still felt the after-effects of his injuries. Perhaps more damaging, the Angels did not respond to his leadership. They posted a losing mark in the final weeks of 1992, finished 20 games below .500 in 1993, and were only 16\u201323 on May 16, 1994, when Rodgers was replaced by [[Marcel Lachemann]].\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

He managed three major league teams: the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (1980\u201382), [[Montreal Expos]] (1985\u201391) and [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] (1991\u201394), compiling a career won-lost mark of 784\u2013773 (.504).\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Delaware, Ohio]], Rodgers graduated from Prospect High School in 1956 and was a star basketball player as well scoring over 1,700 points in his career and averaging 25 points per game over his Junior and Senior seasons with a high of 55 in 1956.  He attended [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] and [[Ohio Northern University]]. As a player, he signed his first professional contract with the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1956, spent five years in their [[farm system]], and was selected by the Angels in the [[1960 MLB Expansion Draft]]. \n\nHe was a top defensive catcher and a [[switch-hitter]] who played nine major league seasons (1961\u201369), all with the Angels, compiling a .232 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] with 704 [[hit (baseball)|hits]], 114 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 18 [[triple (baseball)|triples]] and 31 [[home run]]s in 932 [[games played]]. As a player, Rodgers caught [[Bo Belinsky]]'s [[no-hitter]] on May 5, 1962.<ref>http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1962/B05050LAA1962.htm</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\nIn between his playing and managing careers, Rodgers served as a coach for the [[Minnesota Twins]] (1970\u201374), [[San Francisco Giants]] (1976), and the Brewers (1978\u201380). He managed in the Angels' [[farm system]] in 1975 and 1977. His managerial career was book-ended by unusual circumstances.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nHe first became manager of the Brewers (then a contending team in the [[American League East Division]]) on an acting basis at the outset of the [[1980 Milwaukee Brewers season|1980]] season. He was serving as the club's third-base coach when pilot [[George Bamberger]] suffered a heart attack. Rodgers posted a record of 26\u201321 as acting field boss until Bamberger was able to return June 4. However, with the Brewers treading water under Bamberger with a record of 47\u201345, the manager stepped down on September 9, 1980, and Rodgers resumed the helm, the team winning 13 of its last 23 games to ultimately finish third. The [[1981 Milwaukee Brewers season|1981 campaign]] was disrupted for six weeks by an in-season [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]], which caused the major leagues to adopt a split-season format. Rodgers led the Brewers to the best overall record in the AL East at 62\u201347 and the second half title, but Milwaukee lost the divisional playoff to the [[1981 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], three games to two. It would be Rodgers' only postseason appearance as a manager. In 1982, the [[1982 Milwaukee Brewers season|Brewers]] started slowly under Rodgers and he was fired June 1 with the team's record a poor 23\u201324. The Brewers then turned their season around under his successor, batting coach [[Harvey Kuenn]], to finish with 95 wins and went on to win their only American League pennant as \"Harvey's Wallbangers.\"\n\n===Montreal Expos===\nAfter guiding the [[Indianapolis Indians]] of the AAA [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] to the 1984 regular season championship, Rodgers was promoted to manager of the parent Expos, replacing [[Jim Fanning]]. His first six years ([[1985 Montreal Expos season|1985]]\u2013[[1990 Montreal Expos season|90]]) in Montreal were largely successful, with the Expos averaging almost 84 wins per season, but when the team faltered in 1991, winning only 20 of its first 49 games, Rodgers was replaced as manager by [[Tom Runnells]] on June 2.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19910603&id=yuMPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xosDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2399,447391&hl=en Rodgers fired as Expos' boss]</ref>\n\n===California Angels===\nHe was not out of work long. On August 26, 1991, the Angels fired [[Doug Rader]] and hired Rodgers as their new pilot.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&dat=19910827&id=wD9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TuoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6292,9089520 Angels fire Doug Rader]</ref> Rodgers\u2014still well-known from his playing days with the Angel teams of the 1960s\u2014led the Halos to a 20\u201318 record for the remainder of the campaign, and was 39 games into his first full season as Angel manager in 1992 when a bus carrying the California club was involved in an expressway accident in [[New Jersey]] on May 20; Rodgers was seriously injured and missed almost 90 games. He returned late August, but still felt the after-effects of his injuries. Perhaps more damaging, the Angels did not respond to his leadership. They posted a losing mark in the final weeks of 1992, finished 20 games below .500 in 1993, and were only 16\u201323 on May 16, 1994, when Rodgers was replaced by [[Marcel Lachemann]].\n\n== Managerial statistics ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! rowspan=\"2\"| From\n! rowspan=\"2\"| To\n! colspan=\"3\"| Regular season record\n! colspan=\"3\"| Post\u2013season record\n! rowspan=\"2\"| {{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n! {{Tooltip|W|Games won}}\n! {{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}\n! {{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n! {{Tooltip|W|Games won}}\n! {{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}\n! {{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n| [[Milwaukee Brewers]]\n| 1980\n| 1982\n| {{WinLossPct|124|102}}\n| {{WinLossPct|2|3}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\">{{cite web|title=Buck Rodgers|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/rodgebu01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference|accessdate=September 21, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Montreal Expos]]\n| 1985\n| 1991\n| {{WinLossPct|520|499}}\n| colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"3\"| \u2014\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n| [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]]\n| 1991\n| 1992\n| {{WinLossPct|39|38}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n| California Angels\n| 1992\n| 1994\n| {{WinLossPct|101|135}}\n| <ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| Total\n! {{WinLossPct|784|774}}\n! {{WinLossPct|2|3}}\n! \u2014\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/r/rodgebu01.shtml Baseball-Reference.com] \u2013 career playing statistics\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/rodgebu01.shtml Baseball-Reference.com] \u2013 career managing record\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Minnesota Twins]] [[coach (baseball)|bullpen coach]]|before=[[Charlie Silvera]]|after=[[Jerry Zimmerman]]<small><br>(1976)</small>|years=1970\u20131973}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Minnesota Twins]] [[coach (baseball)|pitching coach]]|before=[[Al Worthington]]|after=[[Lee Stange]]|years=1974}}\n{{succession box|title=[[San Francisco Giants]] [[coach (baseball)|pitching coach]]|before=[[Don McMahon]]|after=[[Herm Starrette]]|years=1976}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Milwaukee Brewers]] [[coach (baseball)|third base coach]]|before=[[Jimmy Bragan]]|after=[[Harry Warner (baseball)|Harry Warner]]|years=1978\u20131980}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Milwaukee Brewers managers}}\n{{Washington Nationals managers}}\n{{Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim managers}}\n{{NL Managers of the Year}}\n{{Sporting News Manager of the Year Award}}\n{{Montreal Expos}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rodgers, Buck}}\n[[Category:1938 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American expatriate baseball people in Canada]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Ohio]]\n[[Category:Birmingham Barons players]]\n[[Category:California Angels managers]]\n[[Category:California Angels players]]\n[[Category:Caribbean Series managers]]\n[[Category:Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers players]]\n[[Category:Denver Bears players]]\n[[Category:El Paso Diablos players]]\n[[Category:Erie Sailors players]]\n[[Category:Hawaii Islanders players]]\n[[Category:Idaho Falls Russets players]]\n[[Category:Indianapolis Indians managers]]\n[[Category:Jamestown Falcons players]]\n[[Category:Knoxville Smokies players]]\n[[Category:Lancaster Red Roses players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Angels players]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball bullpen coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball catchers]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches]]\n[[Category:Manager of the Year Award winners]]\n[[Category:Milwaukee Brewers coaches]]\n[[Category:Milwaukee Brewers managers]]\n[[Category:Minnesota Twins coaches]]\n[[Category:Minor league baseball managers]]\n[[Category:Montreal Expos managers]]\n[[Category:Ohio Northern University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ohio Wesleyan Battling Bishops baseball players]]\n[[Category:People from Delaware, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Philadelphia Phillies scouts]]\n[[Category:Salinas Packers players]]\n[[Category:San Francisco Giants coaches]]\n", "name_user": "Storyofcory", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMilwaukee Brewers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rodgers"}
