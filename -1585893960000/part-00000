It is located approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} southeast of [[central London]], adjacent to the [[Greater London]] boundary and within the [[M25 motorway]] periphery. The population at the 2011 census was 16,226.<ref name=ONS/> The [[Parish councils in England|local council]] is [[Swanley Town Council]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1066, Swanley only consisted of a few cattle farms, surrounded in [[oak]], [[sycamore]] and [[ash (Fraxinus)]] woodland.\nBecause Swanley only consisted of a few homesteads, it was not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.pluspublishing.co.uk/assets/applets/Swanley_11-12.pdf |title=Swanley 11\u201312 Edit:MAIN GUIDE TEMPLATE |format=PDF |date= |access-date=8 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328021609/http://www.pluspublishing.co.uk/assets/applets/Swanley_11-12.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere is a theory that the placename Swanley developed from the [[Old English|Saxon]] term 'Swine-ley', \"Ley\" meaning a clearing in the woods and \"swine\" meaning pigs.  So it has been suggested that it was originally a [[Saxon]] pig farm or a stopping place for pigs on the way to the markets in Kent . This later developed into what we now know as Swanley.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nIn the 6th and 7th Centuries, there were probably two homesteads. After the [[Norman Conquest]], these portions of land were turned into [[manor]]s, which were then often divided among the [[monks]] at [[Ghent]] [[Abbey]] and [[Bermondsey]].<ref name=sevenoakshistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.sevenoaks.gov.uk/documents/swanleyvillagespg.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - swanleyvillagespg.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref> The original settlement of the town of Swanley (as opposed to modern-day Swanley Village) was based around Birchwood which does get mention in later medieval and early modern documents.\n\nThe town developed from a crossroads with only three houses before the advent of the railway in 1861 to a town with a population of 16,588 (in 2001) in one and a half centuries.<ref name=town>[http://www.swanleytowncouncil.gov.uk/infopage.asp?infoid=337 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703065757/http://www.swanleytowncouncil.gov.uk/infopage.asp?infoid=337 |date=3 July 2010 }}</ref> The newer settlement grew up around the railway junction and was originally named Swanley Junction, before becoming known as Swanley, and the original Swanley became Swanley Village, in the 1920s.\n\nThe arrival of the railway changed life in Swanley. The town became the location of Swanley Horticultural College which opened in 1887 and led to horticulture becoming the predominant industry. The college originally only catered for male students. Then in the early 1890s the first female students were admitted. Local Nurseries and florists' outlets blossomed, while casual farm labouring job opportunities on farms became in short supply.<ref name=history /> Some properties in Swanley still have apple and pear trees in their gardens from the original orchards. The college amalgamated with [[Wye College]] near Canterbury in 1945 under the governorship of [[Lord Northbourne]].<ref>Paull, John (2014) [http://www.academia.edu/9254016/Lord_Northbourne_the_man_who_invented_organic_farming_a_biography Lord Northbourne, the man who invented organic farming, a biography.] Journal of Organic Systems, 9(1), 31-53.</ref>\n\nContrary to popular myth, Swanley was never a major flower growing or orchard area (at least not more so than any other part of North Kent) however its location became attractive for London doctors seeking a cure for sick Londoners, escaping the smog of London.\n\nThree hospitals were established, the Kettlewell (or Alexandra) Hospital in 1885, Parkwood Hospital in 1893 and White Oak Hospital in 1897.<ref name=town />\nThe Kettlewell stood on the site of [[Asda]]'s car park and was for poor patients from London who needed to recuperate after major surgery. The Parkwood hospital was similarly used and White Oak was originally for children with eye diseases.\nDuring both [[World war]] I and II, Kettlewell and Parkwood were used as military hospitals, Parkwood become part of the [[Sidcup]] Hospital for facial injuries.\nAfter 1948, and the creations of the [[National Health Service]], meant these old London Hospitals became redundant \u2013 Kettlewell and White Oak\nclosed in 1959 and Parkwood ceased being a hospital in the early 1960s.\nCurrently, the gates of White Oak can still be seen opposite Swanley Police Station in London Road, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Bartholomew Way\nis on the site of Kettlewell's chapel and Parkwood still exists in its entirety in Beechenlea Lane as Parkwood Hall School (a residential and day school).<ref name=town />\n\nThe [[civil parish]] of Swanley was created in 1955 from neighbouring parishes of [[Farningham]] and [[Sutton at Hone]] reflecting the developments of the town and increase in population. In 1974 the parish council became a [[Swanley Town Council|Town Council]] and included the settlements of Hextable, Swanley Village and the main town of Swanley. In 1988, Hextable was formed into a separate parish council.\n\nUp until 1974 it was a part of the [[Dartford Rural District]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shopping Centre, London Road, Swanley - geograph.org.uk - 725103.jpg|thumb|Swanley shopping centre in 2008]]\nWithin Kent, Swanley is adjacent to the parishes of [[Wilmington, Kent|Wilmington]] and [[Hextable]] to the north, [[Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley]] and [[Farningham]] to the east, and [[Eynsford]] and [[Crockenhill]] to the south. To the west there is a boundary with [[St Mary Cray]] in the [[London Borough of Bromley]] and [[Ruxley]] in the [[London Borough of Bexley]].\n\nThe closest large towns are [[Bexleyheath]], [[Dartford]], [[Orpington]] and [[Sidcup]].\n\nThe Swanley [[post town]] in the [[BR postcode area]] includes the hamlet of [[Hockenden]] in the London Borough of Bromley.\n\nBeing on the outskirts of south east London it is a convenient commuter town for people who work in the city, as they can still be paid the London living wage. It still keeps some traditional links with [[Sevenoaks]] and [[Kent]] but it is heavily associated with South East London due to the expansion of that area close to Swanley's borders. The majority of housing development took place from the post-war period to late 1980s. A new fire station was opened in 1962, and new post office two years later. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] houses and shops were demolished to create a new town centre.<ref name=history /> Its 1970s shopping centre was then re-modelled in the 1990s when the [[Asda]] supermarket was extended and is one of the larger [[Asda]] stores.\n\n==Transport==\n===Road===\nSwanley has easy access to the [[M25 motorway|M25]], [[M20 motorway (England)|M20]] and the [[A20 road|A20]] being on the M25 Junction 3 interchange. The [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] is also north of the town.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Swanley railway station]] serves the town with [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] and [[Govia Thameslink Railway|Thameslink]] services to [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] via [[Bromley South railway station|Bromley South]], [[Blackfriars railway station|London Blackfriars]] via [[Catford railway station|Catford]],  [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover Priory]] via [[Chatham railway station|Chatham]] and [[Canterbury East railway station|Canterbury East]], [[Canterbury West railway station|Canterbury West]] via [[Maidstone East railway station|Maidstone East]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]] as well as to [[Sevenoaks railway station|Sevenoaks]].<ref>[http://m.nationalrail.co.uk/pj/ldbboard/dep/SAY Swanley] National Rail</ref>\n\n===Bus===\nSwanley is served by several bus routes. These connect it with areas including [[Dartford]], [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], [[Sidcup]], [[Orpington]] and [[Sevenoaks]].\n\n==Politics==\nSwanley has had a [[Swanley Town Council|town council]] since 1974, owning some 150 acres of parks and recreation areas. The town is also administered by [[Sevenoaks District]] and [[Kent County Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swanleytowncouncil.gov.uk/ |title=Swanly Town Council website }}</ref> It is in the [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks parliamentary constituency]] with [[Laura Trott (politician)|Laura Trott]] as its MP.\n\n==Facilities==\nLocal business sponsor the floral displays, while the Town Council maintains the grass verges and open spaces.\nThe residential is a mix of private housing with social housing on two main estates at St Mary's and White Oak largely provided by West Kent Housing Association who have an office in Swanley Centre.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSwanley Park (which covers 60 acres) was previously known as New Barn park. It was previously New Barn Farm until various fields and orchards were bought by the Town Council to protect the [[green belt]] between Hextable and Swanley.<ref name=history />\nThere remains acknowledgement of the former use as a farm with a remaining avenue of fruit trees and new avenues of trees linking the car parks to the central play areas, caf\u00e9 and paddling pool and water play and boating lake. The town council has maintained old hedgerows and trees around the outside of the park and has created allotments and an environment area that is now managed by local volunteers. The park is home to Swanley Athletics Club and hosts a number of county cross country races and other events each year. Around one of the large fields is Swanley New Barn Model railway (running on 800 metres of track) operated by a group of volunteers throughout the summer. A classical music and firework event \u2013 called the '1812 Night' \u2013 is held on the Friday before the August bank holiday.<ref name=history />\n\n==Places of worship==\nThe [[Victorian era|Victorian]] St Mary the Virgin's Church is the [[Anglican parish church]] of Swanley.<ref name=\"Homan93\">{{cite book|last=Homan|first=Roger|title=The Victorian Churches of Kent|year=1984|publisher=Phillimore & Co.|location=Chichester|isbn=0-85033-466-7|page=93}}</ref> The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Church of the Holy Apostles was registered for worship in 1965, superseding a church hall used since 1931.<ref name=\"LG-43556-839\">{{London Gazette|issue=43556|date=22 January 1965|page=839}}</ref> Christ Church, originally [[Congregational church#United Kingdom|Congregational]] and registered in 1904, is now part of the [[United Reformed Church]].<ref name=\"LG-27675-3025\">{{London Gazette|issue=27675|date=10 May 1904|page=3025}}</ref><ref name=\"WR-39640\">{{WorshipReg|id=39640|name=Christ Church|address=Swanley|denom=United Reformed Church|accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Also in the town are the Swanley Full Gospel Church ([[Assemblies of God]]),<ref name=\"WR-77062\">{{WorshipReg|id=77062|name=Swanley Full Gospel Church|address=Hockenden Lane, Swanley|denom=Christians not otherwise designated|accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Elim Christian Centre ([[Elim Pentecostal Church|Elim Pentecostal]]),<ref name=\"WR-77271\">{{WorshipReg|id=77271|name=Elim Pentecostal Church|address=36 Cherry Avenue, Swanley|denom=Elim Pentecostal Church|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> a [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] Kingdom Hall<ref name=\"WR-76684\">{{WorshipReg|id=76684|name=Kingdom Hall|address=Bremner Close/London Road, Swanley|denom=Jehovah's Witnesses|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> and a [[Exclusive Brethren|Brethren]] meeting room.<ref name=\"WR-77723\">{{WorshipReg|id=77723|name=Meeting Room|address=Leydenhatch Lane, Hextable, Swanley|denom=Christians not otherwise designated|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Orchards Academy]] is located close to the Town Centre and is the only Secondary School in the town. Other schools are located in the nearby towns of [[Sidcup]], [[Dartford]] and [[Orpington]] within 5 miles of Swanley. There are five Primary Schools in Swanley, with others in the surrounding villages. The closest Further Education Colleges are [[North Kent College]] and London South East College.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Alma Swanley F.C.]] was a popular local side but went bankrupt. [[Swanley Furness F.C.]] was another team from the town, though many support nearby [[Crockenhill F.C.]] as it is more successful. Titan Tigers is a popular local youth football club, which was formerly run from and trained in Swanley, but now are based in Hextable, training on the grounds of Hextable School. Titan Tigers has also just expanded into adult football with an Under 21s and Veterans team. Hexley Rangers F.C. is a FA Charter Standard (Hextable/Swanley) community-based junior football club that play at Downsview Primary School. Petham Park Panthers is another FA Charter club.\n\nThe Swanley and District Athletic Club, founded in 1988, meets at New Barn Park. The club organises and helps run a number of annual running and cross-country events.\n\nSwanley Sub Aqua Club meets at the White Oak swimming pool on Monday nights. SSAC is an independent club that has been training people to dive safely since 1967.

It is located approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} southeast of [[central London]], adjacent to the [[Greater London]] boundary and within the [[M25 motorway]] periphery. The population at the 2011 census was 16,226.<ref name=ONS/> The [[Parish councils in England|local council]] is [[Swanley Town Council]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1066, Swanley only consisted of a few cattle farms, surrounded in [[oak]], [[sycamore]] and [[ash (Fraxinus)]] woodland.\nBecause Swanley only consisted of a few homesteads, it was not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.pluspublishing.co.uk/assets/applets/Swanley_11-12.pdf |title=Swanley 11\u201312 Edit:MAIN GUIDE TEMPLATE |format=PDF |date= |access-date=8 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328021609/http://www.pluspublishing.co.uk/assets/applets/Swanley_11-12.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere is a theory that the placename Swanley developed from the [[Old English|Saxon]] term 'Swine-ley', \"Ley\" meaning a clearing in the woods and \"swine\" meaning pigs.  So it has been suggested that it was originally a [[Saxon]] pig farm or a stopping place for pigs on the way to the markets in Kent . This later developed into what we now know as Swanley.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nIn the 6th and 7th Centuries, there were probably two homesteads. After the [[Norman Conquest]], these portions of land were turned into [[manor]]s, which were then often divided among the [[monks]] at [[Ghent]] [[Abbey]] and [[Bermondsey]].<ref name=sevenoakshistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.sevenoaks.gov.uk/documents/swanleyvillagespg.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - swanleyvillagespg.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref> The original settlement of the town of Swanley (as opposed to modern-day Swanley Village) was based around Birchwood which does get mention in later medieval and early modern documents.\n\nThe town developed from a crossroads with only three houses before the advent of the railway in 1861 to a town with a population of 16,588 (in 2001) in one and a half centuries.<ref name=town>[http://www.swanleytowncouncil.gov.uk/infopage.asp?infoid=337 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703065757/http://www.swanleytowncouncil.gov.uk/infopage.asp?infoid=337 |date=3 July 2010 }}</ref> The newer settlement grew up around the railway junction and was originally named Swanley Junction, before becoming known as Swanley, and the original Swanley became Swanley Village, in the 1920s.\n\nThe arrival of the railway changed life in Swanley. The town became the location of Swanley Horticultural College which opened in 1887 and led to horticulture becoming the predominant industry. The college originally only catered for male students. Then in the early 1890s the first female students were admitted. Local Nurseries and florists' outlets blossomed, while casual farm labouring job opportunities on farms became in short supply.<ref name=history /> Some properties in Swanley still have apple and pear trees in their gardens from the original orchards. The college amalgamated with [[Wye College]] near Canterbury in 1945 under the governorship of [[Lord Northbourne]].<ref>Paull, John (2014) [http://www.academia.edu/9254016/Lord_Northbourne_the_man_who_invented_organic_farming_a_biography Lord Northbourne, the man who invented organic farming, a biography.] Journal of Organic Systems, 9(1), 31-53.</ref>\n\nContrary to popular myth, Swanley was never a major flower growing or orchard area (at least not more so than any other part of North Kent) however its location became attractive for London doctors seeking a cure for sick Londoners, escaping the smog of London.\n\nThree hospitals were established, the Kettlewell (or Alexandra) Hospital in 1885, Parkwood Hospital in 1893 and White Oak Hospital in 1897.<ref name=town />\nThe Kettlewell stood on the site of [[Asda]]'s car park and was for poor patients from London who needed to recuperate after major surgery. The Parkwood hospital was similarly used and White Oak was originally for children with eye diseases.\nDuring both [[World war]] I and II, Kettlewell and Parkwood were used as military hospitals, Parkwood become part of the [[Sidcup]] Hospital for facial injuries.\nAfter 1948, and the creations of the [[National Health Service]], meant these old London Hospitals became redundant \u2013 Kettlewell and White Oak\nclosed in 1959 and Parkwood ceased being a hospital in the early 1960s.\nCurrently, the gates of White Oak can still be seen opposite Swanley Police Station in London Road, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Bartholomew Way\nis on the site of Kettlewell's chapel and Parkwood still exists in its entirety in Beechenlea Lane as Parkwood Hall School (a residential and day school).<ref name=town />\n\nThe [[civil parish]] of Swanley was created in 1955 from neighbouring parishes of [[Farningham]] and [[Sutton at Hone]] reflecting the developments of the town and increase in population. In 1974 the parish council became a [[Swanley Town Council|Town Council]] and included the settlements of Hextable, Swanley Village and the main town of Swanley. In 1988, Hextable was formed into a separate parish council.\n\nUp until 1974 it was a part of the [[Dartford Rural District]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Shopping Centre, London Road, Swanley - geograph.org.uk - 725103.jpg|thumb|Swanley shopping centre in 2008]]\nWithin Kent, Swanley is adjacent to the parishes of [[Wilmington, Kent|Wilmington]] and [[Hextable]] to the north, [[Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley]] and [[Farningham]] to the east, and [[Eynsford]] and [[Crockenhill]] to the south. To the west there is a boundary with [[St Mary Cray]] in the [[London Borough of Bromley]] and [[Ruxley]] in the [[London Borough of Bexley]].\n\nThe closest large towns are [[Bexleyheath]], [[Dartford]], [[Orpington]] and [[Sidcup]].\n\nThe Swanley [[post town]] in the [[BR postcode area]] includes the hamlet of [[Hockenden]] in the London Borough of Bromley.\n\nBeing on the outskirts of south east London it is a convenient commuter town for people who work in the city, as they can still be paid the London living wage. It still keeps some traditional links with [[Sevenoaks]] and [[Kent]] but it is heavily associated with South East London due to the expansion of that area close to Swanley's borders. The majority of housing development took place from the post-war period to late 1980s. A new fire station was opened in 1962, and new post office two years later. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] houses and shops were demolished to create a new town centre.<ref name=history /> Its 1970s shopping centre was then re-modelled in the 1990s when the [[Asda]] supermarket was extended and is one of the larger [[Asda]] stores.\n\n==Transport==\n===Road===\nSwanley has easy access to the [[M25 motorway|M25]], [[M20 motorway (England)|M20]] and the [[A20 road|A20]] being on the M25 Junction 3 interchange. The [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2]] is also north of the town.\n\n===Rail===\n[[Swanley railway station]] serves the town with [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] and [[Govia Thameslink Railway|Thameslink]] services to [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] via [[Bromley South railway station|Bromley South]], [[Blackfriars railway station|London Blackfriars]] via [[Catford railway station|Catford]],  [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover Priory]] via [[Chatham railway station|Chatham]] and [[Canterbury East railway station|Canterbury East]], [[Canterbury West railway station|Canterbury West]] via [[Maidstone East railway station|Maidstone East]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]] as well as to [[Sevenoaks railway station|Sevenoaks]].<ref>[http://m.nationalrail.co.uk/pj/ldbboard/dep/SAY Swanley] National Rail</ref>\n\n===Bus===\nSwanley is served by several bus routes. These connect it with areas including [[Dartford]], [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], [[Sidcup]], [[Orpington]] and [[Sevenoaks]].\n\n==Politics==\nSwanley has had a [[Swanley Town Council|town council]] since 1974, owning some 150 acres of parks and recreation areas. The town is also administered by [[Sevenoaks District]] and [[Kent County Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swanleytowncouncil.gov.uk/ |title=Swanly Town Council website }}</ref> It is in the [[Sevenoaks (UK Parliament constituency)|Sevenoaks parliamentary constituency]] with [[Laura Trott]] as its MP.\n\n==Facilities==\nLocal business sponsor the floral displays, while the Town Council maintains the grass verges and open spaces.\nThe residential is a mix of private housing with social housing on two main estates at St Mary's and White Oak largely provided by West Kent Housing Association who have an office in Swanley Centre.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSwanley Park (which covers 60 acres) was previously known as New Barn park. It was previously New Barn Farm until various fields and orchards were bought by the Town Council to protect the [[green belt]] between Hextable and Swanley.<ref name=history />\nThere remains acknowledgement of the former use as a farm with a remaining avenue of fruit trees and new avenues of trees linking the car parks to the central play areas, caf\u00e9 and paddling pool and water play and boating lake. The town council has maintained old hedgerows and trees around the outside of the park and has created allotments and an environment area that is now managed by local volunteers. The park is home to Swanley Athletics Club and hosts a number of county cross country races and other events each year. Around one of the large fields is Swanley New Barn Model railway (running on 800 metres of track) operated by a group of volunteers throughout the summer. A classical music and firework event \u2013 called the '1812 Night' \u2013 is held on the Friday before the August bank holiday.<ref name=history />\n\n==Places of worship==\nThe [[Victorian era|Victorian]] St Mary the Virgin's Church is the [[Anglican parish church]] of Swanley.<ref name=\"Homan93\">{{cite book|last=Homan|first=Roger|title=The Victorian Churches of Kent|year=1984|publisher=Phillimore & Co.|location=Chichester|isbn=0-85033-466-7|page=93}}</ref> The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Church of the Holy Apostles was registered for worship in 1965, superseding a church hall used since 1931.<ref name=\"LG-43556-839\">{{London Gazette|issue=43556|date=22 January 1965|page=839}}</ref> Christ Church, originally [[Congregational church#United Kingdom|Congregational]] and registered in 1904, is now part of the [[United Reformed Church]].<ref name=\"LG-27675-3025\">{{London Gazette|issue=27675|date=10 May 1904|page=3025}}</ref><ref name=\"WR-39640\">{{WorshipReg|id=39640|name=Christ Church|address=Swanley|denom=United Reformed Church|accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Also in the town are the Swanley Full Gospel Church ([[Assemblies of God]]),<ref name=\"WR-77062\">{{WorshipReg|id=77062|name=Swanley Full Gospel Church|address=Hockenden Lane, Swanley|denom=Christians not otherwise designated|accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Elim Christian Centre ([[Elim Pentecostal Church|Elim Pentecostal]]),<ref name=\"WR-77271\">{{WorshipReg|id=77271|name=Elim Pentecostal Church|address=36 Cherry Avenue, Swanley|denom=Elim Pentecostal Church|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> a [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] Kingdom Hall<ref name=\"WR-76684\">{{WorshipReg|id=76684|name=Kingdom Hall|address=Bremner Close/London Road, Swanley|denom=Jehovah's Witnesses|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> and a [[Exclusive Brethren|Brethren]] meeting room.<ref name=\"WR-77723\">{{WorshipReg|id=77723|name=Meeting Room|address=Leydenhatch Lane, Hextable, Swanley|denom=Christians not otherwise designated|accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Orchards Academy]] is located close to the Town Centre and is the only Secondary School in the town. Other schools are located in the nearby towns of [[Sidcup]], [[Dartford]] and [[Orpington]] within 5 miles of Swanley. There are five Primary Schools in Swanley, with others in the surrounding villages. The closest Further Education Colleges are [[North Kent College]] and London South East College.\n\n==Sport==\n[[Alma Swanley F.C.]] was a popular local side but went bankrupt. [[Swanley Furness F.C.]] was another team from the town, though many support nearby [[Crockenhill F.C.]] as it is more successful. Titan Tigers is a popular local youth football club, which was formerly run from and trained in Swanley, but now are based in Hextable, training on the grounds of Hextable School. Titan Tigers has also just expanded into adult football with an Under 21s and Veterans team. Hexley Rangers F.C. is a FA Charter Standard (Hextable/Swanley) community-based junior football club that play at Downsview Primary School. Petham Park Panthers is another FA Charter club.\n\nThe Swanley and District Athletic Club, founded in 1988, meets at New Barn Park. The club organises and helps run a number of annual running and cross-country events.\n\nSwanley Sub Aqua Club meets at the White Oak swimming pool on Monday nights. SSAC is an independent club that has been training people to dive safely since 1967. Since 2009 it has been offering free PADI training for club members.\n\nSidcup and District Motor Cycle Club owns the Canada Heights international motocross circuit at Button Street, Swanley.

In [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective \"holy\" or \"sacred\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac}} transliterated as ''hiera'') is constantly applied to all such sees as a matter of course. In the West, the adjective is not commonly added, but it does form part of an official title of two sees: besides the Holy See, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Bishopric of Mainz]] (the former [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], which was also of [[prince-elector|electoral]] and [[primate (bishop)|primatial]] rank) bears the title of \"the Holy See of Mainz\" (Latin: ''Sancta Sedes Moguntina'').<ref name=\"Kersting\">{{cite book| last = Kersting| first = Hans| title = MAINZ \u2013 tours on foot| year = 2003| publisher = Bayerische Verlagsanstalt| ISBN = 978-3-89889-078-6\n| volume = 4| language = en}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{further|History of the papacy|Papal primacy|Temporal power (papal)}}\n\nThe [[apostolic see]] of Diocese of Rome was established in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, then the capital of the [[Roman Empire]], according to Catholic tradition. The legal status of the Catholic Church and its property was recognised by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantine the Great]], and it became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] by the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380 by Emperor [[Theodosius I]].\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476, the temporal [[Legal history of the Catholic Church|legal jurisdisction]] of the [[papal primacy]] was further recognised as promulgated in [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Canon law]]. The Holy See was granted territory in Duchy of Rome by the [[Donation of Sutri]] in 728 of [[List of kings of the Lombards|King]] [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] of the [[Lombards]], and [[sovereignty]] by the [[Donation of Pepin]] in 756 by [[List of Frankish kings|King]] [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] of the [[Franks]].\n\nThe [[Papal States]] thus held extensive territory and armed forces in 756\u20131870. [[Pope Leo III]] [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] [[Charlemagne]] as Roman Emperor by ''[[translatio imperii]]'' in 800. The pope's [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] peaked around the time of the [[papal coronation]]s of the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 858, and the ''[[Dictatus papae]]'' in 1075, which conversely also described [[Papal deposing power]]. Several modern states still trace their own sovereignty to recognition in medieval papal bulls.\n\nThe sovereignty of the Holy See was retained despite multiple [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sacks of Rome]] during the Early Middle Ages. Yet, relations with the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the Holy Roman Empire were at times strained, reaching from the ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'' and ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'' regarding the \"[[Patrimony of Saint Peter]]\" in the 10th century, to the [[Investiture Controversy]] in 1076\u20131122, and settled again by the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The exiled [[Avignon Papacy]] during 1309\u20131376 also put a strain on the Papacy, which however finally returned to Rome. [[Pope Innocent X]] was critical of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 as it weakened the authority of the Holy See throughout much of [[Europe]]. Following the French Revolution, the Papal States were briefly occupied as the \"[[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]\" from 1798 to 1799 as a [[sister republic]] of the [[First French Empire]] under [[Napoleon and the Catholic Church|Napoleon]], before their territory was reestablished.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Holy See was represented in and identified as a \"permanent subject of general customary international law vis-\u00e0-vis all states\" in the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u20131815).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open-diplomacy.eu/blog/moral-diplomacy-of-the-holy-see-multi-level-diplomacy-of-a-tr | title='Moral Diplomacy' of the Holy See: Multi-Level Diplomacy of a Transnational Actor}}</ref> The Papal States were recognised under the rule of the Papacy and largely restored to their former extent. Despite the [[Capture of Rome]] in 1870 by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Roman Question]] during the [[Vatican during the Savoyard era (1870\u20131929)|Savoyard era]] (which made the pope a \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\" from 1870 to 1929), its international legal subject was \"constituted by the ongoing reciprocity of diplomatic relationships\" that not only were maintained but multiplied.\n\nThe [[Lateran Treaty]] on 11 February 1929 between the Holy See and Italy recognised Vatican City as an independent [[city-state]], along with extraterritorial [[Properties of the Holy See|properties]] around the region.

It is organized into [[Ecclesiastical polity|polities]] of the [[Latin Church]] and the 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], and their [[diocese]]s and [[religious institute]]s.\n\nThe Holy See is administered by the [[Roman Curia]] (''Latin'' for ''Roman Court''), which is the central government of the Catholic Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P19.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law: text \u2013 IntraText CT|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid12178005\"/> The Roman Curia includes various [[Dicastery|dicasteries]], comparable to ministries and executive departments, with the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] as its chief administrator.

The term \"Apostolic See\" can refer to any see founded by one of the Twelve Apostles, but, when used with the definite article, it is used in the Catholic Church to refer specifically to the see of the Bishop of Rome, whom that Church sees as successor of Saint Peter.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm |title = Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles }}</ref> While [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in Vatican City is perhaps the church most associated with the papacy, the actual cathedral of the Holy See is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]] in the city of Rome.{{NoteTag|Although Saint John Lateran is legally within Rome, it is one of the properties of the Holy See granted [[extraterritorial privileges]].}}\n\nEvery see is considered holy. In [[Greek language|Greek]], the adjective \"holy\" or \"sacred\" ({{lang|grc|\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac}} transliterated as ''hiera'') is constantly applied to all such sees as a matter of course. In the West, the adjective is not commonly added, but it does form part of an official title of two sees: besides the Holy See, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Bishopric of Mainz]] (the former [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], which was also of [[prince-elector|electoral]] and [[primate (bishop)|primatial]] rank) bears the title of \"the Holy See of Mainz\" (Latin: ''Sancta Sedes Moguntina'').<ref name=\"Kersting\">{{cite book| last = Kersting| first = Hans| title = MAINZ \u2013 tours on foot| year = 2003| publisher = Bayerische Verlagsanstalt| ISBN = 978-3-89889-078-6\n| volume = 4| language = en}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{further|History of the papacy|Papal primacy|Temporal power (papal)}}\n\nThe [[apostolic see]] of Diocese of Rome was established in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century]] by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, then the capital of the [[Roman Empire]], according to Catholic tradition. The legal status of the Catholic Church and its property was recognised by the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Constantine the Great]], and it became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] by the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] in 380 by Emperor [[Theodosius I]].\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476, the temporal [[Legal history of the Catholic Church|legal jurisdisction]] of the [[papal primacy]] was further recognised as promulgated in [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Canon law]]. The Holy See was granted territory in Duchy of Rome by the [[Donation of Sutri]] in 728 of [[List of kings of the Lombards|King]] [[Liutprand, King of the Lombards|Liutprand]] of the [[Lombards]], and [[sovereignty]] by the [[Donation of Pepin]] in 756 by [[List of Frankish kings|King]] [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]] of the [[Franks]].\n\nThe [[Papal States]] thus held extensive territory and armed forces in 756\u20131870. [[Pope Leo III]] [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] [[Charlemagne]] as Roman Emperor by ''[[translatio imperii]]'' in 800. The pope's [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] peaked around the time of the [[papal coronation]]s of the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 858, and the ''[[Dictatus papae]]'' in 1075, which conversely also described [[Papal deposing power]]. Several modern states still trace their own sovereignty to recognition in medieval papal bulls.\n\nThe sovereignty of the Holy See was retained despite multiple [[Sack of Rome (disambiguation)|sacks of Rome]] during the Early Middle Ages. Yet, relations with the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the Holy Roman Empire were at times strained, reaching from the ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'' and ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'' regarding the \"[[Patrimony of Saint Peter]]\" in the 10th century, to the [[Investiture Controversy]] in 1076\u20131122, and settled again by the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The exiled [[Avignon Papacy]] during 1309\u20131376 also put a strain on the Papacy, which however finally returned to Rome. [[Pope Innocent X]] was critical of the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 as it weakened the authority of the Holy See throughout much of [[Europe]]. Following the French Revolution, the Papal States were briefly occupied as the \"[[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]\" from 1798 to 1799 as a [[sister republic]] of the [[First French Empire]] under [[Napoleon and the Catholic Church|Napoleon]], before their territory was reestablished.\n\nNotwithstanding, the Holy See was represented in and identified as a \"permanent subject of general customary international law vis-\u00e0-vis all states\" in the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u20131815).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open-diplomacy.eu/blog/moral-diplomacy-of-the-holy-see-multi-level-diplomacy-of-a-tr | title='Moral Diplomacy' of the Holy See: Multi-Level Diplomacy of a Transnational Actor}}</ref> The Papal States were recognised under the rule of the Papacy and largely restored to their former extent. Despite the [[Capture of Rome]] in 1870 by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Roman Question]] during the [[Vatican during the Savoyard era (1870\u20131929)|Savoyard era]] (which made the pope a \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\" from 1870 to 1929), its international legal subject was \"constituted by the ongoing reciprocity of diplomatic relationships\" that not only were maintained but multiplied.\n\nThe [[Lateran Treaty]] on 11 February 1929 between the Holy See and Italy recognised Vatican City as an independent [[city-state]], along with extraterritorial [[Properties of the Holy See|properties]] around the region. Since then, Vatican City is distinct from yet under \"full ownership, exclusive [[dominion]], and [[sovereignty|sovereign authority]] and [[jurisdiction]]\" of the Holy See ({{lang-la|Sancta Sedes}}).{{NoteTag|The Holy See is the central governing body of the Catholic Church and a sovereign entity recognized by international law, consisting of the pope and the [[Roman Curia]].
