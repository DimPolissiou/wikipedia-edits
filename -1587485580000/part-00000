It is uncertain when he arrived in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. He appears in the charter record in the service of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]] in the late 1170s, and by 22 October 1179 held the rank of [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Marshals|Marshal of the kingdom]].\n\nIt seems that he expected [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] to give him the hand of an available heiress.  However, when C\u00e9cile Dorel inherited her father's coastal fief of [[Botrun]] in the [[County of Tripoli]], Raymond married her (before March 1181) to [[Plivain]] or Plivano, the nephew of a [[Pisa]]n merchant, for a bride price of 10,000 bezants.  By the mid-thirteenth century, when the ''Old French Continuation of [[William of Tyre]]'' (the so-called ''Chronicle of [[Ernoul]]'') was compiled, the story of the bride of Botrun had evolved into a fanciful legend in which Plivain's uncle put the young lady (there renamed Lucie) on the scales, and offered Raymond her weight in gold, to obtain the marriage.\n\n==Templar==\nG\u00e9rard fell seriously ill, after which he took vows as a Templar.  By June 1183 he held the rank of [[seneschal]] of the Order.  He was elected Grand Master in late 1184 or early 1185, after the death of [[Arnold of Torroja]] in [[Verona]].\n\nG\u00e9rard continued to hold a grudge against Raymond of Tripoli, which influenced some of his political man\u0153uvrings.  In 1186, when [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|King Baldwin V]], successor to the late [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|King Baldwin IV]], had died, G\u00e9rard quickly took the side of [[Agnes of Courtenay|Agnes de Courtenay]]\u2019s daughter [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Queen Sibylla]] and her husband [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]], in the ensuing succession struggle.  Raymond and his allies, including the [[Ibelin family]] were the leaders of the opposing faction, who supported the claim of Sibylla's younger half-sister [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Princess Isabella]].\n\nIn the crisis of 1187, G\u00e9rard used the money sent by [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] to be deposited with The Templars in Jerusalem to hire additional troops for the ''[[arri\u00e8re ban]]'' to defend the Kingdom Of Jerusalem from [[Saladin]].  (Henry had sent the funds for his own future crusading plans, in penance for the murder of [[Thomas Becket]]; some of it was deposited with the Templars, some with the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights Hospital\u00eder]], in Jerusalem and Tyre.)  G\u00e9rard and fewer than 100 Templars, together with some Hospitallers, attacked Saladin's son [[Al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din|al-Afdal]] at the [[Battle of Cresson]] in 1187.  Al-Afdal, however, had over 5,000 men.  The Hospitaller Grand Master [[Roger de Moulins]] was killed; G\u00e9rard, though wounded, was one of the few survivors. G\u00e9rard's report of the battle was the source for a short narrative written by [[Pope Urban III]] to [[Baldwin of Exeter]], [[archbishop of Canterbury]].  \n\nIn July of the same year G\u00e9rard led the Templars at the [[Battle of Hattin|Battle Of H\u00e1ttin]]. Saladin had captured [[Tiberias]] and Guy was contemplating a march on the city to retake it.  Raymond advised him to wait for Saladin to come to them, since they were in a well-defended, well-watered position, and would have to cross a dry open plain to reach Tiberias. G\u00e9rard opposed this, and convinced Guy to continue the march. He was supported by [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon|Reynald de Ch\u00e2tillon]], a fellow enemy of Raymond.  The armies of Outremer ended up trapped on the dry plain and were defeated on 4 July.  Raymond and several other nobles escaped, but some who were not killed, including [[Humphrey IV of Toron|Humphrey de Toron IV]], [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery de Lusignan]], Reynald, Guy ''and'' ''also'' G\u00e9rard were among those captured by Salah ad-Din.  The rest of the Templar prisoners were executed.  G\u00e9rard remained a prisoner until 1188, during which time his Order was commanded by Brother Thierry (Terricus) from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].\n\nG\u00e9rard was given the condition by Saladin that, if he could convince a Templar fortress to surrender peacefully, he would be set free. He succeeded and on his release went to [[Tartous|Tortosa]], where he ably led the Templars' defence of their castle, which held out after the fall of the town to Saladin\u2019s siege forces. Having taken back control of his order from Thierry, he seems to have seized the remainder of King Henry II\u2019s money which had been left with the Templars in Tyre. This provoked a complaint from the city's defender, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], in letters of 20 September 1188 to [[Baldwin of Exeter]] and [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], even saying: \"''...graver still, the Master of the Temple has made off with the King of England's alms''\".\n\nIn 1189, he again joined forces with Guy, taking the Templars to the [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|Siege of Acre]]. After being taken prisoner once more, he was beheaded by Saladin on 4 October 1189.\n\n==Popular culture==\n\nMany forms of media such as books, comics, films, television and games, like in sources that influenced them from when he was alive and afterwards, often depict G\u00e9rard de Ridefort as an extremely hot-headed, vicious, stubborn, religiously fanatical, self-righteously arrogant as well as stubborn, scheming and selfish individual wont to refuse to compromise, seeing matters as having no shades of grey but as only either good or evil, and continuously attempting to make Count Raymond III of Tripoli look bad in front of all else from out of, even to the point of putting his spite towards him and his own beliefs before the best interests of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and before those of all of the Order of the Knights Templar, as well as who believes that all armies that serve beliefs in Christianity are invincible. He is also quite often depicted in such media forms as being in cahoots with Reynald de Ch\u00e2tillon, Agnes de Courtenay in their mutual enmity with Count Raymond, the two of them frequently conspiring and making schemes, including to goad King Guy de Lusignan (often portrayed as quite unintelligent) into war for their own schemes. Yet in every one of these forms of media, his personality leads to his undoing.\n\n===Literature===\n\n*As in many stories about his reputation, G\u00e9rard is depicted in Jack Whyte\u2019s book \u201c''Standard'' ''of'' ''Honor''\u201d as having sought to spite Count Raymond.\n\n*G\u00e9rard appears in [[Jan Guillou]]\u2019s \u201c[[Crusades trilogy|The Crusades Book Trilogy]]\u201c about the fictional character Arn Magnusson, where he is depicted as helping to ensure the latter\u2019s release from The Templars, albeit only \u201cby persuasion\u201d. Yet he also hates Arn due to the fact that the latter does not share his views on what it means to believe in Christianity, seeks piece with Muslims and other such reasons.\n\n*In \u201c''Beyond'' ''the'' ''Sea''\u201d by Elon Salmon, G\u00e9rard is depicted as is typical of him to be depicted, yet in cases like this one, he goes to lengths such as recruiting thuggish and brutal men to keep any acting for or even acting with Count Raymond de Tripoli III and those supporting him and Princess Isabella.\n\n*In \u201c''Jerusalem''\u201d by Cecelia Holland, wherein G\u00e9rard is given the name of \u201cGerard de Ridford\u201d, he appears in fact as the story\u2019s top main leading primary antagonist, caught onto over his double-dealing, all of his schemes and plots with all of those he is in league with and vice versa, including in regards to using Guy as a pawn, all by Guy\u2019s wife Sibylla (called in the story \u201cSybilla\u201d) and her factionalized romantic love interest, the fictional Templar Knights Order Organization Member Character Sir Rannulf Fitzwilliam, the latter of whom he is depicted as archenemies with.\n\n*In Helena P. Schrader\u2019s \u201c''Balian'' ''d''<nowiki/>'''Ibelin'' ''Trilogy''\u201d, which attempts a more historically accurate depiction of the life of the titular character, once again, G\u00e9rard de Ridefort is a main antagonist, depicted as scheming with Reynald and with him and those such as Agnes de Courtenay, using Guy de Lusignan as a pawn, in G\u00e9rard\u2019s case once again from out of his own spite for Count Raymond de Tripoli III.\n\n===Games===\n* G\u00e9rard is also a general of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] at the [[Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms#Crusades Campaign|''Medieval II: Total War: Kingdoms'' Crusades Campaign]].\n\n===Films & Television Shows===\n* G\u00e9rard was portrayed by [[Nicholas Boulton (actor)|Nicholas Boulton]] in the Swedish 2007 film ''[[Arn &ndash; The Knight Templar]]'', and its 2008 sequel ''[[Arn \u2013 The Kingdom at Road's End]]'', each of which depicts him as incredibly self-righteously religiously fanatically arrogant, and uncompromising self.

It is uncertain when he arrived in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. He appears in the charter record in the service of [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem]] in the late 1170s, and by 22 October 1179 held the rank of [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Marshals|Marshal of the kingdom]].\n\nIt seems that he expected [[Raymond III of Tripoli]] to give him the hand of an available heiress.  However, when C\u00e9cile Dorel inherited her father's coastal fief of [[Botrun]] in the [[County of Tripoli]], Raymond married her (before March 1181) to [[Plivain]] or Plivano, the nephew of a [[Pisa]]n merchant, for a [[bride price]] of 10,000 bezants.  By the mid-thirteenth century, when the ''Old French Continuation of [[William of Tyre]]'' (the so-called ''Chronicle of [[Ernoul]]'') was compiled, the story of the bride of Botrun had evolved into a fanciful legend in which Plivain's uncle put the young lady (there renamed Lucie) on the scales, and offered Raymond her weight in gold, to obtain the marriage.\n\n==Templar==\nG\u00e9rard fell seriously ill, after which he took vows as a Templar.  By June 1183 he held the rank of [[seneschal]] of the Order.  He was elected Grand Master in late 1184 or early 1185, after the death of [[Arnold of Torroja]] in [[Verona]].\n\nG\u00e9rard continued to hold a grudge against Raymond of Tripoli, which influenced some of his political man\u0153uvrings.  In 1186, when [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|King Baldwin V]], successor to the late [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|King Baldwin IV]], had died, G\u00e9rard quickly took the side of [[Agnes of Courtenay|Agnes de Courtenay]]\u2019s daughter [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Queen Sibylla]] and her husband [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]], in the ensuing succession struggle.  Raymond and his allies, including the [[Ibelin family]] were the leaders of the opposing faction, who supported the claim of Sibylla's younger half-sister [[Isabella of Jerusalem|Princess Isabella]].\n\nIn the crisis of 1187, G\u00e9rard used the money sent by [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] to be deposited with The Templars in Jerusalem to hire additional troops for the ''[[arri\u00e8re ban]]'' to defend [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|The Kingdom Of Jerusalem]] from [[Saladin]].  (Henry had sent the funds for his own future crusading plans, in penance for the murder of [[Thomas Becket]]; some of it was deposited with the Templars, some with the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights Hospital\u00eder]], in Jerusalem and Tyre.)  G\u00e9rard and fewer than 100 Templars, together with some Hospitallers, attacked Saladin's son [[Al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din|al-Afdal]] at the [[Battle of Cresson]] in 1187.  Al-Afdal, however, had over 5,000 men.  The Hospitaller Grand Master [[Roger de Moulins]] was killed; G\u00e9rard, though wounded, was one of the few survivors. G\u00e9rard's report of the battle was the source for a short narrative written by [[Pope Urban III]] to [[Baldwin of Exeter]], [[archbishop of Canterbury]].  \n\nIn July of the same year G\u00e9rard led the Templars at the [[Battle of Hattin|Battle Of H\u00e1ttin]]. Saladin had captured [[Tiberias]] and Guy was contemplating a march on the city to retake it.  Raymond advised him to wait for Saladin to come to them, since they were in a well-defended, well-watered position, and would have to cross a dry open plain to reach Tiberias. G\u00e9rard opposed this, and convinced Guy to continue the march. He was supported by [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon|Reynald de Ch\u00e2tillon]], a fellow enemy of Raymond.  The armies of Outremer ended up trapped on the dry plain and were defeated on 4 July.  Raymond and several other nobles escaped, but some who were not killed, including [[Humphrey IV of Toron|Humphrey de Toron IV]], [[Aimery of Cyprus|Aimery de Lusignan]], Reynald, Guy ''and'' ''also'' G\u00e9rard were among those captured by Salah ad-Din.  The rest of the Templar prisoners were executed.  G\u00e9rard remained a prisoner until 1188, during which time his Order was commanded by Brother Thierry (Terricus) from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].\n\nG\u00e9rard was given the condition by Saladin that, if he could convince a Templar fortress to surrender peacefully, he would be set free. He succeeded and on his release went to [[Tartous|Tortosa]], where he ably led the Templars' defence of their castle, which held out after the fall of the town to Saladin\u2019s siege forces. Having taken back control of his order from Thierry, he seems to have seized the remainder of King Henry II\u2019s money which had been left with the Templars in Tyre. This provoked a complaint from the city's defender, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], in letters of 20 September 1188 to [[Baldwin of Exeter]] and [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], even saying: \"''...graver still, the Master of the Temple has made off with the King of England's alms''\".\n\nIn 1189, he again joined forces with Guy, taking the Templars to the [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|Siege of Acre]]. After being taken prisoner once more, he was beheaded by Saladin on 4 October 1189.\n\n==Popular culture==\n\nMany forms of media such as books, comics, films, television and games, like in sources that influenced them from when he was alive and afterwards, often depict G\u00e9rard de Ridefort as an extremely hot-headed, vicious, stubborn, religiously fanatical, self-righteously arrogant as well as stubborn, scheming and selfish individual wont to refuse to compromise, seeing matters as having no shades of grey but as only either good or evil, and continuously attempting to make Count Raymond III of Tripoli look bad in front of all else from out of, even to the point of putting his spite towards him and his own beliefs before the best interests of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and before those of all of the Order of the Knights Templar, as well as who believes that all armies that serve beliefs in Christianity are invincible.

Misoprostol taken vaginally tends to have fewer gastrointestinal side effects.

In a large-scale prospective trial published in 1992 of more than 16,000 women undergoing medical abortion using mifepristone with varying doses of [[gemeprost]] or [[sulprostone]], only 0.1% had hemorrhage requiring a [[blood transfusion]]. It is often advised to contact a health care provider if there is bleeding to such degree that more than two pads are soaked per hour for two consecutive hours.\n\n===Management of bleeding===\nVaginal bleeding generally diminishes gradually over about two weeks after a medical abortion, but in individual cases spotting can last up to 45 days.<ref name=\"WHO FAQs 2006\" /> If the woman is well, neither prolonged bleeding nor the presence of tissue in the uterus (as detected by [[obstetric ultrasonography]]) is an indication for surgical intervention (that is, [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[dilation and curettage]]). Remaining [[products of conception]] will be expelled during subsequent vaginal bleeding. Still, surgical intervention may be carried out on the woman's request, if the bleeding is heavy or prolonged, or causes [[anemia]], or if there is evidence of [[endometritis]].\n\n=== Complications ===\nComplications following medical abortion with mifepristone and misprostol under 10 weeks pregnancy are rare; according to two large reviews, bleeding requiring a blood transfusion occurred in 0.03-0.6% of women and serious infection in 0.01-0.5%.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nBetween January 2005 and June 2008 rates of serious infection after medical abortion at Planned Parenthood affiliate centers declined by 93% after a change from vaginal to [[buccal administration]] of misoprostol combined with the routine preventative use of [[doxycycline]] antibiotics.<ref name=\"Fjerstad 2009b\" />\n\nA few rare cases of deaths from [[Clostridium|clostridial]] [[toxic shock syndrome]] have occurred following medical abortions.<ref>{{cite journal| pmc=1188182 | pmid=16093445 | doi=10.1503/cmaj.050980 | volume=173 | issue=5 | title=Septic shock after medical abortions with mifepristone (Mifeprex, RU 486) and misoprostol | year=2005 | journal=CMAJ | page=485 | last1 = Murray | first1 = S | last2 = Wooltorton | first2 = E}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacology==\nMifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/health-medicine/science-behind-abortion-pill-180963762/ |title = The Science Behind the \"Abortion Pill\"}}</ref><ref>Medical management of first trimestesr abortion, Society of Family Planning Clinical Guideline, Contraception 89(2014) 148-161</ref> causing the lining of the uterus to thin and preventing the embryo from staying implanted and growing.

The show started streaming in March 2015, partway through the cast's first campaign. \"Campaign One\" ran for 115 episodes, and ended in October 2017. The cast started playing \"Campaign Two\" in January 2018, which is still ongoing {{As of|2020|04|lc=y|df=}}. A number of one-shots were aired in the [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]] between the two campaigns.\n\nThe series is broadcast live on Thursdays at 19:00&nbsp;[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]] on the Critical Role [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] channel, with the [[video on demand]] (VOD) being available to Twitch subscribers immediately after the broadcast. On the Monday following the live stream, the VODs are made available for the public on Critical Role's website and uploaded to their [[YouTube]] channel.\n\nA number of licensed works based on the show have been released, such as the two official campaign setting guides written by the show's dungeon master, [[Matthew Mercer]].\n\nCritical Role is also the name of the studio owned by the cast. The studio has produced ''Critical Role'' and ''Talks Machina'' since 2018. It also develops and produces other programming for the studio's Twitch and YouTube channels.\n\n==Campaign structure==\nThe ''Critical Role'' storyline occurs in a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] that consists of a series of story arcs, which are usually played over multiple episodes. Between\u2014or sometimes within\u2014the major story arcs, the characters rest, resupply, or go on side quests. In addition, every player character has a [[backstory]], an unfinished part of their personal history that can be relevant to the campaign from time to time. Sometimes, major story arcs are intrinsically tied to a character's backstory.\n\nBoth campaigns are set in Exandria, a world of Matthew Mercer's creation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddkenreck/2017/06/06/matthew-mercer-on-critical-roles-taldorei-campaign-setting-guide/ |title=Matthew Mercer On Critical Role's Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide |work=[[Forbes]] |last=Kenreck |first=Todd |date=June 6, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign One===\nCampaign One [[Campaign setting|takes place]] primarily in Tal'Dorei, a continent of Exandria. It follows the exploits of an adventuring party known as '''Vox Machina''', previously known as the Super High-Intensity Team (or S.H.I.T.s), a rag-tag group of mercenaries originally formed in the swamp-town of Stilben.\n\n====Pre-series history====\nIn their adventures prior to the start of the series, the group saved the family of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, ruler of Tal'Dorei and its capital city of Emon. In appreciation, Uriel gave the group seats on the city [[council]], and provided them with a residence called Greyskull Keep, which is located just outside the city. Episode 36, titled ''Winter's Crest in Whitestone'', features a summary of the pre-series history (starting 1 hour 35 minutes into the episode), with artwork created by Wendy Sullivan Green and voice-overs provided by the cast.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=96m21s |title=Winter's Crest in Whitestone : Critical Role RPG Show Episode 36 - The Story of Vox Machina |publisher=Geek & Sundry |date=December 18, 2015 |medium=Youtube video |time=1:36:21 |access-date=May 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe forthcoming ''Critical Role'' animated series will include a canonic story that takes place within the pre-stream time frame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/criticalrole/critical-role-the-legend-of-vox-machina-animated-s/description |title=Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina Animated Special |website=Kickstarter |accessdate=May 9, 2019 |quote=\"... the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch.\"}}</ref>\n\n====On-stream campaign====\nThe first episode of the show aired on March 12, 2015, beginning the on-stream part of the first campaign, which concluded with its 115th and final episode on October 12, 2017.<ref name=\"bleedingcool\"/><ref>{{cite tweet |number=920015612184686592 |title=The end. |user=CriticalRole |author=Critical Role |date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Kraghammer story arc (16 episodes, 1\u201316) jumps in at the point in Vox Machina's story where the cast's original home game left off. It takes place primarily in the subterrenean depths of the [[Underdark]], and culminates in a battle between Vox Machina and a dangerous [[Beholder (Dungeons & Dragons)|beholder]] by the name of K'varn, who is controlling an entire city of [[Illithid]].\n\nThe Vasselheim story arc (7 episodes, 17\u201323) splits the party into two groups, who seek to prove their worth to the \"Slayer's Take\", a local adventurer's guild in the ancient city of Vasselheim, by taking on dangerous missions. This arc features multi-episode [[guest appearance]]s by [[Felicia Day]] (Lyra), [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] (Zahra), [[Wil Wheaton]] (Thorbir), and [[Will Friedle]] (Kashaw), adding a new twist to the now-divided adventuring band. This arc also includes the first episode (episode 22) that touches on a character's backstory, as Keyleth visits another druid tribe to continue her Arament\u00e9, a journey to become the leader of her people.\n\nThe Briarwood story arc (15 episodes, 24\u201338) leads Vox Machina to Percy's ancestral home, the city of Whitestone, which was once ruled by his family. The party have to fight for control over Whitestone against Lord and Lady Briarwood, who are responsible for the demise of most of the de Rolo family and have taken the city as their own. The Briarwood's ties into necromancy and a secret cult make things even more dangerous, and Vox Machina must stop them from completing a ritual that threatens to endanger the entire kingdom. During the early stages of this arc, Tiberius leaves Vox Machina for good.\n\nThe Chroma Conclave story arc (45 episodes, 39\u201383) begins with the attack of four ancient [[chromatic dragon]]s on Emon, the capital of Tal'Dorei, with the Sovereign and other important political figures falling in the onslaught. The dragons take control over and divide the kingdom, and in order to defeat them, Vox Machina needs more power than they currently have. They search for the \"Vestiges of Divergence\", famed and extremely powerful magical items from ages passed, which are scattered throughout the world. During the ongoing battles against the powerful dragons of the Chroma Conclave, the backstories of some characters are also further explored. Smaller arcs focus on Grog's herd that once exiled him, the last figure from Percy's traumatic past, as well as a strained family reunion for the twins, Vex and Vax.\n\nThe Taryon Darrington story arc (16 episodes, 84\u201399) begins with the departure of Scanlan from the group, whose mental problems and disagreements with the group culminate in an argument that shakes the party. While traveling to Ank'Harel on the continent of Marquet, Vox Machina meet Taryon Darrington, an inexperienced aspiring author and adventurer. Adventuring together with Taryon, some smaller story arcs see Vox Machina helping Keyleth (who seeks to complete her Arament\u00e9), literally traveling to hell, as well as dealing with Taryon's family, who reside in the Dwendalian Empire on the continent of Wildemount. During this arc, which is loosely defined by Scanlan's absence and Taryon's presence in the party, Pike's family also makes an appearance and her relationship with them is explored. The arc includes a one year time skip between episodes 94 and 95.\n\nThe Cult of [[Vecna]] story arc (16 episodes, 100\u2013115) revisits the mysterious and dangerous artifact that was activated beneath Whitestone Castle during the Briarwood story arc. Scanlan finally rejoins Vox Machina, while the party now has to fight a cult which tries to summon the evil [[lich]] demigod Vecna, who seeks to ascend to true godhood and rule Exandria. His ascension actually succeeds and he becomes the only god on this side of the Divine Gate, which keeps the other gods from directly interfering in the world they created. With the indirect help of some of the prime deities who aid them with special powers, Vox Machina are the only group of heroes who can possibly stop the \"Whispered One\" in one gigantic final battle.\n\n====Post-campaign====\nIn 2019, over a year after the first campaign ended, Critical Role produced three canonical one-shot games that feature Vox Machina in the time frame after the banishment of Vecna. The first one-shot, ''Vox Machina: The Search for Grog'', was played at a live show in Los Angeles on January 19, 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://critrole.com/event/live-show-vox-machina-the-search-for-grog/|title=[LIVE SHOW] Vox Machina: The Search for Grog {{!}} Critical Role|date=2018-12-11|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> then broadcast on Twitch on February 22, 2019 before being released via YouTube and Twitch VOD on February 23, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://critrole.com/the-search-for-grog-vod-update/|title=The Search for Grog VOD Update {{!}} Critical Role|date=2019-01-17|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> It explored an event that took place in the final episode of Campaign one, but was not played out in detail because it would have disrupted the ongoing epilogue.

It stars Sam Riegel as Taryon Darrington, honorary member of Vox Machina, who leads a group of new characters into their own adventures.

The story is set on the continent of Wildemount, which was briefly visited during the Vox Machina campaign. The Mighty Nein campaign is set about 20 years after Vox Machina's final battle against [[Vecna]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16666344/dungeons-and-dragons-twitch-roleplay-rpgs-critical-role-streaming-gaming |title=The rise of D&D liveplay is changing how fans approach roleplaying |work=[[The Verge]] |last=DeVille |first=Chris |date=November 16, 2017 |access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-one-chapter-closes-and-another-begins/ |title=Critical Role: One Chapter Closes, And Another Begins |last=Knox |first=Kelly |publisher=Geek & Sundry |date=December 18, 2017 |access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref> and takes place in a time where tensions between two of Wildemount\u2019s mightiest nations are very high.\n\nThe Trostenwald/Alfield story arc (episodes 1\u20137) serves as an origin story for the new adventuring party, whose members meet for the first time in a town called Trostenwald within the Dwendalian Empire. They are: Fjord, a male half-orc who gained magical powers out of nowhere; Jester, a young female tiefling who follows an unknown god; Caleb, a very guarded male human wizard; Nott, a seemingly benevolent female goblin; and Beauregard (\"Beau\"), a young human woman \"on a wandering tour\". They meet Mollymauk (\"Molly\"), a pompous tiefling, and Yasha, a quiet swordswoman, who work for a traveling circus. An Undead attack during a circus performance forces the seven to work together, as they have to prove they were not responsible for the incident. During this arc, Beau\u2019s connection to the monk order of the \"Cobalt Soul\", keepers of knowledge who also work as spies, is revealed. The seven individuals decide to travel together, and, after fending off a gnoll attack in the town of Alfield, name themselves \"The Mighty Nein\". \n\nThe Zadash story arc (episodes 8\u201318) covers the party's adventures in the Empire city of Zadash. They do some jobs for the Crownsguard, the official police forces; but also help a secret group that fights corrupt high ranking government officials. During this time, the \"Zauber Spire\", a mage tower in the middle of the city, nearly crumbles in an attack. The group run into one of the attackers, a fleeing Drow. He is later killed by Crownsguard, but the Nein \u2014 unbeknownst to anyone else \u2014 \"acquire\" the mysterious power source he seemingly stole from the mages of the Empire-allied Cerberus Assembly. This event seemingly becomes the catalyst for war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Drow of the Kryn Dynasty, who rule over the eastern country of Xhorhas. Meanwhile, the Mighty Nein start doing jobs for The Gentleman, an enigmatic figure who controls the criminal underground of Zadash. During this time, it is revealed that Molly is missing many of his memories. At the end of this arc, the Nein win Zadash\u2018s annual fighting tournament. At the after-party, they meet Cerberus Assembly archmage Trent Ikithon. Caleb, who was not noticed, later on entrusts the horrible secrets of his past in the service of Ikithon to Nott and Beau - he was once trained to be an Empire assassin. \n\nIn the Labenda Swamp/Iron Shepards story arc (episodes 19\u201331), the Mighty Nein decide to keep away from the beginning war and deal with two missions for the Gentleman. The first one leads them into the Labenda Swamp, where they investigate a smuggler\u2018s safe house that went dark. The party also find a mysterious orb \u2014 which is suddenly sucked into Fjord's body. For their second mission, the party travels to the Empire's northern border, where they are supposed to aid an ally of the Gentleman in the lawless city of Shady Creek Run. On their way, the party are ambushed by a group of slavers known as the \"Iron Shepards\". Fjord, Jester, and Yasha are kidnapped, and a rescue attempt from the rest of the Nein leads to Molly's death at the hands of Lorenzo, the leader of the slavers. Caleb, Beau, and Nott gather new allies \u2014 including Caduceus, the last keeper of a holy graveyard in the forest outside of Shady Creek Run. They attack the Iron Shepards in their stronghold, rescuing their friends and killing the slavers. Following these traumatic events, the group, alongside Caduceus, who wants to accompany them, returns to Zadash. After learning of Molly's fate, a grieving Yasha leaves the party temporarily. \n\nThe False Serpent arc (episodes 32\u201347) follows the Mighty Nein as they travel southwards, out of the Empire and to the city states of the Menagerie Coast. They visit Jester's hometown, the coastal city of Nicodranas, where they meet Jester's mother, Marion Lavorre, a famed courtesan. Surprisingly, they also meet Yasha again, who rejoins the group. Later, an absolutely crazy series of events involving the group, pirates and the city guards leads to the party fleeing by sailing a ship onto the Lucidian Ocean. They embark on a months-long journey, discovering that Fjord's powers \u2014 and the orb \u2014 are granted to him by an ancient and evil being named \"Uk'otoa\", which was sealed away a long time ago. The party is forced into working with the cunning pirate captain Avantika, another one of Uk'otoa's chosen, who plans to release her ancient \"god\". After breaking one of three seals that are holding Uk'otoa back, a rest on Darktow, an island controlled by pirates, gives the Mighty Nein the opportunity to sever their ties with Avantika. She is executed for treason by the \"Plank King\", the leader of the pirates. Fjord, however, continues to follow Uk'otoa's path, breaking the second seal. In the end, he figures out that he does not want to release an evil calamity, and abandons the search for the third seal. Back in Nicodranas, the Nein meet Yussah Erennis, a strange elven mage, who they entrust with a weird magical item they had found. Then, the Mighty Nein return to the Empire, where the city of Felderwin was attacked by Kryn.\n\nIn the Xhorhas story arc (episodes 48\u201369), the Mighty Nein travel east and have to deal with the reality of the war. In Felderwin, they learn that a Halfling named Yeza was taken by the Kryn, which leads Nott to confess that she is a Halfling who was magically changed into a Goblin. She's also married to Yeza, with whom she has a son, Luc. Searching for Yeza, the group travels into the wastelands of Xhorhas. In the city of Asarius, they take on mercenary work for the Kryn, sealing a strange rift to the Abyss, the demonic plane. As their reward, the group are granted an audience with Leylas Kryn, the Bright Queen, ruler of the Kryn Dynasty. During the audience in the capital, Rosohna, the party are accused of espionage. In an effort to save their lives, Caleb hands over the object the party \"acquired\" in Zadash. It turns out to be one of the \"Beacons of the Luxon\", key parts of the Kryn's religion that were stolen by the Cerberus Assembly \u2013 a reason for the war. The Mighty Nein are declared heroes, and Yeza and Nott are reunited. Following this, the party find more demonic rifts they manage to seal. The Kryn reward them with a house in Rosohna. During this time, Yasha tells the whole group about her own dark past \u2013 parts of which she doesn\u2019t remember. Also, Beau has to deal with her mentor Dairon, who has infiltrated Xhorhas for the Cobalt Soul. Over time, the Mighty Nein figure out that the rifts were opened on purpose. They chase the responsible person, Obann, to a place called Bazzoxan, where he lures them into an ancient underground temple. Here, Obann reveals himself as a demon and releases an ancient, mad terror known as the \"Laughing Hand\". Also, Yasha seemingly turns on the party. She had, in the past of which she was missing memories, served under Obann in the cult of a being called the \"Angel of Irons\". The others barely escape with their lives, unaware that Yasha was controlled by Obann. \n\nThe Angel of Irons story arc (episode 70\u201386) follows the remaining party members after Bazzoxan. They reunite Yeza and Luc, escorting them to live with Marion Lavorre in Nicodranas. Searching for more power to beat the Laughing Hand, the Mighty Nein travel to the \"Greying Wildlands\", north of the Empire and Xhorhas, where they hope to reforge an ancient sword known as the \"Star Razor\". With help from the Dust family, keepers of a holy kiln, as well as from a smith and a vigilante from the city of Uthodorn, the reforging process is a success. However, during their travels, the Nein only narrowly escape from an encounter with the ancient white dragon Gelidon \u2013 and during this time, Uk'otoa takes away Fjord's magical powers because he disobeyed his patron. Fjord manages to destroy his pact weapon, and, with guidance from Caduceus, becomes a Paladin of the Cleric's goddess, the Wildmother. He now wields Star Razor. During this arc, Beau is promoted within the Cobalt Soul order. The group \u2014 via Jester's Scrying spell \u2014 witness an attack on the Cobalt Soul library in Zadash, carried out by Obann, Yasha, and the Laughing Hand. They manage to deduce their next goal, but come up short again when Obann manages to release another ancient terror, the \"Caedogeist\". Seeking guidance, the Mighty Nein visit the mage Yussah, who has vanished into the age-old \u201eHeirloom Sphere\u201c, the magical object the Mighty Nein had left with him. The Nein, supported by Yussah\u2019s ally Allura Vysoren, follow and free him while also finding a way to weaken the Laughing Hand. After this, a ritual reveals the true face of the Angel of Irons: Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion, the maddest and oldest darkness trying to break its shackles. Under the Empire's capital, Rexxentrum, the Mighty Nein confront the \"Angel\" cult for the final time \u2013 all while Kryn forces attack the city. They break Obann's influence over Yasha, who obliterates her abuser shortly after, and kill the Laughing Hand, while the Caedogeist turns on Obann and flees. \n\nThe current story arc (ongoing from Episode 87) starts with the Mighty Nein being brought before King Bertrand Dwendal and his advisors, including Cerberus Assembly members Ludinus Da'leth and Trent Ikithon. They convince the King that they stopped a dangerous cult, but have to admit they have contacts in the Dynasty. However, the King and the Assembly want the Nein to help broker a peace, using the second stolen Beacon as a peace offering. At this time, Ikithon reveals that he has recognised Caleb as his former student, Bren. Caleb also has to confront two other students of Trent: his former friends Eodwulf and Astrid. Beau discovers that the Assembly has found yet another Beacon that the Dynasty doesn\u2019t know about \u2013 giving them the opportunity to end the war and keep a Beacon. The party convince the Bright Queen to hold peace talks on neutral ground without mentioning this detail. During the preparations for the talks, the Mighty Nein deal with some of their private problems. Caleb and Essek, a gifted mage and their friend from the Dynasty, create a spell that can turn Nott back into a Halfing. The spell fails - because Nott was not only turned, but cursed. The search for the magic woman who did this to Nott leads the Nein to someone who Beau\u2019s father once made a deal with: Isharnai, a crone-like being. The Nein visit Beau's parents, with whom she\u2019s had a bad falling out \u2013 their reunion sends Beau in a mental downward spiral. The subsequent meeting with Isharnai is saved by Jester, who masterfully tricks Isharnai into lifting Nott's curse. This triggers a revelation from the Traveler, Jester's enigmatic god: He is actually not a god, but an archfey named Artagan - who has become something more thanks to Jester's belief. The Nein also help Caduceus on his path, as he finds a possibility to help his dying forest home and reunites with his family \u2013 who were turned to stone on the last leg of their own journeys, a curse that is broken by the party. Caduceus' family returns home, and soon after, the spell on Nott works. She becomes herself again: Veth, a Halfling. With the peace talks approaching, both Caduceus and Veth agree to travel with the Nein for a little longer.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{As of|since=y|2015|10|post=,}} ''Critical Role'' has consisted of eight main cast members, all of whom are the original cast.

A one-shot could be described as the RPG equivalent to a [[short story]].\n\nSome of the ''Critical Role'' one-shots are canonical parts of the storylines that play out in one of the campaigns, covering events that occur outside the time frame of the respective campaign, but still feature some of the campaign's main characters. Other one-shots only have a tangential relationship to the campaigns, as they are set in the world of Exandria, but feature a different cast of characters, often in smaller scale adventures that may or may not be canon. There are also one-shots that have no connection with the campaigns or the world of Exandria at all.<ref>e.g. \n*{{cite web |title=Critical Role \u2013 Liam's Quest: Full Circle |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-liams-quest-full-circle/ |publisher=[[Geek & Sundry]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |date=April 24, 2017}} - where O'Brien was Dungeon Master for a one-shot separate from the ''Critical Role'' fictional Universe.\n*{{cite web |title=Critical Role: Bar Room Blitz \u2013 A Sam Riegel One-Shot |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-bar-room-blitz/ |publisher=[[Geek & Sundry]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |date=September 4, 2017}} - in which Riegel is Dungeon Master with O'Brien and several guests playing. This story is set within Exandria.</ref> Especially for the latter two types of one-shots, it is not uncommon that several guest players replace absent cast members.\n\n''Critical Role'' aired several one-shots in the hiatus between Campaign one and Campaign two. Also, during the runtime of a campaign, the series will occasionally air (sometimes prerecorded) one-shots as replacements for regular episodes, for example on Thursdays on which multiple cast members are unavailable due to other work commitments. Sometimes one-shots are aired as additional content, for example as rewards for the fans donating money to a charity the cast promoted. Not all ''Critical Role'' one-shots use the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game system, as some are based on different, sometimes one-page, RPG games. Also, in many one-shots, other cast members take over the role of Dungeon Master or [[Gamemaster|game master]] (GM) from Matthew Mercer. {{As of|2019|10}}, over 25 one-shots have aired, and every cast member\u2014with the exception of Ashley Johnson\u2014has taken up the duties of DMing or GMing at least once.\n\nSome of ''Critical Role'''s one shots have been sponsored. One-shot sponsors have included ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'', ''[[Hearthstone]]'', and ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]''. In 2019, a Critical Role one-shot was sponsored by [[Wendy's]] to promote the ''Feast of Legends'' RPG system<ref name=\"WC2019-Wendy\">{{cite news |last1=Williamson |first1=Evan |title=Wendy\u2019s expands its focus beyond food |url=https://westerncourier.com/45614/the-edge/wendys-expands-its-focus-beyond-food/ |accessdate=October 23, 2019 |work=Western Courier |date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> developed by the company.

On each ''Talks Machina'' episode, Foster and a few (usually two) cast members discuss the most recent installment of ''Critical Role''. A few days before a new episode of ''Talks Machina'', the cast members who will be present as guests on the respective episode are announced, and fans can submit questions which they want these cast members to answer. Some questions are picked out by the ''Talks Machina'' crew and answered on-air by the cast, allowing the fans to gain some more insight on in-game events, decisions, or character development.\n\n''Talks Machina'' also runs weekly competitions for fan content, such as \"fan art of the week\" and \"cosplay of the week\". The winners are announced in special segments that act as interludes during the show. Prizes for the winners of these competitions include ''Critical Role'' merchandise, Wyrmwood products, or special merchandise from the respective episode's sponsor.\n\nOriginally, the first 100 episodes of ''Talks Machina'' were broadcast on Geek & Sundry's channels. Beginning in February 2019, and coinciding with Critical Role's split from Geek & Sundry, new episodes began airing on the ''Critical Role'' Twitch channel. The VODs are available to Twitch subscribers immediately after the initial broadcast, and are also uploaded to YouTube on the following Thursday. Beginning in December 2019, as part of the migration of older content to the ''Critical Role'' channels, some episodes of Talks Machina were deleted from Geek & Sundry's channels and re-uploaded to the official ''Critical Role'' channels. All episodes can be accessed via playlists provided on ''Critical Role'''s website and YouTube channel.\n\n====''Critical Recap''====\nHosted by Critical Role production coordinator Dani Carr, ''Critical Recap'' is a short video series that quickly summarizes the events of the previous week's episode of ''Critical Role''.<ref name=\"CritRecap\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDrGA0fPDig |title=Critical Recap: Campaign 2, Episodes 1 - 10 -- The Story So Far |publisher=Geek & Sundry |website=Youtube.com |last=Carr |first=Dani |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> Starting with Episode 11 of Campaign two, ''Critical Recap'' aired on the Geek & Sundry Twitch channel before the ''Critical Role'' live stream on Thursdays.

The show started streaming in March 2015, partway through the cast's first campaign. \"Campaign One\" ran for 115 episodes, and ended in October 2017. The cast started playing \"Campaign Two\" in January 2018, which is still ongoing {{As of|2020|04|lc=y|df=}}. A number of one-shots were aired in the [[Hiatus (television)|hiatus]] between the two campaigns.\n\nThe series is broadcast live on Thursdays at 19:00&nbsp;[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]] on the Critical Role [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] channel, with the [[video on demand]] (VOD) being available to Twitch subscribers immediately after the broadcast. On the Monday following the live stream, the VODs are made available for the public on Critical Role's website and uploaded to their [[YouTube]] channel.\n\nA number of licensed works based on the show have been released, such as the official campaign setting guide written by the show's dungeon master, [[Matthew Mercer]].\n\nCritical Role is also the name of the studio owned by the cast. The studio has produced ''Critical Role'' and ''Talks Machina'' since 2018. It also develops and produces other programming for the studio's Twitch and YouTube channels.\n\n==Campaign structure==\nThe ''Critical Role'' storyline occurs in a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] that consists of a series of story arcs, which are usually played over multiple episodes. Between\u2014or sometimes within\u2014the major story arcs, the characters rest, resupply, or go on side quests. In addition, every player character has a [[backstory]], an unfinished part of their personal history that can be relevant to the campaign from time to time. Sometimes, major story arcs are intrinsically tied to a character's backstory.\n\nBoth campaigns are set in Exandria, a world of Matthew Mercer's creation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddkenreck/2017/06/06/matthew-mercer-on-critical-roles-taldorei-campaign-setting-guide/ |title=Matthew Mercer On Critical Role's Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Guide |work=[[Forbes]] |last=Kenreck |first=Todd |date=June 6, 2017 |accessdate=May 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign one===\nCampaign one [[Campaign setting|takes place]] primarily in Tal'Dorei, a continent of Exandria. It follows the exploits of an adventuring party known as '''Vox Machina''', previously known as the Super High-Intensity Team (or S.H.I.T.s), a rag-tag group of mercenaries originally formed in the swamp-town of Stilben.\n\n====Pre-series history====\nIn their adventures prior to the start of the series, the group saved the family of Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei III, ruler of Tal'Dorei and its capital city of Emon. In appreciation, Uriel gave the group seats on the city [[council]], and provided them with a residence called Greyskull Keep, which is located just outside the city. Episode 36, titled ''Winter's Crest in Whitestone'', features a summary of the pre-series history (starting 1 hour 35 minutes into the episode), with artwork created by Wendy Sullivan Green and voice-overs provided by the cast.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EikRMYRf5-Y&t=96m21s |title=Winter's Crest in Whitestone : Critical Role RPG Show Episode 36 - The Story of Vox Machina |publisher=Geek & Sundry |date=December 18, 2015 |medium=Youtube video |time=1:36:21 |access-date=May 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe forthcoming ''Critical Role'' animated series will include a canonic story that takes place within the pre-stream time frame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/criticalrole/critical-role-the-legend-of-vox-machina-animated-s/description |title=Critical Role: The Legend of Vox Machina Animated Special |website=Kickstarter |accessdate=May 9, 2019 |quote=\"... the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch.\"}}</ref>\n\n====On-stream campaign====\nThe first episode of the show aired on March 12, 2015, beginning the on-stream part of the first campaign, which concluded with its 115th and final episode on October 12, 2017.<ref name=\"bleedingcool\"/><ref>{{cite tweet |number=920015612184686592 |title=The end. |user=CriticalRole |author=Critical Role |date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Kraghammer story arc (16 episodes, 1\u201316) jumps in at the point in Vox Machina's story where the cast's original home game left off. It takes place primarily in the subterrenean depths of the [[Underdark]], and culminates in a battle between Vox Machina and a dangerous [[Beholder (Dungeons & Dragons)|beholder]] by the name of K'varn, who is controlling an entire city of [[Illithid]].\n\nThe Vasselheim story arc (7 episodes, 17\u201323) splits the party into two groups, who seek to prove their worth to the \"Slayer's Take\", a local adventurer's guild in the ancient city of Vasselheim, by taking on dangerous missions. This arc features multi-episode [[guest appearance]]s by [[Felicia Day]] (Lyra), [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]] (Zahra), [[Wil Wheaton]] (Thorbir), and [[Will Friedle]] (Kashaw), adding a new twist to the now-divided adventuring band. This arc also includes the first episode (episode 22) that touches on a character's backstory, as Keyleth visits another druid tribe to continue her Arament\u00e9, a journey to become the leader of her people.\n\nThe Briarwood story arc (15 episodes, 24\u201338) leads Vox Machina to Percy's ancestral home, the city of Whitestone, which was once ruled by his family. The party have to fight for control over Whitestone against Lord and Lady Briarwood, who are responsible for the demise of most of the de Rolo family and have taken the city as their own. The Briarwood's ties into necromancy and a secret cult make things even more dangerous, and Vox Machina must stop them from completing a ritual that threatens to endanger the entire kingdom. During the early stages of this arc, Tiberius leaves Vox Machina for good.\n\nThe Chroma Conclave story arc (45 episodes, 39\u201383) begins with the attack of four ancient [[chromatic dragon]]s on Emon, the capital of Tal'Dorei, with the Sovereign and other important political figures falling in the onslaught. The dragons take control over and divide the kingdom, and in order to defeat them, Vox Machina needs more power than they currently have. They search for the \"Vestiges of Divergence\", famed and extremely powerful magical items from ages passed, which are scattered throughout the world. During the ongoing battles against the powerful dragons of the Chroma Conclave, the backstories of some characters are also further explored. Smaller arcs focus on Grog's herd that once exiled him, the last figure from Percy's traumatic past, as well as a strained family reunion for the twins, Vex and Vax.\n\nThe Taryon Darrington story arc (16 episodes, 84\u201399) begins with the departure of Scanlan from the group, whose mental problems and disagreements with the group culminate in an argument that shakes the party. While traveling to Ank'Harel on the continent of Marquet, Vox Machina meet Taryon Darrington, an inexperienced aspiring author and adventurer. Adventuring together with Taryon, some smaller story arcs see Vox Machina helping Keyleth (who seeks to complete her Arament\u00e9), literally traveling to hell, as well as dealing with Taryon's family, who reside in the Dwendalian Empire on the continent of Wildemount. During this arc, which is loosely defined by Scanlan's absence and Taryon's presence in the party, Pike's family also makes an appearance and her relationship with them is explored. The arc includes a one year time skip between episodes 94 and 95.\n\nThe Cult of [[Vecna]] story arc (16 episodes, 100\u2013115) revisits the mysterious and dangerous artifact that was activated beneath Whitestone Castle during the Briarwood story arc. Scanlan finally rejoins Vox Machina, while the party now has to fight a cult which tries to summon the evil [[lich]] demigod Vecna, who seeks to ascend to true godhood and rule Exandria. His ascension actually succeeds and he becomes the only god on this side of the Divine Gate, which keeps the other gods from directly interfering in the world they created. With the indirect help of some of the prime deities who aid them with special powers, Vox Machina are the only group of heroes who can possibly stop the \"Whispered One\" in one gigantic final battle.\n\n====Post-campaign====\nIn 2019, over a year after the first campaign ended, Critical Role produced three canonical one-shot games that feature Vox Machina in the time frame after the banishment of Vecna. The first one-shot, ''Vox Machina: The Search for Grog'', was played at a live show in Los Angeles on January 19, 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://critrole.com/event/live-show-vox-machina-the-search-for-grog/|title=[LIVE SHOW] Vox Machina: The Search for Grog {{!}} Critical Role|date=2018-12-11|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> then broadcast on Twitch on February 22, 2019 before being released via YouTube and Twitch VOD on February 23, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://critrole.com/the-search-for-grog-vod-update/|title=The Search for Grog VOD Update {{!}} Critical Role|date=2019-01-17|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-23}}</ref> It explored an event that took place in the final episode of Campaign one, but was not played out in detail because it would have disrupted the ongoing epilogue.

It stars Sam Riegel as Taryon Darrington, honorary member of Vox Machina, who leads a group of new characters into their own adventures.

The story is set on the continent of Wildemount, which was briefly visited during the Vox Machina campaign. The Mighty Nein campaign is set about 20 years after Vox Machina's final battle against [[Vecna]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16666344/dungeons-and-dragons-twitch-roleplay-rpgs-critical-role-streaming-gaming |title=The rise of D&D liveplay is changing how fans approach roleplaying |work=[[The Verge]] |last=DeVille |first=Chris |date=November 16, 2017 |access-date=December 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-one-chapter-closes-and-another-begins/ |title=Critical Role: One Chapter Closes, And Another Begins |last=Knox |first=Kelly |publisher=Geek & Sundry |date=December 18, 2017 |access-date=December 23, 2017}}</ref> and takes place in a time where tensions between two of Wildemount\u2019s mightiest nations are very high.\n\nThe Trostenwald/Alfield story arc (episodes 1\u20137) serves as an origin story for the new adventuring party, whose members meet for the first time in a town called Trostenwald within the Dwendalian Empire. They are: Fjord, a male half-orc who gained magical powers out of nowhere; Jester, a young female tiefling who follows an unknown god; Caleb, a very guarded male human wizard; Nott, a seemingly benevolent female goblin; and Beauregard (\"Beau\"), a young human woman \"on a wandering tour\". They meet Mollymauk (\"Molly\"), a pompous tiefling, and Yasha, a quiet swordswoman, who work for a traveling circus. An Undead attack during a circus performance forces the seven to work together, as they have to prove they were not responsible for the incident. During this arc, Beau\u2019s connection to the monk order of the \"Cobalt Soul\", keepers of knowledge who also work as spies, is revealed. The seven individuals decide to travel together, and, after fending off a gnoll attack in the town of Alfield, name themselves \"The Mighty Nein\". \n\nThe Zadash story arc (episodes 8\u201318) covers the party's adventures in the Empire city of Zadash. They do some jobs for the Crownsguard, the official police forces; but also help a secret group that fights corrupt high ranking government officials. During this time, the \"Zauber Spire\", a mage tower in the middle of the city, nearly crumbles in an attack. The group run into one of the attackers, a fleeing Drow. He is later killed by Crownsguard, but the Nein \u2014 unbeknownst to anyone else \u2014 \"acquire\" the mysterious power source he seemingly stole from the mages of the Empire-allied Cerberus Assembly. This event seemingly becomes the catalyst for war between the Dwendalian Empire and the Drow of the Kryn Dynasty, who rule over the eastern country of Xhorhas. Meanwhile, the Mighty Nein start doing jobs for The Gentleman, an enigmatic figure who controls the criminal underground of Zadash. During this time, it is revealed that Molly is missing many of his memories. At the end of this arc, the Nein win Zadash\u2018s annual fighting tournament. At the after-party, they meet Cerberus Assembly archmage Trent Ikithon. Caleb, who was not noticed, later on entrusts the horrible secrets of his past in the service of Ikithon to Nott and Beau - he was once trained to be an Empire assassin. \n\nIn the Labenda Swamp/Iron Shepards story arc (episodes 19\u201331), the Mighty Nein decide to keep away from the beginning war and deal with two missions for the Gentleman. The first one leads them into the Labenda Swamp, where they investigate a smuggler\u2018s safe house that went dark. The party also find a mysterious orb \u2014 which is suddenly sucked into Fjord's body. For their second mission, the party travels to the Empire's northern border, where they are supposed to aid an ally of the Gentleman in the lawless city of Shady Creek Run. On their way, the party are ambushed by a group of slavers known as the \"Iron Shepards\". Fjord, Jester, and Yasha are kidnapped, and a rescue attempt from the rest of the Nein leads to Molly's death at the hands of Lorenzo, the leader of the slavers. Caleb, Beau, and Nott gather new allies \u2014 including Caduceus, the last keeper of a holy graveyard in the forest outside of Shady Creek Run. They attack the Iron Shepards in their stronghold, rescuing their friends and killing the slavers. Following these traumatic events, the group, alongside Caduceus, who wants to accompany them, returns to Zadash. After learning of Molly's fate, a grieving Yasha leaves the party temporarily. \n\nThe False Serpent arc (episodes 32\u201347) follows the Mighty Nein as they travel southwards, out of the Empire and to the city states of the Menagerie Coast. They visit Jester's hometown, the coastal city of Nicodranas, where they meet Jester's mother, Marion Lavorre, a famed courtesan. Surprisingly, they also meet Yasha again, who rejoins the group. Later, an absolutely crazy series of events involving the group, pirates and the city guards leads to the party fleeing by sailing a ship onto the Lucidian Ocean. They embark on a months-long journey, discovering that Fjord's powers \u2014 and the orb \u2014 are granted to him by an ancient and evil being named \"Uk'otoa\", which was sealed away a long time ago. The party is forced into working with the cunning pirate captain Avantika, another one of Uk'otoa's chosen, who plans to release her ancient \"god\". After breaking one of three seals that are holding Uk'otoa back, a rest on Darktow, an island controlled by pirates, gives the Mighty Nein the opportunity to sever their ties with Avantika. She is executed for treason by the \"Plank King\", the leader of the pirates. Fjord, however, continues to follow Uk'otoa's path, breaking the second seal. In the end, he figures out that he does not want to release an evil calamity, and abandons the search for the third seal. Back in Nicodranas, the Nein meet Yussah Erennis, a strange elven mage, who they entrust with a weird magical item they had found. Then, the Mighty Nein return to the Empire, where the city of Felderwin was attacked by Kryn.\n\nIn the Xhorhas story arc (episodes 48\u201369), the Mighty Nein travel east and have to deal with the reality of the war. In Felderwin, they learn that a Halfling named Yeza was taken by the Kryn, which leads Nott to confess that she is a Halfling who was magically changed into a Goblin. She's also married to Yeza, with whom she has a son, Luc. Searching for Yeza, the group travels into the wastelands of Xhorhas. In the city of Asarius, they take on mercenary work for the Kryn, sealing a strange rift to the Abyss, the demonic plane. As their reward, the group are granted an audience with Leylas Kryn, the Bright Queen, ruler of the Kryn Dynasty. During the audience in the capital, Rosohna, the party are accused of espionage. In an effort to save their lives, Caleb hands over the object the party \"acquired\" in Zadash. It turns out to be one of the \"Beacons of the Luxon\", key parts of the Kryn's religion that were stolen by the Cerberus Assembly \u2013 a reason for the war. The Mighty Nein are declared heroes, and Yeza and Nott are reunited. Following this, the party find more demonic rifts they manage to seal. The Kryn reward them with a house in Rosohna. During this time, Yasha tells the whole group about her own dark past \u2013 parts of which she doesn\u2019t remember. Also, Beau has to deal with her mentor Dairon, who has infiltrated Xhorhas for the Cobalt Soul. Over time, the Mighty Nein figure out that the rifts were opened on purpose. They chase the responsible person, Obann, to a place called Bazzoxan, where he lures them into an ancient underground temple. Here, Obann reveals himself as a demon and releases an ancient, mad terror known as the \"Laughing Hand\". Also, Yasha seemingly turns on the party. She had, in the past of which she was missing memories, served under Obann in the cult of a being called the \"Angel of Irons\". The others barely escape with their lives, unaware that Yasha was controlled by Obann. \n\nThe Angel of Irons story arc (episode 70\u201386) follows the remaining party members after Bazzoxan. They reunite Yeza and Luc, escorting them to live with Marion Lavorre in Nicodranas. Searching for more power to beat the Laughing Hand, the Mighty Nein travel to the \"Greying Wildlands\", north of the Empire and Xhorhas, where they hope to reforge an ancient sword known as the \"Star Razor\". With help from the Dust family, keepers of a holy kiln, as well as from a smith and a vigilante from the city of Uthodorn, the reforging process is a success. However, during their travels, the Nein only narrowly escape from an encounter with the ancient white dragon Gelidon \u2013 and during this time, Uk'otoa takes away Fjord's magical powers because he disobeyed his patron. Fjord manages to destroy his pact weapon, and, with guidance from Caduceus, becomes a Paladin of the Cleric's goddess, the Wildmother. He now wields Star Razor. During this arc, Beau is promoted within the Cobalt Soul order. The group \u2014 via Jester's Scrying spell \u2014 witness an attack on the Cobalt Soul library in Zadash, carried out by Obann, Yasha, and the Laughing Hand. They manage to deduce their next goal, but come up short again when Obann manages to release another ancient terror, the \"Caedogeist\". Seeking guidance, the Mighty Nein visit the mage Yussah, who has vanished into the age-old \u201eHeirloom Sphere\u201c, the magical object the Mighty Nein had left with him. The Nein, supported by Yussah\u2019s ally Allura Vysoren, follow and free him while also finding a way to weaken the Laughing Hand. After this, a ritual reveals the true face of the Angel of Irons: Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion, the maddest and oldest darkness trying to break its shackles. Under the Empire's capital, Rexxentrum, the Mighty Nein confront the \"Angel\" cult for the final time \u2013 all while Kryn forces attack the city. They break Obann's influence over Yasha, who obliterates her abuser shortly after, and kill the Laughing Hand, while the Caedogeist turns on Obann and flees. \n\nThe current story arc (ongoing from Episode 87) starts with the Mighty Nein being brought before King Bertrand Dwendal and his advisors, including Cerberus Assembly members Ludinus Da'leth and Trent Ikithon. They convince the King that they stopped a dangerous cult, but have to admit they have contacts in the Dynasty. However, the King and the Assembly want the Nein to help broker a peace, using the second stolen Beacon as a peace offering. At this time, Ikithon reveals that he has recognised Caleb as his former student, Bren. Caleb also has to confront two other students of Trent: his former friends Eodwulf and Astrid. Beau discovers that the Assembly has found yet another Beacon that the Dynasty doesn\u2019t know about \u2013 giving them the opportunity to end the war and keep a Beacon. The party convince the Bright Queen to hold peace talks on neutral ground without mentioning this detail. During the preparations for the talks, the Mighty Nein deal with some of their private problems. Caleb and Essek, a gifted mage and their friend from the Dynasty, create a spell that can turn Nott back into a Halfing. The spell fails - because Nott was not only turned, but cursed. The search for the magic woman who did this to Nott leads the Nein to someone who Beau\u2019s father once made a deal with: Isharnai, a crone-like being. The Nein visit Beau's parents, with whom she\u2019s had a bad falling out \u2013 their reunion sends Beau in a mental downward spiral. The subsequent meeting with Isharnai is saved by Jester, who masterfully tricks Isharnai into lifting Nott's curse. This triggers a revelation from the Traveler, Jester's enigmatic god: He is actually not a god, but an archfey named Artagan - who has become something more thanks to Jester's belief. The Nein also help Caduceus on his path, as he finds a possibility to help his dying forest home and reunites with his family \u2013 who were turned to stone on the last leg of their own journeys, a curse that is broken by the party. Caduceus' family returns home, and soon after, the spell on Nott works. She becomes herself again: Veth, a Halfling. With the peace talks approaching, both Caduceus and Veth agree to travel with the Nein for a little longer.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{As of|since=y|2015|10|post=,}} ''Critical Role'' has consisted of eight main cast members, all of whom are the original cast.

A one-shot could be described as the RPG equivalent to a [[short story]].\n\nSome of the ''Critical Role'' one-shots are canonical parts of the storylines that play out in one of the campaigns, covering events that occur outside the time frame of the respective campaign, but still feature some of the campaign's main characters. Other one-shots only have a tangential relationship to the campaigns, as they are set in the world of Exandria, but feature a different cast of characters, often in smaller scale adventures that may or may not be canon. There are also one-shots that have no connection with the campaigns or the world of Exandria at all.<ref>e.g. \n*{{cite web |title=Critical Role \u2013 Liam's Quest: Full Circle |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-liams-quest-full-circle/ |publisher=[[Geek & Sundry]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |date=April 24, 2017}} - where O'Brien was Dungeon Master for a one-shot separate from the ''Critical Role'' fictional Universe.\n*{{cite web |title=Critical Role: Bar Room Blitz \u2013 A Sam Riegel One-Shot |url=https://geekandsundry.com/critical-role-bar-room-blitz/ |publisher=[[Geek & Sundry]] |accessdate=July 18, 2018 |date=September 4, 2017}} - in which Riegel is Dungeon Master with O'Brien and several guests playing. This story is set within Exandria.</ref> Especially for the latter two types of one-shots, it is not uncommon that several guest players replace absent cast members.\n\n''Critical Role'' aired several one-shots in the hiatus between Campaign one and Campaign two. Also, during the runtime of a campaign, the series will occasionally air (sometimes prerecorded) one-shots as replacements for regular episodes, for example on Thursdays on which multiple cast members are unavailable due to other work commitments. Sometimes one-shots are aired as additional content, for example as rewards for the fans donating money to a charity the cast promoted. Not all ''Critical Role'' one-shots use the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game system, as some are based on different, sometimes one-page, RPG games. Also, in many one-shots, other cast members take over the role of Dungeon Master or [[Gamemaster|game master]] (GM) from Matthew Mercer. {{As of|2019|10}}, over 25 one-shots have aired, and every cast member\u2014with the exception of Ashley Johnson\u2014has taken up the duties of DMing or GMing at least once.\n\nSome of ''Critical Role'''s one shots have been sponsored. One-shot sponsors have included ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'', ''[[Hearthstone]]'', and ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]''. In 2019, a Critical Role one-shot was sponsored by [[Wendy's]] to promote the ''Feast of Legends'' RPG system<ref name=\"WC2019-Wendy\">{{cite news |last1=Williamson |first1=Evan |title=Wendy\u2019s expands its focus beyond food |url=https://westerncourier.com/45614/the-edge/wendys-expands-its-focus-beyond-food/ |accessdate=October 23, 2019 |work=Western Courier |date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> developed by the company.

On each ''Talks Machina'' episode, Foster and a few (usually two) cast members discuss the most recent installment of ''Critical Role''. A few days before a new episode of ''Talks Machina'', the cast members who will be present as guests on the respective episode are announced, and fans can submit questions which they want these cast members to answer. Some questions are picked out by the ''Talks Machina'' crew and answered on-air by the cast, allowing the fans to gain some more insight on in-game events, decisions, or character development.\n\n''Talks Machina'' also runs weekly competitions for fan content, such as \"fan art of the week\" and \"cosplay of the week\". The winners are announced in special segments that act as interludes during the show. Prizes for the winners of these competitions include ''Critical Role'' merchandise, Wyrmwood products, or special merchandise from the respective episode's sponsor.\n\nOriginally, the first 100 episodes of ''Talks Machina'' were broadcast on Geek & Sundry's channels. Beginning in February 2019, and coinciding with Critical Role's split from Geek & Sundry, new episodes began airing on the ''Critical Role'' Twitch channel. The VODs are available to Twitch subscribers immediately after the initial broadcast, and are also uploaded to YouTube on the following Thursday. Beginning in December 2019, as part of the migration of older content to the ''Critical Role'' channels, some episodes of Talks Machina were deleted from Geek & Sundry's channels and re-uploaded to the official ''Critical Role'' channels. All episodes can be accessed via playlists provided on ''Critical Role'''s website and YouTube channel.\n\n====''Critical Recap''====\nHosted by Critical Role production coordinator Dani Carr, ''Critical Recap'' is a short video series that quickly summarizes the events of the previous week's episode of ''Critical Role''.<ref name=\"CritRecap\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDrGA0fPDig |title=Critical Recap: Campaign 2, Episodes 1 - 10 -- The Story So Far |publisher=Geek & Sundry |website=Youtube.com |last=Carr |first=Dani |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> Starting with Episode 11 of Campaign two, ''Critical Recap'' aired on the Geek & Sundry Twitch channel before the ''Critical Role'' live stream on Thursdays.

If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, prostitution (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking. Violations of the tax code involving income tax evasion constitute membership in the unreported economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12methods.pdf|title=Internal Revenue Service Summary of Estimation Methods|author=|date=|website=irs.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"feige\">{{cite book|author=Edgar L.

These underground economies are omnipresent, existing in market oriented as well as in centrally planned nations, be they developed or developing. Those engaged in underground activities circumvent, escape or are excluded from the institutional system of rules, rights, regulations and enforcement penalties that govern formal agents engaged in production and exchange. Different types of underground activities are distinguished according to the particular institutional rules that they violate. Four major underground economies can be identified:<ref name=Feige /><ref name=\"Feige 2016\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the \"Shadow Economy\"?|last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2016|journal = Journal of Tax Administration |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 30/1}}</ref>\n\n# the illegal economy\n# the unreported economy\n# the unrecorded economy\n# the informal economy\n\nThe \"illegal economy\" consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statutes defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce.

A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported. A complementary measure of the unreported economy is the \"[[tax gap]]\", namely the difference between the amount of tax revenues due the fiscal authority and the amount of tax revenue actually collected. In the U.S. unreported income is estimated to be $2 trillion resulting in a \"tax gap\" of $450\u2013$600 billion.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the \"Tax Gap\" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe \"unrecorded economy\" consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.<ref name=\"Feige 2016\"/> A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, namely the amount of income that should (under existing rules and conventions) be recorded in national accounting systems (e.g. [[National Income and Product Accounts]]) but is not.

The [[Fence (criminal)|supplier]] does not have to pay for production costs and/or taxes. This is usually the case in the underground economy. Criminals steal goods and sell them below the legal market price, but there is no receipt, guarantee, and so forth. When someone is hired to perform work and the client is unable to write off the expense (particularly common for work such as [[home renovation]]s or [[Cosmetology|cosmetological]] services), the client may be inclined to request a lower price (usually paid in cash) in exchange for foregoing a receipt, which enables the service provider to avoid reporting the income on his or her tax return.\n* They may be more expensive than legal market prices. For example, the product is difficult to acquire or produce, dangerous to handle, is strictly rationed, or not easily available legally if at all. If exchange of goods are made illegal by some sort of [[state (polity)|state]] sanction, such as is often seen with certain pharmaceutical drugs, their prices will tend to rise as a result of that sanction.\n\n==Consumer issues==\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|No government, no global nonprofit, no multinational enterprise can seriously claim to be able to replace the 1.8 billion jobs created by the economic underground.

Many people nonetheless continue to use illegal drugs, and a black market exists to supply them. Despite law enforcement efforts to intercept them, demand remains high, providing a large [[profit motive]] for [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] to keep drugs supplied. The United Nations has reported that the retail market value of illegal drugs is $321.6 billion USD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |title=World Drug Report 2005 |work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720100713/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archivedate=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nAlthough law enforcement agencies intercept a fraction of the illegal drugs, and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of wholesale and retail sellers, the very stable demand for such drugs and the high profit margins encourages new distributors to enter the market without a decrease in the retail price.

These restrictions can range from small [[combat knife|knives]] to [[firearms]], either altogether or by classification (e.g. [[caliber]], [[handgun]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[explosives]]). The black market supplies the demands for weaponry that can not be obtained legally, or may only be obtained legally after obtaining permits and paying fees. This may be by [[smuggling]] the arms from countries where they were bought legally or stolen, or by stealing from arms manufacturers within the country itself, using [[insider]]s. In cases where the underground economy is unable to smuggle firearms, they can also satisfy requests by [[gunsmith]]ing their own firearms. Those who may buy this way include [[criminals]] to use for illegal activities, gun collectors, and otherwise law-abiding citizens interested in protecting their dwellings, families or businesses.\n\nIn England and Wales, certain categories of weapons used for hunting may be owned by qualified residents but must be registered with the local police force and kept within a locked cabinet. Another segment of the population who may purchase weapons on the black market are individuals who are unable to pass the legal requirements for registration\u2014convicted felons or those suffering from mental illness for example. In a few jurisdictions, collectors may legally keep antique weapons made incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition.\n\n===Illegally logged timber===\n{{Main|Illegal logging}}\nThe illegal logging of [[timber]] has posed as an issue.

Smuggling is usually done to circumvent [[tax]]ation or [[prohibition]] laws within a particular jurisdiction. The term ''rum-running'' is more commonly applied to smuggling over water; ''bootlegging'' is applied to smuggling over land.

But [[rum]]'s cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on to smuggling [[Canadian whisky]], French [[champagne]], and English [[gin]] to major cities like [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], where prices ran high.

Conducting a racket is racketeering.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racketeering|title= Racketeering|dictionary=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, although that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party. An archetype is the [[protection racket]], wherein a person or group (e.g., a criminal gang) indicates to a store owner that they could protect her/his store from potential damage, damage that the same person or group would otherwise inflict, while the correlation of threat and protection may be more or less deniably veiled, distinguishing it from the more direct act of [[extortion]].\nRacketeering is often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.<ref>David Witwer, \"'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s\", in {{cite book |first2=William Chester, Ed. |last2=Jordan |title=Corrupt histories |location=Rochester, New York |first1=Emmanuel, Ed. |last1=Kreike |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58046-173-3}}</ref>\n\n===Transportation providers===\n{{main|illegal taxicab operation}}\nWhere taxicabs, buses, and other transportation providers are strictly regulated or monopolized by government, a black market typically flourishes to provide transportation to poorly served or overpriced communities. In the United States, some cities restrict entry to the taxicab market with a medallion system, i.e., taxicabs must get a special license and display it on a medallion in the vehicle. In most such jurisdictions it is legal to sell the medallions, but the limited supply and resulting high prices of medallions have led to a market in unlicensed [[carpooling]]/[[illegal taxicab operation]]. In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for example, it is not uncommon for private individuals to provide illegal taxicab service<ref name=\"Baltimore\"/> for city residents.\n\n===Housing rental===\nIn places where there is [[rent control]] there may be a black market for housing. For instance, in the UK there is illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, May 4, 2011</ref> In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]]'', August 30, 2010</ref> either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner.

A determined counterfeiter with a few hundred dollars can make copies that are digitally identical to an original and face no loss in quality; innovations in consumer [[DVD]] and [[CD]] writers and the widespread availability of [[software cracking|cracks]] on the [[Internet]] for most forms of [[copy protection]] technology make this cheap and easy to do.\n\nCopyright-holders and other proponents of copyright laws have found this phenomenon hard to stop through the courts, as the operations are distributed and widespread,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} transversing national borders and thus legal systems. Since digital information can be duplicated repeatedly with no loss of quality, and passed on electronically at little to no cost, the effective underground market value of media is zero, differentiating it from nearly all other forms of underground economic activity. The issue is compounded by widespread indifference to enforcing copyright law, both with governments and the public at large. To steal a car is seen as a crime in most people's eyes, but to obtain unauthorized copies of music or a game is not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |title=Is music piracy stealing? |author=Charles W.

It also authorises copyright-holders to use [[DVD region codes|region-coding]] to discriminate against selected populations price-wise and availability-wise.\n\nThe comparison to car-theft, although common, is not truly analogous. Automobile theft results in an item being removed from the owner with the ownership transferred to a second party. Media piracy is a crime of duplication, with no physical property being stolen. Copyright infringement law goes as far as to deem illegal \"[[mixtape]]s\" and other such material copied to tape or disk. Copyright holders typically attest the act of theft to be in the profits forgone to the pirates. However, this makes the unsubstantiated assumption that the pirates would have bought the copyrighted material if it had not been available through [[file sharing]] or other means. Copyright holders also say that they did some work for creating their copyrighted material and they wish to get compensated for their work. No other system than copyright has been found to compensate the artists and other creators for their work,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} and many artists do not have any alternative source of income or another job.

This may happen for one or more of several reasons:\n* The government sets (\"pegs\") the local currency at some arbitrary level to another currency that does not reflect its true market value.\n* A government makes it difficult or illegal for its citizens to own much or any foreign currency.\n* The government taxes exchanging the local currency with other currencies, either in one direction or both (e.g. foreigners are taxed to buy local currency, or residents are taxed to buy foreign currency).\n* The currency is [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]].\n* The currency has been acquired illegally and needs to be [[money laundering|laundered]] before the money can be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/special/blackpeso.html |title=Drug Wars: Special Reports: The Black Peso Money Laudering System |work=PBS Frontline |author1=Oriana Zill |author2=Lowell Bergman |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nA government may officially set the rate of exchange of its currency with that of other currencies, typically the [[US dollar]]. When it does, the peg often overvalues the local currency relative to what its market value would be if it were a [[floating currency]]. Those in possession of the \"harder\" currency, for example [[expatriate]] workers, may be able to use the black market to buy the local currency at better exchange rates than they can get officially.\n\nIn situations of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency for the local currency.

See also the example of the [[Ghanaian cedi]] from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIf foreign currency is difficult or illegal for local citizens to acquire, they will pay a premium to acquire it. U.S. currency is viewed as a relatively stable store of value and since it does not leave a paper trail,{{Dubious|reason=serial numbers|date=March 2012}} it is also a convenient medium of exchange for both illegal transactions and for [[tax evasion|unreported income]] both in the U.S and abroad.<ref name=\"Cebula and Feige\">{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nMore recently [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] such as [[bitcoin]] have been used as medium of exchange in black market transactions.

This is known as [[fuel dyes|dyed fuel]], because a coloured dye is added so it can be detected if used in other vehicles (e.g. a red dye in the UK, a green dye in Ireland). Nevertheless, the saving is attractive enough to make a black market in agricultural diesel. In 2007 it was estimated that \u00a3350 million was not gained in profit as a result of this phenomenon, in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[What Car?]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Group]] |title=Red diesel abuse costs UK millions |date=November 7, 2007 |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/red-diesel-abuse-costs-uk-millions/229086 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn countries like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and it is illegal to sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for hours or even sometimes overnight to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 economic blockade]] imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.\n\n===Sex toys===\nThere are some countries where sex toys are illegal, such as Saudi Arabia, Thailand and India. The illegality has omitted certain clearing processes such as safety testing when they are sold by undercover independent vendors on the black market.

States that are engaged in [[total war]] or other large-scale, extended [[war]]s often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], etc., typically through [[rationing]]. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] enforced in many countries during [[World War II]] encouraged widespread black market activity.<ref name=\"TheHomeFront\">{{cite book |title=The Home Front|date=July 1945|isbn=978-1-904897-11-8|publisher=Imperial War Museum|location=London|edition=facsimile}}</ref> One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] than actually happened.

Although these activities were illegal, only flagrant or large-scale black-marketeers were prosecuted by the military.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Laws and regulations===\nA classic example of new regulation creating a black market is the [[prohibition]] of alcohol.

If the rule defines the set of goods and services whose production and distribution is prohibited by law, non-compliance with the rule constitutes a black market trade since the transaction itself is illegal. Parties engaging in the production or distribution of prohibited goods and services are members of the illegal economy. Examples include the drug trade, prostitution (where prohibited), illegal currency transactions and human trafficking. Violations of the tax code involving income tax evasion constitute membership in the unreported economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/06rastg12methods.pdf|title=Internal Revenue Service Summary of Estimation Methods|author=|date=|website=irs.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"feige\">{{cite book|author=Edgar L.

These underground economies are omnipresent, existing in market oriented as well as in centrally planned nations, be they developed or developing. Those engaged in underground activities circumvent, escape or are excluded from the institutional system of rules, rights, regulations and enforcement penalties that govern formal agents engaged in production and exchange. Different types of underground activities are distinguished according to the particular institutional rules that they violate. Four major underground economies can be identified:<ref name=Feige /><ref name=\"Feige 2016\">{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Meaning and Measurement of Unobserved Economies: What do we really know about the \"Shadow Economy\"?|last = Feige|first = Edgar L.|date = 2016|journal = Journal of Tax Administration |doi = |pmid = |access-date = | issue = 30/1}}</ref>\n\n# the illegal economy\n# the unreported economy\n# the unrecorded economy\n# the informal economy\n\nThe \"illegal economy\" consists of the income produced by those economic activities pursued in violation of legal statutes defining the scope of legitimate forms of commerce.

A summary measure of the unreported economy is the amount of income that should be reported to the tax authority but is not so reported. A complementary measure of the unreported economy is the \"[[tax gap]]\", namely the difference between the amount of tax revenues due the fiscal authority and the amount of tax revenue actually collected. In the U.S. unreported income is estimated to be $2 trillion resulting in a \"tax gap\" of $450\u2013$600 billion.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S.|author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/19564.html |title=New estimates of overseas U.S. currency holdings, the Underground economy and the \"Tax Gap\" |author=Feige, Edgar L. |date=September 2009 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nThe \"unrecorded economy\" consists of those economic activities that circumvent the institutional rules that define the reporting requirements of government statistical agencies.<ref name=\"Feige 2016\"/> A summary measure of the unrecorded economy is the amount of unrecorded income, namely the amount of income that should (under existing rules and conventions) be recorded in national accounting systems (e.g. [[National Income and Product Accounts]]) but is not.

The [[Fence (criminal)|supplier]] does not have to pay for production costs and/or taxes. This is usually the case in the underground economy. Criminals steal goods and sell them below the legal market price, but there is no receipt, guarantee, and so forth. When someone is hired to perform work and the client is unable to write off the expense (particularly common for work such as [[home renovation]]s or [[Cosmetology|cosmetological]] services), the client may be inclined to request a lower price (usually paid in cash) in exchange for foregoing a receipt, which enables the service provider to avoid reporting the income on his or her tax return.\n* They may be more expensive than legal market prices. For example, the product is difficult to acquire or produce, dangerous to handle, is strictly rationed, or not easily available legally if at all. If exchange of goods are made illegal by some sort of [[state (polity)|state]] sanction, such as is often seen with certain pharmaceutical drugs, their prices will tend to rise as a result of that sanction.\n\n==Consumer issues==\n\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|No government, no global nonprofit, no multinational enterprise can seriously claim to be able to replace the 1.8 billion jobs created by the economic underground.

In countries such as [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]], where prostitution is legal but regulated, illegal prostitutes exist whose services are offered cheaper without regard for the legal requirements or procedures\u2014health checks, standards of accommodation, and so on.\n\nIn other countries, such as [[Nicaragua]], where legal prostitution is regulated, hotels may require both parties to identify themselves, to prevent the rise of [[child prostitution]].\n\n===Personal information===\n[[Personally identifying information]], financial information like credit card and bank account information, and [[Medical data breach|medical data]] is bought and sold, mostly in [[darknet market]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holt |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Smirnova |first2=Olga |last3=Chua |first3=Yi-Ting |title=Data thieves in action : examining the international market for stolen personal information |date=2016 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-137-58904-0}}</ref> People increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data, and sell it again for a profit, increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rossi |first1=Ben |title=The ripple effect of identity theft: What happens to my data once it's stolen?|url=https://www.information-age.com/ripple-effect-identity-theft-what-happens-my-data-once-its-stolen-123459795/ |work=Information Age |date=8 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Illegal drugs===\n[[File:Yellow Cannabis strain.jpg|thumb|left|In the U.S., [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] has been termed as a [[cash crop]].]]\n{{Main|Illegal drug trade}}\nFrom the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries began to ban the keeping or using of some [[recreational drug]]s, such as the United States' [[war on drugs]]. Many people nonetheless continue to use illegal drugs, and a black market exists to supply them. Despite law enforcement efforts to intercept them, demand remains high, providing a large [[profit motive]] for [[organized crime|organized criminal groups]] to keep drugs supplied. The United Nations has reported that the retail market value of illegal drugs is $321.6 billion USD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |title=World Drug Report 2005 |work=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720100713/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/world_drug_report_2005.html |archivedate=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nAlthough law enforcement agencies intercept a fraction of the illegal drugs, and incarcerate hundreds of thousands of wholesale and retail sellers, the very stable demand for such drugs and the high profit margins encourages new distributors to enter the market without a decrease in the retail price.

These restrictions can range from small [[combat knife|knives]] to [[firearms]], either altogether or by classification (e.g. [[caliber]], [[handgun]]s, [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[explosives]]). The black market supplies the demands for weaponry that can not be obtained legally, or may only be obtained legally after obtaining permits and paying fees. This may be by [[smuggling]] the arms from countries where they were bought legally or stolen, or by stealing from arms manufacturers within the country itself, using [[insider]]s. In cases where the underground economy is unable to smuggle firearms, they can also satisfy requests by [[gunsmith]]ing their own firearms. Those who may buy this way include [[criminals]] to use for illegal activities, gun collectors, and otherwise law-abiding citizens interested in protecting their dwellings, families or businesses.\n\nIn England and Wales, certain categories of weapons used for hunting may be owned by qualified residents but must be registered with the local police force and kept within a locked cabinet. Another segment of the population who may purchase weapons on the black market are individuals who are unable to pass the legal requirements for registration\u2014convicted felons or those suffering from mental illness for example. In a few jurisdictions, collectors may legally keep antique weapons made incapable of being readily restored to a firing condition.\n\n===Illegally logged timber===\n{{Main|Illegal logging}}\nThe illegal logging of [[timber]] has posed as an issue.

Smuggling is usually done to circumvent [[tax]]ation or [[prohibition]] laws within a particular jurisdiction. The term ''rum-running'' is more commonly applied to smuggling over water; ''bootlegging'' is applied to smuggling over land.

But [[rum]]'s cheapness made it a low-profit item for the rum-runners, and they soon moved on to smuggling [[Canadian whisky]], French [[champagne]], and English [[gin]] to major cities like [[New York City]] and [[Boston]], where prices ran high.

Conducting a racket is racketeering.<ref>{{cite dictionary| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racketeering|title= Racketeering|dictionary=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-06-29}}</ref> Particularly, the potential problem may be caused by the same party that offers to solve it, although that fact may be concealed, with the specific intent to engender continual patronage for this party. An archetype is the [[protection racket]], wherein a person or group (e.g., a criminal gang) indicates to a store owner that they could protect her/his store from potential damage, damage that the same person or group would otherwise inflict, while the correlation of threat and protection may be more or less deniably veiled, distinguishing it from the more direct act of [[extortion]].\nRacketeering is often associated with [[organized crime]], and the term was coined by the [[Employers' Association of Greater Chicago|Employers' Association of Chicago]] in June 1927 in a statement about the influence of organized crime in the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] union.<ref>David Witwer, \"'The Most Racketeer-Ridden Union in America': The Problem of Corruption in the Teamsters Union During the 1930s\", in {{cite book |first2=William Chester, Ed. |last2=Jordan |title=Corrupt histories |location=Rochester, New York |first1=Emmanuel, Ed. |last1=Kreike |publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58046-173-3}}</ref>\n\n===Transportation providers===\n{{main|illegal taxicab operation}}\nWhere taxicabs, buses, and other transportation providers are strictly regulated or monopolized by government, a black market typically flourishes to provide transportation to poorly served or overpriced communities. In the United States, some cities restrict entry to the taxicab market with a medallion system, i.e., taxicabs must get a special license and display it on a medallion in the vehicle. In most such jurisdictions it is legal to sell the medallions, but the limited supply and resulting high prices of medallions have led to a market in unlicensed [[carpooling]]/[[illegal taxicab operation]]. In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], for example, it is not uncommon for private individuals to provide illegal taxicab service<ref name=\"Baltimore\"/> for city residents.\n\n===Housing rental===\nIn places where there is [[rent control]] there may be a black market for housing. For instance, in the UK there is illegal [[Lease#Sublease|subletting]] of [[social housing]] homes where the tenant illegally rents out the home at a higher rent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9474000/9474045.stm Tracking down England's council house sublet cheats], ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'', BBC, May 4, 2011</ref> In Sweden, rental contracts with regulated rent can be bought on the black market,<ref>[http://www.thelocal.se/20100830/28666 'Egalitarian' Stockholm rents feed black market], ''[[The Local]]'', August 30, 2010</ref> either from the current tenant or sometimes directly from the property owner.

A determined counterfeiter with a few hundred dollars can make copies that are digitally identical to an original and face no loss in quality; innovations in consumer [[DVD]] and [[CD]] writers and the widespread availability of [[software cracking|cracks]] on the [[Internet]] for most forms of [[copy protection]] technology make this cheap and easy to do.\n\nCopyright-holders and other proponents of copyright laws have found this phenomenon hard to stop through the courts, as the operations are distributed and widespread,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} transversing national borders and thus legal systems. Since digital information can be duplicated repeatedly with no loss of quality, and passed on electronically at little to no cost, the effective underground market value of media is zero, differentiating it from nearly all other forms of underground economic activity. The issue is compounded by widespread indifference to enforcing copyright law, both with governments and the public at large. To steal a car is seen as a crime in most people's eyes, but to obtain unauthorized copies of music or a game is not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.applelinks.com/mooresviews/pirate.shtml |title=Is music piracy stealing? |author=Charles W.

It also authorises copyright-holders to use [[DVD region codes|region-coding]] to discriminate against selected populations price-wise and availability-wise.\n\nThe comparison to car-theft, although common, is not truly analogous. Automobile theft results in an item being removed from the owner with the ownership transferred to a second party. Media piracy is a crime of duplication, with no physical property being stolen. Copyright infringement law goes as far as to deem illegal \"[[mixtape]]s\" and other such material copied to tape or disk. Copyright holders typically attest the act of theft to be in the profits forgone to the pirates. However, this makes the unsubstantiated assumption that the pirates would have bought the copyrighted material if it had not been available through [[file sharing]] or other means. Copyright holders also say that they did some work for creating their copyrighted material and they wish to get compensated for their work. No other system than copyright has been found to compensate the artists and other creators for their work{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}, and many artists do not have any alternative source of income or another job.

This may happen for one or more of several reasons:\n* The government sets (\"pegs\") the local currency at some arbitrary level to another currency that does not reflect its true market value.\n* A government makes it difficult or illegal for its citizens to own much or any foreign currency.\n* The government taxes exchanging the local currency with other currencies, either in one direction or both (e.g. foreigners are taxed to buy local currency, or residents are taxed to buy foreign currency).\n* The currency is [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit]].\n* The currency has been acquired illegally and needs to be [[money laundering|laundered]] before the money can be used.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/special/blackpeso.html |title=Drug Wars: Special Reports: The Black Peso Money Laudering System |work=PBS Frontline |author1=Oriana Zill |author2=Lowell Bergman |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nA government may officially set the rate of exchange of its currency with that of other currencies, typically the [[US dollar]]. When it does, the peg often overvalues the local currency relative to what its market value would be if it were a [[floating currency]]. Those in possession of the \"harder\" currency, for example [[expatriate]] workers, may be able to use the black market to buy the local currency at better exchange rates than they can get officially.\n\nIn situations of financial instability and inflation, citizens may substitute a foreign currency for the local currency.

See also the example of the [[Ghanaian cedi]] from the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nIf foreign currency is difficult or illegal for local citizens to acquire, they will pay a premium to acquire it. U.S. currency is viewed as a relatively stable store of value and since it does not leave a paper trail,{{Dubious|reason=serial numbers|date=March 2012}} it is also a convenient medium of exchange for both illegal transactions and for [[tax evasion|unreported income]] both in the U.S and abroad.<ref name=\"Cebula and Feige\">{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/29672.html |title=America's Underground Economy: Measuring the Size, Growth and Determinants of Income Tax Evasion in the U.S. |author1=Feige, Edgar L. |author2=Cebula, Richard |lastauthoramp=yes |date=January 2011|accessdate=2012-03-05}}</ref>\n\nMore recently [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]] such as [[bitcoin]] have been used as medium of exchange in black market transactions.

This is known as [[fuel dyes|dyed fuel]], because a coloured dye is added so it can be detected if used in other vehicles (e.g. a red dye in the UK, a green dye in Ireland). Nevertheless, the saving is attractive enough to make a black market in agricultural diesel. In 2007 it was estimated that \u00a3350 million was not gained in profit as a result of this phenomenon, in the UK.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[What Car?]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Group]] |title=Red diesel abuse costs UK millions |date=November 7, 2007 |url=http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/red-diesel-abuse-costs-uk-millions/229086 |accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nIn countries like India and Nepal, the price of fuel is set by the government, and it is illegal to sell the fuel over the set price. Due to the petrol crisis in Nepal, black marketing in fuel has been a common trend, especially during mass petrol shortage. At times, people need to queue for hours or even sometimes overnight to get the fuel. On the other hand, the petrol pump operators are alleged to hoarding the fuel, and selling it to black marketers. Black marketing in vehicle/cooking fuel became widespread during the [[2015 Nepal blockade|2015 economic blockade]] imposed on Nepal. Even after the economic blockade was eased, and petrol imports resumed, people are not getting the fuel as they were supposed to and are resort to buying from the black market.\n\n===Sex toys===\nThere are some countries where sex toys are illegal, such as Saudi Arabia, Thailand and India. The illegality has omitted certain clearing processes such as safety testing when they are sold by undercover independent vendors on the black market.

States that are engaged in [[total war]] or other large-scale, extended [[war]]s often impose restrictions on home use of critical resources that are needed for the war effort, such as [[food]], [[gasoline]], [[rubber]], [[metal]], etc., typically through [[rationing]]. In most cases, a black market develops to supply rationed goods at exorbitant prices. The [[rationing]] and [[price controls]] enforced in many countries during [[World War II]] encouraged widespread black market activity.<ref name=\"TheHomeFront\">{{cite book |title=The Home Front|date=July 1945|isbn=978-1-904897-11-8|publisher=Imperial War Museum|location=London|edition=facsimile}}</ref> One source of black-market meat under wartime rationing was by farmers declaring fewer domestic animal births to the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] than actually happened.

Although these activities were illegal, only flagrant or large-scale black-marketeers were prosecuted by the military.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Laws and regulations===\nA classic example of new regulation creating a black market is the [[prohibition]] of alcohol.
