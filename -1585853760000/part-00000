The Earls of Kildare and their Ancestors: from 1057 to 1773, 4th edition, published by Hodges, Smith & Co., Dublin, 1864 (pp. 235-236). He made the same mistake himself, i.e. that Elizabeth was a daughter of Bridget O'Donnell Lady Tyrconnell (nee Fitzgerald) rather than a sister of Bridget, in the second edition of 1858 (page 226), but corrected this in his fourth edition in 1864</ref><ref>Lee, Sidney (Editor).

See also [[Fingal]].\n\n==The Earls' Fingall Estate Papers==\nThe Earls of Fingall\u2019s ''Fingall Estate Papers'' (i.e. real property) consist of a large archive of manuscripts and ephemera (17th\u201320th century), documents incl. deeds, indentures, leases, wills, marriage settlements, incl. many on vellum.  The Papers were purchased by the Fingal County Council and lodged in its Fingal Local Studies and Archives Department following an auction by Whyte\u2019s Auctioneers on 6 February 1999 (item 373).  However, the lands concerned did not actually extend into the modern Fingal, and  the Earls\u2019 ''Fingall Estate Papers'' contain no evidence of any ownership in Fingal. Practically all the properties and leases relate to County Meath (or Westmeath), understandably since the Plunketts were originally, as indicated above, Barons of Killeen in County Meath.  They essentially have nothing to do with the territory of Fingal, and hence the lands ''per se'' never justified the denomination of ''Fingall'' as an Earldom and later peerage Barony (both now extinct) for the Plunketts of Killeen in Meath (as the [[prescriptive barony]] of Fingal rested with the [[Viscounts Gormanston]] by descent from [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter de Lacy]] who obtained it in 1208).

The Earls of Kildare and their Ancestors: from 1057 to 1773, 4th edition, published by Hodges, Smith & Co., Dublin, 1864 (pp. 235-236).

See also [[Fingal]].\n\n==The Earls' Fingall Estate Papers==\nThe Earls of Fingall\u2019s ''Fingall Estate Papers'' (i.e. real property) consist of a large archive of manuscripts and ephemera (17th\u201320th century), documents incl. deeds, indentures, leases, wills, marriage settlements, incl. many on vellum.  The Papers were purchased by the Fingal County Council and lodged in its Fingal Local Studies and Archives Department following an auction by Whyte\u2019s Auctioneers on 6 February 1999 (item 373).  However, the lands concerned did not actually extend into the modern Fingal, and  the Earls\u2019 ''Fingall Estate Papers'' contain no evidence of any ownership in Fingal. Practically all the properties and leases relate to County Meath (or Westmeath), understandably since the Plunketts were originally, as indicated above, Barons of Killeen in County Meath.  They essentially have nothing to do with the territory of Fingal, and hence the lands ''per se'' never justified the denomination of ''Fingall'' as an Earldom and later peerage Barony (both now extinct) for the Plunketts of Killeen in Meath (as the [[prescriptive barony]] of Fingal rested with the [[Viscounts Gormanston]] by descent from [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter de Lacy]] who obtained it in 1208). Rather, the evidence indicates that Lord Killeen negotiated and purchased<ref>''The Early Stuarts and the Irish Peerage'', by Charles R.

The terminology has also been used to refer to films that do not necessarily reflect Mormon themes but have been made by Mormon filmmakers.\n\nLDS cinema films might be considered distinct from LDS Church movies like ''[[Legacy (movie)|Legacy]]'' and ''[[The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd|Testaments]]'', since they are commercial and not produced for teaching or proselytizing LDS doctrine. LDS cinema is usually produced and directed by Latter-day Saints. The films typically have LDS themes and are often marketed especially toward Latter-day Saints, though there has been an effort to \"cross over\" into more mainstream themes.\n\n==History==\nFilms about Latter-day Saints are nothing new. The LDS Church sponsored the production and release of the feature-length films ''[[One Hundred Years of Mormonism]]'' (1913) and ''[[The Life of Nephi]]'' (1914). Films about Mormons, especially lurid pulp fiction-inspired tales of hypnotic missionaries and Western pioneer stories,  were a staple of the early silent, black and white film era. With films made primarily by LDS filmmakers for an LDS audience, the \"LDS Cinema\" movement is distinct from the broader use of Mormon characters in mainstream Hollywood films. The \"LDS Cinema\" movement began around 1999, when [[Richard Dutcher]]'s company, Zion Films, released ''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' commercially. The film, which was produced on a budget of $300,000, grossed about $2.5 million at the box office and many more millions of dollars worth of video purchases. Observing the market success of ''God's Army'', many other LDS studios began producing films.\n\nAlthough ''God's Army'' dealt with the overtly religious subject of [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]], and many LDS comedies are sometimes incomprehensible to people outside the LDS Church, a growing trend moves toward making LDS-themed movies more broadly accessible. The acclaimed [[World War II]] movie ''[[Saints and Soldiers]]'' is perhaps the most successful crossover LDS film to date. More accessible films have been thought by some as likely to ensure larger potential markets. However, \"accessibility\" has not necessarily translated into greater box office earnings or critical acclaim than achieved by the more \"insider\"-oriented LDS Cinema films.\n\nLDS comedies in particular have been panned by critics, who have branded most efforts thus far inaccessible and unfunny to those outside the intended market. Such movies have frequently been perceived as overly reliant upon the audience's extensive knowledge of LDS practices and LDS cultural norms.\n\n==MPAA ratings==\nOne aspect of the culture of LDS cinema is heightened concern over [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film ratings]]. Many Mormons feel disinclined to view movies rated R, so LDS film producers risk greatly diminished revenue for exceeding a PG or PG-13 rating. One PG-13 film, ''The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1'', gained its rating for depicting a decapitation that occurs in the [[Book of Mormon]]. Producers defended the scene as essential. Some critics{{Who|date=February 2010}} leveled a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Tougher standards for independent studios|common complaint about the MPAA]] &ndash; that it awards a higher rating to movies ''not'' produced by the [[major film studio]]s. Nonetheless, producers re-edited the movie to earn a PG rating for [[DVD]] distribution. Another film, ''Saints and Soldiers'' received an R-rating prior to [[film festival]] screening. Producers edited the movie to receive PG-13 for commercial distribution.\n\n==Selected notable companies==\n*[[Excel Entertainment Group]]\n*[[Halestorm Entertainment]]\n\n==Selected filmography==\n\n===Drama===\n*''[[Brigham Young (film)|Brigham Young]]'' (1940) &ndash; Follows the story of [[Brigham Young]] after [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]'s death. \n*''[[Bad Bascomb (film)|Bad Bascomb]]'' (1946) &ndash; Two outlaws hide out in a Mormon wagon and one of them befriends a little girl.\n*''[[Wagon Master]]'' (1950) &ndash; Forced out of Crystal City, a group of Mormons head west in search of the promised land.\n*''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969) &ndash; Two unlikely prospectors share the same wife in a Californian mining town. \n*''[[Messenger of Death]]'' (1988) &ndash; A film about an attempt by a water company to start a family feud among [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]] to take the family's land for the company.\n*''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' (1999) &ndash; The first general release, modern Mormon cinema film, about LDS missionaries; directed by [[Richard Dutcher]].\n*''Handcart'' &ndash; tale of the Martin handcart company<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337632/</ref>\n**''[[God's Army 2|God's Army 2: States of Grace]]'' (2005) &ndash; A sequel to ''God's Army'', by Richard Dutcher\n*''[[Brigham City (movie)|Brigham City]]'' (2001) &ndash; A murder mystery, also by Dutcher.\n*''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' (2001) &ndash; Not by an LDS studio.

The terminology has also been used to refer to films that do not necessarily reflect Mormon themes but have been made by Mormon filmmakers.\n\nLDS cinema films might be considered distinct from LDS Church movies like ''[[Legacy (movie)|Legacy]]'' and ''[[The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd|Testaments]]'', since they are commercial and not produced for teaching or proselytizing LDS doctrine. LDS cinema is usually produced and directed by Latter-day Saints. The films typically have LDS themes and are often marketed especially toward Latter-day Saints, though there has been an effort to \"cross over\" into more mainstream themes.\n\n==History==\nFilms about Latter-day Saints are nothing new. The LDS Church sponsored the production and release of the feature-length films ''[[One Hundred Years of Mormonism]]'' (1913) and ''[[The Life of Nephi]]'' (1914). Films about Mormons, especially lurid pulp fiction-inspired tales of hypnotic missionaries and Western pioneer stories,  were a staple of the early silent, black and white film era. With films made primarily by LDS filmmakers for an LDS audience, the \"LDS Cinema\" movement is distinct from the broader use of Mormon characters in mainstream Hollywood films. The \"LDS Cinema\" movement began around 1999, when [[Richard Dutcher]]'s company, Zion Films, released ''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' commercially. The film, which was produced on a budget of $300,000, grossed about $2.5 million at the box office and many more millions of dollars worth of video purchases. Observing the market success of ''God's Army'', many other LDS studios began producing films.\n\nAlthough ''God's Army'' dealt with the overtly religious subject of [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]], and many LDS comedies are sometimes incomprehensible to people outside the LDS Church, a growing trend moves toward making LDS-themed movies more broadly accessible. The acclaimed [[World War II]] movie ''[[Saints and Soldiers]]'' is perhaps the most successful crossover LDS film to date. More accessible films have been thought by some as likely to ensure larger potential markets. However, \"accessibility\" has not necessarily translated into greater box office earnings or critical acclaim than achieved by the more \"insider\"-oriented LDS Cinema films.\n\nLDS comedies in particular have been panned by critics, who have branded most efforts thus far inaccessible and unfunny to those outside the intended market. Such movies have frequently been perceived as overly reliant upon the audience's extensive knowledge of LDS practices and LDS cultural norms.\n\n==MPAA ratings==\nOne aspect of the culture of LDS cinema is heightened concern over [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|MPAA film ratings]]. Many Mormons feel disinclined to view movies rated R, so LDS film producers risk greatly diminished revenue for exceeding a PG or PG-13 rating. One PG-13 film, ''The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1'', gained its rating for depicting a decapitation that occurs in the [[Book of Mormon]]. Producers defended the scene as essential. Some critics{{Who|date=February 2010}} leveled a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Tougher standards for independent studios|common complaint about the MPAA]] &ndash; that it awards a higher rating to movies ''not'' produced by the [[major film studio]]s. Nonetheless, producers re-edited the movie to earn a PG rating for [[DVD]] distribution. Another film, ''Saints and Soldiers'' received an R-rating prior to [[film festival]] screening. Producers edited the movie to receive PG-13 for commercial distribution.\n\n==Selected notable companies==\n*[[Excel Entertainment Group]]\n*[[Halestorm Entertainment]]\n\n==Selected filmography==\n\n===Drama===\n*''[[Brigham Young (film)|Brigham Young]]'' (1940) &ndash; Follows the story of [[Brigham Young]] after [[Joseph Smith Jr.|Joseph Smith]]'s death. \n*''[[Bad Bascomb (film)|Bad Bascomb]]'' (1946) &ndash; Two outlaws hide out in a Mormon wagon and one of them befriends a little girl.\n*''[[Wagon Master]]'' (1950) &ndash; Forced out of Crystal City, a group of Mormons head west in search of the promised land.\n*''[[Paint Your Wagon (film)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1969) &ndash; Two unlikely prospectors share the same wife in a Californian mining town. \n*''[[Messenger of Death]]'' (1988) &ndash; A film about an attempt by a water company to start a family feud among [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormons]] to take the family's land for the company.\n*''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' (1999) &ndash; The first general release, modern Mormon cinema film, about LDS missionaries; directed by [[Richard Dutcher]].\n*''Handcart'' &ndash; tale of the Martin handcart company<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337632/</ref>\n**''[[God's Army 2|God's Army 2: States of Grace]]'' (2005) &ndash; A sequel to ''God's Army'', by Richard Dutcher\n*''[[Brigham City (movie)|Brigham City]]'' (2001) &ndash; A murder mystery, also by Dutcher.\n*''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' (2001) &ndash; Not by an LDS studio.
