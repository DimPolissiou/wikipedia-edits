It is a group composition and appears as the second track on their 1983 album ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Genesis]]''. It was the album's second single after \"[[Mama (Genesis song)|Mama]]\". In the summer of 1992, [[MCA Records]] re-issued the single and re-released it as a [[compact disc|CD]] and [[cassette single]].\n\nThe U.S. single reached No. 6 in early 1984, making it their first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Top 10 hit; it included \"Second Home by the Sea\" as the [[B-side]]. The UK single featured \"[[Taking It All Too Hard]]\" as the flipside, and reached No. 16. Also released was a 12' single that included a live version of \"[[Firth of Fifth]]\" from 1981.\n\nAs the band's first break into the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 Top 10, the song is included in ''Rock Song Index: The 7500 Most Important Songs for the Rock and Roll Era''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollock |first=Bruce |title=Rock Song Index: The 7500 Most Important Songs for the Rock and Roll Era|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415970730}}</ref>\n\n==Background and recording==\nThe song was intended as an attempt to write a simple pop song with a melody in the style of [[The Beatles]]. Phil Collins acknowledged in a subsequent interview that the song also features one of his attempts at a \"[[Ringo Starr]] drum part\".<ref name=\"philcollins.co.uk\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080801174547/http://www.philcollins.co.uk/hitmen86b.htm HITMEN, 1986 Part Two], ''Hitmen'', 1986. reprinted at Collins's website in 2009; archived copy at archive.org.</ref>\n\nThe song begins with [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] playing the main riff of the song on a [[Electric grand piano|Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano]]. The other keyboards used on this song are a [[Sequential Circuits]] Prophet-10 for organ pads and a [[Synclavier]] II for the organ solo in the middle section. The [[coda (music)|coda]] lapses into a somewhat discordant [[guitar solo]] played by Mike Rutherford, as the drum beat intensifies, before the song fades away.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video|video]] depicts the band as homeless men taking shelter outside a disused factory. They perform the song, eat soup, play cards, and keep warm around an open fire. It was the first time Genesis used director [[Jim Yukich]], who would in turn direct the majority of their next videos, as well as many of Collins's solo videos, for one of their videos.\n\n==Live performances==\nThe song was played live during the ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Mama]]'',<ref>[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=14&addcommentsall=  Mama Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> ''[[Invisible Touch]]'',<ref>[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=15&addcommentsall=  Invisible Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> ''[[We Can't Dance|The Way We Walk]]'',<ref>[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=16&addcommentsall=  The Way We Walk Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> and ''[[Calling All Stations]]'' (with [[Ray Wilson (musician)|Ray Wilson]] on vocals)<ref>[http://www.genesis-movement.org/php/listtour.php?tourid=17&addcommentsall=  Calling All Stations Tour Songs & Dates]</ref> Tours.

It is considered to be the first of the 1970s [[slasher film]]s, and originated a great many of the clich\u00e9s seen in countless later low-budget slashers. Its plot concerns a family of cannibals living in rural [[Texas]], who abduct customers from their gas station. The film's most notable character, [[Leatherface]], is one of the most well-known villains in cinema history, notable for his masks made of human skin, his blood-soaked butcher's apron and the chainsaw he wields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hooper|first=Tobe|author2=Henkel, Kim |title=Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Leatherface.|publisher=Script City}}</ref> Although the film is marketed as a true story, it does not depict actual events, and is instead (as with the film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') inspired by notorious killer [[Ed Gein]], who acted alone and did not use a chainsaw.<ref name=\"SlasherFilm\">{{cite book|last=Rockoff|first=Adam|title=Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978-1986|publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]]}}</ref> ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' (1986) is set 13 years after the events of the first film. Although it managed to recoup its relatively small budget, the film was not considered a financial success. Since its initial release, however, it has developed a cult following of its own. Unlike its predecessor, which combined minimal gore with a documentary-style nature, the sequel is a comedic horror film, filled with black humor and various gore effects created by make-up maestro [[Tom Savini]]. The film features an appearance by novelist [[Kinky Friedman]] as well as film critic [[Joe Bob Briggs]]. Briggs' cameo appearance was originally cut in editing, but was restored for the director's cut version of the film when it was released on [[DVD]].\n\n''[[Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III]]'' is a 1990 follow-up to the previous two films. It stars [[Kate Hodge]], [[Ken Foree]], and [[Viggo Mortensen]] and was directed by [[Jeff Burr]]. At the time, this was considered to be the first of several sequels in the series to be produced by New Line Cinema. However, it was not a commercial success, and New Line had no further involvement in the series. ''[[Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation]]'' (1995) is the fourth and final film in the original series. Though it was shelved by [[Columbia Pictures]] after initial screenings, the film was released in 1997 after stars [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] and [[Matthew McConaughey]] gained notoriety.\n\nThe 2003 remake, ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', directed by [[Marcus Nispel]], written by [[Scott Kosar]] and produced by [[Michael Bay]], is based on the events of the first film, however, for the most part, it follows a different storyline. A major difference between the two films, for example, is that rather than picking up Leatherface's psychotic hitchhiker brother, the group instead come upon a traumatized survivor who shoots herself in their van. The film gives [[Leatherface]]'s background, a real name (Thomas Brown Hewitt), as well as a possible reason for his wearing masks, namely a skin disease which has caused his nose to rot away. The remake received a mixed critical response upon release, but was financially successful enough to lead to a prequel. ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]'', which takes place in 1969, is the 2006 prequel directed by [[Jonathan Liebesman]], written by [[Sheldon Turner]] and produced by Michael Bay. It explores the roots of Leatherface's family and delves into their past. Leatherface's first mask is featured, as well as the first murder he commits using a chainsaw. It grossed less than its predecessor and has received largely negative reception from film critics.\n\nThe seventh film, ''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' (2013), is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, and makes no reference to the events of the other sequels. The film was directed by [[John Luessenhop]], and written by [[Adam Marcus (director)|Adam Marcus]], Kirsten Elms, and Debra Sullivan. ''Texas Chainsaw'' follows a young girl named Heather, who is travelling to Texas with her friends to collect an inheritance from her deceased grandmother, whom she had never met. There, Heather discovers that she is part of the Sawyer family, who were killed by the townspeople following the events of the 1974 film, as well as a cousin of Leatherface. According to Seth M. Sherwood, writer of the prequel ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' (2017), the eighth film is part of a continuity that consists of ''Leatherface'', ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' (1974), and ''Texas Chainsaw 3D''.<ref name=\"SherwoodWriterInt\">{{cite news|last1=McGrew|first1=Shannon|title=Interview: Writer Seth Sherwood Talks Origins of Leatherface|url=http://ihorror.com/leatherface-seth-sherwood/|accessdate=May 29, 2017|publisher=[[iHorror]]|date=May 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nWhen comparing ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' to the other top-grossing horror film series \u2013 ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Child's Play (franchise)|Child's Play]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'', the ''[[Hannibal Lecter (franchise)|Hannibal Lecter]]'' series, ''[[Psycho (franchise)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'', and ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' \u2013 and adjusting for the 2011 inflation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halfhill.com/inflation1.html|title=Tom's Inflation Calculator|publisher=Half Hill|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' is the eighth highest grossing horror film series in the United States, with a combined gross of $304.6 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=texaschainsawmassacre.htm|title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> only outperforming the ''Child's Play'' film series with approximately $203&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=childsplay.htm|title=Child's Play box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> The series is led by ''Friday the 13th'' at $687.1&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=fridaythe13th.htm|title=Friday the 13th box office ranking|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' with $592.8&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=nightmareonelmstreet.htm|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> the Hannibal Lecter film series with $588.7&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=hannibal.htm|title=The Hannibal Lector series box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> ''Halloween'' with $557.5&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=halloween.htm|title=Halloween box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> ''Saw'' with $457.4&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=saw.htm|title=Saw box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref> ''Scream'' with $442.9&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=scream.htm|title=Scream box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> and the ''Psycho'' film series, with $376.3&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=psycho.htm|title=Psycho box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Film\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Release date (US)\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Budget\n!colspan=\"3\"|Box office\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Reference\n|- \n!

Saw Massacre|original film]]. The franchise focuses on serial killer [[Leatherface]] and his psychotic family, who terrorize unsuspecting visitors to their territories in the desolate Texas countryside, typically killing and cannibalizing them. The original film was released in 1974, directed by [[Tobe Hooper]] and written by Hooper and [[Kim Henkel]]. Hooper and Henkel were involved in only three of the later films.\n\nThe film series has grossed over $252 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s) \n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s) \n! scope=\"col\" | Producer(s)\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |Original series\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''\n| October 11, 1974\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Tobe Hooper]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kim Henkel]] and [[Tobe Hooper]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Kim Henkel]] and [[Tobe Hooper]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]''\n| August 22, 1986\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[L.M.

It is considered to be the first of the 1970s [[slasher film]]s, and originated a great many of the clich\u00e9s seen in countless later low-budget slashers. Its plot concerns a family of cannibals living in rural [[Texas]], who abduct customers from their gas station. The film's most notable character, [[Leatherface]], is one of the most well-known villains in cinema history, notable for his masks made of human skin, his blood-soaked butcher's apron and the chainsaw he wields.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hooper|first=Tobe|author2=Henkel, Kim |title=Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Leatherface.|publisher=Script City}}</ref> Although the film is marketed as a true story, it does not depict actual events, and is instead (as with the film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') inspired by notorious killer [[Ed Gein]], who acted alone and did not use a chainsaw.<ref name=\"SlasherFilm\">{{cite book|last=Rockoff|first=Adam|title=Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978-1986|publisher=[[McFarland & Company|McFarland]]}}</ref> ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'' (1986) is set 13 years after the events of the first film. Although it managed to recoup its relatively small budget, the film was not considered a financial success. Since its initial release, however, it has developed a cult following of its own. Unlike its predecessor, which combined minimal gore with a documentary-style nature, the sequel is a comedic horror film, filled with black humor and various gore effects created by make-up maestro [[Tom Savini]]. The film features an appearance by novelist [[Kinky Friedman]] as well as film critic [[Joe Bob Briggs]]. Briggs' cameo appearance was originally cut in editing, but was restored for the director's cut version of the film when it was released on [[DVD]].\n\n''[[Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III]]'' is a 1990 follow-up to the previous two films. It stars [[Kate Hodge]], [[Ken Foree]], and [[Viggo Mortensen]] and was directed by [[Jeff Burr]]. At the time, this was considered to be the first of several sequels in the series to be produced by New Line Cinema. However, it was not a commercial success, and New Line had no further involvement in the series. ''[[Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation]]'' (1995) is the fourth and final film in the original series. Though it was shelved by [[Columbia Pictures]] after initial screenings, the film was released in 1997 after stars [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] and [[Matthew McConaughey]] gained notoriety.\n\nThe 2003 remake, ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', directed by [[Marcus Nispel]], written by [[Scott Kosar]] and produced by [[Michael Bay]], is based on the events of the first film, however, for the most part, it follows a different storyline. A major difference between the two films, for example, is that rather than picking up Leatherface's psychotic hitchhiker brother, the group instead come upon a traumatized survivor who shoots herself in their van. The film gives [[Leatherface]]'s background, a real name (Thomas Brown Hewitt), as well as a possible reason for his wearing masks, namely a skin disease which has caused his nose to rot away. The remake received a mixed critical response upon release, but was financially successful enough to lead to a prequel. ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning]]'', which takes place in 1969, is the 2006 prequel directed by [[Jonathan Liebesman]], written by [[Sheldon Turner]] and produced by Michael Bay. It explores the roots of Leatherface's family and delves into their past. Leatherface's first mask is featured, as well as the first murder he commits using a chainsaw. It grossed less than its predecessor and has received largely negative reception from film critics.\n\nThe seventh film, ''[[Texas Chainsaw 3D]]'' (2013), is a direct sequel to the original 1974 film, and makes no reference to the events of the other sequels. The film was directed by [[John Luessenhop]], and written by [[Adam Marcus (director)|Adam Marcus]], Kirsten Elms, and Debra Sullivan. ''Texas Chainsaw'' follows a young girl named Heather, who is travelling to Texas with her friends to collect an inheritance from her deceased grandmother, whom she had never met. There, Heather discovers that she is part of the Sawyer family, who were killed by the townspeople following the events of the 1974 film, as well as a cousin of Leatherface. According to Seth M. Sherwood, writer of the prequel ''[[Leatherface (2017 film)|Leatherface]]'' (2017), the eighth film is part of a continuity that consists of ''Leatherface'', ''The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'' (1974), and ''Texas Chainsaw 3D''.<ref name=\"SherwoodWriterInt\">{{cite news|last1=McGrew|first1=Shannon|title=Interview: Writer Seth Sherwood Talks Origins of Leatherface|url=http://ihorror.com/leatherface-seth-sherwood/|accessdate=May 29, 2017|publisher=[[iHorror]]|date=May 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nWhen comparing ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' to the other top-grossing horror film series \u2013 ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', ''[[Child's Play (franchise)|Child's Play]]'', ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'', the ''[[Hannibal Lecter (franchise)|Hannibal Lecter]]'' series, ''[[Psycho (franchise)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'', and ''[[Scream (franchise)|Scream]]'' \u2013 and adjusting for the 2011 inflation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halfhill.com/inflation1.html|title=Tom's Inflation Calculator|publisher=Half Hill|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' is the eighth highest grossing horror film series in the United States, with a combined gross of $304.6 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=texaschainsawmassacre.htm|title=The Texas Chainsaw Massacre box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> only outperforming the ''Child's Play'' film series with approximately $203&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=childsplay.htm|title=Child's Play box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> The series is led by ''Friday the 13th'' at $687.1&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=fridaythe13th.htm|title=Friday the 13th box office ranking|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' with $592.8&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=nightmareonelmstreet.htm|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> the Hannibal Lecter film series with $588.7&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=hannibal.htm|title=The Hannibal Lector series box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> ''Halloween'' with $557.5&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=halloween.htm|title=Halloween box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> ''Saw'' with $457.4&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=saw.htm|title=Saw box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-09-05}}</ref> ''Scream'' with $442.9&nbsp;million,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=scream.htm|title=Scream box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> and the ''Psycho'' film series, with $376.3&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/franchises/chart/?id=psycho.htm|title=Psycho box office rankings|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Film\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Release date (US)\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Budget\n!colspan=\"3\"|Box office\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Reference\n|- \n!

In 1810, the whole [[Hawaiian Islands]] became [[unification of Hawaii|unified]] when [[Kauai|Kaua\u02bbi]] and [[Niihau|Ni\u02bbihau]] joined the Hawaiian Kingdom voluntarily. Two major dynastic families ruled the kingdom: the [[House of Kamehameha]] and the [[House of Kal\u0101kaua]].\n\nThe Kingdom won recognition from major European powers. The [[United States]] became its chief trading partner.

Hawaii was forced to adopt [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|a new constitution in 1887]] when King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] was threatened with violence by the [[Honolulu Rifles]], a white, anti-monarchist militia, to sign it.

Eventually, Kaua\u02bbi's chief swore allegiance to Kamehameha. The unification ended the [[ancient Hawaii]]an society, transforming it into an independent constitutional monarchy crafted in the traditions and manner of European monarchs.\n\n=== Kamehameha dynasty ===\n{{Main|House of Kamehameha}}\nFrom 1810 to 1893, the Hawaiian Kingdom was ruled by two major dynastic families: the [[House of Kamehameha]] and the [[House of Kal\u0101kaua|Kal\u0101kaua Dynasty]]. Five members of the Kamehameha family led the government styled as Kamehameha. Lunalilo was a member of the House of Kamehameha through his mother. Liholiho (Kamehameha II) and Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) were direct sons of Kamehameha the Great. During Liholiho's and Kauikeaouli's reigns, the primary wife of Kamehameha the Great, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]], ruled as [[Regent|Queen Regent]] and ''[[Kuhina Nui]]'', or [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]].\n\n== Economic, social, and cultural transformation ==\n{{History of Hawaii}}\nEconomic and demographic factors in the 19th century reshaped the islands. Their consolidation into one unified political entity led to international trade. Under Kamehameha (1795\u20131819), [[sandalwood]] was exported to [[Qing dynasty|China]]. That led to the introduction of money and trade throughout the islands.\n\nFollowing Kamehameha's death the succession was overseen by his principal wife, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Ka'ahumanu]], who was designated as regent over the new king, Liholiho, who was a minor.\n\nQueen Ka'ahumanu eliminated various prohibitions ([[kapu]]) governing women's behavior. They included men and women eating together and women eating bananas. She also overturned the old religion as the Christian missionaries arrived in the islands. A major contribution of the missionaries was to develop a written Hawaiian language. That led to very high levels of literacy in Hawaii, above 90 percent in the latter half of the 19th century. The development of writing aided in the consolidation of government. Written constitutions enumerating the power and duties of the King were developed.\n\nIn 1848, the [[Great M\u0101hele]] was promulgated by King Liholihog. It instituted formal property rights to the land and followed the customary control of the land prior to this declaration. Ninety-eight percent of the land was assigned to the [[Ali\u02bbi|Ali'i]], chiefs or nobles. Two percent went to the commoners. No land could be sold, only transferred to lineal descendant land manager.\nFor the natives, contact with the outer world represented demographic disaster, as a series of unfamiliar diseases such as smallpox decimated the natives. The [[Hawaii|Hawaiian population]] of natives fell from approximately 128,000 in 1778<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tom Dye|author2=Eric Komori|title=Pre-censal Population History of Hawai'i |work=New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 14 |url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/482/1/JL28007.pdf|year=1992|publisher=NA|page=3}}</ref> to 71,000 in 1853 and kept declining to 24,000 in 1920.

The missionaries and their children became a powerful elite into the mid-19th century. They provided the chief advisors and cabinet members of the kings and dominated the professional and merchant class in the cities.<ref>Harold W. Bradley, ''The American frontier in Hawaii: the pioneers, 1789\u20131843'' (Stanford university press, 1942).</ref>\n\nThe elites promoted the [[sugar]] [[Sugarcane|industry]] in order to modernize Hawaii's economy. American capital set up a series of plantations after 1850.<ref>Julia Flynn Siler, ''Lost Kingdom: Hawaii's Last Queen, the Sugar Kings and America's First Imperial Adventure'' (2012).</ref> Few natives were willing to work on the sugar plantations and so recruiters fanned out across Asia and Europe. As a result, between 1850 and 1900 some 200,000 contract laborers from [[Qing dynasty|China]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Portugal]] and elsewhere came to Hawaii under fixed term contracts (typically for five years). Most returned home on schedule, but large numbers stayed permanently. By 1908 about 180,000 Japanese workers had arrived. No more were allowed in, but 54,000 remained permanently.<ref name=\"Beechert1985\">{{cite book|author=Edward D.

The army and navy used both traditional [[Canoe|canoes]] and uniforms including helmets made of natural materials and loincloths (called the Malo) as well as western technology like artillery cannons, muskets, and European ships.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} European advisors were captured, treated well and became Hawaiian citizens.{{Clarify|reason=When were they captured? By who?|date=December 2018}} When Kamehameha died in 1819 he left his son [[Kamehameha II|Liholiho]] a large arsenal with tens of thousands of soldiers and many warships. This helped put down the revolt at [[Kuamoo Burials|Kuamo\u02bbo]] later in 1819 and [[Humehume]]'s rebellion on Kauai in 1824.\n\nDuring the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha dynasty]] the population in Hawaii was ravaged by epidemics following the arrival of outsiders. The military shrank with the population, so by the end of the Dynasty there was no Hawaiian navy and only an army, consisting of several hundred troops. After a French invasion that sacked [[Honolulu]] in 1849, [[Kamehameha III]] sought defense treaties with the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. During the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]] in Europe, Kamehameha III declared Hawaii a neutral state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiankingdom.org/hawn-territory.shtml |title=Hawaiian Territory |publisher=Hawaiian Kingdom |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref> The United States government put strong pressure on [[Kamehameha IV]] to make trade exclusively to the United States even annexed the islands. To counterbalance this situation Kamehameha IV and [[Kamehameha V]] pushed for alliances with other foreign powers, especially [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]. Hawaii claimed uninhabited islands in the Pacific, including the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]], many of which came into conflict with American claims.\n\nFollowing the Kamehameha dynasty the royal guards were disbanded under [[Lunalilo]] after a barracks revolt in September 1873. A small army was restored under King [[Kal\u0101kaua|Kalakaua]] but failed to stop the 1887 Rebellion by the [[Reform Party (Hawaii)|Missionary Party]]. In 1891, [[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani]] came to power. The elections of 1892 were followed with petitions and requests from her administration to change the [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|constitution of 1887]]. <!-- prior sentence is very confusing and needs editing by someone with knowledge --> The US maintained a policy of keeping at least one [[cruiser]] in Hawaii at all times. On January 17, 1893, Lili\u02bbuokalani, believing the US military would intervene if she changed the constitution, waited for the {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} to leave port. Once it was known that Lili\u02bbuokalani was revising the constitution, the ''Boston'' was recalled and assisted the Missionary Party in her overthrow. Following the overthrow and the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] the Kingdom's military was disarmed and disbanded. One hundred years later, in 1993, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Apology Resolution]], admitting wrongdoing and issuing a belated apology.\n\n== French Incident (1839) ==\n{{Main|Laplace affair}}\n\nUnder the rule of [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]], the powerful, newly converted Protestant widow of Kamehameha the Great, Catholicism was illegal in Hawaii, and in 1831 French Catholic priests were forcibly deported by chiefs loyal to her.

You will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting impression.''\n\nUnder the threat of war, King [[Kamehameha III]] signed the [[Edict of Toleration (Hawaii)|Edict of Toleration]] on July 17, 1839 and paid the $20,000 in compensation for the deportation of the priests and the incarceration and torture of converts, agreeing to Laplace's demands.

Admiral Thomas apologized to Kamehameha III for Paulet's actions, and restored Hawaiian sovereignty on July 31, 1843. In his restoration speech, Kamehameha III declared that ''\"[[Ua Mau ke Ea o ka \u02bb\u0100ina i ka Pono]]\"'' (The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness), the motto of the future State of Hawaii. The day was celebrated as [[Sovereignty Restoration Day|L\u0101 Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Ea]] (Sovereignty Restoration Day).\n\n== French invasion (1849) ==\n{{Main|French invasion of Honolulu}}\nIn August 1849, French admiral [[Louis Tromelin]] arrived in [[Honolulu Harbor]] with the ''La Poursuivante'' and ''Gassendi''. De Tromelin made ten demands to King [[Kamehameha III]] on August 22, mainly demanding that full religious rights be given to Catholics, (a decade earlier, during the French Incident the ban on Catholicism had been lifted, but Catholics still enjoyed only partial religious rights). On August 25 the demands had not been met. After a second warning was made to the civilians, French troops overwhelmed the [[skeleton crew|skeleton force]] and captured [[Honolulu Fort]], spiked the [[Coastal artillery|coastal guns]] and destroyed all other weapons they found (mainly muskets and ammunition). They raided government buildings and general property in Honolulu, causing damage that amounted to $100,000. After the raids the invasion force withdrew to the fort. De Tromelin eventually recalled his men and left Hawaii on September 5.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\nAnticipating foreign encroachment on Hawaiian territory, King Kamehameha III dispatched a delegation to the United States and Europe to secure the recognition of Hawaiian independence. [[Ha\u02bbalilio|Timoteo Ha\u02bbalilio]], [[William Richards (Hawaii)|William Richards]] and [[George Simpson (HBC administrator)|Sir George Simpson]] were commissioned as joint Ministers Plenipotentiary on April 8, 1842. Simpson left for Great Britain while Ha\u02bbalilio and Richards to the United States on July 8, 1842. The Hawaiian delegation secured the assurance of US President [[John Tyler]] on December 19, 1842 of Hawaiian independence and then met Simpson in Europe to secure formal recognition by the United Kingdom and France. On March 17, 1843, King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe of France]] recognized Hawaiian independence at the urging of King [[Leopold I of Belgium]]. On April 1, 1843, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], on behalf of [[Queen Victoria]], assured the Hawaiian delegation, \"Her Majesty's Government was willing and had determined to recognize the independence of the [[Sandwich Islands]] under their present sovereign.\"\n\n=== Anglo-Franco Proclamation ===\n[[File:La Kuokoa o Hawaii Nei.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Flier for the 30th anniversary celebration of the 1843 treaty]]\nOn November 28, 1843, at the Court of London, the British and French Governments formally recognized Hawaiian independence.

Upon his deathbed, he summoned High Chiefess [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] to declare his intentions of making her heir to the throne. Bernice refused the crown, and Kamehameha V died without naming an heir.\n\nThe refusal of Bishop to take the crown forced the legislature of the kingdom to [[Election|elect]] a new monarch. From 1872 to 1873, several relatives of the Kamehameha line were nominated. In [[Hawaii monarchal election, 1873|a ceremonial popular vote and a unanimous legislative vote]], [[Lunalilo|William C. Lunalilo]], grandnephew of Kamehameha I, became Hawai\u02bbi's first of two [[Elective monarchy|elected monarchs]] but reigned only from 1873 to 1874 because of his early death due to tuberculosis at the age of 39.\n\n== Kal\u0101kaua dynasty ==\n[[File:Kalakaua Grant state visit 1874.jpg|thumb|King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] meeting U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

Once again, the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom needed an election to fill the royal vacancy. [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]], widow of Kamehameha IV, was nominated along with [[Kal\u0101kaua|David Kal\u0101kaua]]. The [[Honolulu Courthouse riot|1874 election]] was a nasty political campaign in which both candidates resorted to mudslinging and innuendo. David Kal\u0101kaua became the second elected King of Hawaii but without the ceremonial popular vote of Lunalilo. The choice of the legislature was controversial, and U.S. and British troops were called upon to suppress rioting by Queen Emma's supporters, the ''[[Emmaites]]''.\n\nKal\u0101kaua officially proclaimed his sister, Lili\u02bbuokalani would succeed to the throne upon his death.  Hoping to avoid uncertainty in the monarchy's future,  Kalakaua had named a line of succession in his will, so that after Lili\u2019uokalani the throne should succeed to Princess [[Ka\u02bbiulani|Victoria Ka\u02bbiulani]], then to Queen Consort [[Kapi\u02bbolani|Kapi\u2019olani]], followed by her sister, [[Poomaikelani|Princess Po\u2019omaikalani]], then Prince [[David Kaw\u0101nanakoa|David Lamea Kawananakoa]] and last was Prince [[Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana\u02bbole]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18910318.2.57&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|title=Daily Alta California 18 March 1891 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>  Although, the will was not an official line of succession or a proper proclamation according to kingdom law.

Thurston]], Minister of Interior under King Kal\u0101kaua.  The constitution was proclaimed by the king after a meeting of 3,000 residents including an armed militia demanded he sign it or be deposed. The document created a [[constitutional monarchy]] like the one that existed in United Kingdom, stripping the King of most of his personal authority and empowering the legislature and establishing cabinet government. It has since become widely known as the \"Bayonet Constitution\" because of the threat of force used to gain Kal\u0101kaua's cooperation.\n\nThe [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|1887 constitution]] empowered the citizenry to elect members of the House of Nobles (who had previously been appointed by the King). It increased the value of property a citizen must own to be eligible to vote above the previous Constitution of 1864 and denied voting rights to Asians who comprised a large proportion of the population (a few Japanese and some Chinese had previously become [[Naturalization|naturalized]] and now lost voting rights they had previously enjoyed). This guaranteed a voting monopoly to wealthy native Hawaiians and Europeans. The Bayonet Constitution continued allowing the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature.\n\n=== Lili\u02bbuokalani's Constitution ===\n[[File:Liliuokalani, c. 1891.jpg|thumb|[[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Lili'uokalani]]]]\nIn 1891, Kal\u0101kaua died and his sister Lili\u02bbuokalani assumed the throne. She came to power during an economic crisis precipitated in part by the [[McKinley Tariff]]. By rescinding the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, the new tariff eliminated the previous advantage Hawaiian exporters enjoyed in trade to U.S. markets. Many Hawaiian businesses and citizens were feeling the pressures of the loss of revenue, so Lili\u02bbuokalani proposed a [[lottery]] and opium licensing to bring in additional revenue for the government. Her ministers and closest friends tried to dissuade her from pursuing the bills, and these controversial proposals were used against her in the looming constitutional crisis.\n\nLili\u02bbuokalani wanted to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Constitution. The queen launched a campaign resulting in a petition to proclaim a new Constitution.\nMany citizens and residents who in 1887 had forced Kal\u0101kaua to sign the \"Bayonet Constitution\" became alarmed when three of her recently appointed cabinet members informed them that the queen was planning to unilaterally proclaim her new Constitution.<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/liliuokalani/hawaii/hawaii-7.html Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen, Appendix A] \"The three ministers left Mr. Parker to try to dissuade me from my purpose; and in the meantime they all (Peterson, Cornwell, and Colburn) went to the government building to inform Thurston and his part of the stand I took.\"</ref>  Some cabinet ministers were reported to have feared for their safety after upsetting the queen by not supporting her plans.<ref>[http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=804-805 Morgan Report, p804-805] \"Every one knows how quickly Colburn and Peterson, when they could escape from the palace, called for help from Thurston and others, and how afraid Colburn was to go back to the palace.\"</ref>\n\n=== Overthrow ===\n{{Main|Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom}}\n[[File:USS Boston landing force, 1893 (PP-36-3-002).jpg|thumb|left|[[USS Boston (1884)|USS ''Boston'''s]] landing force on duty at the Arlington Hotel, Honolulu, at the time of the overthrow, January 1893<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/h56000/h56555c.htm|title=U.S. Navy History site|publisher=}}</ref>]]\n\nIn 1893, local businessmen and politicians, composed of six non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects, five American nationals, one British national, and one German national,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/blount/br0588.html|title=Blount Report \u2013 Page 588|publisher=}}</ref> all of whom were living and doing business in Hawaii, overthrew the queen, her cabinet and her marshal, and took over the government of the Hawaiian Kingdom.\n\nHistorians suggest that businessmen were in favor of overthrow and annexation to the U.S. in order to benefit from more favorable trade conditions with its main export market.<ref>Kinzer, Stephen.

During this time, members of the former government lobbied in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] for the United States to restore the Hawaiian Kingdom. President [[Grover Cleveland]] considered the overthrow to have been an illegal act of war; he refused to consider annexation of the islands and initially worked to restore the Queen to her throne. Between December 14, 1893 and January 11, 1894 a standoff occurred between the [[United States]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]] against the Provisional Government to pressure them into returning the Queen known as the [[Black Week (Hawaii)|Black Week]]. This incident drove home the message that President Cleveland wanted Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani's return to power, and so on July 4, 1894 the Republic of Hawaii was requested to wait for President Cleveland's second term to finish. As lobbying continued in Washington during 1894, the royalist faction was secretly amassing an army of 600 strong led by former [[Captain of the guard|Captain of the Guard]] [[Samuel Nowlein]]. In 1895 they attempted a [[1895 Wilcox rebellion|counter-rebellion]], and [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was arrested when a weapons cache was found on the palace grounds. She was tried by a military tribunal of the Republic, convicted of treason, and placed under permanent house arrest in her own home.\n\nOn January 24, 1895 while under house arrest [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was forced to sign a five-page declaration as \"Liliuokalani Dominis\" in which she formally abdicated the throne in return for the release and commutation of the death sentences of her jailed supporters, including Minister Joseph Nawahi, Prince Kawananakoa, Robert Wilcox, and Prince Jonah Kuhio:\n\n{{quote|Before ascending the throne, for fourteen years, or since the date of my proclamation as heir apparent, my official title had been simply Liliuokalani.

[[Kamehameha I]] had conquered Maui and Molokai five years prior in the [[Battle of Kepaniwai]], but they were abandoned when Kamehameha's Big Island possession was under threat and later reconquered by the aged King [[Kahekili II]] of Maui. His domain comprised six of the major islands of the Hawaiian chain, and with [[Kaumualii]]'s peaceful surrender, Kauai and Niihau were added to his territories. [[Kamehameha II]] assumed de facto control of Kauai and Niihau when he kidnapped Kaumualii, ending his vassal rule over the islands.\n\nIn 1822, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]] and her husband [[Kaumualii|King Kaumuali\u02bbi]] traveled with Captain William Sumner to find [[Nihoa]], as her generation had only known the island through songs and [[Hawaiian religion|myths]]. Later, King [[Kamehameha IV]] sailed there to officially annex the island. Kamehameha IV and Kal\u0101kaua would later claim other islands in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]], including [[Pearl and Hermes Atoll]], [[Necker Island (Hawaii)|Necker Island]], [[Laysan]], [[Lisianski Island]], [[Kure Atoll|Ocean (Kure) Atoll]], [[Midway Atoll]], [[French Frigate Shoals]], [[Maro Reef]] and [[Gardner Pinnacles]], as well as [[Palmyra Atoll]], [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Jarvis Island]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Several of these islands had previously been claimed by the United States under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856. The Stewart Islands, or [[Sikaiana]] Atoll, near the [[Solomon Islands]], were ceded to Hawaii in 1856 by its residents, but the cession was never formalized by the Hawaiian government.\n\n== Royal estates ==\n[[File:Lowering the Hawaiian flag at Annexation ceremony (PPWD-8-3-006).jpg|thumb|On August 12, 1898, the flag of the Hawaiian Kingdom over \u02bbIolani Palace was lowered to raise the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] to signify annexation.]]\n\nEarly in its history, the Hawaiian Kingdom was governed from several locations including coastal towns on the islands of Hawai\u02bbi and Maui ([[Lahaina, Hawaii|L\u0101hain\u0101]]). It wasn't until the reign of Kamehameha III that a capital was established in Honolulu on the Island of O\u02bbahu.\n\nBy the time Kamehameha V was king, he saw the need to build a royal palace fitting of the Hawaiian Kingdom's new found prosperity and standing with the royals of other nations. He commissioned the building of [[Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale|the palace at Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale]]. He died before it was completed. Today, the palace houses the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai\u02bbi.\n\nDavid Kal\u0101kaua shared the dream of Kamehameha V to build a palace, and eagerly desired the trappings of European royalty. He commissioned the construction of [[\u02bbIolani Palace]]. In later years, the palace would become his sister's makeshift prison under guard by the forces of the Republic of Hawaii, the site of the official raising of the U.S. flag during annexation, and then territorial governor's and legislature's offices.  It is now a museum.\n\n=== Palaces and royal grounds ===\n*[[List of Hawaiian royal residences]]\n\n== Notable people ==\n[[File:Kawaiaha'o Church.jpg|thumb|[[Kawaiaha\u02bbo Church]] is known as the [[Westminster Abbey]] of Hawai\u02bbi, the site of coronations, royal christenings and funerals.]]\n*[[:Category:Kingdom of Hawaii people|People of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cabinet of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n*[[Privy Council of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n*[[Legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n*[[Hawaii\u2013Tahiti relations]]\n*[[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]]\n*[[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)]]\n*[[Hawaiian Kingdom\u2013United States relations]]\n*[[Supreme Court of Hawaii]]\n*[[Republic of Hawaii]]\n*[[United States federal recognition of Native Hawaiians]]\n*[[List of bilateral treaties signed by the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n*[[List of missionaries to Hawaii]]\n*[[Legal status of Hawaii]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|author=Liliuokalani|authorlink=Liliuokalani|title=Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen, Liliuokalani|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001268108 |via=HathiTrust|location=Boston|publisher=Lee and Shepard|year=1898|isbn=978-0-548-22265-2|oclc=2387226|ref=harv}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Beechert, Edward D.

In 1810, the whole [[Hawaiian Islands]] became [[unification of Hawaii|unified]] when [[Kauai|Kaua\u02bbi]] and [[Niihau|Ni\u02bbihau]] joined the Hawaiian Kingdom voluntarily. Two major dynastic families ruled the kingdom: the [[House of Kamehameha]] and the [[House of Kal\u0101kaua]].\n\nThe Kingdom won recognition from major European powers.

Eventually, Kaua\u02bbi's chief swore allegiance to Kamehameha. The unification ended the [[ancient Hawaii]]an society, transforming it into an independent constitutional monarchy crafted in the traditions and manner of European monarchs.\n\n=== Kamehameha dynasty ===\n{{Main|House of Kamehameha}}\nFrom 1810 to 1893, the Hawaiian Kingdom was ruled by two major dynastic families: the [[House of Kamehameha]] and the [[House of Kal\u0101kaua|Kal\u0101kaua Dynasty]]. Five members of the Kamehameha family led the government styled as Kamehameha. Lunalilo was a member of the House of Kamehameha through his mother. Liholiho (Kamehameha II) and Kauikeaouli (Kamehameha III) were direct sons of Kamehameha the Great. During Liholiho's and Kauikeaouli's reigns, the primary wife of Kamehameha the Great, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]], ruled as [[Regent|Queen Regent]] and ''[[Kuhina Nui]]'', or [[Prime minister|Prime Minister]].\n\n== Economic, social, and cultural transformation ==\n{{History of Hawaii}}\nEconomic and demographic factors in the 19th century reshaped the islands. Their consolidation into one unified political entity led to international trade. Under Kamehameha (1810\u20131819), [[sandalwood]] was exported to [[Qing dynasty|China]]. That led to the introduction of money and trade throughout the islands.\n\nFollowing Kamehameha's death the succession was overseen by his principal wife, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Ka'ahumanu]], who was designated as regent over the new king, Liholiho, who was a minor.\n\nQueen Ka'ahumanu eliminated various prohibitions ([[kapu]]) governing women's behavior. They included men and women eating together and women eating bananas. She also overturned the old religion as the Christian missionaries arrived in the islands. A major contribution of the missionaries was to develop a written Hawaiian language. That led to very high levels of literacy in Hawaii, above 90 percent in the latter half of the 19th century. The development of writing aided in the consolidation of government. Written constitutions enumerating the power and duties of the King were developed.\n\nIn 1848, the [[Great M\u0101hele]] was promulgated by King Liholihog. It instituted formal property rights to the land and followed the customary control of the land prior to this declaration. Ninety-eight percent of the land was assigned to the [[Ali\u02bbi|Ali'i]], chiefs or nobles. Two percent went to the commoners. No land could be sold, only transferred to lineal descendant land manager.\nFor the natives, contact with the outer world represented demographic disaster, as a series of unfamiliar diseases such as smallpox decimated the natives. The [[Hawaii|Hawaiian population]] of natives fell from approximately 128,000 in 1778<ref>{{cite book|author1=Tom Dye|author2=Eric Komori|title=Pre-censal Population History of Hawai'i |work=New Zealand Journal of Archaeology 14 |url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/482/1/JL28007.pdf|year=1992|publisher=NA|page=3}}</ref> to 71,000 in 1853 and kept declining to 24,000 in 1920.

The missionaries and their children became a powerful elite into the mid-19th century.

The army and navy used both traditional [[Canoe|canoes]] and uniforms including helmets made of natural materials and loincloths (called the Malo) as well as western technology like artillery cannons, muskets, and European ships.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} European advisors were captured, treated well and became Hawaiian citizens.{{Clarify|reason=When were they captured? By who?|date=December 2018}} When Kamehameha died in 1819 he left his son [[Kamehameha II|Liholiho]] a large arsenal with tens of thousands of soldiers and many warships. This helped put down the revolt at [[Kuamoo Burials|Kuamo\u02bbo]] later in 1819 and [[Humehume]]'s rebellion on Kauai in 1824.\n\nDuring the [[House of Kamehameha|Kamehameha dynasty]] the population in Hawaii was ravaged by epidemics following the arrival of outsiders. The military shrank with the population, so by the end of the Dynasty there was no Hawaiian navy and only an army, consisting of several hundred troops. After a French invasion that sacked [[Honolulu]] in 1849, [[Kamehameha III]] sought defense treaties with the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. During the outbreak of the [[Crimean War]] in Europe, Kamehameha III declared Hawaii a neutral state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiankingdom.org/hawn-territory.shtml |title=Hawaiian Territory |publisher=Hawaiian Kingdom |date= |accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref> The United States government put strong pressure on [[Kamehameha IV]] to make trade exclusively to the United States even annexed the islands. To counterbalance this situation Kamehameha IV and [[Kamehameha V]] pushed for alliances with other foreign powers, especially [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]. Hawaii claimed uninhabited islands in the Pacific, including the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]], many of which came into conflict with American claims.\n\nFollowing the Kamehameha dynasty the royal guards were disbanded under [[Lunalilo]] after a barracks revolt in September 1873. A small army was restored under King [[Kal\u0101kaua|Kalakaua]] but failed to stop the 1887 Rebellion by the [[Reform Party (Hawaii)|Missionary Party]]. In 1891, [[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani]] came to power. The elections of 1892 were followed with petitions and requests from her administration to change the [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|constitution of 1887]]. <!-- prior sentence is very confusing and needs editing by someone with knowledge --> The US maintained a policy of keeping at least one [[cruiser]] in Hawaii at all times. On January 17, 1893, Lili\u02bbuokalani, believing the US military would intervene if she changed the constitution, waited for the {{USS|Boston|1884|6}} to leave port. Once it was known that Lili\u02bbuokalani was revising the constitution, the ''Boston'' was recalled and assisted the Missionary Party in her overthrow. Following the overthrow and the establishment of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] the Kingdom's military was disarmed and disbanded. One hundred years later, in 1993, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Apology Resolution]], admitting wrongdoing and issuing a belated apology.\n\n== French Incident (1839) ==\n{{Main|Laplace affair}}\n\nUnder the rule of [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]], the powerful, newly converted Protestant widow of Kamehameha the Great, Catholicism was illegal in Hawaii, and in 1831 French Catholic priests were forcibly deported by chiefs loyal to her.

You will exact, if necessary with all the force that is yours to use, complete reparation for the wrongs which have been committed, and you will not quit those places until you have left in all minds a solid and lasting impression.''\n\nUnder the threat of war, King [[Kamehameha III]] signed the [[Edict of Toleration (Hawaii)|Edict of Toleration]] on July 17, 1839 and paid the $20,000 in compensation for the deportation of the priests and the incarceration and torture of converts, agreeing to Laplace's demands.

In his restoration speech, Kamehameha III declared that ''\"[[Ua Mau ke Ea o ka \u02bb\u0100ina i ka Pono]]\"'' (The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness), the motto of the future State of Hawaii. The day was celebrated as [[Sovereignty Restoration Day|L\u0101 Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Ea]] (Sovereignty Restoration Day).\n\n== French invasion (1849) ==\n{{Main|French invasion of Honolulu}}\nIn August 1849, French admiral [[Louis Tromelin]] arrived in [[Honolulu Harbor]] with the ''La Poursuivante'' and ''Gassendi''. De Tromelin made ten demands to King [[Kamehameha III]] on August 22, mainly demanding that full religious rights be given to Catholics, (a decade earlier, during the French Incident the ban on Catholicism had been lifted, but Catholics still enjoyed only partial religious rights). On August 25 the demands had not been met. After a second warning was made to the civilians, French troops overwhelmed the [[skeleton crew|skeleton force]] and captured [[Honolulu Fort]], spiked the [[Coastal artillery|coastal guns]] and destroyed all other weapons they found (mainly muskets and ammunition). They raided government buildings and general property in Honolulu, causing damage that amounted to $100,000. After the raids the invasion force withdrew to the fort. De Tromelin eventually recalled his men and left Hawaii on September 5.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\nAnticipating foreign encroachment on Hawaiian territory, King Kamehameha III dispatched a delegation to the United States and Europe to secure the recognition of Hawaiian independence. [[Ha\u02bbalilio|Timoteo Ha\u02bbalilio]], [[William Richards (Hawaii)|William Richards]] and [[George Simpson (HBC administrator)|Sir George Simpson]] were commissioned as joint Ministers Plenipotentiary on April 8, 1842. Simpson left for Great Britain while Ha\u02bbalilio and Richards to the United States on July 8, 1842. The Hawaiian delegation secured the assurance of US President [[John Tyler]] on December 19, 1842 of Hawaiian independence and then met Simpson in Europe to secure formal recognition by the United Kingdom and France. On March 17, 1843, King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe of France]] recognized Hawaiian independence at the urging of King [[Leopold I of Belgium]]. On April 1, 1843, [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], on behalf of [[Queen Victoria]], assured the Hawaiian delegation, \"Her Majesty's Government was willing and had determined to recognize the independence of the [[Sandwich Islands]] under their present sovereign.\"\n\n=== Anglo-Franco Proclamation ===\n[[File:La Kuokoa o Hawaii Nei.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Flier for the 30th anniversary celebration of the 1843 treaty]]\nOn November 28, 1843, at the Court of London, the British and French Governments formally recognized Hawaiian independence.

Upon his deathbed, he summoned High Chiefess [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]] to declare his intentions of making her heir to the throne. Bernice refused the crown, and Kamehameha V died without naming an heir.\n\nThe refusal of Bishop to take the crown forced the legislature of the kingdom to [[Election|elect]] a new monarch. From 1872 to 1873, several relatives of the Kamehameha line were nominated. In [[Hawaii monarchal election, 1873|a ceremonial popular vote and a unanimous legislative vote]], [[Lunalilo|William C. Lunalilo]], grandnephew of Kamehameha I, became Hawai\u02bbi's first of two [[Elective monarchy|elected monarchs]] but reigned only from 1873 to 1874 because of his early death due to tuberculosis at the age of 39.\n\n== Kal\u0101kaua dynasty ==\n[[File:Kalakaua Grant state visit 1874.jpg|thumb|King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] meeting U.S. President [[Ulysses S.

Once again, the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom needed an election to fill the royal vacancy. [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Queen Emma]], widow of Kamehameha IV, was nominated along with [[Kal\u0101kaua|David Kal\u0101kaua]]. The [[Honolulu Courthouse riot|1874 election]] was a nasty political campaign in which both candidates resorted to mudslinging and innuendo. David Kal\u0101kaua became the second elected King of Hawaii but without the ceremonial popular vote of Lunalilo. The choice of the legislature was controversial, and U.S. and British troops were called upon to suppress rioting by Queen Emma's supporters, the ''[[Emmaites]]''.\n\nKal\u0101kaua officially proclaimed his sister, Lili\u02bbuokalani would succeed to the throne upon his death.  Hoping to avoid uncertainty in the monarchy's future,  Kalakaua had named a line of succession in his will, so that after Lili\u2019uokalani the throne should succeed to Princess [[Ka\u02bbiulani|Victoria Ka\u02bbiulani]], then to Queen Consort [[Kapi\u02bbolani|Kapi\u2019olani]], followed by her sister, [[Poomaikelani|Princess Po\u2019omaikalani]], then Prince [[David Kaw\u0101nanakoa|David Lamea Kawananakoa]] and last was Prince [[Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana\u02bbole]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DAC18910318.2.57&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|title=Daily Alta California 18 March 1891 \u2014 California Digital Newspaper Collection|website=cdnc.ucr.edu|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref>  Although, the will was not an official line of succession or a proper proclamation according to kingdom law.

Thurston]], Minister of Interior under King Kal\u0101kaua.  The constitution was proclaimed by the king after a meeting of 3,000 residents including an armed militia demanded he sign it or be deposed. The document created a [[constitutional monarchy]] like the one that existed in United Kingdom, stripping the King of most of his personal authority and empowering the legislature and establishing cabinet government. It has since become widely known as the \"Bayonet Constitution\" because of the threat of force used to gain Kal\u0101kaua's cooperation.\n\nThe [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|1887 constitution]] empowered the citizenry to elect members of the House of Nobles (who had previously been appointed by the King). It increased the value of property a citizen must own to be eligible to vote above the previous Constitution of 1864 and denied voting rights to Asians who comprised a large proportion of the population (a few Japanese and some Chinese had previously become [[Naturalization|naturalized]] and now lost voting rights they had previously enjoyed). This guaranteed a voting monopoly to wealthy native Hawaiians and Europeans. The Bayonet Constitution continued allowing the monarch to appoint cabinet ministers, but stripped him of the power to dismiss them without approval from the Legislature.\n\n=== Lili\u02bbuokalani's Constitution ===\n[[File:Liliuokalani, c. 1891.jpg|thumb|[[Lili\u02bbuokalani|Lili'uokalani]]]]\nIn 1891, Kal\u0101kaua died and his sister Lili\u02bbuokalani assumed the throne. She came to power during an economic crisis precipitated in part by the [[McKinley Tariff]]. By rescinding the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, the new tariff eliminated the previous advantage Hawaiian exporters enjoyed in trade to U.S. markets. Many Hawaiian businesses and citizens were feeling the pressures of the loss of revenue, so Lili\u02bbuokalani proposed a [[lottery]] and opium licensing to bring in additional revenue for the government. Her ministers and closest friends tried to dissuade her from pursuing the bills, and these controversial proposals were used against her in the looming constitutional crisis.\n\nLili\u02bbuokalani wanted to restore power to the monarch by abrogating the 1887 Constitution. The queen launched a campaign resulting in a petition to proclaim a new Constitution.\nMany citizens and residents who in 1887 had forced Kal\u0101kaua to sign the \"Bayonet Constitution\" became alarmed when three of her recently appointed cabinet members informed them that the queen was planning to unilaterally proclaim her new Constitution.<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/liliuokalani/hawaii/hawaii-7.html Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen, Appendix A] \"The three ministers left Mr. Parker to try to dissuade me from my purpose; and in the meantime they all (Peterson, Cornwell, and Colburn) went to the government building to inform Thurston and his part of the stand I took.\"</ref>  Some cabinet ministers were reported to have feared for their safety after upsetting the queen by not supporting her plans.<ref>[http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=804-805 Morgan Report, p804-805] \"Every one knows how quickly Colburn and Peterson, when they could escape from the palace, called for help from Thurston and others, and how afraid Colburn was to go back to the palace.\"</ref>\n\n=== Overthrow ===\n{{Main|Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom}}\n[[File:USS Boston landing force, 1893 (PP-36-3-002).jpg|thumb|left|[[USS Boston (1884)|USS ''Boston'''s]] landing force on duty at the Arlington Hotel, Honolulu, at the time of the overthrow, January 1893<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/h56000/h56555c.htm|title=U.S. Navy History site|publisher=}}</ref>]]\n\nIn 1893, local businessmen and politicians, composed of six non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects, five American nationals, one British national, and one German national,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/blount/br0588.html|title=Blount Report \u2013 Page 588|publisher=}}</ref> all of whom were living and doing business in Hawaii, overthrew the queen, her cabinet and her marshal, and took over the government of the Hawaiian Kingdom.\n\nHistorians suggest that businessmen were in favor of overthrow and annexation to the U.S. in order to benefit from more favorable trade conditions with its main export market.<ref>Kinzer, Stephen.

During this time, members of the former government lobbied in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] for the United States to restore the Hawaiian Kingdom. President [[Grover Cleveland]] considered the overthrow to have been an illegal act of war; he refused to consider annexation of the islands and initially worked to restore the Queen to her throne. Between December 14, 1893 and January 11, 1894 a standoff occurred between the [[United States]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom]] against the Provisional Government to pressure them into returning the Queen known as the [[Black Week (Hawaii)|Black Week]]. This incident drove home the message that President Cleveland wanted Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani's return to power, and so on July 4, 1894 the Republic of Hawaii was requested to wait for President Cleveland's second term to finish. As lobbying continued in Washington during 1894, the royalist faction was secretly amassing an army of 600 strong led by former [[Captain of the guard|Captain of the Guard]] [[Samuel Nowlein]]. In 1895 they attempted a [[1895 Wilcox rebellion|counter-rebellion]], and [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was arrested when a weapons cache was found on the palace grounds. She was tried by a military tribunal of the Republic, convicted of treason, and placed under permanent house arrest in her own home.\n\nOn January 24, 1895 while under house arrest [[Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was forced to sign a five-page declaration as \"Liliuokalani Dominis\" in which she formally abdicated the throne in return for the release and commutation of the death sentences of her jailed supporters, including Minister Joseph Nawahi, Prince Kawananakoa, Robert Wilcox, and Prince Jonah Kuhio:\n\n{{quote|Before ascending the throne, for fourteen years, or since the date of my proclamation as heir apparent, my official title had been simply Liliuokalani. Thus I was proclaimed both Princess Royal and Queen. Thus it is recorded in the archives of the government to this day. The Provisional Government nor any other had enacted any change in my name. All my official acts, as well as my private letters, were issued over the signature of Liliuokalani. But when my jailers required me to sign (\"Liliuokalani Dominis,\") I did as they commanded. Their motive in this as in other actions was plainly to humiliate me before my people and before the world. I saw in a moment, what they did not, that, even were I not complying under the most severe and exacting duress, by this demand they had overreached themselves. There is not, and never was, within the range of my knowledge, any such a person as Liliuokalani Dominis.|Queen Liliuokalani| \"Hawaii's Story By Hawaii's Queen\"{{Sfn | Liliuokalani | 1898 | p = 275}}}}\n\n== Territorial extent ==\nThe Kingdom came about in 1795 in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Nu\u02bbuanu|Battle of Nuuanu]] with the conquest of [[Maui]], [[Molokai]] and [[Oahu]]. [[Kamehameha I]] had conquered Maui and Molokai five years prior in the [[Battle of Kepaniwai]], but they were abandoned when Kamehameha's Big Island possession was under threat and later reconquered by the aged King [[Kahekili II]] of Maui. His domain comprised six of the major islands of the Hawaiian chain, and with [[Kaumualii]]'s peaceful surrender, Kauai and Niihau were added to his territories. [[Kamehameha II]] assumed de facto control of Kauai and Niihau when he kidnapped Kaumualii, ending his vassal rule over the islands.\n\nIn 1822, [[Ka\u02bbahumanu|Queen Ka\u02bbahumanu]] and her husband [[Kaumualii|King Kaumuali\u02bbi]] traveled with Captain William Sumner to find [[Nihoa]], as her generation had only known the island through songs and [[Hawaiian religion|myths]]. Later, King [[Kamehameha IV]] sailed there to officially annex the island. Kamehameha IV and Kal\u0101kaua would later claim other islands in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]], including [[Pearl and Hermes Atoll]], [[Necker Island (Hawaii)|Necker Island]], [[Laysan]], [[Lisianski Island]], [[Kure Atoll|Ocean (Kure) Atoll]], [[Midway Atoll]], [[French Frigate Shoals]], [[Maro Reef]] and [[Gardner Pinnacles]], as well as [[Palmyra Atoll]], [[Johnston Atoll]] and [[Jarvis Island]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Several of these islands had previously been claimed by the United States under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856. The Stewart Islands, or [[Sikaiana]] Atoll, near the [[Solomon Islands]], were ceded to Hawaii in 1856 by its residents, but the cession was never formalized by the Hawaiian government.\n\n== Royal estates ==\n[[File:Lowering the Hawaiian flag at Annexation ceremony (PPWD-8-3-006).jpg|thumb|On August 12, 1898, the flag of the Hawaiian Kingdom over \u02bbIolani Palace was lowered to raise the [[Flag of the United States|United States flag]] to signify annexation.]]\n\nEarly in its history, the Hawaiian Kingdom was governed from several locations including coastal towns on the islands of Hawai\u02bbi and Maui ([[Lahaina, Hawaii|L\u0101hain\u0101]]). It wasn't until the reign of Kamehameha III that a capital was established in Honolulu on the Island of O\u02bbahu.\n\nBy the time Kamehameha V was king, he saw the need to build a royal palace fitting of the Hawaiian Kingdom's new found prosperity and standing with the royals of other nations. He commissioned the building of [[Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale|the palace at Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale]]. He died before it was completed. Today, the palace houses the Supreme Court of the State of Hawai\u02bbi.\n\nDavid Kal\u0101kaua shared the dream of Kamehameha V to build a palace, and eagerly desired the trappings of European royalty. He commissioned the construction of [[\u02bbIolani Palace]]. In later years, the palace would become his sister's makeshift prison under guard by the forces of the Republic of Hawaii, the site of the official raising of the U.S. flag during annexation, and then territorial governor's and legislature's offices.  It is now a museum.\n\n=== Palaces and royal grounds ===\n*[[List of Hawaiian royal residences]]\n\n== Notable people ==\n[[File:Kawaiaha'o Church.jpg|thumb|[[Kawaiaha\u02bbo Church]] is known as the [[Westminster Abbey]] of Hawai\u02bbi, the site of coronations, royal christenings and funerals.]]\n*[[:Category:Kingdom of Hawaii people|People of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cabinet of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n*[[Privy Council of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n*[[Legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n*[[Hawaii\u2013Tahiti relations]]\n*[[Hawaiian sovereignty movement]]\n*[[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)]]\n*[[Hawaiian Kingdom\u2013United States relations]]\n*[[Supreme Court of Hawaii]]\n*[[Republic of Hawaii]]\n*[[United States federal recognition of Native Hawaiians]]\n*[[List of bilateral treaties signed by the Hawaiian Kingdom]]\n*[[List of missionaries to Hawaii]]\n*[[Legal status of Hawaii]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|author=Liliuokalani|authorlink=Liliuokalani|title=Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen, Liliuokalani|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001268108 |via=HathiTrust|location=Boston|publisher=Lee and Shepard|year=1898|isbn=978-0-548-22265-2|oclc=2387226|ref=harv}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Beechert, Edward D.
