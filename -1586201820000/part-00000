Over the following five years small settlers began to establish themselves along the north bank of the Nepean River opposite the estate in accordance with the burgeoning of agricultural and pastoral interest in the area. During the term of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Foveaux Acting-Governor (1808-1809) several smaller grants were also made along the north bank to increase settlement. Governor Macquarie (1810-1821) soon after his arrival continued this trend granting the remaining land on the north bank. In this manner, by the mid-1810s the Cowpastures became a developing pastoral and agricultural area, but with Camden Park being the only main settlement south of the Nepean.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1>Atkinson, 1988</ref>{{rp|11-124}}\n\nBy 1815 Camden Park carried 4,500 sheep divided into flocks of between 350 and 500 that were each managed by a single convict shepherd. Three herdsmen also managed a herd of several hundred cattle. However, the only substantial building on the property was a woolshed.

These additions extended Camden Park to about {{convert|27333|acre|ha|order=flip}} in size bounded on its north and east sides by the Nepean River, on its west side by Mount Hunter Rivulet, and on its south side by higher ground.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|19}}\n\nThe absentee landlords began to move into permanent residency on their estates by the 1820s and this encouraged the Macarthur's to erect fitting housing at ''Camden Park''. Thus, in 1821 the weatherboard cottage \"Belgenny Farm House\" was constructed on the property. This farm became the home of James and [[William Macarthur]] when they arrived to oversee the running of the Estate. At this time the Estate was run by a workforce of nearly a hundred people of which the majority were convicts and the remainder ex-convicts. This included only three women. From this time the Macarthur brothers were the higher gentry of the area who with their considerable wealth and youthful energy began to see to the proper development and advancement of the Cowpastures in accordance with the ideas and improvements they had brought back from the continent. There was a vast social gulf between the Macarthurs and their convict servants on the Estate that was enforced by a range of overseers and upper servants and this contributed to their social standing in the community. Under their leadership the Estate was well run and organised partly due to their careful encouragement of well-behaved and industrious convicts and servants. Those loyal to the Macarthurs were well-looked after by the family. The movement of the Macarthurs and other owner families to the area at this time led to imposition of order and the ruling of the area from within its borders.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|17, 19-20, 23-24}}\n\nIn 1831, after John Macarthur had finally decided to make Camden the \"family seat\", he commissioned the architect [[John Verge]] to design a house of a stature suitable for one of the colony's leading and wealthiest families. The house was completed in 1835, shortly after John Macarthur's death in 1834. His sons James and William Macarthur took up occupancy in the new house, while their mother Elizabeth continue to reside at Elizabeth Farm in Parramatta, in which she had a life interest.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-3>Emery, 2016</ref>\n\nJames and William were intelligent and capable men and their interests and morals were to characterise the development of the ''[[Camden Park Estate]]''. Of the many things which they were fond of, such as theatre and history, they had a special interest in a well-made or picturesque landscape that could encapsulate and frame the works and lives of men and women. Consequently, during the early development of the estate they spent much time and money on developing the beauty of its landscape, which in time incorporated the township of Camden. James and William saw to the construction of three well-made and purposefully placed structures, St John's Anglican Church, Camden Park House, and the monument on John Macarthur's grave, that helped to form a triangular arrangement of subtle and elegant picturesque vistas. This was especially when they were contrasted with the intrinsic beauty of the surrounding \"natural\" landscape. Form the earliest trespasses of Europeans into this region they had considered the Camden landscape to be beautiful, almost a work of art, and satisfactory to the aesthetic notions of the time that valued the combination of the natural and the artificial (the works of man - [[anthropogeny|anthropogenic]]). Adapting or improving this original canvas with the works of men could only add to its beauty in the minds of the Macarthurs and their contemporaries.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|26-27}}\n\nBy the 1830s the Camden Park Estate had grown to {{convert|28000|acre|ha|order=flip}} through the addition of further grants including Cawdor and was arguably the greatest and most advanced mixed farm in NSW. Throughout the 1820s James and William had worked towards improving the quality of their wool production but had also diversified the estate so that it produced grain, meat, and dairy produce. This was aside from Williams development of a flourishing orchard, vineyards, and gardens for vegetables and horticultural experiments. With this diverse base the estate was in good financial straits, despite the fall of wool prices and drought during the late 1820s. Consequently, the Macarthur brothers could begin looking to consolidating their squirearchy at Camden and creating a social order to their liking (consisting of tenant farmers).<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-6>Ashton and Blackmore, 1987</ref>{{rp|4-6}}\n\n===The establishment of the Township of Camden===\n{{main|Camden, New South Wales}}\nThe construction of the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]] with a river crossing over the Nepean River along the north boundary of the ''Camden Park Estate'' in the early 1820s ultimately served as the goad for the establishment of a Township in the area. In 1826 this crossing was replaced by a bridge which more effectively opened up the land to the south for settlement and the mere existence of the bridge encouraged the development of a settlement. The fact that there were no major settlements along the Great South Road for considerable distances each way from the Cowpastures also encouraged the establishment of a police lock-up at Camden that could patrol the road and protect settlers against bushrangers.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|34-35}}\n\nConsequently, in December 1830 a group of local residents petitioned [[Ralph Darling|Governor Darling]] for the establishment of settlement, comprising a police station, court-house, goal, and church, near the Cowpastures Bridge. Darling liked this idea and began arranging for the establishment of a {{convert|320|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip}} township to serve as a local administrative centre. However, due to most of the land along the Nepean being a flood plain and nearly all of it also having been granted away the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] had no existing Crown Land on which to establish a township. The [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor-General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] recommended the land on the south bank of the Nepean on a rise close to the river being the most ideal choice, but this location was part of the ''Camden Park Estate''. As John Macarthur had not signed the petition and was not amenable to the idea of giving away any of his Estate for this purpose, the plan was shelved at this time.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|34-35}}\n\nJames and William Macarthur were of the same opinion as their neighbours that a township would be to the benefit of the district, but they were unable to change their father's mind. However, following John's death in April 1834 and their establishment as the official heads of the Estate they were able to re-commence the plans for a township. In the interval the government had chosen Campbelltown as the main administration centre in the southern districts, but this allowed James and William to develop their own private township in accordance with their own ideals. They were keen to promote public order (along with a keen social order) that reflected a spiritual one that could encourage and regulate the minds and souls of the people. To this end an Anglican church was to form the imposing and commanding centrepiece of their new township.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|35}}\n\nThe Macarthur brothers had the 8 hectare area for their township cleared during the winter of 1835. On this foundation they desired that the first building to be constructed should be a church. To this end they appealed to their neighbours and employees for assistance and subscriptions to fulfil this goal. James was the main force behind this scheme. He was more religious than William and convinced that religious progress was beneficial, but that it should not be forced on the lower classes by the gentry, but rather be the result of the combined effort and initiative of all classes. This was to encourage a collective and mutual dependence among the population that was in keeping with Christian teachings and tenets. In this way, James pictured this church as growing from the land from the combined effort of the people so that it could be a focus of their moral behaviour and a symbol of the inter-reliance of society for its common good. However, he still demanded that it be an Anglican church, in accordance with its status as the Established Faith, despite the fact that people of a number of different denominations resided in the area.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|35}}\n\nJames and William had amassed A\u00a3644 in subscriptions by September 1835 for the construction of an Anglican church. Of this total they had promised A\u20a4500, while their employees had offered A\u20a443, and their neighbours the remainder. This allowed them to write to the government outlining their plans for a township and offering a copy of the subscription list as evidence of the commitment of the local population. They envisioned that the town would include reserves for a police station and lock-up, courthouse, post-office, and for churches of the several denominations: Anglican, Catholic, and Presbyterian, that flourished in the area.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Government approved these plans and the Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell began the process of town planning in consultation with the Macarthur brothers in January 1836. In accordance with his ideals he designed Camden as being a rectangle with two crossing main streets near its centre: the one running east-west was to be the highway and the other (John Street) running north-south being a vista to the town's Anglican church. This church was to crown a hilltop overlooking the town and, specifically gaze down into the centre of rectangle and the commercial district. In this way, Mitchell designed the church to be a focus for the town, while also being above and beyond it. Mitchell characteristically liked towns to have axes, squares, and meeting places and he often used the natural landscapes of places, such as hills and valleys, to emphasize these features. Camden was a more simple example of this type, but this does not prevent it from being a successful and highly picturesque and commanding one.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|36}} <ref name=CMP>{{cite web |url=https://stjohnscamden.org.au/media/audio/St.%20Johns%20Camden%20CMP%20Final%20(Heritage).pdf |title=St. John\u2019s Anglican Church Precinct Menangle Road, Camden: Conservation Management Plan |author=Clive Lucas, Stapleton and Partners Pty Ltd |publisher=The Anglican Parish of St. John, Camden |date=March 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190305014644/https://stjohnscamden.org.au/media/audio/St.%20Johns%20Camden%20CMP%20Final%20(Heritage).pdf |archive-date=5 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|9}}\n\nDespite this beginning it was not until July 1841 that the town allotments were offered for sale at auction. At this time the population of the Camden Park Estate was around 200-300 and there were eight households and a post office in the township. There was also regular traffic along the Great South Road through the township. These inducements encouraged the sale of half of the 44 half acre township blocks but up for sale for high prices and the beginning of increased settlement.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-6/>{{rp|10}} <ref name=CMP/>{{rp|9-10}}\n\n===The construction of St John's the Evangelist, Camden===\n[[File:The church, Camden (2533271302).jpg|thumb|The church set in the streetscape, pictured {{circa|1900}}.]]\nDuring the early days of settlement of the Cowpastures, particularly after the 1820s when the landholders began to live in the area, religious services were undertaken through the employees and members of each estate coming together for prayers. Early in their residency at Camden Park it appears William and James organised these events with William at least occasionally conducting readings. By 1826 the Reverend Thomas Reddall, chaplain of St Peter's, Campbelltown began conducting services at [[Kirkham, New South Wales|Kirkham]] on the north bank of the Nepean. In March 1827 [[Thomas Hassall]] was appointed Chaplain of the Cowpastures and settled at Denbigh near [[Cobbitty, New South Wales|Cobbitty]] and he soon began his regular circuit of the properties and settlements within his parish, which included Camden Park.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|33-34}}<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Macarthur's plans for Camden and it crowning jewel - its Anglican Church - in late 1835 lucky coincided with the introduction of Governor Burke's Church Act the following year. This Act was designed to promote the buildings of churches and chapels and provide for the maintenance of Ministers of Religion. This Act offered pound for pound subsidies for the construction of churches of all the major denominations. In this manner it removed the de facto \"established church\" status the Church of England had enjoyed in the colony to this point by providing equal access to state funding for the major denominations. The subsidies were available for churches and rectories costing between A\u20a4600 and A\u20a42,000. These building had to be designed by a competent architect and be approved by the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]] to be eligible for the subsidy. A subsidy of A\u20a41,000, towards the total cost of A\u20a42,500 of the church, was provided to the Macarthurs under this Act. The Reverend Thomas Hassall, [[Charles Cowper]] of [[Wivenhoe, Narellan|Wivenhoe]], James and William Macarthur, and [[George Macleay]] were appointed trustees of the church.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nWhile the 1836 Church Act provided substantial funds for church construction Bishop [[William Broughton (bishop)|William Broughton]] and the Anglican Church were hamstrung by the lack of competent architects in the colony to realise their dreams and ideals. Consequently, Broughton was initially forced to rely on James Hume to design the church. He commissioned Hume to design the church in the classical style in 1837. This design was initially accepted by Broughton, and assumedly the Macarthurs, but it was abandoned by late 1839 at the request of Emily Macarthur, James new wife, who objected to the classical design and preferred something in the Gothic style which was the current new vogue in England.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|46, 243}}<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\n[[James Macarthur (Australian politician)|James Macarthur]] had travelled back to England in 1836 and met Emily Stone (1806-1880) there in 1838. Emily was the daughter of Henry and Mary Stone. Henry was a civil servant (and later banker or their family had banking connections) and Mary was the daughter of Dr William Roxburgh a botanist with the East India Company. Emily had been born in India and she travelled to England in 1811. Soon after meeting James Macarthur she married him later in 1838. Soon afterwards they returned to the colony, arriving in March 1839. After returning to Camden Park, Emily became the first mistress of the new Camden House which had been completed in 1834-35.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nDuring the mid-late 1830s in England the gothic or medieval style of architecture was just becoming the new trend in ecclesiological architecture due to the works of the Tractarian movement and the Cambridge Camden Society.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Oxford or Tractarian movement, named after their publication \"Tracts for the Times\", was formed at Oxford in 1833 as a new school of churchmanship. Initially, it was an academic theological and historical movement focussed on ascertaining the rightful position and nature of the Church of England within contemporary society. It had been formed as a protest against the State and liberal pressure being directed against the Church of England at the time and was part of the Church taking stock of its purpose and mission. However, as it rapidly grew and was influenced by the Romantic Movement it morphed into a widespread affirmation of the spiritual and historical integrity and apostolic character of the Church of England. To this end it focussed on and insisted that the sacramental character of the Church be given proper reverence. The movement argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology. Overall, Tractarianism focussed on the Catholic heritage of the church and the apostolic succession, espoused that the liturgical emphasis should be on the sacraments, and was strongly opposed to any segregation in church based on social differentiation. At this time the liturgical emphasis of the Church of England was on the spoken word with the pulpit being the focus of attention and there was commonly social segregation through the use of rented pews for the wealthy and open galleries for the poor.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-22>Judd and Cable, 2000:29-30</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-24/>{{rp|25-26}} <ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-23/>{{rp|29}}\n\nTractarianism was, overall, a divisive movement, as among its supporters it generated much excitement, but at the same time it brought about resolute and firm opposition among its, often Evangelical, opponents. The nature of the movement to look towards the medieval past for inspiration led its liberal critics to label it as retrogressive and its Evangelical opponents as pro-Roman Catholic and a threat to the Protestant Church. Indeed, several of the movement's leaders seceded to the Roman Catholic Church.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-23>Lucas, Stapleton, and Partners, 2001</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Cambridge Camden Society, later the Ecclesiological Society, was originally established to study the design and execution of ecclesiastical ornaments and buildings. This organisation was closely allied with the Tractarian movement as their goal was to provide structural expression for the liturgical and doctrinal ideals they developed. In this manner they were attempting to reintroduce structural sacramentalism to the Church of England. They eventually settled on Gothic architecture as being the most fitting for church construction and promoted these designs in Britain and across her colonies. In accordance with their goals they had very stringent standards and design requirements for church architecture and church designs they approved. The society advocated an architectural form known as \"symbolic sacramentality\" which was a system where the material fabric of the structure was designed to symbolise or embody some abstract meaning and through which an expression of liturgy could be articulated structurally. In essence the society aimed to develop a style that could best embody \"both liturgical and architectural beauty without striving for effect\".<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-24>Elliot, 1995</ref>\n\nThis society aimed to implement the reformations of the Tractarian Movement through igniting a change in ecclesiological architecture in England. The favoured design or icon of the society ultimately came to be an idealised version of the 14th Century English country parish church and particularly the designs modelled after this type by its favoured architects in the 1830s and 1840s. This design stressed the proper definition and separation of the nave and chancel; the allocation of the chancel with fair proportions; the placement of the font at the entrance to the church; the addition of an exterior porch; the provision of aisles with the subsequent threefold division of the nave symbolising the holy trinity; the provision of an un-galleried nave furnished with open benches; the establishment of the chancel, sanctuary, and altar as the focus of the congregation through their elevation with steps (ideally three each); the sub-division of the chancel into a chorus cantorum and sacrarium; and the alignment of the church so that it faced east. Church design should also encourage the exclusion of the congregation from the chancel, which was only acceptable when receiving communion. A tower was not considered an essential element, but if provided should be at the west end or at the crossing of the church if it featured transepts. The most ideal Gothic style was the Decorated dating to between 1260-1360 (13th-14th Centuries) and building materials stone, or less so flints, with bricks only being used as an alternative when neither was available. In this manner a church should emphasise auditory and hierarchal values in its architecture. This design was in contrast to the traditional early nineteenth century style that featured high box pews, triple-decker pulpit, and a western gallery containing harmonium and choir.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-25>Kerr, 1977:105</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-24/>{{rp|25-28, 50-52, 145}}\n\nEmily Macarthur must have been fashionably up-to-date with the nascent Gothic Revival in England prompting her to ensure that the new Anglican church at Camden was constructed in the [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Ecclesiastical Gothic|Gothic Revival]] style. However, due to the lack of competent architects in the colony that could design buildings in this style (Edmund Blacket was not to arrive in the colony until 1843). Emily and James Macarthur were forced to have a British architect design the church. They chose the Scottish architect John Cunningham (1799-1873) who had a connection with Emily's family or the Macarthurs. Cunningham had been trained in the Edinburgh City Works Department, but after he established his own practice he mostly worked in the [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] area. During his career Cunningham designed a number of churches in Gothic and Romanesque styles.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nIt is slightly unclear at what point the decision was made to change the style of the Camden church from Classical to Gothic. It seems most likely that the decision occurred prior to the beginning of construction of the church. Emily and James likely convinced the other church trustees to change the style after their arrival back in Camden in mid-1839. They must have been successful by late 1839 when Hume was dropped as the architect, allowing them to send away for plans at this time. They then waited until the winter of 1840 before clearing the site and constructing the foundations (the church sits on bedrock) and they must have had the plans in hand by September when construction began in earnest. When the Macarthurs sent to England for plans they must have specified that they be the same dimensions as Hume's original plans, perhaps to ensure that the budget for the church was still applicable to the new gothic design. This would explain the similarity in the designs of the foundations of the two plans noted by many modern authors.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|46, 243}}<ref>Kerr and Broadbent, 1980:122-124</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nAs noted above construction work commenced on the church during the winter of 1840 with the levelling of the site occurring over two months. Construction of the brickwork commenced in September allowing Bishop Broughton to lay the foundation stone on 3 November 1840. During these works the Colonial Architect, Mortimer William Lewis served as supervisory architect. This was likely a result of the connection of the Macarthur family rather than Lewis fulfilling the terms of the Church Act requirements on the design and construction. Richard Basden was the local builder employed to construct the church. He supplied the 386,000 bricks used in its erection from his brickyard located on the southwest corner of the intersection of Argyle and Oxley streets. John Le Ferve acted as the carpenter and he constructed the brick spire, framing, and other timberwork. The ironbark that was used to construct the roof framing was provided by the Macarthur brothers who organised for it to be cut from the forest at Mount Hunter. The stone for the construction was sourced from Denbigh and the lime from quarries near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]].<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|46}}<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11-12}}\n\nWith these arrangements construction continued apace during 1841 and by April 1842 the roof, tower, and spire (including its plastering) had been completed. Unfortunately, the depression now intruded on the construction work with a lack of funds preventing the final stages of construction, such as the installation of the stained glass windows and the furnishing and flooring of the interior. This was apparently due to the folding of the bank that held the funds for the church construction.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-28>{{cite book |author=Wrigley, John |date=8 August 2017 |title=pers. comm. }}</ref> With the loss of these funds the church could not be completed until replacement funding could be found and this was difficult due to the financial straits of the Colony and the Macarthurs. It is also possible that the depression caused the delay of the promised funding from the government under the Church Act.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|46}}<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|12}}\n\nBy the time the shell of the church had been constructed in 1842 its authentic gothic design was a new innovation in the colony and just ahead of the fashionable wave of the Gothic Revevial that was to wash over the community from the mid 1840s. In particular, the decorated gothic stone tracery of the windows and the open cusped hammer-beam roof of the church were entirely new features that subsequently became standard for Gothic Revival churches in the colony.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nWhile construction had been underway the 5 acre, 3 rood, and 24 perch land grant for St John's Church had been formally granted to the Anglican Church through Bishop Broughton in May 1841 by James and William Macarthur. This land was reserved strictly for \"the erection of a church or chapel for the performance of divine worship according to the rites of the United Church of England and Ireland (and) for the erection of a residence for a clergyman in holy orders, and for a burial ground according to the use of the said United Church.\" The grant was triangular and positioned on the south side of the town with Broughton Street forming its north boundary, the road from Broughton Street to Camden House its west boundary, and the road from Elizabeth Street to Camden House its east and south boundary. Also as part of this deed two perches of land on the Camden Park Estate to the west of Camden House and south of Belgenny Farm was granted to the Church of England as the Macarthur family burial vault.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nSoon after the granting of this land the first burial of Thomas Budd of Narellan occurred in the cemetery in March 1843. The cemetery continued to grow from this period, but unfortunately no records are available about burials or grave locations for the first 40 years of its existence.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|16}}\n\nDuring the halt in construction work, Camden continued to develop at a fast pace with it expanding to 45 households by around 1846. This development was undertaken in the shadow of the incomplete shell St John's that promising so much picturesque beauty if it could be completed.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|10}}\n\nSome effort appears to have been undertaken in 1846 to completed the construction of the church when James Macarthur is reported to have ordered the stained glass windows from England. To ensure that they were of the correct size zinc templates were sent of the unique design with its tiny stained glass diamonds. Two of these windows (plus more in the tower) are still extant in the church today.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|50}}\n\nFurther work to complete the church had occurred by 1848 when it was suggested in the local press that the flooring had been laid and even perhaps the windows installed leaving just the interior furnishings, pulpit, seats, and chancel fittings, to be finalised. From early 1848 the church appears to have been used for marriages according to the parish register. Temporary measures to supply these furnishings and fittings appear to have been taken prior to June 1849 to allow the consecration of the church to finally be carried out. The consecration of St John's the Evangelist Anglican Church was performed by Bishop Broughton on 7 June 1849. The ceremony was attended by a congregation of around 500 people, including the Macarthur brothers, and the service was assisted by the incumbent Reverend Edward Rodgers and the clergy of the surrounding parishes (Rev. George F. Macarthur).<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|13, 17}}\n\nA contemporary account eloquently describes the church on its completion:<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14}}\n{{blockquote|''St John's consists of a nave, chancel and western tower and spire, all including the spire, being of brick, and at some future time to be covered with plaster. The spire is already stuccoed. The windows, which are of the \"decorated \" period, are exceedingly well wrought in the stone procured from the neighbourhood, which is of greyer colour and closer grain, though softer in the cutting, than the sandstone around Sydney. The flagging of the interior is the very best piece of work of the kind in the country. The roof is open, with tie-beams and spandrels. The windows are filled with fancy patterns of octagon and square glass, the former being ground, the latter coloured set in copper frames. The altar rail is carved with cinquefoil arches, on small shafts, with caps, bases and bands, in the style of the Church, and is of very effect. There is a want of porch and vestry, and the chancel is far too short.''}}\n\nAt the time of its completion St John's was considered to be large for the population of Camden and the surrounding estates. Its size was part of the Macarthur's vision, and providing for the future, for a large and thriving settlement at Camden that honoured Anglican morals and traditions.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|1}}\n\nThe original road that ran along the south border of the church lot was used extensively by the Macarthur family travelling from the town and the main south road to Camden Park House. It was closed around the time St John's was completed and consecrated.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|16}}\n\n=== The operation of St John's Camden ===\n\nThe Anglican Parish of Camden is thought to date to the period of the enactment of the Church Act in 1836-1837 and the early plans of James and William Macarthur to establish a church at Camden. With the Macarthur family acting as patrons for the new church and endowing the stipend of the clergyman they had the right of nomination of presentation of a parish under the provisions of the Sydney Diosecan Ordinance. However, an arrangement was made at Camden that the appointment of a minister was alternatively the decision of the Macarthur Family and the Bishop. The first incumbent of the parish of Camden (in conjunction with the parish of Narellan) was the Rev. Robert Forrest who was appointed in 1843. He had previously been the first headmaster of [[The King's School, Parramatta]] from 1832 and the minister of the parish of Campbelltown from 1839 to April 1843. Forrest resided at his property [[Elderslie, New South Wales|Elderslie]] and officiated at services at the Camden Park school-room and the Narellan school-church during this period. He returned to the King's School in January 1848.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|17}}\n\nForrest's replacement was the Rev. Edward Rogers who was appointed in early 1848 and was subsequently the minister at the time of St John's consecration in June 1849. He oversaw the first marriages that were performed in St John's. The first registered marriage was on 24 February 1848 between Robert Boyd of Camden and Augusta Sheather of Camden Park and the first following its consecration was in June 1849 between Thomas Dunk and Maria New of Camden. Rogers remained at Camden until 1858 when he was appointed to Holy Trinity, Sydney. The first churchwardens of St John's who worked alongside Rev. Rogers were James Macarthur, William Macarthur, and George Macleay. Over the following years they were replaced by both the main tradesmen who had been involved in the church construction: John Le Ferve in 1854 and Richard Basden in 1856.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11-12, 17}}\n\nThe Rev. Henry Tingcombe replaced Rogers in August 1858. He had previously been the minister of [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] from 1846. When the rectory was completed in 1859 he was its first resident and he remained in the parish until his resignation in October 1872.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|17}}\n\nAt the time of Tingcombe's resignation the arrangements for the endowment of the stipend for the parish were altered. The Macarthur family continued to contribute A\u20a4100 per annum to the stipend and provided the rectory on a nominal rent, but the local parishioners were now asked to contribute the remaining part of the stipend. With this arrangement the Bishop of Sydney granted his right of alternate nomination of the minister to the parish.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|17}}\n\nThe ministers appointed from this time were:<ref name=CMP/>{{rp|17-18}}\n*Rev John Fleming Moran 1872-1891;\n*Rev Cecil John King 1891-1927;\n*Rev Thomas Giles Paul - 1927-1943;\n*Rev Alfred Henry Kirk - 1944-1968;\n*Rev James Barry Burgess - 1968-1975;\n*Rev Alan Reginald Patrick - 1976-1988;\n*Rev Trevor William Edwards - 1989-1996;\n*Rev Steven John Davis - 1996-2000\n*Rev Anthony Victor Galea - 2001 to date<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nA critique of the completed St John's at the time of its consecration was that its chancel was too short for the preferred liturgy of the day as encouraged by the Tractarian movement. This movement required long chancels that could accommodate a choir and in which the raised altar was the focus of the congregation. This lack must have been felt by the congregation over the early years of the church's operation as in 1857 Sir William Macarthur decided to acquire plans for a chancel extension and vestry. Consequently, during his visit to Europe between 1855 and 1857 as commissioner of the NSW contingent to the Paris International Exhibition he commissioned the famous English Gothic Revival architect, Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] to provide a design. It apparently took some time for Scott to supply these plans and it appears that in the meantime Edmund Blacket was also commissioned to provide a design. No action seems to have been taken to implement either of these designs over the following years until the death of James Macarthur in April 1867 that led to a desire by the congregation to install a fitting memorial in the church for the life of the gentleman who had been so instrumental in its establishment and early management. The congregation, organised by Rev. Tingcombe, resolved to erect a memorial window, enlarge the chancel, and complete the church in James's honour. To this end they organised a subscription fund \"the Macarthur Memorial Fund\" in which the friends and relatives of James could subscribe funds towards this memorial. This resulted in the commissioning of a grand stained-glass window from Clayton and [[Bell, New South Wales|Bell]] later in 1867. However, when it became time to implement the chancel enlargement William and the rector, Rev. Henry Tingcombe disagreed about which plan to use. William preferring Scott's and Tingcombe Blacket's. This disagreement continued to at least 1872 before a compromise was reached and a mix of Scott's and Blacket's work was used. The separate vestry design that was implement is thought to be Blacket's work.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-39>[[Empire (newspaper)|''Empire'']], 18 June 1867:5</ref><ref>Kerr, 1983:19</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14}}\n\nConstruction work on the chancel extension and vestry must have commenced post-1872 with the bricks being sourced from the demolition of Thompson's former steam flour mill and store that was constructed in c.1843. Work on the extension was completed in 1874, but it was not until the 13 June 1875 the chancel extension with its window memorial to James Macarthur was finally opened by the Lord Bishop of Sydney.<ref>''[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]'', 26 June 1875:32</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-39/><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14}}\n\nSoon after the completion of St John's the need was felt for improved educational facilities in the budding township of Camden. Consequently, in 1850 moves were made to found a denominational school on the eastern corner of the church lot adjacent the intersection of Hill and Broughton streets. Funding was granted from the Denominational School Board for the school and the trustees of the local board, George Macleay, Rev. Edward Rodgers, and [[John Oxley]] sought about seeing to its construction. The foundation stone was laid by Bishop Broughton on the 1 July 1850, but tenders for the construction were not called until February 1851. The very neat brick school was soon completed and in remained in use until the denominational school was closed in 1879 after the establishment of the Camden Public School. The building was retained by the church for the next 25 years before its worsening condition prompted the parish to sell it and 1 acre and 11  perches of surrounding land in December 1906. Both the condition of the building and the need to raise funds to construct a new Church Hall appear to have played a part in prompting the sale of this corner of the original 1841 land grant for the church.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14-15}}\n\nThe need for a rectory at St John's was alleviated in 1859 with the construction of a brick rectory with stables and coach house. James and William Macarthur donated the A\u20a41,000 pounds for the construction of these building on lands belonging to the Camden Park Estate. As Rev. Henry Tingcombe was the Rector of the church at this time and he became the first occupant of the new rectory it has been speculated that Edmund Blacket was the architect for this building. This is because these gentlemen are known to have been associates and in later times were involved in the design of the chancel extension. The rectory consisted of a substantial Georgian style two-storey brick building with six-pane windows and shutters, as well as a front verandah. The Macarthurs appear to have seen to the upkeep of the rectory throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and continued to manage the surrounding land as part of the estate. However, it does seem likely that they permitted some of the surrounding land to be used for glebe purposes by the rectors.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14}}\n\nIn 1861 a new organ, specially constructed by Bates and Sons of Ludgate Hill, London, was presented to the church on the behalf of Emily Macarthur (who was in London at the time) to replace an older harmonium that was not of the best quality. Theodore Charles Bates was a well-known London builder of small finger and barrel organs. He operated from about 1812 to 1864 on his own, in partnership with others, and in partnerships with his son. A new gallery was constructed at the west end of St John's in 1861 to accommodate this new organ. This gallery was designed by Edmund Blacket and the organ had been fitted by the 21 July 1861.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-41>Rushworth, 1988:218-219</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\nElizabeth Macarthur (1840-1911), the only daughter of James and Emily Macarthur, married Commander R. N. [[Arthur Onslow (Australian politician)|Arthur Onslow]] (1833-1882) at St John's on the 21 January 1867.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-42>''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 21 February 1867:9</ref> Elizabeth, and to a lesser degree her husband, was to be a strong patron of the church throughout her life and she donated many fixtures to improve the church facilities.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe early 1880s witnessed the passing away of several older members of the Macarthur family. Emily died in 1880 and Arthur Onslow in early 1882 leaving his wife Elizabeth to raise their six surviving children. William Macarthur passed away on 29 October 1882 and his funeral service was held at St John's before he was interred at the family vault on the Camden Park Estate. As he had never married he left the estate to his niece Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow. Elizabeth had been managing the estate since the late 1870s due to William's failing health. Throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the next she and her children were to be strong friends and patrons of the church and its parish.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-6/>{{rp|16}}<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-43>Teale, 1974</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nIn 1897 Elizabeth Macarthur Onslow donated the turret clock and peal of eight ringing bells for the church tower to commemorate [[Queen Victoria]]'s diamond Jubilee. The majority of the bells were dedicated to different members of the Macarthur family (see description).<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nBy the late nineteenth century the church cemetery was nearing capacity and a new general cemetery at Cawdor was dedicated in 1898 to serve the community. The church cemetery was soon closed except for those who had purchased the right to burial or family vaults.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|16}}\n\nPlans to construct the first Church Hall were underway in 1905 to provide the parish with improved facilities after the deterioration of the old denominational school building. This hall was designed by Sulman and Power in the Federation Gothic style and the plans were approved by the Diocesan Building Surveyor Cyril Blacket (the son of Edmund Blacket) in February 1906. Sir [[John Sulman]] is known as an important late-nineteenth and early twentieth century Australian architect. The design consisted of a {{convert|50|by|30|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} hall with platform and two {{convert|15|by|25|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} retiring rooms at the south end and {{convert|10|by|9|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} porch at the front. The Bishop of Goulburn laid the foundation stone for the hall on the 29 July and construction commenced soon after. Funding came from three main sources: the Church Loan Fund, the Camden Park Estate, and other subscriptions and donations. The funds from the sale of the denomination school when it proceeded after 1906 was reportedly used to pay back the loan for the construction.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|15, 75}}\n\nAn Ordinance of August 1906 approved the sale of 1 acre, 11  perches of the original 1841 grant to the Anglican Church for the establishment of St John's. This reduced the grant area to the 4 acres, 3 roods, and 12  perches which is extant today. The rational for the sale of this land was the area was surplus to the needs of the church and the funds from the sale were necessary for the funding of the new hall which was already under construction. Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow consented to the sale and the auction took place in December 1906 and the land was sold for 300 pounds to Mr F.C. Whiteman. In 1925 the land was sold again and in 1926 the Masonic Lodge that still stands today was built on the site.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|33-34}}\n\nIn the early 20th century when the Parish was in some financial trouble due to a decrease in the congregation and the changing nature of the surrounding area (from agriculture to dairy farming) the Macarthur-Onslow family came to its assistance through the granting of additional land.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThis first resulted in the rectory being donated to the Camden Parish by George Macleay Macarthur-Onslow a church warden and active member of the congregation on behalf of the Directors of the Camden Park Estate Ltd at the annual vestry meeting of St John's parish in May 1905. This was so that the parish now had its own proper rectory, however, it required that the parish outlay funds for the upkeep of the property. It seems that previously the Camden Park Estate had paid for repairs, renovations, and other maintenance. Consequently, in November 1905 a 3-acre, 2 rood, and 3 perch property encompassing the rectory was transferred from the ''Camden Park Estate'' to the Anglican Church Property Trust.<ref>''[[Camden News]]'', 18 May 1905:1</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|33-34}}\n\nIn August 1910 the ''Camden Park Estate'' donated a further two pieces of land to the Parish: a 12-acre, 3 rood, 2 perch lot equal in width to the rectory and lot and extending from its south side to the Nepean River and a 2-acre, 2 rood, 22 perch lot, which is the modern day horse paddock lot between the rectory and church lots. Besides this they also offered for purchase the strip of land between the rectory and Mr Furner's paddock for 200 pounds. It does not appear that the parish accepted this offer at the time, but the two parcels of land that had been donated were transferred to the Church of England Property Trust from the Camden Park Estate in September 1911.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-46>''[[Camden News]]'', 11 August 1910:4</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|34}}\n[[File:StJohns&LychGate.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the church taken from Menangle Road with the lynch gate in the foreground, pictured in 2017.]]\nElizabeth Macarthur Onslow passed away while in England in August 1911. A memorial lych gate (which is extant) was installed on the church grounds in her honour the following year. The ''Camden Park Estate'' had been formed into a company a few years previously and her sons and daughters had been strongly associated with its running since they reached their majorities. Rosa Sibella (1871-1943) who had cared for her mother for some time now took over Camden Park House and the headship of the family. She was to be a good friend and patron of St John's over her lifetime and a leader in church and charity affairs. Captain George Onslow was strongly connected with civic and social life in Camden in this period and had been a treasurer of the parish council for some time, he was to be strongly connected with the Parish and St John's throughout his life. Upon his death in 1937 a memorial window depicting war and peace was installed in the nave.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-47>''[[Camden News]]'', 10 August 1910:5</ref><ref>''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 12 August 1937:7</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nIn July 1929, 7 acres, 2 roods, and 16 perches in a strip of land to the south of the rectory from Menangle Road to the Nepean River was transferred to the Church of England Property Trust from the ''Camden Park Estate''. This may encompass the land that the Camden Park Estate had previously offered to the Parish for 200 pounds in 1910. The land the Parish now owned facing Menangle Road to the south of the rectory was subdivided into building blocks and sold in 1932.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|34}}\n\nIn 1968 the remaining {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of glebe{{clarify|date=October 2019}} land located between the rectory and the Nepean River, as well as an additional five acres purchased by the parish, was subdivided and sold as a residential estate. This comprised 54 buildings lots around Forrest Crescent and Tingcombe Place, and Paul Place - streets named after the early ministers of the parish. Part of the original rectory lot was also subdivided at this time. The {{convert|12|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of flood prone land closest to the Nepean River was donated to [[Camden Council (New South Wales)|Camden Council]] and became the Kings Bush reserve. Today it is known as the Chellaston Street Reserve. The funds raised through this land sale were used to meet the operation costs of the parish and to fund the construction of a new church hall.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|34}}\n\nThe final building constructed in the church precinct was the second Church Hall. It was designed by the architects Martin and King and originally also included a kindergarten that has never been constructed due to a lack of funding. The foundation stone for this hall was set by Brigadier Richard Quentin Macarthur-Stanham (1921-2008) of Camden Park House on 24 September 1972. It was opened and dedicated on 25 March 1973 by the [[Anglican Archbishop of Sydney|Archbishop of Sydney]] Most Rev. [[Marcus Loane]].<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|15}}\n\n== Description ==\nThe following description has been sourced and summarised primarily from the Conservation Management Plan prepared for St John's Anglican Church Precinct,<ref name=CMP/> which provides a comprehensive physical description of the precinct's major elements and its wider landscape context.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== St John's Anglican Church Precinct ===\n\nThe St John's Anglican Church Precinct comprises the church, rectory, cemetery, two church halls and grounds that provide a rural landscaped environment to the group. The precinct is situated on St John's Hill, which is 134 metres above sea level and overlooks the township of Camden. St John's Anglican Church and its precinct was created to be the picturesque focus of the Camden region and today, it is one of the most complete parish church groups in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe precinct comprises three modern lots: the church lot comprising the remainder of the original 1841 land grant from the Macarthur family; the rectory lot comprising the remainder of the land donated to the parish from the ''Camden Park Estate'' in 1906; and the horse paddock lot that was donated to the parish from the ''Camden Park Estate'' in 1911. It is bordered on its east side by Menangle Road, by Broughton Street on its north side, Forrest Crescent on its south side, and the Alpha Road (Warner Estate) residential development on its west side.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe church lot features St John's Church, the two church halls, the cemetery, and churchyard. The rectory lot comprises the rectory, its associated stables, and grounds. The horse paddock lot between them is a rolling grassed open space that was formerly glebe land for the rector. It forms an important setting that accentuates the rural and nineteenth century characters of the church and churchyard and rectory and grounds.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== St John's Anglican Church ===\n\nSt John's Anglican Church is a town church featuring a large nave, chancel (extended in 1872-1874), vestry (added 1872-1874), and west tower with brick [[spire]]. It is considered to be the first archaeologically correct Gothic Revival church constructed in the Colony of NSW since it was mostly complete by 1843. It considerably differs from earlier churches in its competent and authentic decorated gothic design and its internal layout with the pulpit and prayer desk in the east end and the table in the chancel. This was considerably different from the previous centralised plans used in the colony (box-like). The hammer beam roof [[trusses]] with their carved tracery and mullioned windows with their stone tracery were authentic English decorated style detailing that were new to the Colony at the time. The spire and its features, engaged [[buttress]]es, correct moulding, and [[finial]], were correct to new Victorian Gothic Revival and likewise new features to the Colony. At the time of its completion the building was of a superior quality with a high standard of craftsmanship in its fittings. Its font communion rail, windows, and the enormous stone flagged floor of the nave are all of particularly fine craftsmanship.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nToday the church remains complete with its tower, spire, stained glass, and all its furniture all being in a good condition. The bare brick finish of the building imparts it with a rustic charm that, to the modern eye, intensifies its romantic qualities.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n==== Church exterior ====\n\n*Roof: Terracotta shingles ({{circa|1929}}); copper gutters and downpipes (1972).<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The roof was originally split timber shingles which were replaced in 1872 and again in 1901. The present terracotta shingle roof was installed in 1929. A series of four [[Gablet roof|gablets]] (two per side of the [[gable]]) were also constructed, likely during one of these re-roofing exercises. There was originally a stone cross atop of the channel arch gable which was dislodged in a severe storm in 1972.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Spire: Render on brick. The spire was rendered from the time of the completion of the church. This render was removed in 1973 and a new render applied. A ventilation opening to the south was made near the top of the spire in 1995.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Tower: Brick, buttressed with brick copings, stone coping at top - original.<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The brick tower has never been rendered. Historical photographs show wooden [[Louver|louvres]] fitted to the upper windows of the tower.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Walls: brick, presented as face. The bricks were burnt locally and a quality in the Camden clay resulted in a multiplicity of colours (National Trust visit, 23/10/01 - notes by Lucas, C.).<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The lower courses of the brick walls are currently suffering from rising damp which will require maintenance works in the near future.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Sills: Cement, re-rendered to approximately original detail {{circa|1995}}.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Windows: Stone frames and [[mullion]]s - original.

To improve ventilation through the church, strips were cut in the base of the timber window frames in 1899.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Base: brick - original.\n* Doors: Timber Gothic style, original cedar; finish: painted external; wood grained oak painted internal.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n===== Clock =====\nEarly photographs indicate that the openings for insertion of a clock face in the tower were part of the original building. The extant [[turret]] clock and peal of eight ringing bells were erected in June 1897 (Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee). They were ordered from England in 1896 by Mrs Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow. The clock is by Gillett and Johnson of Croydon, London, and the bells are by Meares and Stainbanks of Whitechapel, London. Installation of the clock was undertaken by F.W. Syer of North Sydney, and the bells were hung by J. D. Rankin of Camden, all under the supervision of Sulman and Power, architects. The clock was officially started by J. K. Chisholm on 21 June 1897. In {{circa|1950}}, electric motors replaced the manual winding mechanism for the striking of the bells. The original church bell was installed in 1859. It was relocated to St James' Menangle at the time of the installation of the present peal of bells.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe clock mechanism consists of three chains of wheels (one drives the clock, the others the striking and chiming apparatus) driven by three weights. The three dials are 6&nbsp;ft in diameter. The chimes are of the \"Westminster\" pattern. Of the eight bells, six are inscribed with the names of members of Mrs Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow's family in the ascending order of weight:\n# John and Elizabeth Macarthur\n# Children of John and Elizabeth Macarthur\n# James and Emily Macarthur\n# Arthur Pooley and Rosa Onslow\n# Arthur Onslow\n# Children of Arthur and Elizabeth Onslow\nThe tenor bell is inscribed with the doxology.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe clock and striking mechanism, bell hammers and clappers were restored {{circa|2004}}. They have been regularly serviced over the recent past, but are today in need of minor works as they are off time.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n==== Church interior ====\n\n===== Nave =====\n* Ceiling: Original beaded sarking boards, beaded [[rafter]]s, timber hammer beam [[truss]] and truss purlins and timber work to four roof vents in a [[quatrefoil]] pattern<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Cornice: Original moulded timbe\n* Walls: Original lime plaster, painted and grained paintwork to window mullions.

The organ loft and choir gallery were constructed at the west end of the nave. The design for this alteration was prepared by Edmund T. Blacket. The builder was John Le Fevre (a former church warden). The cost was met by public subscription. Stair to loft: Tasmanian oak [[stairs]] (1995). Originally access to the gallery was by stairs situated in the entrance area under the tower. This arrangement was removed in 1995 and new access stairs were installed within the nave to the design of architect R. Y. Stringer. Screen doors: Entry to nave; pair of Tasmanian oak glass panelled doors (1995).<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\n;Organ loft - fittings\nOrgan: The organ is labelled \"Bates and Son, organ builders Ludgate Hill London\". The organ is housed in a timber case in the Gothic style, of gabled towers with [[pinnacle]]s, and contains 17 false gilded pipes arranged 5-7-5. It has eight ranks to the manual and one rank to the foot pedals.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\nThe original harmonium was installed in 1850 on a platform which also accommodated the choir; located at the west end of the nave. The extant pipe organ was either built or rebuilt (Rev C. J. King in 1919 stated that it was second hand) by the London firm of T.C. Bates & Son, Organ Builders, 6 Ludgate Hill, London. The organ was selected by Dr E. J. Hopkins, organist of Temple Church, London, for Emily Macarthur. The purchase price was A\u20a4300. Theodore Charles Bates was a builder of small finger and barrel organs from 1812 through to 1864. In alterations, possibly undertaken early in this century, the Bourdon pipes were added for the pedals and the range reduced. This work was by organ builder, Charles Richardson. Further alterations were made in 1969 by the organ builder Arthur Jones.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\nExtensive restoration was commenced in 2000. Between 2002-2007 the organ was completely rebuilt by M. Da Costa master organ builder of Sydney who extended the keyboard compass back to the original [[G (note)|G]] below bottom [[C (note)|C]] with additional pipes.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\n=== Rectory and stables ===\n\nThe rectory of St John's, dating from {{circa|1859}}, is a thorough architectural essay in strict Georgian symmetry and discipline. Its plan form is four square about a wide hall. This is repeated for the first floor. The window and door openings are set out to give symmetrical elevations and internally doors face each other across the halls. The elevations are executed in fine face brick laid in true [[Brickwork|English bond]]. Large double-hung windows with divided [[Sash window|sashes]] and shutters are identical throughout the house. The windows are original, with double-hung sashes, each divided into a six panes, in a timber-box frame with a pair of louvred timber shutters. The quality and details of the house are refined but simple. All except two of the [[chimney]] pieces have been removed. The surviving joinery, [[cornice]]s and staircase are well built and finely executed examples of their period.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe original [[veranda]]h on the front of the building (its east side) was removed in the mid-1970s and replaced with a smaller [[portico]].<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-52>Macarthur Development Board, 1977:86</ref> This portico was later removed and the verandah recreated in 2003. A family room was added to the rectory sometime between 2004 and 2010.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nInternally, the rectory consists of a main and rear hall, sitting room, study, dining room, bedroom, sunroom, passage, service room, kitchen, laundry and lavatory on the first floor, and stair hall, four further bedrooms and a dressing room.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe stables are constructed in brick and originally provided for horse stabling, carriage and harness storage with feed loft. The building was reduced in length to enable access to church land subdivision in 1968 and for the creation of Forrest Crescent.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== Church hall (1906) ===\n\nThe Federation Gothic church hall is entirely as built in 1906 except for a partition one [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] east of the original stage proscenium. The roof is asbestos cement shingles with a perforated terracotta roof ridging and weatherboarding to the gable ends. The bell and its associated detail is intact. The hall has timber-framed doors and windows; the walls are face brick; the interior walls are painted print; the floors are timber and the ceiling is timber planked with exposed compound steel and timber trusses.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nDrainage works were undertaken to overcome structural cracking as some point between 2004 and 2010.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe site also contains a modern second church hall, dating from 1973, which was deemed not to be of heritage significance.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== Church Precinct Grounds ===\n\n==== Plantings ====\n\nThere are a group of exotic and native trees planted to the east and south of the church and within the terraced platforms of the cemetery. These trees are visible in photographs from the 1860s onwards:<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Mature kurrajongs (''Brachychiton populenus'') planted to the west of the 1973 church hall.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Clusters of conifers (''[[Cupressus funebris]]'' and ''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]'') planted throughout the grounds, also visible in photographs from the 1860s.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Mature bunyas (''Acaucaria bidwilii'') planted throughout the grounds providing a reference point within the surrounding landscape. Particularly large and locally prominent examples are situated to the east of the rectory.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Two large palms (''Jubaca chilensis'') planted to the east of the rectory. Many of the now mature specimens probably came from William Macarthur's nursery at Camden Park.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nOther mature trees immediately around the church include Mediterranean cypress (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]''), forest red gum (''[[Eucalyptus tereticornis]]''), kurrajong (''[[Brachychiton populneum]]''), Chinese juniper (''[[Juniperus chinensis]]''), oleanders (''[[Nerium oleander]] cv.s''), funeral cypresses (''[[Chamaecyparis funebris]]''), ''[[Photinia glabra]]'', Chinese elm (''[[Ulmus chinensis]]''), and brown pine (''[[Podocarpus elatus]]'').<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-53>Stuart Read, visit notes, 23/10/2001</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n==== Memorials ====\n\nThere are several memorials to benefactors within the precinct:<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n*Lych gate: The lych gate at the entry to the church grounds from Menangle Road was erected in 1912 as a memorial to Mrs Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow and restored in 2003.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*John Street entry: The flight of brick built steps and [[iron railing]]s leading up from John Street were erected in 1935. The cost of this work was donated by General J.W. Macarthur-Onslow. The electric light and copper fitting here is a memorial to Mr and Mrs James Waterworth.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Boundary fencing: Boundary fencing of pipe railing and other gates were erected in 1935. The cost of this work was donated by Mrs Faithful Anderson.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Sundial: The [[sundial]] was donated in 1953 by Mrs (Violet) G.M. Macarthur-Onslow. It had been at the Riley's Glenmore estate at Mulgoa since 1861, and at her property, Murrandah, Camden, since 1922. It was restored in 1996.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Columbarium: The Memorial Garden / Columbarium was erected in 1964 as a memorial to William Angilley. The Columbarium walls were further extended in 1986 in memory of Mark Kernahan and again in 1994.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n==== Other features ====\n\nThe major features, other than buildings, within the precinct are:<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Road formation: Situated to the east and south of the cemetery are the remains of a road formation, which is likely to be the road shown in nineteenth century maps of the area and photographs of the church. The road evidently provided an early route to Camden Park House.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Horse paddock: The sloping areas of land situated between the rectory and church is shown in nineteenth century photographs as cleared and open. It was separated from the church and cemetery by a substantial four rail fence. It was purchased by or donated to the church in 1911.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Tennis courts platform: Located to the west of the 1906 church hall is a platform which evidently is the remains of former tennis courts. This photograph is visible on 1940s photographs of the precinct.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Undulating topography: The church grounds possess an undulating topography framed by the three hills upon which the rectory, church and Masonic hall (site of former school) are sited.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Old path from the church hall to the church: The formation of the old path from the church hall of 1906 (and presumably before that from the old school) to the church is evident in a number of nineteenth-century photographs and cl940 aerial photograph.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Road from the lych gate to the church: The present-day road from the lych gate to the church closely approximates the same shown in early twentieth century photographs although the surface treatment is different.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Road from front of the rectory and leading to the stables: There are a number of old road formations and gates associated with the rectory and associated stables. The timber gate posts to the stables are comparable in detail to a gate to the church on Broughton Street shown in an early twentieth-century photograph.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Horse paddock and Cemetery gate: These are four nineteenth-century timber gate posts with cast irons caps.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== Cemetery ===\n\nThe modern cemetery covers an area of around {{convert|1|acre|ha|order=flip|spell=on}} across approximately six terraces ranged across the southern slopes of the church lot. It holds approximately 1600 grave sites and is scattered with and surrounding by various tree plantings. Since 1977 there has been an ongoing program of maintenance which ensures that the sites is not overgrown by vegetation. Between 1977 and 1987 a survey of the cemetery was undertaken that recorded all the grave sites. Further work has been undertaken in 1995 by a Land Environment Action Program team and in 1999 by a work for the dole program. Today sections of the cemetery are in poor condition and require maintenance, rebuilding, and interpretation.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|16}} <ref name=CMPAdd/>{{rp|25}}\n\n=== Regional landscape context ===\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct is an exemplary demonstration of the regional use of landscape design. St John's Anglican Church, with its tower and spire, dominates and commands the Camden landscape on its high prominence (St John's Hill) in the middle of what is a low-lying flood plain. Its tower and spire symbolically reach for heaven and point the way for the minds and souls of the local community. The church tower and spire, as well as other elements of the church precinct such as the rectory, are visible from many locations in the local landscape from Cobbitty to the north, Narellan in the east, Cawdor in the south, and Grasmere and Bickley Vale to the west. More distant views are also available of the church in the greater region as well. This effect on the local landscape is the result of a deliberate landscape design by the Macarthur family that was aimed both at creating picturesque vistas that reminded them of an English countryside, and reinforcing the social order the Macarthurs, as part of the ruling class, wished to uphold. St John's extraordinary command of the regional landscape ensures that it is visible from all the major roads, high points, and the seats of several of the major local estates. This command is expressed through 16 significant views and vistas in the regional landscape that is identified in the conservation management plan.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|35-36, 44}}\n\nThe most important of these many vistas are the two deliberately planned by the Macarthur family with the assistance of Sir Thomas Mitchell:<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n# The vista from the front carriageway loop of Camden Park House to St John's in the distance. Today the garden and plantings around the front of the house have been purposefully managed and arranged so that a break exists in the surrounding tree line (across the croquet lawn) which captures the picturesque vista to St John's across the landscape of the former estate. In this vista, St John's spire sits in front of the Blue Mountains range between the two distinctive peaks of Mount Hay and Mount Banks.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-55>Images 8</ref> This vista has earned the church the local quip \"built to the glory of God and to improve the views of the Macarthurs\".<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-56>Hill, 2016:505</ref> It is complemented by one of Camden Park House from the southern main entrance of St John's (however, this is no longer visible due to tree growth near the church). Further evidence of the deliberate planning of this vista is the fact that it aligns with the cross-axis of the township of Camden.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-56/><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n# The vista of St John's looking south and upwards along John's Street in Camden. This vista was deliberately planned by Sir Thomas Mitchell in his design for the township to demonstrate the moral authority and commanding presence of God, and the Anglican Church, over the hearts and souls of the community.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 20 September 2017, St John's the Evanglist Anglican church was in good condition and retains all its original fabric. It is well maintained by the Camden Parish and features only small sympathetic modifications to assist in the modern running of the building. Some elements of the building require conservation and maintenance works such as the clock and bells, roof, and walls (rising damp).<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The churchyard and grounds are well maintained and in good condition. The cemetery is well maintained but requires some conservation works to its older portions to prevent further subsidence of some graves and memorials. The rectory is in a fair-good condition but requires some maintenance works, especially to its roof.  The church hall is in fair condition, but has some issues with structural cracking due to subsidence. The church precinct has good integrity and intactness.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nOrgan: The pipes and mechanical action have been modified in places and added to over time, however the organ remains a substantially intact instrumental and is played regularly.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 6 November 2007, St John's Anglican Church Precinct was of state heritage significance as a group of ecclesiastical buildings set in a beautiful landscape setting consisting of mature and exotic tree plantings and open grassed slopes. The precinct's centre and focal point is St John's the Evangelist Anglican Church which is of state heritage significance as the first Gothic Revival church constructed in NSW that was correct in its medieval detail ('archaeologically correct'). This status, along with its strong connection to the 1836 Church Act, renders it an important early forerunner of the Gothic Revival movement which was to dominate ecclesiastical architecture in the Colony throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century. The church, and especially its tower and spire, is aesthetically significant to NSW as part of the regional Camden landscape created by the Macarthur family. St John's as an important regional landmark is a significant element in the picturesque landscape planning used to create the Camden Park Estate, the seat of the Macarthur family. As part of a triumvirate of significant points in the landscape, along with Camden Park House and the township of Camden, it also expresses the power structures the Macarthur family wished to instil in the local community they were creating in the early nineteenth century. This regional landscape design is of state heritage significance as an important example of early-mid nineteenth century landscape planning.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe entire church precinct has an important historical association with the Macarthur family of Camden. Each of the precinct allotments was donated to the Anglican Church by the Macarthurs and the family funded the construction of most of the buildings and patronised the operation of the church throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Ultimately, St John's Anglican church precinct is a remarkable, picturesquely located, and historic place of Anglican worship in a state context.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 August 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=GazetteNSW>{{Gazette NSW |title=NOTICE OF LISTING ON THE STATE HERITAGE REGISTER UNDER SECTION 37(1)(b)|issue=82|page=5544|date=24 August 2018|url=https://gazette.legislation.nsw.gov.au/so/download.w3p?id=Gazette_2018_2018-82.pdf|access-date=25 November 2019|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt John the Evangelist Anglican Church has historical significance at a state level as the first archaeologically correct Gothic Revival Church constructed in the colony of NSW and Australia as the Gothic Revival movement gained momentum in the early 1840s. The church thus has an important place in this movement that was to dominate ecclesiastical architecture in the colony throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century. The Gothic Revival movement was reflective of deep-running change in the Anglican Church during this period. St John's Anglican Church demonstrates the spread of these ideas to the Colony, following the trends of ecclesiastical architecture in Britain.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's Anglican Church is of historical significance at a state level due to its strong connection with the 1836 Church Act. This piece of legislation confirmed the colony as a religiously plural society and ushered in an unprecedented period of church building. St John's is one of the earliest extant churches built under this act. It is an important member of this group of early Church Act churches due to its Gothic Revival design, fine construction, picturesque location, and prominent part in wider regional landscape planning that renders it a remarkable place of worship.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct has an association of state significance with the Macarthur family. The Macarthurs have played significant roles in politics, social life, philanthropy, military life, and the development of wool growing, agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, and dairying in the colony of NSW. They are especially well remembered as the gentry that developed the Camden area as it is today with its wide open rural landscape and proud historic nature. The Macarthur family are directly responsible for the establishment of St John's and its associated church precinct as they donated the land on which it sits and provided much of the funding that saw the church, rectory, and many of the other features constructed. Many elements of the church precinct and furnishings of the church were also donated by, or are memorials to, members of the Macarthur family. In this manner, the church precinct and its regional landscape setting is a fitting memorial to the achievements of the Macarthur family in the development of the Camden region and the Colony of NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nAmong the generations of the Macarthur family that have been custodians of the Camden Park Estate there are several members who were closely involved with the establishment and running of the church precinct. The successful pastoralist and conservative politician James (1798-1867); his wife Emily (1806-1880); and the prominent pastoralist, horticulturalist, vintner, and benefactor of public institutions Sir William Macarthur (1800\u201382) were intimately involved in the establishment and construction of St John's and the early portions of its precinct during the mid-nineteenth century. Their successors to the Camden Park Estate, the philanthropist and dairy farmer Elizabeth (1840-1911) and naval officer and politician Commander R. N. Arthur Macarthur-Onslow (1833-1882), were also strongly involved in the further running and development of the church and precinct during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Their children the charity and church worker Rosa Sibella (1871-1943) and the soldier and grazier Brigadier-General George Macleay (1875-1931) were also involved in the same manner during the early to mid-twentieth century. The association between the family and the church precinct continued until at least 1972 when Brigadier Richard Quentin Macarthur-Stanham (1921-2008) laid the foundation stone for the new Church Hall. In this manner, almost all the diverse elements of the church precinct have some form of connection with members of the Macarthur family.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct has aesthetic significance at a State level as a fine group of ecclesiastic buildings with a cemetery located in an open rural landscape resplendent with mature native and exotic trees, rolling grassed slopes, fence lines, paths, and memorials. This open setting creates important interconnecting views and vistas between different elements of the church precinct, such as that between the church and rectory, that allows for their proper appreciation. On a broader scale this open setting complements St John Anglican Church, and particular its tower and spire, by opening it to a wider catchment of views and vistas across the regional landscape. This allows the church to be the focus of the great picturesque character of the region which is the result of the landscape design implement by the Macarthurs in their development of Camden. In the landscape design St John's is the pinnacle of the township and the apex of many important vistas. As such, it has an all-encompassing relationship with its landscape and has important inter-relationships with the Camden Park Estate, Camden Park House, and the township of Camden that expresses the power structures between these places.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's plays a key role in the picturesque landscape planning of the Camden Park Estate and particularly, Camden Park House. This is demonstrated by a picturesque vista of St John's available from the front carriageway loop of Camden Park House. It was part of the early design of the mansion and its surrounding countryside and it has been cultivated into the surrounding garden to the present by the Macarthur family. This vista features St John's tower and spire framed by the peaks of [[Mount Hay (New South Wales)|Mount Hay]] and Banks of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] range in the distance as its focal point. Its exemplary picturesque design is evident in the intricate details and variety in contains that are expressed in its contrasting textures created by the juxtaposition between nature and man-made structures and landscapes. This vista was deliberately planned to delight and interest the eye and mind of early nineteenth century observers and the medieval inspired design of St John's was a fitting centrepiece according to the dictates of the picturesque. This vista is reciprocated by a view of Camden Park House from the front steps of St John's Anglican Church.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's is an important part in the framework of power dynamics the Macarthurs embedded in their regional landscape design to reinforce the social structures they wished to perpetuate. This featured the Macarthurs as the ruling upper gentry; the Anglican church, patronised and guided by the Macarthurs, as the moral compass of the community; and the middle and working classes as the lowest social strata. This social structure is expressed firstly through the distant vista of St John's from Camden Park House as described above which demonstrates the relationship the Macarthur family wished to cultivate with the Anglican Church in Camden; one of patronage and firm guidance. It is secondly expressed in the relationship of St John's Anglican Church with the township design of Camden as envisioned by James and William Macarthur and put into effect by Sir Thomas Mitchell. In this design, St John's is purposely situated on top of a hill over the town that ensures that it dominates the local landscape. This design ensures that the church, and particularly its tower and spire, was a reminder to the community of the watchful presence of God and the Anglican Church. This effect was further accentuated by the commanding vista of St John's along John Street that was purposefully planned into the town design by Mitchell.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's Anglican Church has technical significance at a State level as the earliest, and one of the finest, examples of archaeologically correct Gothic Revival architecture in the state (and possibly nationally). This church embodies the aims of the early development of the Gothic Revival movement in the Colony. As such, it is a successful early example that was likely used as a precedent in the local Gothic Revival movement throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century.

Over the following five years small settlers began to establish themselves along the north bank of the Nepean River opposite the estate in accordance with the burgeoning of agricultural and pastoral interest in the area. During the term of Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph Foveaux Acting-Governor (1808-1809) several smaller grants were also made along the north bank to increase settlement. Governor Macquarie (1810-1821) soon after his arrival continued this trend granting the remaining land on the north bank. In this manner, by the mid-1810s the Cowpastures became a developing pastoral and agricultural area, but with Camden Park being the only main settlement south of the Nepean.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1>Atkinson, 1988</ref>{{rp|11-124}}\n\nBy 1815 Camden Park carried 4,500 sheep divided into flocks of between 350 and 500 that were each managed by a single convict shepherd. Three herdsmen also managed a herd of several hundred cattle. However, the only substantial building on the property was a woolshed. At this time the resident overseer was Thomas Hubert with the property being managed remotely by Elizabeth and Hannibal Macarthur.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|15-16}}\n\nThe granting of Macarthur's addition {{convert|5000|acre|ha|order=flip}} in 1822-1823 provided him with an additional four grants with which to extend Camden Park and in 1825 Macarthur also managed to secure the [[Cawdor, New South Wales|Cawdor]] grant ({{convert|10400|acre|ha|order=flip}}) based on the success of his wool scheme. These additions extended Camden Park to about {{convert|27333|acre|ha|order=flip}} in size bounded on its north and east sides by the Nepean River, on its west side by Mount Hunter Rivulet, and on its south side by higher ground.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|19}}\n\nThe absentee landlords began to move into permanent residency on their estates by the 1820s and this encouraged the Macarthur's to erect fitting housing at ''Camden Park''. Thus, in 1821 the weatherboard cottage \"Belgenny Farm House\" was constructed on the property. This farm became the home of James and [[William Macarthur]] when they arrived to oversee the running of the Estate. At this time the Estate was run by a workforce of nearly a hundred people of which the majority were convicts and the remainder ex-convicts. This included only three women. From this time the Macarthur brothers were the higher gentry of the area who with their considerable wealth and youthful energy began to see to the proper development and advancement of the Cowpastures in accordance with the ideas and improvements they had brought back from the continent. There was a vast social gulf between the Macarthurs and their convict servants on the Estate that was enforced by a range of overseers and upper servants and this contributed to their social standing in the community. Under their leadership the Estate was well run and organised partly due to their careful encouragement of well-behaved and industrious convicts and servants. Those loyal to the Macarthurs were well-looked after by the family. The movement of the Macarthurs and other owner families to the area at this time led to imposition of order and the ruling of the area from within its borders.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|17, 19-20, 23-24}}\n\nIn 1831, after John Macarthur had finally decided to make Camden the \"family seat\", he commissioned the architect [[John Verge]] to design a house of a stature suitable for one of the colony's leading and wealthiest families. The house was completed in 1835, shortly after John Macarthur's death in 1834. His sons James and William Macarthur took up occupancy in the new house, while their mother Elizabeth continue to reside at Elizabeth Farm in Parramatta, in which she had a life interest.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-3>Emery, 2016</ref>\n\nJames and William were intelligent and capable men and their interests and morals were to characterise the development of the ''[[Camden Park Estate]]''. Of the many things which they were fond of, such as theatre and history, they had a special interest in a well-made or picturesque landscape that could encapsulate and frame the works and lives of men and women. Consequently, during the early development of the estate they spent much time and money on developing the beauty of its landscape, which in time incorporated the township of Camden. James and William saw to the construction of three well-made and purposefully placed structures, St John's Anglican Church, Camden Park House, and the monument on John Macarthur's grave, that helped to form a triangular arrangement of subtle and elegant picturesque vistas. This was especially when they were contrasted with the intrinsic beauty of the surrounding \"natural\" landscape. Form the earliest trespasses of Europeans into this region they had considered the Camden landscape to be beautiful, almost a work of art, and satisfactory to the aesthetic notions of the time that valued the combination of the natural and the artificial (the works of man - [[anthropogeny|anthropogenic]]). Adapting or improving this original canvas with the works of men could only add to its beauty in the minds of the Macarthurs and their contemporaries.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|26-27}}\n\nBy the 1830s the Camden Park Estate had grown to {{convert|28000|acre|ha|order=flip}} through the addition of further grants including Cawdor and was arguably the greatest and most advanced mixed farm in NSW. Throughout the 1820s James and William had worked towards improving the quality of their wool production but had also diversified the estate so that it produced grain, meat, and dairy produce. This was aside from Williams development of a flourishing orchard, vineyards, and gardens for vegetables and horticultural experiments. With this diverse base the estate was in good financial straits, despite the fall of wool prices and drought during the late 1820s. Consequently, the Macarthur brothers could begin looking to consolidating their squirearchy at Camden and creating a social order to their liking (consisting of tenant farmers).<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-6>Ashton and Blackmore, 1987</ref>{{rp|4-6}}\n\n===The establishment of the Township of Camden===\n{{main|Camden, New South Wales}}\nThe construction of the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]] with a river crossing over the Nepean River along the north boundary of the ''Camden Park Estate'' in the early 1820s ultimately served as the goad for the establishment of a Township in the area. In 1826 this crossing was replaced by a bridge which more effectively opened up the land to the south for settlement and the mere existence of the bridge encouraged the development of a settlement. The fact that there were no major settlements along the Great South Road for considerable distances each way from the Cowpastures also encouraged the establishment of a police lock-up at Camden that could patrol the road and protect settlers against bushrangers.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|34-35}}\n\nConsequently, in December 1830 a group of local residents petitioned [[Ralph Darling|Governor Darling]] for the establishment of settlement, comprising a police station, court-house, goal, and church, near the Cowpastures Bridge. Darling liked this idea and began arranging for the establishment of a {{convert|320|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip}} township to serve as a local administrative centre. However, due to most of the land along the Nepean being a flood plain and nearly all of it also having been granted away the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] had no existing Crown Land on which to establish a township. The [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor-General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] recommended the land on the south bank of the Nepean on a rise close to the river being the most ideal choice, but this location was part of the ''Camden Park Estate''. As John Macarthur had not signed the petition and was not amenable to the idea of giving away any of his Estate for this purpose, the plan was shelved at this time.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|34-35}}\n\nJames and William Macarthur were of the same opinion as their neighbours that a township would be to the benefit of the district, but they were unable to change their father's mind. However, following John's death in April 1834 and their establishment as the official heads of the Estate they were able to re-commence the plans for a township. In the interval the government had chosen Campbelltown as the main administration centre in the southern districts, but this allowed James and William to develop their own private township in accordance with their own ideals. They were keen to promote public order (along with a keen social order) that reflected a spiritual one that could encourage and regulate the minds and souls of the people. To this end an Anglican church was to form the imposing and commanding centrepiece of their new township.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|35}}\n\nThe Macarthur brothers had the 8 hectare area for their township cleared during the winter of 1835. On this foundation they desired that the first building to be constructed should be a church. To this end they appealed to their neighbours and employees for assistance and subscriptions to fulfil this goal. James was the main force behind this scheme. He was more religious than William and convinced that religious progress was beneficial, but that it should not be forced on the lower classes by the gentry, but rather be the result of the combined effort and initiative of all classes. This was to encourage a collective and mutual dependence among the population that was in keeping with Christian teachings and tenets. In this way, James pictured this church as growing from the land from the combined effort of the people so that it could be a focus of their moral behaviour and a symbol of the inter-reliance of society for its common good. However, he still demanded that it be an Anglican church, in accordance with its status as the Established Faith, despite the fact that people of a number of different denominations resided in the area.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|35}}\n\nJames and William had amassed A\u00a3644 in subscriptions by September 1835 for the construction of an Anglican church. Of this total they had promised A\u20a4500, while their employees had offered A\u20a443, and their neighbours the remainder. This allowed them to write to the government outlining their plans for a township and offering a copy of the subscription list as evidence of the commitment of the local population. They envisioned that the town would include reserves for a police station and lock-up, courthouse, post-office, and for churches of the several denominations: Anglican, Catholic, and Presbyterian, that flourished in the area.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Government approved these plans and the Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell began the process of town planning in consultation with the Macarthur brothers in January 1836. In accordance with his ideals he designed Camden as being a rectangle with two crossing main streets near its centre: the one running east-west was to be the highway and the other (John Street) running north-south being a vista to the town's Anglican church. This church was to crown a hilltop overlooking the town and, specifically gaze down into the centre of rectangle and the commercial district. In this way, Mitchell designed the church to be a focus for the town, while also being above and beyond it. Mitchell characteristically liked towns to have axes, squares, and meeting places and he often used the natural landscapes of places, such as hills and valleys, to emphasize these features. Camden was a more simple example of this type, but this does not prevent it from being a successful and highly picturesque and commanding one.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|36}} <ref name=CMP>{{cite web |url=https://stjohnscamden.org.au/media/audio/St.%20Johns%20Camden%20CMP%20Final%20(Heritage).pdf |title=St. John\u2019s Anglican Church Precinct Menangle Road, Camden: Conservation Management Plan |author=Clive Lucas, Stapleton and Partners Pty Ltd |publisher=The Anglican Parish of St. John, Camden |date=March 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190305014644/https://stjohnscamden.org.au/media/audio/St.%20Johns%20Camden%20CMP%20Final%20(Heritage).pdf |archive-date=5 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|9}}\n\nDespite this beginning it was not until July 1841 that the town allotments were offered for sale at auction. At this time the population of the Camden Park Estate was around 200-300 and there were eight households and a post office in the township. There was also regular traffic along the Great South Road through the township. These inducements encouraged the sale of half of the 44 half acre township blocks but up for sale for high prices and the beginning of increased settlement.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-6/>{{rp|10}} <ref name=CMP/>{{rp|9-10}}\n\n===The construction of St John's the Evangelist, Camden===\n[[File:The church, Camden (2533271302).jpg|thumb|The church set in the streetscape, pictured {{circa|1900}}.]]\nDuring the early days of settlement of the Cowpastures, particularly after the 1820s when the landholders began to live in the area, religious services were undertaken through the employees and members of each estate coming together for prayers. Early in their residency at Camden Park it appears William and James organised these events with William at least occasionally conducting readings. By 1826 the Reverend Thomas Reddall, chaplain of St Peter's, Campbelltown began conducting services at [[Kirkham, New South Wales|Kirkham]] on the north bank of the Nepean. In March 1827 [[Thomas Hassall]] was appointed Chaplain of the Cowpastures and settled at Denbigh near [[Cobbitty, New South Wales|Cobbitty]] and he soon began his regular circuit of the properties and settlements within his parish, which included Camden Park.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|33-34}}<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Macarthur's plans for Camden and it crowning jewel - its Anglican Church - in late 1835 lucky coincided with the introduction of Governor Burke's Church Act the following year. This Act was designed to promote the buildings of churches and chapels and provide for the maintenance of Ministers of Religion. This Act offered pound for pound subsidies for the construction of churches of all the major denominations. In this manner it removed the de facto \"established church\" status the Church of England had enjoyed in the colony to this point by providing equal access to state funding for the major denominations. The subsidies were available for churches and rectories costing between A\u20a4600 and A\u20a42,000. These building had to be designed by a competent architect and be approved by the [[New South Wales Government Architect|Colonial Architect]] to be eligible for the subsidy. A subsidy of A\u20a41,000, towards the total cost of A\u20a42,500 of the church, was provided to the Macarthurs under this Act. The Reverend Thomas Hassall, [[Charles Cowper]] of [[Wivenhoe, Narellan|Wivenhoe]], James and William Macarthur, and [[George Macleay]] were appointed trustees of the church.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nWhile the 1836 Church Act provided substantial funds for church construction Bishop [[William Broughton (bishop)|William Broughton]] and the Anglican Church were hamstrung by the lack of competent architects in the colony to realise their dreams and ideals. Consequently, Broughton was initially forced to rely on James Hume to design the church. He commissioned Hume to design the church in the classical style in 1837. This design was initially accepted by Broughton, and assumedly the Macarthurs, but it was abandoned by late 1839 at the request of Emily Macarthur, James new wife, who objected to the classical design and preferred something in the Gothic style which was the current new vogue in England.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|46, 243}}<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\n[[James Macarthur (Australian politician)|James Macarthur]] had travelled back to England in 1836 and met Emily Stone (1806-1880) there in 1838. Emily was the daughter of Henry and Mary Stone. Henry was a civil servant (and later banker or their family had banking connections) and Mary was the daughter of Dr William Roxburgh a botanist with the East India Company. Emily had been born in India and she travelled to England in 1811. Soon after meeting James Macarthur she married him later in 1838. Soon afterwards they returned to the colony, arriving in March 1839. After returning to Camden Park, Emily became the first mistress of the new Camden House which had been completed in 1834-35.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nDuring the mid-late 1830s in England the gothic or medieval style of architecture was just becoming the new trend in ecclesiological architecture due to the works of the Tractarian movement and the Cambridge Camden Society.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Oxford or Tractarian movement, named after their publication \"Tracts for the Times\", was formed at Oxford in 1833 as a new school of churchmanship. Initially, it was an academic theological and historical movement focussed on ascertaining the rightful position and nature of the Church of England within contemporary society. It had been formed as a protest against the State and liberal pressure being directed against the Church of England at the time and was part of the Church taking stock of its purpose and mission. However, as it rapidly grew and was influenced by the Romantic Movement it morphed into a widespread affirmation of the spiritual and historical integrity and apostolic character of the Church of England. To this end it focussed on and insisted that the sacramental character of the Church be given proper reverence. The movement argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology. Overall, Tractarianism focussed on the Catholic heritage of the church and the apostolic succession, espoused that the liturgical emphasis should be on the sacraments, and was strongly opposed to any segregation in church based on social differentiation. At this time the liturgical emphasis of the Church of England was on the spoken word with the pulpit being the focus of attention and there was commonly social segregation through the use of rented pews for the wealthy and open galleries for the poor.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-22>Judd and Cable, 2000:29-30</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-24/>{{rp|25-26}} <ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-23/>{{rp|29}}\n\nTractarianism was, overall, a divisive movement, as among its supporters it generated much excitement, but at the same time it brought about resolute and firm opposition among its, often Evangelical, opponents. The nature of the movement to look towards the medieval past for inspiration led its liberal critics to label it as retrogressive and its Evangelical opponents as pro-Roman Catholic and a threat to the Protestant Church. Indeed, several of the movement's leaders seceded to the Roman Catholic Church.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-23>Lucas, Stapleton, and Partners, 2001</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Cambridge Camden Society, later the Ecclesiological Society, was originally established to study the design and execution of ecclesiastical ornaments and buildings. This organisation was closely allied with the Tractarian movement as their goal was to provide structural expression for the liturgical and doctrinal ideals they developed. In this manner they were attempting to reintroduce structural sacramentalism to the Church of England. They eventually settled on Gothic architecture as being the most fitting for church construction and promoted these designs in Britain and across her colonies. In accordance with their goals they had very stringent standards and design requirements for church architecture and church designs they approved. The society advocated an architectural form known as \"symbolic sacramentality\" which was a system where the material fabric of the structure was designed to symbolise or embody some abstract meaning and through which an expression of liturgy could be articulated structurally. In essence the society aimed to develop a style that could best embody \"both liturgical and architectural beauty without striving for effect\".<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-24>Elliot, 1995</ref>\n\nThis society aimed to implement the reformations of the Tractarian Movement through igniting a change in ecclesiological architecture in England. The favoured design or icon of the society ultimately came to be an idealised version of the 14th Century English country parish church and particularly the designs modelled after this type by its favoured architects in the 1830s and 1840s. This design stressed the proper definition and separation of the nave and chancel; the allocation of the chancel with fair proportions; the placement of the font at the entrance to the church; the addition of an exterior porch; the provision of aisles with the subsequent threefold division of the nave symbolising the holy trinity; the provision of an un-galleried nave furnished with open benches; the establishment of the chancel, sanctuary, and altar as the focus of the congregation through their elevation with steps (ideally three each); the sub-division of the chancel into a chorus cantorum and sacrarium; and the alignment of the church so that it faced east. Church design should also encourage the exclusion of the congregation from the chancel, which was only acceptable when receiving communion. A tower was not considered an essential element, but if provided should be at the west end or at the crossing of the church if it featured transepts. The most ideal Gothic style was the Decorated dating to between 1260-1360 (13th-14th Centuries) and building materials stone, or less so flints, with bricks only being used as an alternative when neither was available. In this manner a church should emphasise auditory and hierarchal values in its architecture. This design was in contrast to the traditional early nineteenth century style that featured high box pews, triple-decker pulpit, and a western gallery containing harmonium and choir.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-25>Kerr, 1977:105</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-24/>{{rp|25-28, 50-52, 145}}\n\nEmily Macarthur must have been fashionably up-to-date with the nascent Gothic Revival in England prompting her to ensure that the new Anglican church at Camden was constructed in the [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Victorian Ecclesiastical Gothic|Gothic Revival]] style. However, due to the lack of competent architects in the colony that could design buildings in this style (Edmund Blacket was not to arrive in the colony until 1843). Emily and James Macarthur were forced to have a British architect design the church. They chose the Scottish architect John Cunningham (1799-1873) who had a connection with Emily's family or the Macarthurs. Cunningham had been trained in the Edinburgh City Works Department, but after he established his own practice he mostly worked in the [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] area. During his career Cunningham designed a number of churches in Gothic and Romanesque styles.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nIt is slightly unclear at what point the decision was made to change the style of the Camden church from Classical to Gothic. It seems most likely that the decision occurred prior to the beginning of construction of the church. Emily and James likely convinced the other church trustees to change the style after their arrival back in Camden in mid-1839. They must have been successful by late 1839 when Hume was dropped as the architect, allowing them to send away for plans at this time. They then waited until the winter of 1840 before clearing the site and constructing the foundations (the church sits on bedrock) and they must have had the plans in hand by September when construction began in earnest. When the Macarthurs sent to England for plans they must have specified that they be the same dimensions as Hume's original plans, perhaps to ensure that the budget for the church was still applicable to the new gothic design. This would explain the similarity in the designs of the foundations of the two plans noted by many modern authors.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|46, 243}}<ref>Kerr and Broadbent, 1980:122-124</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nAs noted above construction work commenced on the church during the winter of 1840 with the levelling of the site occurring over two months. Construction of the brickwork commenced in September allowing Bishop Broughton to lay the foundation stone on 3 November 1840. During these works the Colonial Architect, Mortimer William Lewis served as supervisory architect. This was likely a result of the connection of the Macarthur family rather than Lewis fulfilling the terms of the Church Act requirements on the design and construction. Richard Basden was the local builder employed to construct the church. He supplied the 386,000 bricks used in its erection from his brickyard located on the southwest corner of the intersection of Argyle and Oxley streets. John Le Ferve acted as the carpenter and he constructed the brick spire, framing, and other timberwork. The ironbark that was used to construct the roof framing was provided by the Macarthur brothers who organised for it to be cut from the forest at Mount Hunter. The stone for the construction was sourced from Denbigh and the lime from quarries near [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]].<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|46}}<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11-12}}\n\nWith these arrangements construction continued apace during 1841 and by April 1842 the roof, tower, and spire (including its plastering) had been completed. Unfortunately, the depression now intruded on the construction work with a lack of funds preventing the final stages of construction, such as the installation of the stained glass windows and the furnishing and flooring of the interior. This was apparently due to the folding of the bank that held the funds for the church construction.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-28>{{cite book |author=Wrigley, John |date=8 August 2017 |title=pers. comm. }}</ref> With the loss of these funds the church could not be completed until replacement funding could be found and this was difficult due to the financial straits of the Colony and the Macarthurs. It is also possible that the depression caused the delay of the promised funding from the government under the Church Act.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-1/>{{rp|46}}<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|12}}\n\nBy the time the shell of the church had been constructed in 1842 its authentic gothic design was a new innovation in the colony and just ahead of the fashionable wave of the Gothic Revevial that was to wash over the community from the mid 1840s. In particular, the decorated gothic stone tracery of the windows and the open cusped hammer-beam roof of the church were entirely new features that subsequently became standard for Gothic Revival churches in the colony.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nWhile construction had been underway the 5 acre, 3 rood, and 24 perch land grant for St John's Church had been formally granted to the Anglican Church through Bishop Broughton in May 1841 by James and William Macarthur. This land was reserved strictly for \"the erection of a church or chapel for the performance of divine worship according to the rites of the United Church of England and Ireland (and) for the erection of a residence for a clergyman in holy orders, and for a burial ground according to the use of the said United Church.\" The grant was triangular and positioned on the south side of the town with Broughton Street forming its north boundary, the road from Broughton Street to Camden House its west boundary, and the road from Elizabeth Street to Camden House its east and south boundary. Also as part of this deed two perches of land on the Camden Park Estate to the west of Camden House and south of Belgenny Farm was granted to the Church of England as the Macarthur family burial vault.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11}}\n\nSoon after the granting of this land the first burial of Thomas Budd of Narellan occurred in the cemetery in March 1843. The cemetery continued to grow from this period, but unfortunately no records are available about burials or grave locations for the first 40 years of its existence.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|16}}\n\nDuring the halt in construction work, Camden continued to develop at a fast pace with it expanding to 45 households by around 1846. This development was undertaken in the shadow of the incomplete shell St John's that promising so much picturesque beauty if it could be completed.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|10}}\n\nSome effort appears to have been undertaken in 1846 to completed the construction of the church when James Macarthur is reported to have ordered the stained glass windows from England. To ensure that they were of the correct size zinc templates were sent of the unique design with its tiny stained glass diamonds. Two of these windows (plus more in the tower) are still extant in the church today.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|50}}\n\nFurther work to complete the church had occurred by 1848 when it was suggested in the local press that the flooring had been laid and even perhaps the windows installed leaving just the interior furnishings, pulpit, seats, and chancel fittings, to be finalised. From early 1848 the church appears to have been used for marriages according to the parish register. Temporary measures to supply these furnishings and fittings appear to have been taken prior to June 1849 to allow the consecration of the church to finally be carried out. The consecration of St John's the Evangelist Anglican Church was performed by Bishop Broughton on 7 June 1849. The ceremony was attended by a congregation of around 500 people, including the Macarthur brothers, and the service was assisted by the incumbent Reverend Edward Rodgers and the clergy of the surrounding parishes (Rev. George F. Macarthur).<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|13, 17}}\n\nA contemporary account eloquently describes the church on its completion:<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14}}\n{{blockquote|''St John's consists of a nave, chancel and western tower and spire, all including the spire, being of brick, and at some future time to be covered with plaster. The spire is already stuccoed. The windows, which are of the \"decorated \" period, are exceedingly well wrought in the stone procured from the neighbourhood, which is of greyer colour and closer grain, though softer in the cutting, than the sandstone around Sydney. The flagging of the interior is the very best piece of work of the kind in the country. The roof is open, with tie-beams and spandrels. The windows are filled with fancy patterns of octagon and square glass, the former being ground, the latter coloured set in copper frames. The altar rail is carved with cinquefoil arches, on small shafts, with caps, bases and bands, in the style of the Church, and is of very effect. There is a want of porch and vestry, and the chancel is far too short.''}}\n\nAt the time of its completion St John's was considered to be large for the population of Camden and the surrounding estates. Its size was part of the Macarthur's vision, and providing for the future, for a large and thriving settlement at Camden that honoured Anglican morals and traditions.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|1}}\n\nThe original road that ran along the south border of the church lot was used extensively by the Macarthur family travelling from the town and the main south road to Camden Park House. It was closed around the time St John's was completed and consecrated.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|16}}\n\n=== The operation of St John's Camden ===\n\nThe Anglican Parish of Camden is thought to date to the period of the enactment of the Church Act in 1836-1837 and the early plans of James and William Macarthur to establish a church at Camden. With the Macarthur family acting as patrons for the new church and endowing the stipend of the clergyman they had the right of nomination of presentation of a parish under the provisions of the Sydney Diosecan Ordinance. However, an arrangement was made at Camden that the appointment of a minister was alternatively the decision of the Macarthur Family and the Bishop. The first incumbent of the parish of Camden (in conjunction with the parish of Narellan) was the Rev. Robert Forrest who was appointed in 1843. He had previously been the first headmaster of [[The King's School, Parramatta]] from 1832 and the minister of the parish of Campbelltown from 1839 to April 1843. Forrest resided at his property [[Elderslie, New South Wales|Elderslie]] and officiated at services at the Camden Park school-room and the Narellan school-church during this period. He returned to the King's School in January 1848.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|17}}\n\nForrest's replacement was the Rev. Edward Rogers who was appointed in early 1848 and was subsequently the minister at the time of St John's consecration in June 1849. He oversaw the first marriages that were performed in St John's. The first registered marriage was on 24 February 1848 between Robert Boyd of Camden and Augusta Sheather of Camden Park and the first following its consecration was in June 1849 between Thomas Dunk and Maria New of Camden. Rogers remained at Camden until 1858 when he was appointed to Holy Trinity, Sydney. The first churchwardens of St John's who worked alongside Rev. Rogers were James Macarthur, William Macarthur, and George Macleay. Over the following years they were replaced by both the main tradesmen who had been involved in the church construction: John Le Ferve in 1854 and Richard Basden in 1856.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|11-12, 17}}\n\nThe Rev. Henry Tingcombe replaced Rogers in August 1858. He had previously been the minister of [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] from 1846. When the rectory was completed in 1859 he was its first resident and he remained in the parish until his resignation in October 1872.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|17}}\n\nAt the time of Tingcombe's resignation the arrangements for the endowment of the stipend for the parish were altered. The Macarthur family continued to contribute A\u20a4100 per annum to the stipend and provided the rectory on a nominal rent, but the local parishioners were now asked to contribute the remaining part of the stipend. With this arrangement the Bishop of Sydney granted his right of alternate nomination of the minister to the parish.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|17}}\n\nThe ministers appointed from this time were:<ref name=CMP/>{{rp|17-18}}\n*Rev John Fleming Moran 1872-1891;\n*Rev Cecil John King 1891-1927;\n*Rev Thomas Giles Paul - 1927-1943;\n*Rev Alfred Henry Kirk - 1944-1968;\n*Rev James Barry Burgess - 1968-1975;\n*Rev Alan Reginald Patrick - 1976-1988;\n*Rev Trevor William Edwards - 1989-1996;\n*Rev Steven John Davis - 1996-2000\n*Rev Anthony Victor Galea - 2001 to date<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nA critique of the completed St John's at the time of its consecration was that its chancel was too short for the preferred liturgy of the day as encouraged by the Tractarian movement. This movement required long chancels that could accommodate a choir and in which the raised altar was the focus of the congregation. This lack must have been felt by the congregation over the early years of the church's operation as in 1857 Sir William Macarthur decided to acquire plans for a chancel extension and vestry. Consequently, during his visit to Europe between 1855 and 1857 as commissioner of the NSW contingent to the Paris International Exhibition he commissioned the famous English Gothic Revival architect, Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]] to provide a design. It apparently took some time for Scott to supply these plans and it appears that in the meantime Edmund Blacket was also commissioned to provide a design. No action seems to have been taken to implement either of these designs over the following years until the death of James Macarthur in April 1867 that led to a desire by the congregation to install a fitting memorial in the church for the life of the gentleman who had been so instrumental in its establishment and early management. The congregation, organised by Rev. Tingcombe, resolved to erect a memorial window, enlarge the chancel, and complete the church in James's honour. To this end they organised a subscription fund \"the Macarthur Memorial Fund\" in which the friends and relatives of James could subscribe funds towards this memorial. This resulted in the commissioning of a grand stained-glass window from Clayton and [[Bell, New South Wales|Bell]] later in 1867. However, when it became time to implement the chancel enlargement William and the rector, Rev. Henry Tingcombe disagreed about which plan to use. William preferring Scott's and Tingcombe Blacket's. This disagreement continued to at least 1872 before a compromise was reached and a mix of Scott's and Blacket's work was used. The separate vestry design that was implement is thought to be Blacket's work.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-39>[[Empire (newspaper)|''Empire'']], 18 June 1867:5</ref><ref>Kerr, 1983:19</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14}}\n\nConstruction work on the chancel extension and vestry must have commenced post-1872 with the bricks being sourced from the demolition of Thompson's former steam flour mill and store that was constructed in c.1843. Work on the extension was completed in 1874, but it was not until the 13 June 1875 the chancel extension with its window memorial to James Macarthur was finally opened by the Lord Bishop of Sydney.<ref>''[[Australian Town and Country Journal]]'', 26 June 1875:32</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-39/><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14}}\n\nSoon after the completion of St John's the need was felt for improved educational facilities in the budding township of Camden. Consequently, in 1850 moves were made to found a denominational school on the eastern corner of the church lot adjacent the intersection of Hill and Broughton streets. Funding was granted from the Denominational School Board for the school and the trustees of the local board, George Macleay, Rev. Edward Rodgers, and [[John Oxley]] sought about seeing to its construction. The foundation stone was laid by Bishop Broughton on the 1 July 1850, but tenders for the construction were not called until February 1851. The very neat brick school was soon completed and in remained in use until the denominational school was closed in 1879 after the establishment of the Camden Public School. The building was retained by the church for the next 25 years before its worsening condition prompted the parish to sell it and 1 acre and 11  perches of surrounding land in December 1906. Both the condition of the building and the need to raise funds to construct a new Church Hall appear to have played a part in prompting the sale of this corner of the original 1841 land grant for the church.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14-15}}\n\nThe need for a rectory at St John's was alleviated in 1859 with the construction of a brick rectory with stables and coach house. James and William Macarthur donated the A\u20a41,000 pounds for the construction of these building on lands belonging to the Camden Park Estate. As Rev. Henry Tingcombe was the Rector of the church at this time and he became the first occupant of the new rectory it has been speculated that Edmund Blacket was the architect for this building. This is because these gentlemen are known to have been associates and in later times were involved in the design of the chancel extension. The rectory consisted of a substantial Georgian style two-storey brick building with six-pane windows and shutters, as well as a front verandah. The Macarthurs appear to have seen to the upkeep of the rectory throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and continued to manage the surrounding land as part of the estate. However, it does seem likely that they permitted some of the surrounding land to be used for glebe purposes by the rectors.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|14}}\n\nIn 1861 a new organ, specially constructed by Bates and Sons of Ludgate Hill, London, was presented to the church on the behalf of Emily Macarthur (who was in London at the time) to replace an older harmonium that was not of the best quality. Theodore Charles Bates was a well-known London builder of small finger and barrel organs. He operated from about 1812 to 1864 on his own, in partnership with others, and in partnerships with his son. A new gallery was constructed at the west end of St John's in 1861 to accommodate this new organ. This gallery was designed by Edmund Blacket and the organ had been fitted by the 21 July 1861.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-41>Rushworth, 1988:218-219</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\nElizabeth Macarthur (1840-1911), the only daughter of James and Emily Macarthur, married Commander R. N. [[Arthur Onslow (Australian politician)|Arthur Onslow]] (1833-1882) at St John's on the 21 January 1867.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-42>''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 21 February 1867:9</ref> Elizabeth, and to a lesser degree her husband, was to be a strong patron of the church throughout her life and she donated many fixtures to improve the church facilities.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe early 1880s witnessed the passing away of several older members of the Macarthur family. Emily died in 1880 and Arthur Onslow in early 1882 leaving his wife Elizabeth to raise their six surviving children. William Macarthur passed away on 29 October 1882 and his funeral service was held at St John's before he was interred at the family vault on the Camden Park Estate. As he had never married he left the estate to his niece Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow. Elizabeth had been managing the estate since the late 1870s due to William's failing health. Throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century and into the next she and her children were to be strong friends and patrons of the church and its parish.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-6/>{{rp|16}}<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-43>Teale, 1974</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nIn 1897 Elizabeth Macarthur Onslow donated the turret clock and peal of eight ringing bells for the church tower to commemorate [[Queen Victoria]]'s diamond Jubilee. The majority of the bells were dedicated to different members of the Macarthur family (see description).<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nBy the late nineteenth century the church cemetery was nearing capacity and a new general cemetery at Cawdor was dedicated in 1898 to serve the community. The church cemetery was soon closed except for those who had purchased the right to burial or family vaults.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|16}}\n\nPlans to construct the first Church Hall were underway in 1905 to provide the parish with improved facilities after the deterioration of the old denominational school building. This hall was designed by Sulman and Power in the Federation Gothic style and the plans were approved by the Diocesan Building Surveyor Cyril Blacket (the son of Edmund Blacket) in February 1906. Sir [[John Sulman]] is known as an important late-nineteenth and early twentieth century Australian architect. The design consisted of a {{convert|50|by|30|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} hall with platform and two {{convert|15|by|25|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} retiring rooms at the south end and {{convert|10|by|9|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} porch at the front. The Bishop of Goulburn laid the foundation stone for the hall on the 29 July and construction commenced soon after. Funding came from three main sources: the Church Loan Fund, the Camden Park Estate, and other subscriptions and donations. The funds from the sale of the denomination school when it proceeded after 1906 was reportedly used to pay back the loan for the construction.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|15, 75}}\n\nAn Ordinance of August 1906 approved the sale of 1 acre, 11  perches of the original 1841 grant to the Anglican Church for the establishment of St John's. This reduced the grant area to the 4 acres, 3 roods, and 12  perches which is extant today. The rational for the sale of this land was the area was surplus to the needs of the church and the funds from the sale were necessary for the funding of the new hall which was already under construction. Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow consented to the sale and the auction took place in December 1906 and the land was sold for 300 pounds to Mr F.C. Whiteman. In 1925 the land was sold again and in 1926 the Masonic Lodge that still stands today was built on the site.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|33-34}}\n\nIn the early 20th century when the Parish was in some financial trouble due to a decrease in the congregation and the changing nature of the surrounding area (from agriculture to dairy farming) the Macarthur-Onslow family came to its assistance through the granting of additional land.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThis first resulted in the rectory being donated to the Camden Parish by George Macleay Macarthur-Onslow a church warden and active member of the congregation on behalf of the Directors of the Camden Park Estate Ltd at the annual vestry meeting of St John's parish in May 1905. This was so that the parish now had its own proper rectory, however, it required that the parish outlay funds for the upkeep of the property. It seems that previously the Camden Park Estate had paid for repairs, renovations, and other maintenance. Consequently, in November 1905 a 3-acre, 2 rood, and 3 perch property encompassing the rectory was transferred from the ''Camden Park Estate'' to the Anglican Church Property Trust.<ref>''[[Camden News]]'', 18 May 1905:1</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|33-34}}\n\nIn August 1910 the ''Camden Park Estate'' donated a further two pieces of land to the Parish: a 12-acre, 3 rood, 2 perch lot equal in width to the rectory and lot and extending from its south side to the Nepean River and a 2-acre, 2 rood, 22 perch lot, which is the modern day horse paddock lot between the rectory and church lots. Besides this they also offered for purchase the strip of land between the rectory and Mr Furner's paddock for 200 pounds. It does not appear that the parish accepted this offer at the time, but the two parcels of land that had been donated were transferred to the Church of England Property Trust from the Camden Park Estate in September 1911.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-46>''[[Camden News]]'', 11 August 1910:4</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|34}}\n[[File:StJohns&LychGate.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the church taken from Menangle Road with the lynch gate in the foreground, pictured in 2017.]]\nElizabeth Macarthur Onslow passed away while in England in August 1911. A memorial lych gate (which is extant) was installed on the church grounds in her honour the following year. The ''Camden Park Estate'' had been formed into a company a few years previously and her sons and daughters had been strongly associated with its running since they reached their majorities. Rosa Sibella (1871-1943) who had cared for her mother for some time now took over Camden Park House and the headship of the family. She was to be a good friend and patron of St John's over her lifetime and a leader in church and charity affairs. Captain George Onslow was strongly connected with civic and social life in Camden in this period and had been a treasurer of the parish council for some time, he was to be strongly connected with the Parish and St John's throughout his life. Upon his death in 1937 a memorial window depicting war and peace was installed in the nave.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-47>''[[Camden News]]'', 10 August 1910:5</ref><ref>''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 12 August 1937:7</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nIn July 1929, 7 acres, 2 roods, and 16 perches in a strip of land to the south of the rectory from Menangle Road to the Nepean River was transferred to the Church of England Property Trust from the ''Camden Park Estate''. This may encompass the land that the Camden Park Estate had previously offered to the Parish for 200 pounds in 1910. The land the Parish now owned facing Menangle Road to the south of the rectory was subdivided into building blocks and sold in 1932.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|34}}\n\nIn 1968 the remaining {{convert|20|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of glebe{{clarify|date=October 2019}} land located between the rectory and the Nepean River, as well as an additional five acres purchased by the parish, was subdivided and sold as a residential estate. This comprised 54 buildings lots around Forrest Crescent and Tingcombe Place, and Paul Place - streets named after the early ministers of the parish. Part of the original rectory lot was also subdivided at this time. The {{convert|12|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} of flood prone land closest to the Nepean River was donated to [[Camden Council (New South Wales)|Camden Council]] and became the Kings Bush reserve. Today it is known as the Chellaston Street Reserve. The funds raised through this land sale were used to meet the operation costs of the parish and to fund the construction of a new church hall.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|34}}\n\nThe final building constructed in the church precinct was the second Church Hall. It was designed by the architects Martin and King and originally also included a kindergarten that has never been constructed due to a lack of funding. The foundation stone for this hall was set by Brigadier Richard Quentin Macarthur-Stanham (1921-2008) of Camden Park House on 24 September 1972. It was opened and dedicated on 25 March 1973 by the [[Anglican Archbishop of Sydney|Archbishop of Sydney]] Most Rev. [[Marcus Loane]].<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|15}}\n\n== Description ==\nThe following description has been sourced and summarised primarily from the Conservation Management Plan prepared for St John's Anglican Church Precinct,<ref name=CMP/> which provides a comprehensive physical description of the precinct's major elements and its wider landscape context.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== St John's Anglican Church Precinct ===\n\nThe St John's Anglican Church Precinct comprises the church, rectory, cemetery, two church halls and grounds that provide a rural landscaped environment to the group. The precinct is situated on St John's Hill, which is 134 metres above sea level and overlooks the township of Camden. St John's Anglican Church and its precinct was created to be the picturesque focus of the Camden region and today, it is one of the most complete parish church groups in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe precinct comprises three modern lots: the church lot comprising the remainder of the original 1841 land grant from the Macarthur family; the rectory lot comprising the remainder of the land donated to the parish from the ''Camden Park Estate'' in 1906; and the horse paddock lot that was donated to the parish from the ''Camden Park Estate'' in 1911. It is borded on its east side by Menangle Road, by Broughton Street on its north side, Forrest Crescent on its south side, and the Alpha Road (Warner Estate) residential development on its west side.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe church lot features St John's Church, the two church halls, the cemetery, and churchyard. The rectory lot comprises the rectory, its associated stables, and grounds. The horse paddock lot between them is a rolling grassed open space that was formerly glebe land for the rector. It forms an important setting that accentuates the rural and nineteenth century characters of the church and churchyard and rectory and grounds.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== St John's Anglican Church ===\n\nSt John's Anglican Church is a town church featuring a large nave, chancel (extended in 1872-1874), vestry (added 1872-1874), and west tower with brick [[spire]]. It is considered to be the first archaeologically correct Gothic Revival church constructed in the Colony of NSW since it was mostly complete by 1843. It considerably differs from earlier churches in its competent and authentic decorated gothic design and its internal layout with the pulpit and prayer desk in the east end and the table in the chancel. This was considerably different from the previous centralised plans used in the colony (box-like). The hammer beam roof [[trusses]] with their carved tracery and mullioned windows with their stone tracery were authentic English decorated style detailing that were new to the Colony at the time. The spire and its features, engaged [[buttress]]es, correct moulding, and [[finial]], were correct to new Victorian Gothic Revival and likewise new features to the Colony. At the time of its completion the building was of a superior quality with a high standard of craftsmanship in its fittings. Its font communion rail, windows, and the enormous stone flagged floor of the nave are all of particularly fine craftsmanship.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nToday the church remains complete with its tower, spire, stained glass, and all its furniture all being in a good condition. The bare brick finish of the building imparts it with a rustic charm that, to the modern eye, intensifies its romantic qualities.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n==== Church exterior ====\n\n*Roof: Terracotta shingles ({{circa|1929}}); copper gutters and downpipes (1972).<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The roof was originally split timber shingles which were replaced in 1872 and again in 1901. The present terracotta shingle roof was installed in 1929. A series of four [[Gablet roof|gablets]] (two per side of the [[gable]]) were also constructed, likely during one of these re-roofing exercises. There was originally a stone cross atop of the channel arch gable which was dislodged in a severe storm in 1972.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Spire: Render on brick. The spire was rendered from the time of the completion of the church. This render was removed in 1973 and a new render applied. A ventilation opening to the south was made near the top of the spire in 1995.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Tower: Brick, buttressed with brick copings, stone coping at top - original.<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The brick tower has never been rendered. Historical photographs show wooden [[Louver|louvres]] fitted to the upper windows of the tower.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Walls: brick, presented as face. The bricks were burnt locally and a quality in the Camden clay resulted in a multiplicity of colours (National Trust visit, 23/10/01 - notes by Lucas, C.).<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The lower courses of the brick walls are currently suffering from rising damp which will require maintenance works in the near future.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Sills: Cement, re-rendered to approximately original detail {{circa|1995}}.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Windows: Stone frames and [[mullion]]s - original. Rendered reveals {{circa|1973}}.<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The [[sandstone]] for the frames and mullions was procured locally and is greyer, closer in grain and softer in cutting than Sydney sandstone.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=LucasC>{{cite book |author=Lucas, C. |title=National Trust visit |date=23 October 2001 |edition=Notes }}</ref> Early photographs indicate that the window reveals were rendered. This render was removed in 1973 and new render applied. To improve ventilation through the church, strips were cut in the base of the timber window frames in 1899.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Base: brick - original.\n* Doors: Timber Gothic style, original cedar; finish: painted external; wood grained oak painted internal.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n===== Clock =====\nEarly photographs indicate that the openings for insertion of a clock face in the tower were part of the original building. The extant [[turret]] clock and peal of eight ringing bells were erected in June 1897 (Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee). They were ordered from England in 1896 by Mrs Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow. The clock is by Gillett and Johnson of Croydon, London, and the bells are by Meares and Stainbanks of Whitechapel, London. Installation of the clock was undertaken by F.W. Syer of North Sydney, and the bells were hung by J. D. Rankin of Camden, all under the supervision of Sulman and Power, architects. The clock was officially started by J. K. Chisholm on 21 June 1897. In {{circa|1950}}, electric motors replaced the manual winding mechanism for the striking of the bells. The original church bell was installed in 1859. It was relocated to St James' Menangle at the time of the installation of the present peal of bells.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe clock mechanism consists of three chains of wheels (one drives the clock, the others the striking and chiming apparatus) driven by three weights. The three dials are 6&nbsp;ft in diameter. The chimes are of the \"Westminster\" pattern. Of the eight bells, six are inscribed with the names of members of Mrs Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow's family in the ascending order of weight:\n# John and Elizabeth Macarthur\n# Children of John and Elizabeth Macarthur\n# James and Emily Macarthur\n# Arthur Pooley and Rosa Onslow\n# Arthur Onslow\n# Children of Arthur and Elizabeth Onslow\nThe tenor bell is inscribed with the doxology.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe clock and striking mechanism, bell hammers and clappers were restored {{circa|2004}}. They have been regularly serviced over the recent past, but are today in need of minor works as they are off time.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n==== Church interior ====\n\n===== Nave =====\n* Ceiling: Original beaded sarking boards, beaded [[rafter]]s, timber hammer beam [[truss]] and truss purlins and timber work to four roof vents in a [[quatrefoil]] pattern<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Cornice: Original moulded timbe\n* Walls: Original lime plaster, painted and grained paintwork to window mullions. Existing colour scheme in plain cream dates from the 1970s.

Margin of {{convert|305|mm}} at the east end. Three stone steps with chamfered nosings lead into the chancel. The diagonal paving gives way to two squared areas on either side of a central [[aisle]], possibly related to the font. Fixing points are evident for fixtures at the east end. William Buchan laid the original floor flagging (and similarly the window tracery and font).<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n====== Nave fittings ======\n* Pews and choir stalls: The polished cedar pews and stalls are of three generations. The first pews were provided by Bishop Broughton. The replacement (extant) seats were obtained at various times. Removable seat and back upholstery added to the main central block of pews in 2000.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Pulpit: Cedar pulpit, raised on five steps - original. The pulpit was a bequest from Dr Anderson in 1858. It was made by Mr Poulton, to a design by W. Voss.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Prayer desk: Cedar - Edwardian. The prayer or reader's desk was presented in 1905 by the ladies of the parish.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Lectern: Carved Burmese teak wood, date of manufacture unknown. The eagle bible lectern was purchased in London in 1894 by Mrs Macarthur-Onslow.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Font: Stone - original; timber front cover - \"In memory of Amy Pinkerton\" ({{circa|1973}}). The font was completed by William Buchan by the time of the consecration. The stone was quarried at the Rev. Thomas Hassall's Denbigh estate. The location of the font has changed over time, being placed centrally under the organ gallery in 1895 and in 2003 placed next to the Chancel arch.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n====== Windows ======\n* South side, first (and second) windows: Examples of the original coloured glass windows (another is in the tower), specially ordered in 1846 by James Macarthur who had sent zinc templates to England.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* South side, third window: A memorial to the fifth rector of the church, Rev C. J. King, and his twin brother, and noted pioneer New Guinea missionary, Rev. Copeland King. The windows were installed in {{circa|1930}} and were made by Alfred Handel of Sydney. The windows depict Jesus and the disciples and Jesus with children of all nations.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* South side, fourth window: This is a memorial commemorating the Great War of 1914-1918 given by the local parishioners. Alfred Handel of Sydney made the window, which depicts St Mark and St George.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* South side, fifth window: Situated near the pulpit, this is a memorial by public subscription to the third rector of the church, Rev. Henry Tingcombe (d.1879).

The window depicts a soldier dedicating his life to Jesus and spiritual triumphs.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* North side, ninth window: This is a memorial to John William and Alice Wilson Clinton given {{circa|1970}} and made by Stephen Moor of Sydney. The window depicts the miracle of Jesus feeding the five thousand.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* North side, tenth window: This is a memorial to Bertha Victoria Brien, an organist and Sunday school teacher with 30 years' service to the church, given in 1961 by her husband and made by Stephen Little of Sydney. The window depicts St Cecilia with an organ and St Mary with the infant Jesus.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Organ: A three manual Johannus electric organ was installed in 1987 at the north side of the channel/nave with loud speakers located high at gable level on each side of the chancel arch.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Artificial [[lighting]]: Eight large pendant light fittings at the hammer beam ({{circa|1932}}).<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe original interior lighting of the church was by candles placed along the top rail of the pew backs. In 1859, 34 kerosene lamps were installed. In c.1910 an acetylene gas system was installed, which was subsequently connected to a town gas supply. In 1932 mains supply electricity was installed in the town with connections made to the church.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nOther: Eight wall mounted infrared electric radiators (1990).<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n;Chancel interior\n* Ceiling: Original timber beaded sarking boards; chamfered purlins, raised knee trusses supported on sandstone bosses\n* Walls: Render, unset, lined out in [[ashlar]] {{circa|1870}}s.

Two steps to the table, both covered by carpet. A [[marble]] margin can be seen on the north and south side.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n;Chancel fittings\n* Table: In 1917 the present cedar table replaced the original 1848 altar table (location now unknown). A front piece was added to commemorate 25 years in charge of St John's Parish by Rev C. J. King in March 1916. The panel at the bottom in the middle of the front is a recent plywood addition\n* Reredos: The original 1848 reredos was remodelled by architects Wilson Neave & Berry and presented by the parishioners in 1916, marking 25 years of Rev. C. J. King's ministry. The eastern end is cedar panelled; given c.1970 in memory of Warwick Frank Hands, replacing earlier heavy curtains\n* Communion rail: Cedar - original. The communion rails with carved Gothic arches were partly funded by Bishop Broughton and were installed shortly after the consecration\n* President's Chairs: Pair of chairs, Gothic style, Australia made, cedar - original. Installed at time of chancel extension in 1874\n* Credence stand: Cedar with grapevines - date unknown\n* Hall chairs: Pair; cedar, mid-Victorian<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n;Windows\n*East window: The stone frame of this window, the largest in the church, dates from the completion of the church in the 1840s. It was re-installed in 1874 when the chancel was extended. The present stained glass was commissioned and installed in 1869 (or 1872-4) as a memorial to James Macarthur (d. 1867) by parishioners and friends, and was made by Clayton and Bell of England. The window depicts the Transformation.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-51>Matthew 17:1-8</ref>\n* Four lancet windows: A gift of Sir George Macleay of Brownlow Hill, and installed at the time of the completion of the chancel in 1874.

The organ loft and choir gallery were constructed at the west end of the nave. The design for this alteration was prepared by Edmund T. Blacket. The builder was John Le Fevre (a former church warden). The cost was met by public subscription. Stair to loft: Tasmanian oak [[stairs]] (1995). Originally access to the gallery was by stairs situated in the entrance area under the tower. This arrangement was removed in 1995 and new access stairs were installed within the nave to the design of architect R. Y. Stringer. Screen doors: Entry to nave; pair of Tasmanian oak glass panelled doors (1995).<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\n;Organ loft - fittings\nOrgan: The organ is labelled \"Bates and Son, organ builders Ludgate Hill London\". The organ is housed in a timber case in the Gothic style, of gabled towers with [[pinnacle]]s, and contains 17 false gilded pipes arranged 5-7-5. It has eight ranks to the manual and one rank to the foot pedals.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\nThe original harmonium was installed in 1850 on a platform which also accommodated the choir; located at the west end of the nave. The extant pipe organ was either built or rebuilt (Rev C. J. King in 1919 stated that it was second hand) by the London firm of T.C. Bates & Son, Organ Builders, 6 Ludgate Hill, London. The organ was selected by Dr E. J. Hopkins, organist of Temple Church, London, for Emily Macarthur. The purchase price was A\u20a4300. Theodore Charles Bates was a builder of small finger and barrel organs from 1812 through to 1864. In alterations, possibly undertaken early in this century, the Bourdon pipes were added for the pedals and the range reduced. This work was by organ builder, Charles Richardson. Further alterations were made in 1969 by the organ builder Arthur Jones.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\nExtensive restoration was commenced in 2000. Between 2002-2007 the organ was completely rebuilt by M. Da Costa master organ builder of Sydney who extended the keyboard compass back to the original [[G (note)|G]] below bottom [[C (note)|C]] with additional pipes.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=\"sydney organ\"/>\n\n=== Rectory and stables ===\n\nThe rectory of St John's, dating from {{circa|1859}}, is a thorough architectural essay in strict Georgian symmetry and discipline. Its plan form is four square about a wide hall. This is repeated for the first floor. The window and door openings are set out to give symmetrical elevations and internally doors face each other across the halls. The elevations are executed in fine face brick laid in true [[Brickwork|English bond]]. Large double-hung windows with divided [[Sash window|sashes]] and shutters are identical throughout the house. The windows are original, with double-hung sashes, each divided into a six panes, in a timber-box frame with a pair of louvred timber shutters. The quality and details of the house are refined but simple. All except two of the [[chimney]] pieces have been removed. The surviving joinery, [[cornice]]s and staircase are well built and finely executed examples of their period.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe original [[veranda]]h on the front of the building (its east side) was removed in the mid-1970s and replaced with a smaller [[portico]].<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-52>Macarthur Development Board, 1977:86</ref> This portico was later removed and the verandah recreated in 2003. A family room was added to the rectory sometime between 2004 and 2010.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nInternally, the rectory consists of a main and rear hall, sitting room, study, dining room, bedroom, sunroom, passage, service room, kitchen, laundry and lavatory on the first floor, and stair hall, four further bedrooms and a dressing room.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe stables are constructed in brick and originally provided for horse stabling, carriage and harness storage with feed loft. The building was reduced in length to enable access to church land subdivision in 1968 and for the creation of Forrest Crescent.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== Church hall (1906) ===\n\nThe Federation Gothic church hall is entirely as built in 1906 except for a partition one [[Bay (architecture)|bay]] east of the original stage proscenium. The roof is asbestos cement shingles with a perforated terracotta roof ridging and weatherboarding to the gable ends. The bell and its associated detail is intact. The hall has timber-framed doors and windows; the walls are face brick; the interior walls are painted print; the floors are timber and the ceiling is timber planked with exposed compound steel and timber trusses.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nDrainage works were undertaken to overcome structural cracking as some point between 2004 and 2010.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe site also contains a modern second church hall, dating from 1973, which was deemed not to be of heritage significance.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== Church Precinct Grounds ===\n\n==== Plantings ====\n\nThere are a group of exotic and native trees planted to the east and south of the church and within the terraced platforms of the cemetery. These trees are visible in photographs from the 1860s onwards:<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Mature kurrajongs (''Brachychiton populenus'') planted to the west of the 1973 church hall.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Clusters of conifers (''[[Cupressus funebris]]'' and ''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]'') planted throughout the grounds, also visible in photographs from the 1860s.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Mature bunyas (''Acaucaria bidwilii'') planted throughout the grounds providing a reference point within the surrounding landscape. Particularly large and locally prominent examples are situated to the east of the rectory.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Two large palms (''Jubaca chilensis'') planted to the east of the rectory. Many of the now mature specimens probably came from William Macarthur's nursery at Camden Park.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nOther mature trees immediately around the church include Mediterranean cypress (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]''), forest red gum (''[[Eucalyptus tereticornis]]''), kurrajong (''[[Brachychiton populneum]]''), Chinese juniper (''[[Juniperus chinensis]]''), oleanders (''[[Nerium oleander]] cv.s''), funeral cypresses (''[[Chamaecyparis funebris]]''), ''[[Photinia glabra]]'', Chinese elm (''[[Ulmus chinensis]]''), and brown pine (''[[Podocarpus elatus]]'').<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-53>Stuart Read, visit notes, 23/10/2001</ref><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n==== Memorials ====\n\nThere are several memorials to benefactors within the precinct:<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n*Lych gate: The lych gate at the entry to the church grounds from Menangle Road was erected in 1912 as a memorial to Mrs Elizabeth Macarthur-Onslow and restored in 2003.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*John Street entry: The flight of brick built steps and [[iron railing]]s leading up from John Street were erected in 1935. The cost of this work was donated by General J.W. Macarthur-Onslow. The electric light and copper fitting here is a memorial to Mr and Mrs James Waterworth.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Boundary fencing: Boundary fencing of pipe railing and other gates were erected in 1935. The cost of this work was donated by Mrs Faithful Anderson.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Sundial: The [[sundial]] was donated in 1953 by Mrs (Violet) G.M. Macarthur-Onslow. It had been at the Riley's Glenmore estate at Mulgoa since 1861, and at her property, Murrandah, Camden, since 1922. It was restored in 1996.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n*Columbarium: The Memorial Garden / Columbarium was erected in 1964 as a memorial to William Angilley. The Columbarium walls were further extended in 1986 in memory of Mark Kernahan and again in 1994.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n==== Other features ====\n\nThe major features, other than buildings, within the precinct are:<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Road formation: Situated to the east and south of the cemetery are the remains of a road formation, which is likely to be the road shown in nineteenth century maps of the area and photographs of the church. The road evidently provided an early route to Camden Park House.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Horse paddock: The sloping areas of land situated between the rectory and church is shown in nineteenth century photographs as cleared and open. It was separated from the church and cemetery by a substantial four rail fence. It was purchased by or donated to the church in 1911.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Tennis courts platform: Located to the west of the 1906 church hall is a platform which evidently is the remains of former tennis courts. This photograph is visible on 1940s photographs of the precinct.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Undulating topography: The church grounds possess an undulating topography framed by the three hills upon which the rectory, church and Masonic hall (site of former school) are sited.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Old path from the church hall to the church: The formation of the old path from the church hall of 1906 (and presumably before that from the old school) to the church is evident in a number of nineteenth-century photographs and cl940 aerial photograph.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Road from the lych gate to the church: The present-day road from the lych gate to the church closely approximates the same shown in early twentieth century photographs although the surface treatment is different.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Road from front of the rectory and leading to the stables: There are a number of old road formations and gates associated with the rectory and associated stables. The timber gate posts to the stables are comparable in detail to a gate to the church on Broughton Street shown in an early twentieth-century photograph.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n* Horse paddock and Cemetery gate: These are four nineteenth-century timber gate posts with cast irons caps.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== Cemetery ===\n\nThe modern cemetery covers an area of around {{convert|1|acre|ha|order=flip|spell=on}} across approximately six terraces ranged across the southern slopes of the church lot. It holds approximately 1600 grave sites and is scattered with and surrounding by various tree plantings. Since 1977 there has been an ongoing program of maintenance which ensures that the sites is not overgrown by vegetation. Between 1977 and 1987 a survey of the cemetery was undertaken that recorded all the grave sites. Further work has been undertaken in 1995 by a Land Environment Action Program team and in 1999 by a work for the dole program. Today sections of the cemetery are in poor condition and require maintenance, rebuilding, and interpretation.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|16}} <ref name=CMPAdd/>{{rp|25}}\n\n=== Regional landscape context ===\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct is an exemplary demonstration of the regional use of landscape design. St John's Anglican Church, with its tower and spire, dominates and commands the Camden landscape on its high prominence (St John's Hill) in the middle of what is a low-lying flood plain. Its tower and spire symbolically reach for heaven and point the way for the minds and souls of the local community. The church tower and spire, as well as other elements of the church precinct such as the rectory, are visible from many locations in the local landscape from Cobbitty to the north, Narellan in the east, Cawdor in the south, and Grasmere and Bickley Vale to the west. More distant views are also available of the church in the greater region as well. This effect on the local landscape is the result of a deliberate landscape design by the Macarthur family that was aimed both at creating picturesque vistas that reminded them of an English countryside, and reinforcing the social order the Macarthurs, as part of the ruling class, wished to uphold. St John's extraordinary command of the regional landscape ensures that it is visible from all the major roads, high points, and the seats of several of the major local estates. This command is expressed through 16 significant views and vistas in the regional landscape that is identified in the conservation management plan.<ref name=nswshr-2006/><ref name=CMP/>{{rp|35-36, 44}}\n\nThe most important of these many vistas are the two deliberately planned by the Macarthur family with the assistance of Sir Thomas Mitchell:<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n# The vista from the front carriageway loop of Camden Park House to St John's in the distance. Today the garden and plantings around the front of the house have been purposefully managed and arranged so that a break exists in the surrounding tree line (across the croquet lawn) which captures the picturesque vista to St John's across the landscape of the former estate. In this vista, St John's spire sits in front of the Blue Mountains range between the two distinctive peaks of Mount Hay and Mount Banks.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-55>Images 8</ref> This vista has earned the church the local quip \"built to the glory of God and to improve the views of the Macarthurs\".<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-56>Hill, 2016:505</ref> It is complemented by one of Camden Park House from the southern main entrance of St John's (however, this is no longer visible due to tree growth near the church). Further evidence of the deliberate planning of this vista is the fact that it aligns with the cross-axis of the township of Camden.<ref name=nswshr-2006-2006-56/><ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n# The vista of St John's looking south and upwards along John's Street in Camden. This vista was deliberately planned by Sir Thomas Mitchell in his design for the township to demonstrate the moral authority and commanding presence of God, and the Anglican Church, over the hearts and souls of the community.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 20 September 2017, St John's the Evanglist Anglican church was in good condition and retains all its original fabric. It is well maintained by the Camden Parish and features only small sympathetic modifications to assist in the modern running of the building. Some elements of the building require conservation and maintenance works such as the clock and bells, roof, and walls (rising damp).<ref name=nswshr-2006/> The churchyard and grounds are well maintained and in good condition. The cemetery is well maintained but requires some conservation works to its older portions to prevent further subsidence of some graves and memorials. The rectory is in a fair-good condition but requires some maintenance works, especially to its roof.  The church hall is in fair condition, but has some issues with structural cracking due to subsidence. The church precinct has good integrity and intactness.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nOrgan: The pipes and mechanical action have been modified in places and added to over time, however the organ remains a substantially intact instrumental and is played regularly.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 6 November 2007, St John's Anglican Church Precinct was of state heritage significance as a group of ecclesiastical buildings set in a beautiful landscape setting consisting of mature and exotic tree plantings and open grassed slopes. The precinct's centre and focal point is St John's the Evangelist Anglican Church which is of state heritage significance as the first Gothic Revival church constructed in NSW that was correct in its medieval detail ('archaeologically correct'). This status, along with its strong connection to the 1836 Church Act, renders it an important early forerunner of the Gothic Revival movement which was to dominate ecclesiastical architecture in the Colony throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century. The church, and especially its tower and spire, is aesthetically significant to NSW as part of the regional Camden landscape created by the Macarthur family. St John's as an important regional landmark is a significant element in the picturesque landscape planning used to create the Camden Park Estate, the seat of the Macarthur family. As part of a triumvirate of significant points in the landscape, along with Camden Park House and the township of Camden, it also expresses the power structures the Macarthur family wished to instil in the local community they were creating in the early nineteenth century. This regional landscape design is of state heritage significance as an important example of early-mid nineteenth century landscape planning.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe entire church precinct has an important historical association with the Macarthur family of Camden. Each of the precinct allotments was donated to the Anglican Church by the Macarthurs and the family funded the construction of most of the buildings and patronised the operation of the church throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Ultimately, St John's Anglican church precinct is a remarkable, picturesquely located, and historic place of Anglican worship in a state context.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 24 August 2018 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=GazetteNSW>{{Gazette NSW |title=NOTICE OF LISTING ON THE STATE HERITAGE REGISTER UNDER SECTION 37(1)(b)|issue=82|page=5544|date=24 August 2018|url=https://gazette.legislation.nsw.gov.au/so/download.w3p?id=Gazette_2018_2018-82.pdf|access-date=25 November 2019|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt John the Evangelist Anglican Church has historical significance at a state level as the first archaeologically correct Gothic Revival Church constructed in the colony of NSW and Australia as the Gothic Revival movement gained momentum in the early 1840s. The church thus has an important place in this movement that was to dominate ecclesiastical architecture in the colony throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century. The Gothic Revival movement was reflective of deep-running change in the Anglican Church during this period. St John's Anglican Church demonstrates the spread of these ideas to the Colony, following the trends of ecclesiastical architecture in Britain.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's Anglican Church is of historical significance at a state level due to its strong connection with the 1836 Church Act. This piece of legislation confirmed the colony as a religiously plural society and ushered in an unprecedented period of church building. St John's is one of the earliest extant churches built under this act. It is an important member of this group of early Church Act churches due to its Gothic Revival design, fine construction, picturesque location, and prominent part in wider regional landscape planning that renders it a remarkable place of worship.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct has an association of state significance with the Macarthur family. The Macarthurs have played significant roles in politics, social life, philanthropy, military life, and the development of wool growing, agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, and dairying in the colony of NSW. They are especially well remembered as the gentry that developed the Camden area as it is today with its wide open rural landscape and proud historic nature. The Macarthur family are directly responsible for the establishment of St John's and its associated church precinct as they donated the land on which it sits and provided much of the funding that saw the church, rectory, and many of the other features constructed. Many elements of the church precinct and furnishings of the church were also donated by, or are memorials to, members of the Macarthur family. In this manner, the church precinct and its regional landscape setting is a fitting memorial to the achievements of the Macarthur family in the development of the Camden region and the Colony of NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nAmong the generations of the Macarthur family that have been custodians of the Camden Park Estate there are several members who were closely involved with the establishment and running of the church precinct. The successful pastoralist and conservative politician James (1798-1867); his wife Emily (1806-1880); and the prominent pastoralist, horticulturalist, vintner, and benefactor of public institutions Sir William Macarthur (1800\u201382) were intimately involved in the establishment and construction of St John's and the early portions of its precinct during the mid-nineteenth century. Their successors to the Camden Park Estate, the philanthropist and dairy farmer Elizabeth (1840-1911) and naval officer and politician Commander R. N. Arthur Macarthur-Onslow (1833-1882), were also strongly involved in the further running and development of the church and precinct during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Their children the charity and church worker Rosa Sibella (1871-1943) and the soldier and grazier Brigadier-General George Macleay (1875-1931) were also involved in the same manner during the early to mid-twentieth century. The association between the family and the church precinct continued until at least 1972 when Brigadier Richard Quentin Macarthur-Stanham (1921-2008) laid the foundation stone for the new Church Hall. In this manner, almost all the diverse elements of the church precinct have some form of connection with members of the Macarthur family.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct has aesthetic significance at a State level as a fine group of ecclesiastic buildings with a cemetery located in an open rural landscape resplendent with mature native and exotic trees, rolling grassed slopes, fence lines, paths, and memorials. This open setting creates important interconnecting views and vistas between different elements of the church precinct, such as that between the church and rectory, that allows for their proper appreciation. On a broader scale this open setting complements St John Anglican Church, and particular its tower and spire, by opening it to a wider catchment of views and vistas across the regional landscape. This allows the church to be the focus of the great picturesque character of the region which is the result of the landscape design implement by the Macarthurs in their development of Camden. In the landscape design St John's is the pinnacle of the township and the apex of many important vistas. As such, it has an all-encompassing relationship with its landscape and has important inter-relationships with the Camden Park Estate, Camden Park House, and the township of Camden that expresses the power structures between these places.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's plays a key role in the picturesque landscape planning of the Camden Park Estate and particularly, Camden Park House. This is demonstrated by a picturesque vista of St John's available from the front carriageway loop of Camden Park House. It was part of the early design of the mansion and its surrounding countryside and it has been cultivated into the surrounding garden to the present by the Macarthur family. This vista features St John's tower and spire framed by the peaks of [[Mount Hay (New South Wales)|Mount Hay]] and Banks of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] range in the distance as its focal point. Its exemplary picturesque design is evident in the intricate details and variety in contains that are expressed in its contrasting textures created by the juxtaposition between nature and man-made structures and landscapes. This vista was deliberately planned to delight and interest the eye and mind of early nineteenth century observers and the medieval inspired design of St John's was a fitting centrepiece according to the dictates of the picturesque. This vista is reciprocated by a view of Camden Park House from the front steps of St John's Anglican Church.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's is an important part in the framework of power dynamics the Macarthurs embedded in their regional landscape design to reinforce the social structures they wished to perpetuate. This featured the Macarthurs as the ruling upper gentry; the Anglican church, patronised and guided by the Macarthurs, as the moral compass of the community; and the middle and working classes as the lowest social strata. This social structure is expressed firstly through the distant vista of St John's from Camden Park House as described above which demonstrates the relationship the Macarthur family wished to cultivate with the Anglican Church in Camden; one of patronage and firm guidance. It is secondly expressed in the relationship of St John's Anglican Church with the township design of Camden as envisioned by James and William Macarthur and put into effect by Sir Thomas Mitchell. In this design, St John's is purposely situated on top of a hill over the town that ensures that it dominates the local landscape. This design ensures that the church, and particularly its tower and spire, was a reminder to the community of the watchful presence of God and the Anglican Church. This effect was further accentuated by the commanding vista of St John's along John Street that was purposefully planned into the town design by Mitchell.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's Anglican Church has technical significance at a State level as the earliest, and one of the finest, examples of archaeologically correct Gothic Revival architecture in the state (and possibly nationally). This church embodies the aims of the early development of the Gothic Revival movement in the Colony. As such, it is a successful early example that was likely used as a precedent in the local Gothic Revival movement throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century. The church's fine construction, completeness, and good condition further enhance its significance against this criterion.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt John's Anglican Church has research potential in a state context as the first archaeologically correct Gothic Revival church constructed in the colony. The church's fine construction and completeness, with its tower, spire, clock, bells, stained glass, organ, and furniture all being intact add to its significance against this criterion. St John's Anglican Church retains many elements of its original built fabric, which makes it a unique repository for the future study of nineteenth century technology and artisan's crafts. These aspects of the church make it an important research resource for the study of Gothic Revival architecture in the state context (and perhaps nationally).<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Bates & Son pipe organ (c.1860) in St John's Anglican Church is the only known extant example constructed by this maker in NSW. This makes it an important research resource in the state context.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt John's Anglican Church is rare in a state context as the first archaeologically correct Gothic Revival church constructed in the colony. The church's fine construction and completeness, with its tower, spire, clock, bells, stained glass, organ, and furniture all being intact add to its significance against this criterion.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nThe Bates & Son pipe organ (c.1860) is rare in a state context as the only known extant example produced by these manufactures.<ref name=nswshr-2006/>\n\nSt John's Anglican Church Precinct is rare in a state context as a complete ensemble of parish church buildings (church, rectory, cemetery, and grounds).

The concept goes back to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] of the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, where {{Cite Talmud|b|Tractate Sota|4=38b|5=yes}} refers to a \"mechitza shel barzel\", an iron barrier or divider: \"{{Lang|he|\u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8\u05d6\u05dc \u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05de\u05e4\u05e1\u05e7\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05dc\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd \u05e9\u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd|rtl=yes}}\" ({{Transliteration|he|Even an iron barrier cannot separate [the people of] Israel from their heavenly father}}).\n\nThe term \"iron curtain\" has since been used metaphorically in two rather different senses \u2013 firstly to denote the end of an era and secondly to denote a closed geopolitical border. The source of these metaphors can refer to either the [[safety curtain]] deployed in theatres (the first one was installed by the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1794<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/exploring-theatres/history-of-theatres/eighteenth-century-theatre |title=Eighteenth-century theatre | work = History of theatres - Exploring Theatres |publisher= The Theatres Trust |accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref>) or to [[roller shutter]]s used to secure commercial premises.<ref>{{citation|last= Proust|first= Marcel|title= The Captive |translator-last= Scott Moncrieff|translator-first=C.K. |year= 1929}}</ref>\n\nThe first metaphorical usage of \"iron curtain\", in the sense of an end of an era, perhaps should be attributed to British author [[Arthur Machen]] (1863\u20131947), who used the term in his 1895 novel ''The Three Impostors'': \"...the door clanged behind me with the noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life\".<ref>{{citation |last= Machen |first= Arthur |title=The Three Impostors |publisher= Aegypan Press |location=Los Angeles(?) |year=2005 |page= 60 |isbn=1-59818-437-7}}</ref> The English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of \"clang\" with reference to an \"iron curtain\", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.\n\n[[Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians]] used the term \"Iron Curtain\" in the context of World War I to describe the political situation between [[Belgium]] and [[Imperial Germany|Germany]] in 1914.<ref>Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians to Pierre Loti in 1915 ({{citation |first= Pierre |last= Loti |title= L'Album de la Guerre |edition=L'Illustration |location= Paris |year=1923 |page= 33}}).</ref>\n\nThe first recorded application of the term to [[Soviet Russia]], again in the sense of the end of an era, comes in [[Vasily Rozanov]]'s 1918 polemic ''[[The Apocalypse of Our Times]]'', and it is possible that Churchill read it there following the publication of the book's English translation in 1920. The passage runs:\n{{Quote |With clanging, creaking, and squeaking, an iron curtain is lowering over Russian History. \"The performance is over.\" The audience got up. \"Time to put on your fur coats and go home.\" We looked around, but the fur coats and homes were missing.<ref>{{Citation |last =Rozanov | first =Vasily| title = The Apocalypse of our Times (\"\u0410\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0441\u0438\u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\") | publisher = | year =1918 | location =103| page =212}}</ref>}}\n\n(Incidentally, this same passage provides a definition of [[nihilism]] adopted by [[Raoul Vaneigem]],<ref>{{Citation|last = Vaneigem | first = Raoul| title =The Revolution of Everyday Life (\"Trait\u00e9 de savoir-vivre \u00e0 l'usage des jeunes g\u00e9n\u00e9rations\") | publisher = Red and Black | year =1967 | location = 176 | page = 279 | isbn = }}</ref> [[Guy Debord]] and other [[Situationist International|Situationists]] as the intention of situationist intervention.)\n\nThe first English-language use of the term ''[[Iron (metaphor)|iron]] [[curtain]]'' applied to the border of Soviet Russia in the sense of \"an impenetrable barrier\" was used in 1920 by [[Ethel Snowden]], in her book ''Through Bolshevik Russia''.<ref>{{Citation |last1 = Cohen |first1 = J.

There were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world, particularly the so-called \"[[inner German border]]\" \u2013 commonly known as ''die Grenze'' in German \u2013 between East and West Germany. The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (expanded metal) with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the [[Berlin Wall]] was built. The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain.<ref>Keeling, Drew (2014), business-of-migration.com [http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-processes/other-regions/berlin-wall-and-migration/ \"Berlin Wall and Migration,\" ''Migration as a travel business'']</ref>\n\nThe barrier was always a short distance inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory. The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier. The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier \u2013 between the actual borderline and the barrier \u2013 was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk, because it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards.\n\n[[File:Point Alpha Ostseite.jpg|thumb|Fence along the former East-West border in Germany]]\nSeveral villages, many historic, were destroyed as they lay too close to the border, for example [[Erlebach]]. Shooting incidents were not uncommon, and several hundred civilians and 28 East German border guards were killed between 1948 and 1981 (some may have been victims of \"[[friendly fire]]\" by their own side).\n\nElsewhere along the border between West and East, the defence works resembled those on the intra-German border. During the Cold War, the border zone in Hungary started {{convert|15|km}} from the border. Citizens could only enter the area if they lived in the zone or had a passport valid for traveling out. Traffic control points and patrols enforced this regulation.\n\nThose who lived within the {{convert|15|km}} border-zone needed special permission to enter the area within {{convert|5|km}} of the border. The area was very difficult to approach and heavily fortified. In the 1950s and 1960s, a double barbed-wire fence was installed {{convert|50|m}} from the border. The space between the two fences was laden with [[land mine]]s. The minefield was later replaced with an electric signal fence (about {{convert|1|km}} from the border) and a barbed wire fence, along with guard towers and a sand strip to track border violations.\n\nRegular patrols sought to prevent escape attempts. They included cars and mounted units. Guards and dog patrol units watched the border 24/7 and were authorised to use their weapons to stop escapees. The wire fence nearest the actual border was irregularly displaced from the actual border, which was marked only by stones. Anyone attempting to escape would have to cross up to {{convert|400|m}} before they could cross the actual border. Several escape attempts failed when the escapees were stopped after crossing the outer fence.\n\nIn parts of [[Czechoslovakia]], the border strip became hundreds of meters wide, and an area of increasing restrictions was defined as the border was approached. Only people with the appropriate government permissions were allowed to get close to the border.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold river : the cold truth of freedom|last=Imrich, Jozef.|date=2005|publisher=Double Dragon|isbn=9781554043118|location=East Markham, Ontario|oclc=225346736}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union built a fence along the entire border between [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it.\n\nIn [[Greece]], a highly militarised area called the \"\u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7 \u0396\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7\" (\"Surveillance Area\") was created by the Greek Army along the Greek-Bulgarian border, subject to significant security-related regulations and restrictions. Inhabitants within this {{convert|25|km}} wide strip of land were forbidden to drive cars, own land bigger than {{convert|60|m2}}, and had to travel within the area with a special passport issued by Greek military authorities. Additionally, the Greek state used this area to encapsulate and monitor a non-Greek ethnic minority, the [[Pomaks]], a Muslim and Bulgarian-speaking minority which was regarded as hostile to the interests of the Greek state during the Cold War because of its familiarity with their fellow Pomaks living on the other side of the Iron Curtain.<ref>[https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb7-2_labrianidis.pdf Lois Labrianidis, The impact of the Greek military surveillance zone on the Greek side of the Bulgarian-Greek borderlands], 1999</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian outer fence became the first part of the Iron Curtain to be dismantled. After the border fortifications were dismantled, a section was rebuilt for a formal ceremony. On 27 June 1989, the [[foreign minister]]s of Austria and Hungary, [[Alois Mock]] and [[Gyula Horn]], ceremonially cut through the border defences separating their countries.\n\nThe creation of these highly militarised no-man's lands led to ''de facto'' nature reserves and created a [[wildlife corridor]] across Europe; this helped the spread of several species to new territories. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, several initiatives are pursuing the creation of a [[European Green Belt]] nature preserve area along the Iron Curtain's former route. In fact, a [[long-distance cycling route]] along the length of the former border called the [[Iron Curtain Trail]] (ICT) exists as a project of the European Union and other associated nations. The trail is {{Convert|6,800|km|abbr=on}} long and spans from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ironcurtaintrail.eu/en/der_iron_curtain_trail/index.html |title=The Iron Curtain Trail |publisher=Ironcurtaintrail.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Iron Curtain\" was only used for the fortified borders in Europe; it was not used for similar borders in Asia between communist and capitalist states (these were, for a time, dubbed the [[Bamboo Curtain]]). The [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|border between North Korea and South Korea]] is very comparable to the former inner German border, particularly in its degree of militarisation, but it has never conventionally been considered part of any Iron Curtain.\n\n====Helmstedt-Marienborn crossing====\n{{Main|Helmstedt-Marienborn border crossing}}\n\nThe '''Border checkpoint Helmstedt\u2013Marienborn''' ({{lang-de|'''Grenz\u00fcbergang Helmstedt-Marienborn'''}}), named ''Grenz\u00fcbergangsstelle Marienborn'' (G\u00dcSt) (''border crossing Marienborn'') by the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), was the largest and most important border crossing on the [[Inner German border]] during the [[History of Germany since 1945|division of Germany]]. Due to its geographical location, allowing for the shortest land route between [[West Germany]] and [[West Berlin]], most transit traffic to and from West Berlin used the Helmstedt-Marienborn crossing. Most travel routes from West Germany to [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] and [[Poland]] also used this crossing. The border crossing existed from 1945 to 1990 and was situated near the East German village of [[Marienborn]] at the edge of the [[Lappwald]]. The crossing interrupted the [[Bundesautobahn 2]] (A&nbsp;2) between the junctions ''[[Helmstedt]]-Ost'' and ''[[Ostingersleben]]''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-paspoortcontrole-personenautos-04.JPG\nFile:Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-paspoortcontrole-vrachtautos.JPG\nFile:Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-lichtmast-commandotoren-brug.JPG\nFile:Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-lichtmast-02.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==Fall of the Iron Curtain==\n{{Further|Eastern Bloc|Revolutions of 1989|Dissolution of the Soviet Union|European integration}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0419-014, Berlin, Loch in Mauer, Grenzsoldaten, Wachturm.jpg|thumb|East German border-guards look through a hole in the Berlin Wall in 1990]]\n[[File:EasternBloc PostDissolution2008.svg|thumb|The dissolution of the Eastern Bloc]]\n\nFollowing a period of [[Brezhnev stagnation|economic and political stagnation]] under Brezhnev and his immediate successors, the Soviet Union decreased its intervention in [[Eastern Bloc politics]].

Hungarian border guards had threatened to shoot anyone crossing the border, but when the time came, they did not intervene and allowed the people to cross. In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the [[Parliament of Hungary|Hungarian parliament]] adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election.<ref name=\"crampton394\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=394\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThe legislation transformed Hungary from a [[People's Republic of Hungary|People's Republic]] into the [[Republic of Hungary|Republic]], guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. In November 1989, following mass protests in [[East Germany]] and the relaxing of border restrictions in Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of [[East Berlin]]ers flooded checkpoints along the [[Berlin Wall]], crossing into [[West Berlin]].<ref name=\"crampton394\"/>\n\nIn the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], the day after the mass crossings across the Berlin Wall, leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted.<ref name=\"crampton395\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=395\u20136}}</ref> In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], following protests of an estimated half-million Czechoslovaks, the government permitted travel to the west and abolished provisions guaranteeing the ruling Communist party its leading role, preceding the [[Velvet Revolution]].<ref name=\"crampton398\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=398}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]], on 22 December 1989, the Romanian military sided with protesters and turned on Communist ruler [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]], who was executed after a brief trial three days later.<ref name=\"crampton400\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=400}}</ref> In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.\n\nThe Berlin Wall officially remained guarded after 9 November 1989, although the inter-German border had become effectively meaningless. The official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military did not begin until June 1990. On 1 July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the [[Deutsche Mark|West German currency]], all border-controls ceased and West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.\n\n==Monuments==\n[[File:Iron Curtain - Hungary.jpg|thumb|Memorial in [[Budapest]] reads: \"''Iron Curtain 1949-1989''\"]]\nThere is an Iron Curtain monument in the southern part of the Czech Republic at approximately {{Coord|48.8755|15.87477|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Iron Curtain monument}}. A few hundred meters of the original fence, and one of the guard towers, has remained installed. There are interpretive signs in Czech and English that explain the history and significance of the Iron Curtain. This is the only surviving part of the fence in the Czech Republic, though several guard towers and bunkers can still be seen. Some of these are part of the Communist Era defences, some are from the never-used [[Czechoslovak border fortifications]] in defence against [[Adolf Hitler]], and some towers were, or have become, hunting platforms.\n\nAnother monument is located in [[Fert\u0151r\u00e1kos]], Hungary, at the site of the [[Pan-European Picnic]]. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by [[Gabriela von Habsburg]]. It is a column made of metal and barbed wire with the date of the Pan-European Picnic and the names of participants. On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text: ''In necessariis unitas \u2013 in dubiis libertas \u2013 in omnibus caritas'' (\"Unity in unavoidable matters \u2013 freedom in doubtful matters \u2013 love in all things\"). The memorial symbolises the Iron Curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.\n\nAnother monument is located in the village of [[Dev\u00edn]], now part of [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], at the confluence of the [[Danube]] and [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava]] rivers.\n\nThere are several open-air museums in parts of the former inner German border, as for example in Berlin and in [[M\u00f6dlareuth]], a village that has been divided for several hundred years. The memory of the division is being kept alive in many places along the ''Grenze''.\n\n==Analogous terms==\nThroughout the Cold War the term \"curtain\" would become a common euphemism for boundaries \u2013 physical or ideological \u2013 between communist and capitalist states.\n\n* An analogue of the Iron Curtain, the [[Bamboo Curtain]], surrounded the People's Republic of China.

The term symbolizes the efforts by the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) to block itself and its [[satellite state]]s from open contact with [[Western Bloc|the West]] and its allied states. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union, while on the west side were the countries that were [[NATO]] members or nominally neutral. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain. \n\nIt later became a term for the {{Convert|7000|km|mi|abbr=|adj=mid}} long physical barrier of fences, walls, minefields, and watchtowers that divided the \"east\" and \"west\".

The concept goes back to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] of the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, where {{Cite Talmud|b|Tractate Sota|4=38b|5=yes}} refers to a \"mechitza shel barzel\", an iron barrier or divider: \"{{Lang|he|\u05d0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05d7\u05d9\u05e6\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8\u05d6\u05dc \u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 \u05de\u05e4\u05e1\u05e7\u05ea \u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05dc\u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d4\u05dd \u05e9\u05d1\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd|rtl=yes}}\" ({{Transliteration|he|Even an iron barrier cannot separate [the people of] Israel from their heavenly father}}).\n\nThe term \"iron curtain\" has since been used metaphorically in two rather different senses \u2013 firstly to denote the end of an era and secondly to denote a closed geopolitical border. The source of these metaphors can refer to either the [[safety curtain]] deployed in theatres (the first one was installed by the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1794<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/exploring-theatres/history-of-theatres/eighteenth-century-theatre |title=Eighteenth-century theatre | work = History of theatres - Exploring Theatres |publisher= The Theatres Trust |accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref>) or to [[roller shutter]]s used to secure commercial premises.<ref>{{citation|last= Proust|first= Marcel|title= The Captive |translator-last= Scott Moncrieff|translator-first=C.K. |year= 1929}}</ref>\n\nThe first metaphorical usage of \"iron curtain\", in the sense of an end of an era, perhaps should be attributed to British author [[Arthur Machen]] (1863\u20131947), who used the term in his 1895 novel ''The Three Impostors'': \"...the door clanged behind me with the noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life\".<ref>{{citation |last= Machen |first= Arthur |title=The Three Impostors |publisher= Aegypan Press |location=Los Angeles(?) |year=2005 |page= 60 |isbn=1-59818-437-7}}</ref> The English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of \"clang\" with reference to an \"iron curtain\", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.\n\n[[Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians]] used the term \"Iron Curtain\" in the context of World War I to describe the political situation between [[Belgium]] and [[Imperial Germany|Germany]] in 1914.<ref>Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians to Pierre Loti in 1915 ({{citation |first= Pierre |last= Loti |title= L'Album de la Guerre |edition=L'Illustration |location= Paris |year=1923 |page= 33}}).</ref>\n\nThe first recorded application of the term to [[Soviet Russia]], again in the sense of the end of an era, comes in [[Vasily Rozanov]]'s 1918 polemic ''[[The Apocalypse of Our Times]]'', and it is possible that Churchill read it there following the publication of the book's English translation in 1920. The passage runs:\n{{Quote |With clanging, creaking, and squeaking, an iron curtain is lowering over Russian History. \"The performance is over.\" The audience got up. \"Time to put on your fur coats and go home.\" We looked around, but the fur coats and homes were missing.<ref>{{Citation |last =Rozanov | first =Vasily| title = The Apocalypse of our Times (\"\u0410\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f\u0441\u0438\u0441 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\") | publisher = | year =1918 | location =103| page =212}}</ref>}}\n\n(Incidentally, this same passage provides a definition of [[nihilism]] adopted by [[Raoul Vaneigem]],<ref>{{Citation|last = Vaneigem | first = Raoul| title =The Revolution of Everyday Life (\"Trait\u00e9 de savoir-vivre \u00e0 l'usage des jeunes g\u00e9n\u00e9rations\") | publisher = Red and Black | year =1967 | location = 176 | page = 279 | isbn = }}</ref> [[Guy Debord]] and other [[Situationist International|Situationists]] as the intention of situationist intervention.)\n\nThe first English-language use of the term ''[[Iron (metaphor)|iron]] [[curtain]]'' applied to the border of Soviet Russia in the sense of \"an impenetrable barrier\" was used in 1920 by [[Ethel Snowden]], in her book ''Through Bolshevik Russia''.<ref>{{Citation |last1 = Cohen |first1 = J.

G. Macdonell; it was used there to describe the way an artillery barrage protected the infantry from an enemy assault: \"...the western sky was a blaze of yellow flame. The iron curtain was down\". [[Sebastian Haffner]] used the metaphor in his book ''Germany: Jekyll & Hyde'', published in London in 1940, in introducing his discussion of the Nazi rise to power in Germany in 1933: \"Back then to March 1933.

Such fires were rather common because the decor often was flammable. In case of fire, a metal wall would separate the stage from the theatre, secluding the flames to be extinguished by firefighters.

Although not well received at the time, the phrase ''iron curtain'' gained popularity as a shorthand reference to the division of Europe as the Cold War strengthened. The Iron Curtain served to keep people in and information out, and people throughout the West eventually came to accept and use the metaphor.<ref>Authors such as Lewkowicz have underlined the importance played by the treatment of the [[German Question]] in the division of the continent into two ideological camps.

He expressed the Allied Nations' distrust of the Soviet Union after the World War II. In September that year, US-Soviet cooperation collapsed due to the US disavowal of the Soviet Union's opinion on the German problem in the [[Stuttgart Council]], and then followed the announcement by US President, Harry S. Truman, of a hard line anti-Soviet, anticommunist policy. After that the phrase became more widely used as an anti-Soviet term in the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1146410&cid=40942&categoryId=31656 |title=\ucca0\uc758 \uc7a5\ub9c9 : \uc9c0\uc2dd\ubc31\uacfc |language=ko |publisher=Terms.naver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Churchill mentioned in his speech that regions under the Soviet Union's control were expanding their leverage and power without any restriction.

There were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world, particularly the so-called \"[[inner German border]]\" \u2013 commonly known as ''die Grenze'' in German \u2013 between East and West Germany. The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (expanded metal) with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the [[Berlin Wall]] was built. The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain.<ref>Keeling, Drew (2014), business-of-migration.com [http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-processes/other-regions/berlin-wall-and-migration/ \"Berlin Wall and Migration,\" ''Migration as a travel business'']</ref>\n\nThe barrier was always a short distance inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory. The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier. The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier \u2013 between the actual borderline and the barrier \u2013 was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk, because it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards.\n\n[[File:Point Alpha Ostseite.jpg|thumb|Fence along the former East-West border in Germany]]\nSeveral villages, many historic, were destroyed as they lay too close to the border, for example [[Erlebach]]. Shooting incidents were not uncommon, and several hundred civilians and 28 East German border guards were killed between 1948 and 1981 (some may have been victims of \"[[friendly fire]]\" by their own side).\n\nElsewhere along the border between West and East, the defence works resembled those on the intra-German border. During the Cold War, the border zone in Hungary started {{convert|15|km}} from the border. Citizens could only enter the area if they lived in the zone or had a passport valid for traveling out. Traffic control points and patrols enforced this regulation.\n\nThose who lived within the {{convert|15|km}} border-zone needed special permission to enter the area within {{convert|5|km}} of the border. The area was very difficult to approach and heavily fortified. In the 1950s and 1960s, a double barbed-wire fence was installed {{convert|50|m}} from the border. The space between the two fences was laden with [[land mine]]s. The minefield was later replaced with an electric signal fence (about {{convert|1|km}} from the border) and a barbed wire fence, along with guard towers and a sand strip to track border violations.\n\nRegular patrols sought to prevent escape attempts. They included cars and mounted units. Guards and dog patrol units watched the border 24/7 and were authorised to use their weapons to stop escapees. The wire fence nearest the actual border was irregularly displaced from the actual border, which was marked only by stones. Anyone attempting to escape would have to cross up to {{convert|400|m}} before they could cross the actual border. Several escape attempts failed when the escapees were stopped after crossing the outer fence.\n\nIn parts of [[Czechoslovakia]], the border strip became hundreds of meters wide, and an area of increasing restrictions was defined as the border was approached. Only people with the appropriate government permissions were allowed to get close to the border.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cold river : the cold truth of freedom|last=Imrich, Jozef.|date=2005|publisher=Double Dragon|isbn=9781554043118|location=East Markham, Ontario|oclc=225346736}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union built a fence along the entire border between [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it.\n\nIn [[Greece]], a highly militarised area called the \"\u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7 \u0396\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7\" (\"Surveillance Area\") was created by the Greek Army along the Greek-Bulgarian border, subject to significant security-related regulations and restrictions. Inhabitants within this {{convert|25|km}} wide strip of land were forbidden to drive cars, own land bigger than {{convert|60|m2}}, and had to travel within the area with a special passport issued by Greek military authorities. Additionally, the Greek state used this area to encapsulate and monitor a non-Greek ethnic minority, the [[Pomaks]], a Muslim and Bulgarian-speaking minority which was regarded as hostile to the interests of the Greek state during the Cold War because of its familiarity with their fellow Pomaks living on the other side of the Iron Curtain.<ref>[https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb7-2_labrianidis.pdf Lois Labrianidis, The impact of the Greek military surveillance zone on the Greek side of the Bulgarian-Greek borderlands], 1999</ref>\n\nThe Hungarian outer fence became the first part of the Iron Curtain to be dismantled. After the border fortifications were dismantled, a section was rebuilt for a formal ceremony. On 27 June 1989, the [[foreign minister]]s of Austria and Hungary, [[Alois Mock]] and [[Gyula Horn]], ceremonially cut through the border defences separating their countries.\n\nThe creation of these highly militarised no-man's lands led to ''de facto'' nature reserves and created a [[wildlife corridor]] across Europe; this helped the spread of several species to new territories. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, several initiatives are pursuing the creation of a [[European Green Belt]] nature preserve area along the Iron Curtain's former route. In fact, a [[long-distance cycling route]] along the length of the former border called the [[Iron Curtain Trail]] (ICT) exists as a project of the European Union and other associated nations. The trail is {{Convert|6,800|km|abbr=on}} long and spans from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ironcurtaintrail.eu/en/der_iron_curtain_trail/index.html |title=The Iron Curtain Trail |publisher=Ironcurtaintrail.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Iron Curtain\" was only used for the fortified borders in Europe; it was not used for similar borders in Asia between communist and capitalist states (these were, for a time, dubbed the [[Bamboo Curtain]]). The [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|border between North Korea and South Korea]] is very comparable to the former inner German border, particularly in its degree of militarisation, but it has never conventionally been considered part of any Iron Curtain.\n\n====Helmstedt-Marienborn crossing====\n{{Main|Helmstedt-Marienborn border crossing}}\n\nThe '''Border checkpoint Helmstedt\u2013Marienborn''' ({{lang-de|'''Grenz\u00fcbergang Helmstedt-Marienborn'''}}), named ''Grenz\u00fcbergangsstelle Marienborn'' (G\u00dcSt) (''border crossing Marienborn'') by the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR), was the largest and most important border crossing on the [[Inner German border]] during the [[History of Germany since 1945|division of Germany]]. Due to its geographical location, allowing for the shortest land route between [[West Germany]] and [[West Berlin]], most transit traffic to and from West Berlin used the Helmstedt-Marienborn crossing. Most travel routes from West Germany to [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] and [[Poland]] also used this crossing. The border crossing existed from 1945 to 1990 and was situated near the East German village of [[Marienborn]] at the edge of the [[Lappwald]]. The crossing interrupted the [[Bundesautobahn 2]] (A&nbsp;2) between the junctions ''[[Helmstedt]]-Ost'' and ''[[Ostingersleben]]''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-paspoortcontrole-personenautos-04.JPG\nFile:Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-paspoortcontrole-vrachtautos.JPG\nFile:Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-lichtmast-commandotoren-brug.JPG\nFile:Grensovergang-helmstedt-marienborn-lichtmast-02.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==Fall of the Iron Curtain==\n{{Further|Eastern Bloc|Revolutions of 1989|Dissolution of the Soviet Union|European integration}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0419-014, Berlin, Loch in Mauer, Grenzsoldaten, Wachturm.jpg|thumb|East German border-guards look through a hole in the Berlin Wall in 1990]]\n[[File:EasternBloc PostDissolution2008.svg|thumb|The dissolution of the Eastern Bloc]]\n\nFollowing a period of [[Brezhnev stagnation|economic and political stagnation]] under Brezhnev and his immediate successors, the Soviet Union decreased its intervention in [[Eastern Bloc politics]].

Hungarian border guards had threatened to shoot anyone crossing the border, but when the time came, they did not intervene and allowed the people to cross. In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the [[Parliament of Hungary|Hungarian parliament]] adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election.<ref name=\"crampton394\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=394\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThe legislation transformed Hungary from a [[People's Republic of Hungary|People's Republic]] into the [[Republic of Hungary|Republic]], guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. In November 1989, following mass protests in [[East Germany]] and the relaxing of border restrictions in Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of [[East Berlin]]ers flooded checkpoints along the [[Berlin Wall]], crossing into [[West Berlin]].<ref name=\"crampton394\"/>\n\nIn the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], the day after the mass crossings across the Berlin Wall, leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted.<ref name=\"crampton395\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=395\u20136}}</ref> In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], following protests of an estimated half-million Czechoslovaks, the government permitted travel to the west and abolished provisions guaranteeing the ruling Communist party its leading role, preceding the [[Velvet Revolution]].<ref name=\"crampton398\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=398}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]], on 22 December 1989, the Romanian military sided with protesters and turned on Communist ruler [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu]], who was executed after a brief trial three days later.<ref name=\"crampton400\">{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=400}}</ref> In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.\n\nThe Berlin Wall officially remained guarded after 9 November 1989, although the inter-German border had become effectively meaningless. The official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military did not begin until June 1990. On 1 July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the [[Deutsche Mark|West German currency]], all border-controls ceased and West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.\n\n==Monuments==\n[[File:Iron Curtain - Hungary.jpg|thumb|Memorial in [[Budapest]] reads: \"''Iron Curtain 1949-1989''\"]]\nThere is an Iron Curtain monument in the southern part of the Czech Republic at approximately {{Coord|48.8755|15.87477|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Iron Curtain monument}}. A few hundred meters of the original fence, and one of the guard towers, has remained installed. There are interpretive signs in Czech and English that explain the history and significance of the Iron Curtain. This is the only surviving part of the fence in the Czech Republic, though several guard towers and bunkers can still be seen. Some of these are part of the Communist Era defences, some are from the never-used [[Czechoslovak border fortifications]] in defence against [[Adolf Hitler]], and some towers were, or have become, hunting platforms.\n\nAnother monument is located in [[Fert\u0151r\u00e1kos]], Hungary, at the site of the [[Pan-European Picnic]]. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by [[Gabriela von Habsburg]]. It is a column made of metal and barbed wire with the date of the Pan-European Picnic and the names of participants. On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text: ''In necessariis unitas \u2013 in dubiis libertas \u2013 in omnibus caritas'' (\"Unity in unavoidable matters \u2013 freedom in doubtful matters \u2013 love in all things\"). The memorial symbolises the Iron Curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.\n\nAnother monument is located in the village of [[Dev\u00edn]], now part of [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], at the confluence of the [[Danube]] and [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava]] rivers.\n\nThere are several open-air museums in parts of the former inner German border, as for example in Berlin and in [[M\u00f6dlareuth]], a village that has been divided for several hundred years. The memory of the division is being kept alive in many places along the ''Grenze''.\n\n==Analogous terms==\nThroughout the Cold War the term \"curtain\" would become a common euphemism for boundaries \u2013 physical or ideological \u2013 between communist and capitalist states.\n\n* An analogue of the Iron Curtain, the [[Bamboo Curtain]], surrounded the People's Republic of China.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=Cities>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=Lightning>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=SunSpencer>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.
