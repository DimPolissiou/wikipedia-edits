Kartini's father Sosroningrat became [[Regency (Indonesia)|Regency]] Chief of [[Jepara]]. Kartini's father was originally the district chief of Mayong. Her mother Ngasirah was the daughter of Madirono and a teacher of religion in Telukawur. She was his first wife but not the most important one. At this time, [[polygamy]] was a common practice among the nobility. Colonial regulations required a regency chief to marry a member of the nobility. Since Ngasirah was not of sufficiently high nobility,<ref>[http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/170/43/ Harvard Asia Quarterly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816165143/http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/170/43/ |date=August 16, 2006 }}</ref> Sosroningrat married a second time to Woerjan (Moerjam), a direct descendant of the [[Raja]] of [[Madura]]. After this second marriage, Kartini's father was elevated to Regency Chief of Jepara, replacing his second wife's own father, Tjitrowikromo.\n\nKartini was the fifth child and second-eldest daughter in a family of eleven, including half siblings. She was born into a family with a strong intellectual tradition. Her grandfather, Pangeran Ario Tjondronegoro IV, became a regency chief at the age of 25, while Kartini's older brother Sosrokartono was an accomplished [[linguistics|linguist]]. Kartini's family allowed her to attend school until she was 12 years old. Here, among other subjects, she learned to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]], an unusual accomplishment for Javanese women at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guratanpena.blogspot.com/2006_04_01_guratanpena_archive.html |title=RA. Kartini |publisher=Guratan Pena |date=April 27, 2006 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref> After she turned 12 she was secluded (''pingit'') at home, a common practice among Javanese nobility, to prepare young girls for their marriage.  During seclusion girls were not allowed to leave their parents' house until they were married, at which point authority over them was transferred to their husbands. Kartini's father was more lenient than some during his daughter's seclusion, giving her such privileges as embroidery lessons and occasional appearances in public for special events.\n\n[[File:Kartini1900s.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Letter by Kartini to Rosa Abendanon (fragment)]]\nDuring her seclusion, Kartini continued to educate herself on her own.  Because she could speak Dutch, she acquired several Dutch pen friends.  One of them, a girl by the name of [[Rosa Abendanon]], became a close friend. Books, newspapers, and European magazines fed Kartini's interest in [[Europe]]an [[feminism|feminist thinking]], and fostered the desire to improve the conditions of indigenous Indonesian women, who at that time had a very low social status.\n\nKartini's reading included the ''[[Semarang]]'' newspaper, to which she began to send contributions which were published. Before she was 20 she had read ''[[Max Havelaar]]'' and ''Love Letters'' by [[Multatuli]]. She also read ''De Stille Kracht (The Hidden Force)'' by [[Louis Couperus]], the works of [[Frederik van Eeden]], [[Augusta de Witt]], the Romantic-Feminist author [[Goekoop de-Jong Van Eek]], and an anti-war novel by [[Berta von Suttner]], ''Die Waffen Nieder! (Lay Down Your Arms!)''. All were in Dutch.\n\nKartini's concerns were not only in the area of the emancipation of women, but also other problems of her society. Kartini saw that the struggle for women to obtain their freedom, autonomy, and legal equality was just part of a wider movement.\n\nKartini's parents arranged her marriage to Joyodiningrat, the Regency Chief of [[Rembang]], who already had three wives. She was married on 12 November 1903. Her husband understood Kartini's aims and allowed her to establish a school for women in the east porch of the Rembang Regency Office complex. Kartini's only son was born on 13 September 1904. A few days later on 17 September 1904, Kartini died at the age of 25. She was buried in Bulu Village, Rembang.\n\nInspired by R.A. Kartini's example, the Van Deventer family established the R.A. Kartini Foundation which built schools for women, 'Kartini's Schools' in [[Semarang]] in 1912, followed by other women's schools in [[Surabaya]], [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Malang]], [[Madiun]], [[Cirebon]] and other areas.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Hari Kartini TMnr 60033701.jpg|thumb|Commemoration of Kartini Day in 1953]]\nIn 1964, President [[Sukarno]] declared R.A. Kartini's birth date, 21 April, as \"Kartini Day\"\u2014an Indonesian national holiday. This decision has been criticized. It has been proposed that Kartini Day should be celebrated in conjunction with Indonesian Mothers Day on 22 December, so that the choice of R.A. Kartini as a national heroine would not overshadow other women who, unlike R.A. Kartini, took up arms to oppose the colonizers.\n\nIn contrast, those who recognize the significance of R.A. Kartini argue that not only was she a feminist who elevated the status of women in Indonesia, she was also a [[nationalism|nationalist]] figure with new ideas, who struggled on behalf of her people and played a role in the [[Indonesian National Revolution|national struggle for independence]].\n\n==Letters==\n\nAfter Raden Adjeng Kartini died, Mr. J.H. Abendanon, the Minister for Culture, Religion, and Industry in the East Indies, collected and published the letters that Kartini had sent to her friends in Europe. The book was titled ''Door Duisternis tot Licht (Out of Dark Comes Light)'' and was published in 1911. It went through five editions, with some additional letters included in the final edition, and was translated into [[English language|English]] by Agnes L. Symmers and published under the title ''[[Letters of a Javanese Princess]]''.\n\nThe publication of R.A. Kartini's letters, written by a native Javanese woman, attracted great interest in the [[Netherlands]], and Kartini's ideas began to change the way the Dutch viewed native women in Java. Her ideas also provided inspiration for prominent figures in the fight for independence.\n\nThere are some grounds for doubting the veracity of R.A. Kartini's letters. There are allegations that Abendanon made them up. These suspicions arose because R.A. Kartini's book was published at a time when the Dutch colonial government was implementing its [[Dutch Ethical Policy]] in the Dutch East Indies, and Abendanon was one of the most prominent supporters of this policy. The current whereabouts of the vast majority of R.A. Kartini's letters are unknown. According to the late Sulastin Sutrisno, the Dutch Government has been unable to track down J. H. Abendanon's descendants.\n\n==Ideas==\n===Condition of Indonesian women===\nIn her letters, Raden Adjeng Kartini wrote about her views of the social conditions prevailing at that time, particularly the condition of native Indonesian women. Most of her letters protest the Javanese cultural tendency to impose obstacles on women's development. She wanted women to have the freedom to learn and study. R.A. Kartini wrote of her ideas and ambitions, including ''Zelf-ontwikkeling, Zelf-onderricht, Zelf-vertrouwen, Zelf-werkzaamheid'' and ''Solidariteit''. These ideas were all based on ''Religieusiteit, Wijsheid, en Schoonheid'', that is, belief in God, wisdom, and beauty, along with ''Humanitarianismus'' ([[humanitarianism]]) and ''Nationalismus' (nationalism).\n\nKartini's letters also expressed her hopes for support from overseas. In her correspondence with Estell \"Stella\" Zeehandelaar, R.A. Kartini expressed her desire to be like European youth. She depicted the sufferings of Javanese women fettered by tradition, unable to study, secluded, and who must be prepared to participate in polygamous marriages with men they don't know.\n\n===Vegetarianism===\nIt is known from her letters dated October 1902 to [[Jacques Henry Abendanon|Abendanon]] and her husband that at the age of 23, Raden Adjeng Kartini had a mind to live a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] life. \"It has been for some time that we are thinking to do it (to be a vegetarian), I have even eaten only vegetables for years now, but I still don't have enough moral courage to carry on. I am still too young,\" R.A. Kartini once wrote.\n\nShe also emphasized the relationship of this kind of life with religious thoughts. She is quoted, \"Living a life as a vegetarian is a wordless prayer to the Almighty.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Lukas Adi Prasetya |url=http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2010/04/21/08471776/Siapa.Menyangka |title=Siapa Menyangka RA Kartini Vegetarian |publisher=Kompas.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Further studies and teaching===\nR.A. Kartini loved her father deeply, although it is clear that her deep affection for him became yet another obstacle to the realization of her ambitions. He was progressive enough to allow his daughters schooling until the age of twelve, but at that point firmly closed the door to further schooling. In his letters, her father also expressed his affection for Kartini. Eventually, he gave permission for her to study to become a teacher in Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]), although previously he had prevented her from continuing her studies in the Netherlands or entering medical school in Batavia.\n\nR.A. Kartini's desire to continue her studies in Europe was also expressed in her letters. Several of her pen friends worked on her behalf to support Kartini in this endeavour. Many of her friends expressed their disappointment when Kartini's ambition was finally thwarted. In the end, her plans to study in Japan were changed into plans to journey to Tokyo, on the advice of Mrs. Abendanon that this would be best for R.A. Kartini and her younger sister, R. Ayu Rukmini.\n\nNevertheless, in 1903 at the age of 24, her plans to study to become a teacher in Tokyo came to nothing. In a letter to Mrs. Abendanon, R.A. Kartini wrote that the plan had been abandoned because she was going to be married: ''\"In short, I no longer desire to take advantage of this opportunity, because I am to be married.\"''. This was despite the fact that, for its part, the Dutch Education Department had finally given permission for R.A. Kartini and R.Ay. Rukmini to study in Batavia.\n\nAs the wedding approached, R.A. Kartini's attitude towards Javanese traditional customs began to change. She became more tolerant. She began to feel that her marriage would bring good fortune for her ambition to develop a school for native women. In her letters, she mentioned that not only did her esteemed husband support her desire to develop the woodcarving industry in Jepara and the school for native women, but she also mentioned that she was going to write a book. Sadly, this ambition was unrealized as a result of her premature death in 1904 at age 25.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Kartini Schools]] named for her opened in Bogor, Jakarta, and [[Malang]]. A society named for her was also established in the Netherlands.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MTTaAsSPsCkC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=Katrini+school+Dutch+east+indies&source=bl&ots=JjodeZD_pf&sig=mzds6Ytaqt5onj3nSEzjey2M9Jo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFUQ6AEwDGoVChMIv9OgxKO_xwIVg9ceCh2nfAbh#v=onepage&q=Katrini%20school%20Dutch%20east%20indies&f=false Ideology and Revolution in Southeast Asia 1900-75] by Clive J Christie, Clive J.

Abendanon's descendants.\n\n==Ideas==\n===Condition of Indonesian women===\nIn her letters, Raden Adjeng Kartini wrote about her views of the social conditions prevailing at that time, particularly the condition of native Indonesian women. Most of her letters protest the Javanese cultural tendency to impose obstacles on women's development. She wanted women to have the freedom to learn and study. R.A. Kartini wrote of her ideas and ambitions, including ''Zelf-ontwikkeling, Zelf-onderricht, Zelf-vertrouwen, Zelf-werkzaamheid'' and ''Solidariteit''. These ideas were all based on ''Religieusiteit, Wijsheid, en Schoonheid'', that is, belief in God, wisdom, and beauty, along with ''Humanitarianismus'' ([[humanitarianism]]) and ''Nationalismus' (nationalism).\n\nKartini's letters also expressed her hopes for support from overseas. In her correspondence with Estell \"Stella\" Zeehandelaar, R.A. Kartini expressed her desire to be like European youth. She depicted the sufferings of Javanese women fettered by tradition, unable to study, secluded, and who must be prepared to participate in polygamous marriages with men they don't know.\n\n===Vegetarianism===\nIt is known from her letters dated October 1902 to [[Jacques Henry Abendanon|Abendanon]] and her husband that at the age of 23, Raden Adjeng Kartini had a mind to live a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] life. \"It has been for some time that we are thinking to do it (to be a vegetarian), I have even eaten only vegetables for years now, but I still don't have enough moral courage to carry on. I am still too young,\" R.A. Kartini once wrote.\n\nShe also emphasized the relationship of this kind of life with religious thoughts. She is quoted, \"Living a life as a vegetarian is a wordless prayer to the Almighty.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Lukas Adi Prasetya |url=http://nasional.kompas.com/read/2010/04/21/08471776/Siapa.Menyangka |title=Siapa Menyangka RA Kartini Vegetarian |publisher=Kompas.com |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Further studies and teaching===\nR.A. Kartini loved her father deeply, although it is clear that her deep affection for him became yet another obstacle to the realization of her ambitions. He was progressive enough to allow his daughters schooling until the age of twelve, but at that point firmly closed the door to further schooling. In his letters, her father also expressed his affection for Kartini. Eventually, he gave permission for her to study to become a teacher in Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]), although previously he had prevented her from continuing her studies in the Netherlands or entering medical school in Batavia.\n\nR.A. Kartini's desire to continue her studies in Europe was also expressed in her letters. Several of her pen friends worked on her behalf to support Kartini in this endeavour. Many of her friends expressed their disappointment when Kartini's ambition was finally thwarted. In the end, her plans to study in Japan were changed into plans to journey to Tokyo, on the advice of Mrs. Abendanon that this would be best for R.A. Kartini and her younger sister, R. Ayu Rukmini.\n\nNevertheless, in 1903 at the age of 24, her plans to study to become a teacher in Tokyo came to nothing. In a letter to Mrs. Abendanon, R.A. Kartini wrote that the plan had been abandoned because she was going to be married: ''\"In short, I no longer desire to take advantage of this opportunity, because I am to be married.\"''. This was despite the fact that, for its part, the Dutch Education Department had finally given permission for R.A. Kartini and R.Ay. Rukmini to study in Batavia.\n\nAs the wedding approached, R.A. Kartini's attitude towards Javanese traditional customs began to change. She became more tolerant. She began to feel that her marriage would bring good fortune for her ambition to develop a school for native women. In her letters, she mentioned that not only did her esteemed husband support her desire to develop the woodcarving industry in Jepara and the school for native women, but she also mentioned that she was going to write a book. Sadly, this ambition was unrealized as a result of her premature death in 1904 at age 25.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Kartini Schools]] named for her opened in Bogor, Jakarta, and [[Malang]].

Based on available observational evidence, deciding the fate and evolution of the universe have now become valid cosmological questions, being beyond the mostly untestable constraints of mythological or theological beliefs. Many possible futures have been predicted by different scientific hypotheses, including that the universe might have existed for a finite and infinite duration, or towards explaining the manner and circumstances of its beginning.\n\nObservations made by [[Edwin Hubble]] during the 1920s\u20131950s found that galaxies appeared to be moving away from each other, leading to the currently accepted [[Big Bang theory]]. This suggests that the universe began \u2013 very small and very dense \u2013 about [[Age of universe|13.8 billion years]] ago, and it has expanded and (on average) become less dense ever since.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wollack|first=Edward J.|title=Cosmology: The Study of the Universe|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|work=Universe 101: Big Bang Theory|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=10 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230003/http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/|archivedate=14 May 2011}}</ref> Confirmation of the Big Bang mostly depends on knowing the rate of expansion, average density of matter, and the physical properties of the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass\u2013energy]] in the universe.\n\nThere is a strong consensus among [[cosmologists]] that the universe is considered \"flat\" (see [[Shape of the universe]]) and will continue to expand forever.<ref name=\"Will the Universe expand forever\">{{cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html|title=WMAP- Shape of the Universe|author=|date=|website=map.gsfc.nasa.gov}}</ref><ref name=\"map.gsfc.nasa.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html|title=WMAP- Fate of the Universe|author=|date=|website=map.gsfc.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFactors that need to be considered in determining the universe's origin and ultimate fate include: the average motions of galaxies, the shape and structure of the universe, and the amount of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] that the universe contains.\n\n==Emerging scientific basis==\n{{See also|Timeline of cosmological theories|Chronology of the universe}}\n\n===Theory===\n\nThe theoretical scientific exploration of the ultimate fate of the universe became possible with [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1915 theory of [[general relativity]]. General relativity can be employed to describe the universe on the largest possible scale. There are many possible solutions to the equations of general relativity, and each solution implies a possible ultimate fate of the universe.\n\n[[Alexander Friedmann]] proposed several [[Friedmann equations|solution]]s in 1922, as did [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] in 1927.<ref name=Lemaitre1927>{{Cite journal | last=Lema\u00eetre | first=Georges | author-link=Georges Lema\u00eetre | title=Un univers homog\u00e8ne de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des n\u00e9buleuses extra-galactiques | date=1927 | journal=Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Scientifique de Bruxelles | volume=A47 | pages=49\u201356 | bibcode=1927ASSB...47...49L }} ''translated by [[A.

From then on, the ''beginning'' of the universe and its possible ''end'' have been the subjects of serious scientific investigation.\n\n===Big Bang and Steady State theories===\nIn 1927, [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] set out a theory that has since come to be called the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe.<ref name=Lemaitre1927 /> In 1948, [[Fred Hoyle]] set out his opposing [[Steady state model|Steady State theory]] in which the universe continually expanded but remained statistically unchanged as new matter is constantly created. These two theories were active contenders until the 1965 discovery, by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]], of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation, a fact that is a straightforward prediction of the Big Bang theory, and one that the original Steady State theory could not account for. As a result, the Big Bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe.\n\n===Cosmological constant===\nWhen Einstein formulated [[general relativity]], he and his contemporaries believed in a [[static universe]]. When Einstein found that his equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding now, and to contract in the far future, he added to those equations what he called a [[cosmological constant]], essentially a constant energy density unaffected by any expansion or contraction, whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static. After Hubble announced his conclusion that the universe was expanding, Einstein wrote that his cosmological constant was \"the greatest blunder of my life.\"<ref>[http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/dark_energy/de-did_einstein_predict.php Did Einstein Predict Dark Energy?], hubblesite.org</ref>\n\n===Density parameter===\nAn important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the [[density parameter]], omega (<math>\\Omega</math>), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density. This selects one of three possible [[Shape of the universe|geometries]] depending on whether <math>\\Omega</math> is equal to, less than, or greater than <math>1</math>. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes. These three adjectives refer to the overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]], and not to the local curving of [[spacetime]] caused by smaller clumps of mass (for example, [[galaxies]] and [[star]]s). If the primary content of the universe is inert matter, as in the [[dust solution|dust models]] popular for much of the 20th century, there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry. Hence cosmologists aimed to determine the fate of the universe by measuring <math>\\Omega</math>, or equivalently the rate at which the expansion was decelerating.\n\n===Repulsive force===\nStarting in 1998, observations of [[supernova]]s in distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] have been interpreted as consistent<ref>{{cite journal|title=Supernovae, an accelerating universe and the cosmological constant|first=Robert P.|last=Kirshner|date=13 April 1999|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=96|issue=8|pages=4224\u20134227|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.8.4224|pmid=10200242|pmc=33557|bibcode=1999PNAS...96.4224K}}</ref> with a universe whose [[accelerating universe|expansion is accelerating]]. Subsequent cosmological theorizing has been designed so as to allow for this possible acceleration, nearly always by invoking [[dark energy]], which in its simplest form is just a positive cosmological constant. In general, dark energy is a catch-all term for any hypothesised field with negative pressure, usually with a density that changes as the universe expands.\n\n==Role of the shape of the universe==\n{{See also|Shape of the universe}}\n\n[[File:Friedmann universes.svg|thumb|400px|The ultimate fate of an expanding universe depends on the matter density <math>\\Omega _M</math> and the dark energy density <math>\\Omega _\\Lambda</math>]]\n\nThe current scientific consensus of most cosmologists is that the ultimate fate of the universe depends on its overall shape, how much [[dark energy]] it contains, and on the [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] which determines how the dark energy density responds to the expansion of the universe.<ref name=\"map.gsfc.nasa.gov\"/> Recent observations conclude, from [[Graphical timeline of the Big Bang|7.5 billion years]] after the Big Bang, that the expansion rate of the universe has likely been increasing, commensurate with the Open Universe theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy/|title=Dark Energy, Dark Matter - Science Mission Directorate|author=|date=|website=science.nasa.gov}}</ref> However, other recent measurements by [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] suggest that the universe is either flat or very close to flat.<ref name=\"Will the Universe expand forever\"/>\n\n===Closed universe===\nIf <math>\\Omega > 1</math>, then the geometry of space is closed like the surface of a sphere. The sum of the angles of a triangle exceeds 180 degrees and there are no parallel lines; all lines eventually meet. The geometry of the universe is, at least on a very large scale, [[elliptic geometry|elliptic]].\n\nIn a closed universe, gravity eventually stops the expansion of the universe, after which it starts to contract until all matter in the universe collapses to a point, a final singularity termed the \"[[Big Crunch]]\", the opposite of the Big Bang. Some new modern theories assume the universe may have a significant amount of dark energy, whose repulsive force may be sufficient to cause the expansion of the universe to continue forever\u2014even if <math>\\Omega > 1</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryden|first=Barbara|title=Introduction to Cosmology|publisher=The Ohio State University|page=56}}</ref>\n\n===Open universe===\nIf <math>\\Omega < 1</math>, the geometry of space is [[shape of the universe|open]], i.e., negatively curved like the surface of a saddle. The angles of a triangle sum to less than 180 degrees, and lines that do not meet are never equidistant; they have a point of least distance and otherwise grow apart. The geometry of such a universe is [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]].\n\nEven without dark energy, a negatively curved universe expands forever, with gravity negligibly slowing the rate of expansion.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} With dark energy, the expansion not only continues but accelerates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The ultimate fate of an open universe is either universal [[heat death of the universe|heat death]], the \"[[future of an expanding universe|Big Freeze]]\",<!-- Not the same as a heat death - see below --> or the \"[[Big Rip]]\",{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} where the acceleration caused by dark energy eventually becomes so strong that it completely overwhelms the effects of the [[gravity|gravitational]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[strong force|strong]] binding forces.\n\nConversely, a ''negative'' [[cosmological constant]], which would correspond to a negative energy density and positive pressure, would cause even an open universe to re-collapse to a big crunch. This option has been ruled out by observations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Flat universe===\nIf the average density of the universe exactly equals the critical density so that <math>\\Omega = 1</math>, then the geometry of the universe is flat: as in [[Euclidean geometry]], the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and parallel lines continuously maintain the same distance. Measurements from [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] have confirmed the universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.<ref name=\"Will the Universe expand forever\"/>\n\nIn absence of dark energy, a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate, with expansion asymptotically approaching zero.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} With dark energy, the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down, due to the effect of gravity, but eventually increases.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} The ultimate fate of the universe is the same as an open universe.\n\n==Theories about the end of the universe==\nThe fate of the universe is determined by its density.

A steady increase in the Hubble constant to infinity would result in all material objects in the universe, starting with galaxies and eventually (in a finite time) all forms, no matter how small,  disintegrating into unbound [[elementary particles]], radiation and beyond. As the energy density, scale factor and expansion rate become infinite the universe ends as what is effectively a singularity.\n\nIn the special case of [[phantom energy|phantom dark energy]], which has supposed negative kinetic energy that would result in a higher rate of acceleration than other cosmological constants predict, a more sudden big rip could occur.\n\n===Big Crunch===\n{{Main|Big Crunch}}\n\n[[File:Big crunch.png|256px|right|thumb|The Big Crunch. The vertical axis can be considered as expansion or contraction with time.]]\n\nThe [[Big Crunch]] hypothesis is a symmetric view of the ultimate fate of the universe. Just as the Big Bang started as a cosmological expansion, this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and begin contracting. The end result is unknown; a simple estimation would have all the matter and space-time in the universe collapse into a dimensionless [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] back into how the universe started with the Big Bang, but at these scales unknown quantum effects need to be considered (see [[Quantum gravity]]). Recent evidence suggests that this scenario is not likely but it has not been ruled out as measurements are only available over a short period of time and could reverse in the future.<ref name=\"astro-ph/0409264\"/>\n\nThis scenario allows the Big Bang to occur immediately after the Big Crunch of a preceding universe. If this happens repeatedly, it creates a [[cyclic model]], which is also known as an oscillatory universe. The universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes, with each finite universe ending with a Big Crunch that is also the Big Bang of the next universe. Theoretically, the cyclic universe could not{{vague|could not = \"might not\" or \"cannot\"?|date=January 2019}} be reconciled with the [[second law of thermodynamics]]: entropy would build up from oscillation to oscillation and cause [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]. Current evidence also indicates the universe is not [[shape of the universe|closed]]. This has caused cosmologists to abandon the oscillating universe model. A somewhat similar idea is embraced by the [[cyclic model]], but this idea evades [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]] because of an expansion of the [[brane]]s that dilutes entropy accumulated in the previous cycle.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Big Bounce===\n{{Main|Big Bounce}}\n\nThe [[Big Bounce]] is a theorized scientific model related to the beginning of the known universe. It derives from the oscillatory universe or cyclic repetition interpretation of the Big Bang where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe.\n\nAccording to one version of the Big Bang theory of cosmology, in the beginning the universe was infinitely dense. Such a description seems to be at odds with other more widely accepted theories, especially quantum mechanics and its [[uncertainty principle]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It is not surprising, therefore, that quantum mechanics has given rise to an alternative version of the Big Bang theory. Also, if the universe is closed, this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the Big Bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion.\n\nIn simple terms, this theory states that the universe will continuously repeat the cycle of a Big Bang, followed up with a Big Crunch.\n\n===Big Slurp===\n{{Main|False vacuum}}\n\nThis theory posits that the universe currently exists in a false vacuum and that it could become a true vacuum at any moment.\n\nIn order to best understand the false vacuum collapse theory, one must first understand the Higgs field which permeates the universe. Much like an electromagnetic field, it varies in strength based upon its potential. A true vacuum exists so long as the universe exists in its lowest energy state, in which case the false vacuum theory is irrelevant. However, if the vacuum is not in its lowest energy state (a [[false vacuum]]), it could [[quantum tunnelling|tunnel]] into a lower energy state.<ref name=\"fate\">\n* {{cite journal | author = M.

But as the name is meant to imply, very little is currently known about the physics of [[dark energy]]. If the theory of [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] is true, the universe went through an episode dominated by a different form of dark energy in the first moments of the Big Bang; but inflation ended, indicating an equation of state far more complex than those assumed so far for present-day dark energy. It is possible that the dark energy equation of state could change again resulting in an event that would have consequences which are extremely difficult to predict or parametrize. As the nature of dark energy and dark matter remain enigmatic, even hypothetical, the possibilities surrounding their coming role in the universe are currently unknown.\n\n== Observational constraints on theories ==\nChoosing among these rival scenarios is done by 'weighing' the universe, for example, measuring the relative contributions of [[matter]], [[radiation]], [[dark matter]], and [[dark energy]] to the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]].

Based on available observational evidence, deciding the fate and evolution of the universe have now become valid cosmological questions, being beyond the mostly untestable constraints of mythological or theological beliefs.

These two theories were active contenders until the 1965 discovery, by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]], of the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation, a fact that is a straightforward prediction of the Big Bang theory, and one that the original Steady State theory could not account for. As a result, the Big Bang theory quickly became the most widely held view of the origin of the universe.\n\n===Cosmological constant===\nWhen Einstein formulated [[general relativity]], he and his contemporaries believed in a [[static universe]]. When Einstein found that his equations could easily be solved in such a way as to allow the universe to be expanding now, and to contract in the far future, he added to those equations what he called a [[cosmological constant]], essentially a constant energy density unaffected by any expansion or contraction, whose role was to offset the effect of gravity on the universe as a whole in such a way that the universe would remain static. After Hubble announced his conclusion that the universe was expanding, Einstein wrote that his cosmological constant was \"the greatest blunder of my life.\"<ref>[http://hubblesite.org/hubble_discoveries/dark_energy/de-did_einstein_predict.php Did Einstein Predict Dark Energy?], hubblesite.org</ref>\n\n===Density parameter===\nAn important parameter in fate of the universe theory is the [[density parameter]], omega (<math>\\Omega</math>), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical value of that density.

These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes. These three adjectives refer to the overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]], and not to the local curving of [[spacetime]] caused by smaller clumps of mass (for example, [[galaxies]] and [[star]]s). If the primary content of the universe is inert matter, as in the [[dust solution|dust models]] popular for much of the 20th century, there is a particular fate corresponding to each geometry. Hence cosmologists aimed to determine the fate of the universe by measuring <math>\\Omega</math>, or equivalently the rate at which the expansion was decelerating.\n\n===Repulsive force===\nStarting in 1998, observations of [[supernova]]s in distant [[galaxy|galaxies]] have been interpreted as consistent<ref>{{cite journal|title=Supernovae, an accelerating universe and the cosmological constant|first=Robert P.|last=Kirshner|date=13 April 1999|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=96|issue=8|pages=4224\u20134227|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.8.4224|pmid=10200242|pmc=33557|bibcode=1999PNAS...96.4224K}}</ref> with a universe whose [[accelerating universe|expansion is accelerating]]. Subsequent cosmological theorizing has been designed so as to allow for this possible acceleration, nearly always by invoking [[dark energy]], which in its simplest form is just a positive cosmological constant.

A steady increase in the Hubble constant to infinity would result in all material objects in the universe, starting with galaxies and eventually (in a finite time) all forms, no matter how small,  disintegrating into unbound [[elementary particles]], radiation and beyond. As the energy density, scale factor and expansion rate become infinite the universe ends as what is effectively a singularity.\n\nIn the special case of [[phantom energy|phantom dark energy]], which has supposed negative kinetic energy that would result in a higher rate of acceleration than other cosmological constants predict, a more sudden big rip could occur.\n\n===Big Crunch===\n{{Main|Big Crunch}}\n\n[[File:Big crunch.png|256px|right|thumb|The Big Crunch. The vertical axis can be considered as expansion or contraction with time.]]\n\nThe [[Big Crunch]] hypothesis is a symmetric view of the ultimate fate of the universe. Just as the Big Bang started as a cosmological expansion, this theory assumes that the average density of the universe will be enough to stop its expansion and begin contracting. The end result is unknown; a simple estimation would have all the matter and space-time in the universe collapse into a dimensionless [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] back into how the universe started with the Big Bang, but at these scales unknown quantum effects need to be considered (see [[Quantum gravity]]). Recent evidence suggests that this scenario is not likely but it has not been ruled out as measurements are only available over a short period of time and could reverse in the future.<ref name=\"astro-ph/0409264\"/>\n\nThis scenario allows the Big Bang to occur immediately after the Big Crunch of a preceding universe. If this happens repeatedly, it creates a [[cyclic model]], which is also known as an oscillatory universe. The universe could then consist of an infinite sequence of finite universes, with each finite universe ending with a Big Crunch that is also the Big Bang of the next universe. Theoretically, the cyclic universe could not{{vague|could not = \"might not\" or \"cannot\"?|date=January 2019}} be reconciled with the [[second law of thermodynamics]]: entropy would build up from oscillation to oscillation and cause [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]. Current evidence also indicates the universe is not [[shape of the universe|closed]]. This has caused cosmologists to abandon the oscillating universe model. A somewhat similar idea is embraced by the [[cyclic model]], but this idea evades [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]] because of an expansion of the [[brane]]s that dilutes entropy accumulated in the previous cycle.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Big Bounce===\n{{Main|Big Bounce}}\n\nThe [[Big Bounce]] is a theorized scientific model related to the beginning of the known universe. It derives from the oscillatory universe or cyclic repetition interpretation of the Big Bang where the first cosmological event was the result of the collapse of a previous universe.\n\nAccording to one version of the Big Bang theory of cosmology, in the beginning the universe was infinitely dense. Such a description seems to be at odds with other more widely accepted theories, especially quantum mechanics and its [[uncertainty principle]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} It is not surprising, therefore, that quantum mechanics has given rise to an alternative version of the Big Bang theory. Also, if the universe is closed, this theory would predict that once this universe collapses it will spawn another universe in an event similar to the Big Bang after a universal singularity is reached or a repulsive quantum force causes re-expansion.\n\nIn simple terms, this theory states that the universe will continuously repeat the cycle of a Big Bang, followed up with a Big Crunch.\n\n===Big Slurp===\n{{Main|False vacuum}}\n\nThis theory posits that the universe currently exists in a false vacuum and that it could become a true vacuum at any moment.\n\nIn order to best understand the false vacuum collapse theory, one must first understand the Higgs field which permeates the universe. Much like an electromagnetic field, it varies in strength based upon its potential. A true vacuum exists so long as the universe exists in its lowest energy state, in which case the false vacuum theory is irrelevant. However, if the vacuum is not in its lowest energy state (a [[false vacuum]]), it could [[quantum tunnelling|tunnel]] into a lower energy state.<ref name=\"fate\">\n* {{cite journal | author = M.

But as the name is meant to imply, very little is currently known about the physics of [[dark energy]]. If the theory of [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] is true, the universe went through an episode dominated by a different form of dark energy in the first moments of the Big Bang; but inflation ended, indicating an equation of state far more complex than those assumed so far for present-day dark energy. It is possible that the dark energy equation of state could change again resulting in an event that would have consequences which are extremely difficult to predict or parametrize. As the nature of dark energy and dark matter remain enigmatic, even hypothetical, the possibilities surrounding their coming role in the universe are currently unknown.\n\n== Observational constraints on theories ==\nChoosing among these rival scenarios is done by 'weighing' the universe, for example, measuring the relative contributions of [[matter]], [[radiation]], [[dark matter]], and [[dark energy]] to the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]].

He arrived in the United States in 1978, attended [[Rutgers University]], where he studied biology and philosophy and worked in the Drosophila laboratory of William Sofer. After that he pursued graduate studies in [[Human Genetics]] at the [[University of Utah]]. There, he worked with Raymond White, one of the pioneers of modern [[Human Genetics]].\n\nHis graduate work showed that [[epigenetic]] patterns of [[DNA methylation]] can be polymorphic and that they are inherited in a Mendelian fashion.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silva | first1 = A.J. | last2 = White | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Inheritance of allelic blueprints for methylation patterns | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 145\u201352 | pmid = 2898978 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(88)90546-6}}</ref> During his graduate studies he became intrigued by the inner processes of science, and organized yearly graduate symposia where leading scientists shared their insights on this subject.

Initially, the Silva laboratory focused its studies on molecular and cellular mechanisms of hippocampal learning and memory.  For example, Rousudan Bourtchuladze led a project in the Silva laboratory that uncovered a role for the transcription factor [[CREB]] in the stability of hippocampal [[long term potentiation]] and long-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bourtchuladze | first1 = R. | last2 = Frenguelli | first2 = B. | last3 = Blendy | first3 = J. | last4 = Cioffi | first4 = D. | last5 = Schutz | first5 = G. | last6 = Silva | first6 = A.J. | year = 1994 | title = Deficient long-term memory in mice with a targeted mutation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 59\u201368 | pmid = 7923378 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90400-6}}</ref> This was the first report of a genetic manipulation that affected the stability of [[synaptic plasticity]] and specifically long-. but not short-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silva | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Kogan | first2 = J.H. | last3 = Frankland | first3 = P.W. | last4 = Kida | first4 = S. | year = 1998 | title = CREB and memory | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24692813ca8bce83218ebd02789bd0a0d75cb799| journal = Annu Rev Neurosci | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 127\u201348 | doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.21.1.127| pmid = 9530494 }}</ref> Other notable studies of memory mechanisms in the early years of the Silva laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor included the discovery that hippocampal pre-synaptic short-term plasticity mechanisms have a role in hippocampal learning and memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silva | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Rosahl | first2 = T.W. | last3 = Chapman | first3 = P.F. | last4 = Marowitz | first4 = Z. | last5 = Friedman | first5 = E. | last6 = Frankland | first6 = P.W. | last7 = Cestari | first7 = V. | last8 = Cioffi | first8 = D. | last9 = Sudhof | first9 = T.C. | last10 = Bourtchuladze | first10 = R. | year = 1996 | title = Impaired learning in mice with abnormal short-lived plasticity | url = | journal = Curr Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 11| pages = 1509\u201318 | pmid = 8939606 | doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(96)00756-7}}</ref> This early work with hippocampal mutations that affected long term potentiation  and learning & memory became the basis for a large literature that now has definitively implicated stable changes in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region in hippocampal dependent learning and memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Y-S | last2 = Silva | first2 = AJ | date = Feb 2009 | title = The molecular and cellular biology of enhanced cognition | journal = Nat Rev Neurosci | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 126\u201340 | pmid = 19153576 | doi=10.1038/nrn2572 | pmc=2664745}}</ref>\n\n== Move to UCLA ==\nIn 1998 the Silva laboratory moved to the Department of Neurobiology at the UCLA School of Medicine. There, the laboratory  bridged their growing involvement in animal models of cognitive disorders with clinical studies. Additionally, UCLA's large and highly collaborative neuroscience community was an ideal environment for the interdisciplinary studies that characterized work in the Silva laboratory.  The Silva laboratory became more involved in studying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficits in genetic [[neurodevelopmental disorders]]. In the late nineties, cognitive deficits associated with this class of disorders were thought to be caused by genetic disruptions of brain development <ref name=\"Ehninger\">Ehninger, D., Li, W, Fox, K, Stryker, MP, and Silva, AJ.

A shared neural ensemble links distinct contextual memories encoded close in time. Nature 2016 May 23;534(7605):115-8</ref><ref name=\"PMID_28632232\"/> They showed that one memory triggers the activation of CREB and subsequent enhancements in excitability in a subset of neurons of a neuronetwork, so that a subsequent memory, even many hours later, can be directed or allocated to some of the same neurons that encoded the first memory. Later on, recall of the first memory triggers the activation of those neurons and therefore the reactivation and retrieval of the second memory. These results represent the first molecular, cellular and circuit mechanism underlying the linking of memories across time. These authors also showed that memory linking mechanisms are affected in the aging brain, and that manipulating excitability in a subset of neurons reverses these deficits. Impairments in CREB and neuronal excitability in aging likely underlie these abnormalities in memory linking. It is possible that problems with memory linking may underlie well-known source memory problems ([[source amnesia]]) associated with aging.

Oxford: Oxford University Press</ref> They propose that these maps of research findings would also be invaluable during experiment planning: Understanding more objectively the implications of the millions of neuroscience papers already published would allow neuroscientists to more clearly define what to do next. Landreth and Silva propose that quantitative maps of research findings will be to experiment planning in neuroscience what statistics is to experiment analyses: a tool that will help neuroscientists judge the likelihood that a series of planned experiments will contribute to the research record. As a first step towards the generation of these maps, Landreth and Silva developed a way to classify the many millions of experiments in neuroscience into a small number of categories that are critical for the generation of these maps. To generate these maps, Landreth and Silva also developed a set of algorithms that formalize strategies neuroscientists use to determine the strength of evidence in their fields.  These algorithms are used  to represent the experiments in networks of causally connected phenomena (i.e., research maps). Pranay Doshi and colleagues in the Silva Lab developed a completely free app (www.ResearchMaps.org) that helps researchers generate these maps. Data from individual research articles is entered into a [[relational database]], and the app can generate maps not only for experimental findings in single research articles, but also for combinations of findings associated with different articles. The user can query the app and tailor-make specific maps that can then be used for experiment planning.\n\n== Awards ==\n* Klingenstein Foundation, 1993\n* [[Beckman Young Investigators Award]],

He left Africa when he was only 12 and in Portugal he went through the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974.  He arrived in the United States in 1978, attended [[Rutgers University]], where he studied biology and philosophy and worked in the Drosophila laboratory of William Sofer. After that he pursued graduate studies in [[Human Genetics]] at the [[University of Utah]]. There, he worked with Raymond White, one of the pioneers of modern [[Human Genetics]].\n\nHis graduate work showed that [[epigenetic]] patterns of [[DNA methylation]] can be polymorphic and that they are inherited in a Mendelian fashion.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silva | first1 = A.J. | last2 = White | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Inheritance of allelic blueprints for methylation patterns | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 145\u201352 | pmid = 2898978 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(88)90546-6}}</ref> During his graduate studies he became intrigued by the inner processes of science, and organized yearly graduate symposia where leading scientists shared their insights on this subject.  It was in Utah that he realized that he could combine his passion for biology with his interest in [[epistemology]].<ref>Silva, A.J. and R.

''Trends Neurosci'' 1994; 17(2): p. 71-5.</ref> This interdisciplinary integration of molecular, electrophysiological and behavioral approaches, fostered by transgenic techniques, has become a mainstay of neuroscience studies.\n\n== The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory years==\nAfter spending three years in the Tonegawa laboratory, Silva set up his own laboratory at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in Long Island, New York, a research institute then run by [[James Watson]], best known as the co-discoverer of the structure of [[DNA]] in 1953 with [[Francis Crick]]. Initially, the Silva laboratory focused its studies on molecular and cellular mechanisms of hippocampal learning and memory.  For example, Rousudan Bourtchuladze led a project in the Silva laboratory that uncovered a role for the transcription factor [[CREB]] in the stability of hippocampal [[long term potentiation]] and long-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bourtchuladze | first1 = R. | last2 = Frenguelli | first2 = B. | last3 = Blendy | first3 = J. | last4 = Cioffi | first4 = D. | last5 = Schutz | first5 = G. | last6 = Silva | first6 = A.J. | year = 1994 | title = Deficient long-term memory in mice with a targeted mutation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 59\u201368 | pmid = 7923378 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90400-6}}</ref> This was the first report of a genetic manipulation that affected the stability of [[synaptic plasticity]] and specifically long-. but not short-term memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silva | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Kogan | first2 = J.H. | last3 = Frankland | first3 = P.W. | last4 = Kida | first4 = S. | year = 1998 | title = CREB and memory | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/24692813ca8bce83218ebd02789bd0a0d75cb799| journal = Annu Rev Neurosci | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 127\u201348 | doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.21.1.127| pmid = 9530494 }}</ref> Other notable studies of memory mechanisms in the early years of the Silva laboratory in Cold Spring Harbor included the discovery that hippocampal pre-synaptic short-term plasticity mechanisms have a role in hippocampal learning and memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Silva | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Rosahl | first2 = T.W. | last3 = Chapman | first3 = P.F. | last4 = Marowitz | first4 = Z. | last5 = Friedman | first5 = E. | last6 = Frankland | first6 = P.W. | last7 = Cestari | first7 = V. | last8 = Cioffi | first8 = D. | last9 = Sudhof | first9 = T.C. | last10 = Bourtchuladze | first10 = R. | year = 1996 | title = Impaired learning in mice with abnormal short-lived plasticity | url = | journal = Curr Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 11| pages = 1509\u201318 | pmid = 8939606 | doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(96)00756-7}}</ref> This early work with hippocampal mutations that affected long term potentiation  and learning & memory became the basis for a large literature that now has definitively implicated stable changes in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region in hippocampal dependent learning and memory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = Y-S | last2 = Silva | first2 = AJ | date = Feb 2009 | title = The molecular and cellular biology of enhanced cognition | journal = Nat Rev Neurosci | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 126\u201340 | pmid = 19153576 | doi=10.1038/nrn2572 | pmc=2664745}}</ref>\n\n== Move to UCLA ==\nIn 1998 the Silva laboratory moved to the Department of Neurobiology at the UCLA School of Medicine. There, the laboratory  bridged their growing involvement in animal models of cognitive disorders with clinical studies. Additionally, UCLA's large and highly collaborative neuroscience community was an ideal environment for the interdisciplinary studies that characterized work in the Silva laboratory.  The Silva laboratory became more involved in studying molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficits in genetic [[neurodevelopmental disorders]]. In the late nineties, cognitive deficits associated with this class of disorders were thought to be caused by genetic disruptions of brain development <ref name=\"Ehninger\">Ehninger, D., Li, W, Fox, K, Stryker, MP, and Silva, AJ.

A shared neural ensemble links distinct contextual memories encoded close in time. Nature 2016 May 23;534(7605):115-8</ref><ref name=\"PMID_28632232\"/> They showed that one memory triggers the activation of CREB and subsequent enhancements in excitability in a subset of neurons of a neuronetwork, so that a subsequent memory, even many hours later, can be directed or allocated to some of the same neurons that encoded the first memory. Later on, recall of the first memory triggers the activation of those neurons and therefore the reactivation and retrieval of the second memory. These results represent the first molecular, cellular and circuit mechanism underlying the linking of memories across time. These authors also showed that memory linking mechanisms are affected in the aging brain, and that manipulating excitability in a subset of neurons reverses these deficits. Impairments in CREB and neuronal excitability in aging likely underlie these abnormalities in memory linking. It is possible that problems with memory linking may underlie well-known source memory problems ([[source amnesia]]) associated with aging.

Landreth and Silva propose that quantitative maps of research findings will be to experiment planning in neuroscience what statistics is to experiment analyses: a tool that will help neuroscientists judge the likelihood that a series of planned experiments will contribute to the research record. As a first step towards the generation of these maps, Landreth and Silva developed a way to classify the many millions of experiments in neuroscience into a small number of categories that are critical for the generation of these maps. To generate these maps, Landreth and Silva also developed a set of algorithms that formalize strategies neuroscientists use to determine the strength of evidence in their fields.  These algorithms are used  to represent the experiments in networks of causally connected phenomena (i.e., research maps). Pranay Doshi and colleagues in the Silva Lab developed a completely free app (www.ResearchMaps.org) that helps researchers generate these maps. Data from individual research articles is entered into a [[relational database]], and the app can generate maps not only for experimental findings in single research articles, but also for combinations of findings associated with different articles. The user can query the app and tailor-make specific maps that can then be used for experiment planning.\n\n== Awards ==\n* Klingenstein Foundation, 1993\n* [[Beckman Young Investigators Award]],

Since its rebrand in 2011, the channel timeshared with [[Comedy Central (Dutch TV channel)|Comedy Central]], replacing [[TMF Nederland|TMF]] in its slot.\n\n==History==\nIn the 70s Kindernet began as an idea by Dennis Livson, a Finnish producer and distributor of cartoon programmes. He believed that, at the time, children's programmes made for television were too violent for young children. He therefore started a channel with so called \"violence-free\" cartoons.

Since its rebrand in 2011, the channel timeshared with [[Comedy Central (Dutch TV channel)|Comedy Central]], replacing [[TMF Nederland|TMF]] in its slot.\n\n==History==\nIn the 70s Kindernet began as an idea by Dennis Livson, a Finnish producer and distributor of cartoon programmes. He believed that, at the time, children's programmes made for television were too violent for young children. He therefore started a channel with so called \"violence-free\" cartoons. Its first logo reflected the childish aesthetic. The channel eventually launched through [[Satellite television|satellite]] (Intelsat V 27.5 degrees West) and some [[Cable television|cable]] networks on 1 March 1988.
