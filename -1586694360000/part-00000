his [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Terry Johnson (dramatist)|Terry Johnson]]'s musical, [[End of the Rainbow]] starring multi-award-winning [[Tracie Bennett]] as [[Judy

transferred to Broadway where he went on to pick up a further Tony nomination for Best Sound Design.\n\nIn recent years Owen collected a 2nd Oliver nomination for ''[[Top Hat (musical)|Top Hat]]'', and, after five nominations, finally won the Oliver for Best Sound Design in 2014 with the London production of ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]''.\n\nIn 2015 Owen won the Olivier for Sound Design for the second consecutive year, this time for [[Memphis (musical)|Memphis]] at the Shaftesbury Theatre, starring [[Beverley Knight]]. Composed by [[David Bryan]] from [[Bon Jovi]], and directed by [[Christopher Ashley]], this marked his sixth win/nomination in a row. He also received the prestigious Pro Sound Award for his work on the same production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prosoundawards.com//|title=Pro Sound Award for Best Theatre Sound|work=The Pro Sound

Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) of funding for 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a single unique identifier or a system of identifiers being installed to aid police operations. The use of numerous different identifiers inhibited the police efforts to return stolen property to its owners.\n\nOf the 21 police departments implementing a form of property marking programs contacted during the 1979 GAO survey:\n\n*5 recommended [[driver's license]] numbers\n*5 recommended [[Social Security number]]s\n*2 utilized a state-devised identifier\n*9 did not encourage the use of a specific identifier\n\nEven with a recommended identifier, participants in the program used vague identifiers such as initials or identifiers that were subject to change such as [[ZIP code]]s and telephone numbers making the return of stolen goods difficult.\n\nAn evaluation funded by the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] in 1975 found that Operation Identification participants did experience few burglaries than their neighbors. However, the evaluation reported that burglars did not find it more difficult to dispose of marked property and that marked property recovered by police was not more likely to be returned to the owners. The evaluation stated the absence of a unique and permanent identifier for each property owner in the United States as a reason for these shortcomings of the program.<ref name=gao/>\n\n==Current use==\nOperation Identification is still endorsed by police in the United States with many departments actively promoting the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> As well as police departments, Operation Identification is encouraged for students by colleges across the country.<ref name=\"Operation Identification\"/>\n\nThere are some private companies that partner directly with the police, giving them ready access to [[serial number]]s collected and entered by citizens. These companies frequently dispense with marking property or use pre-Internet marking strategies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.serialnumberregistry.ca/  |title=Serial Number Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.immobilise.com/  |title=Immobilise |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThere are newer companies that issue uniquely numbered identifier tags associated with a unique website that allows only the rightful owner of the property to enter and access serial numbers. If an account holder is a victim of a crime, it is up to them to provide police with serial numbers, so they can be entered into the [[National Crime Information Center]]. This strategy, via the internet, also connects a [[Good Samaritan]] with the rightful owner if the identifying tag is intact, using a regulated [[Anonymous P2P]] communication strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/  |title=My Property ID Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n===Outside the United States===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] recommend similar property marking techniques to Operation Identification. They suggest the use of approved marking solutions in the form of a special marker pen or paint only visible under ultraviolet (UV) light to mark or etch personal property with the postcode, house or flat number or the first three letters of the owner's address. They also encourage that valuable items are registered with an accredited property database.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.met.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/residential-burglary/mark-your-property/  |title=Mark your property to deter burglars |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Metropolitan Police |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==LPCB guidelines==\nIn 1996, the Loss Prevention Certification\u00a0Board (LPCB) issued its first set of guidelines\u00a0for the migration of Operation Identification to the Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bregroup.com/products/lpcb  |title=LPCB standards and certification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=BRE Group |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n*''Loss Prevention Standard LPS 1224'' Issue 3.1 (2014) lists the requirements for companies providing secure asset registration services.

Operation Identification signs and stickers are used to act as a deterrent to would-be criminals who may decide to try elsewhere when informed of the added traceability of the goods.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdle.net/brochures/ident.pdf  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOperation Identification was developed at a similar time as [[Neighborhood Watch]] was being promoted.<ref name=\":0\"/> Unlike Neighborhood Watch, Operation Identification did not find widespread use, even though it was endorsed by significant organizations such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/08/04/operation-id-marketing-flop/  |title=Operation ID: Biggest Marketing Flop in U.S. History |last= |first= |date=2018-08-04 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Despite this, Operation Identification is still promoted by many police departments and colleges across the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification  |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref name=\"Operation Identification\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amherst.edu/offices/campus_police/programs/operation_id/node/29577  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=University of Amherst |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOperation Identification was initially developed in the United States by the police in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2018/11/07/police-endorse-operation-id/  |title=Law Enforcement Professionals Endorse Operation ID |last= |first= |date=2018-11-07 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> This was in response to the growing incidence of theft across the nation. Between 1974 and 1978, the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] reported roughly $26 million ($115 million in 2020 dollars) of funding for 378 crime prevention projects with an Operation Identification component. Police departments would sponsor Operation Identification programs for residents, and many neighborhood organizations promoted and implemented marking programs.<ref name=gao>{{cite web |url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/130/126467.pdf  |title=Memo B-171019 |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Government Accountability Office |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nProperty marking was also encouraged by private companies and insurance companies. A national insurance association offered clients free engravers, literature, and participation stickers with other insurance companies offering discounts to clients who marked their property. One company provided customers a service where they would be provided an engraver, window stickers, and inventory sheets. Then the identity and current address of the enrolee, along with the assigned number, were stored in a data bank for retrieval.<ref name=gao/>\n\nMost of the effort to encourage property marking was aimed at the personal property of private citizens but some businesses along with state and local governmental units also participated.<ref name=gao/>\n\nA 1979 survey by the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) primarily performed in New York State and at federal agencies in [[Washington D.C.]] indicated that Operation Identification was being widely implemented and showing benefits although it had not been pursued by any Federal agency. Of the 28 police departments contacted during the survey, 21 were implementing property marking programs.<ref name=gao/> Following this survey, Operation Identification was rolled out by the US Department of Justice in 1979.<ref name=\":1979\">{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/2017/06/21/government-accountability-office-gao-validates-operation-identification-1979/  |title=Government Accountability Office (GAO) Validates Operation Identification |last= |first= |date=2017-06-21 |publisher=My Property ID Registry |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThe program was endorsed by the:<ref name=\":1979\"/>\n\n*[[National Sheriff's Association]]\n*[[International Association of Chiefs of Police]]\n*[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n*[[National Crime Information Center]]\n*[[National Crime Prevention Association]]\n*[[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]]\n*[[Independent insurance agent|Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]]<ref>[https://www.independentagent.com/default.aspx Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America]</ref>\n*[[American Farm Bureau]]\n*[[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]]\n\n===Identifiers===\nOperation Identification was hindered by the lack of a single unique identifier or a system of identifiers being installed to aid police operations. The use of numerous different identifiers inhibited the police efforts to return stolen property to its owners.\n\nOf the 21 police departments implementing a form of property marking programs contacted during the 1979 GAO survey:\n\n*5 recommended [[driver's license]] numbers\n*5 recommended [[Social Security number]]s\n*2 utilized a state-devised identifier\n*9 did not encourage the use of a specific identifier\n\nEven with a recommended identifier, participants in the program used vague identifiers such as initials or identifiers that were subject to change such as [[ZIP code]]s and telephone numbers making the return of stolen goods difficult.\n\nAn evaluation funded by the [[Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] in 1975 found that Operation Identification participants did experience few burglaries than their neighbors. However, the evaluation reported that burglars did not find it more difficult to dispose of marked property and that marked property recovered by police was not more likely to be returned to the owners. The evaluation stated the absence of a unique and permanent identifier for each property owner in the United States as a reason for these shortcomings of the program.<ref name=gao/>\n\n==Current use==\nOperation Identification is still endorsed by police in the United States with many departments actively promoting the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityoftaylor.com/655/Operation-Identification  |title=Operation Identification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=City of Taylor |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> As well as police departments, Operation Identification is encouraged for students by colleges across the country.<ref name=\"Operation Identification\"/>\n\nThere are some private companies that partner directly with the police, giving them ready access to [[serial number]]s collected and entered by citizens. These companies frequently dispense with marking property or use pre-Internet marking strategies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.serialnumberregistry.ca/  |title=Serial Number Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.immobilise.com/  |title=Immobilise |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\nThere are newer companies that issue uniquely numbered identifier tags associated with a unique website that allows only the rightful owner of the property to enter and access serial numbers. If an account holder is a victim of a crime, it is up to them to provide police with serial numbers, so they can be entered into the [[National Crime Information Center]]. This strategy, via the internet, also connects a [[Good Samaritan]] with the rightful owner if the identifying tag is intact, using a regulated [[Anonymous P2P]] communication strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mypropertyidregistry.com/  |title=My Property ID Registry |last= |first= |date= |publisher= |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n===Outside the United States===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Metropolitan Police]] recommend similar property marking techniques to Operation Identification. They suggest the use of approved marking solutions in the form of a special marker pen or paint only visible under ultraviolet (UV) light to mark or etch personal property with the postcode, house or flat number or the first three letters of the owner's address. They also encourage that valuable items are registered with an accredited property database.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.met.police.uk/cp/crime-prevention/residential-burglary/mark-your-property/  |title=Mark your property to deter burglars |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Metropolitan Police |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n==LPCB guidelines==\nIn 1996, the Loss Prevention Certification\u00a0Board (LPCB) issued its first set of guidelines\u00a0for the migration of Operation Identification to the Internet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bregroup.com/products/lpcb  |title=LPCB standards and certification |last= |first= |date= |publisher=BRE Group |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n*''Loss Prevention Standard LPS 1224'' Issue 3.1 (2014) lists the requirements for companies providing secure asset registration services.

There were reports of cars being damaged while traveling on the lower deck by fist-sized concrete chunks falling from the joints of upper deck slabs.\n\nA major part of the retrofit involved the long concrete causeway on the Marin side, which as part of the retrofit program, was nearly completely replaced. Because of the active use of the bridge, Caltrans designed the project to allow the bridge to remain open to traffic. For economy, schedule efficiency and traffic impact mitigation, much of the repair work was fabricated off site and shipped to the bridge by barge.\n\nTo reduce impacts to traffic the major work was performed at night.  Caltrans kept two lanes of traffic moving in each direction during daylight hours, then reduced that flow to a single lane in each direction at night. Thus, one trestle was completely closed, and the other trestle had two-way traffic.\n\nThe concrete segments of the trestle were precast in [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] and barged to the site. At monthly intervals, tugs positioned barges with one or two {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, 500-ton pre-cast concrete roadway segments, which a 900-ton barge-mounted crane lifted into place. Earlier, either two or four of the corroded, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid}} concrete segments of the old roadway were removed by crane. Then, a pile driver moved into position and drove new piles. After the new concrete road segment was in place, steel plates were used to temporarily fill the gaps, and the roadway was ready for morning traffic. At times, construction backed up traffic to Highway 101 into central San Rafael.\n\nThe completion of this retrofit, on September 22, 2005 was celebrated as a success despite the many challenges, including the deaths of two workers.\n\nThe retrofit was originally estimated by Caltrans engineers at {{US$|329000000|1999|round=-5}},<ref name=\"sfgate\" /> but Caltrans adjusted the estimate to {{US$|393272000|2000|round=-5}} in 2000 during the bidding process.<ref name=Bid-Summary>{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/Rich-SR/0438U4/docs/bidsummary.pdf |title=Bid Summary, Contract No. 04-0438U4 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=August 9, 2000 |website=State of California Department of Transportation |accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> While most of the resulting bids were close to {{US$|545000000|2000|round=-5}}, the low bid came in at {{US$|484403479|2000|round=-5}} from the Tutor-Saliba/Koch/Tidewater Joint Venture.<ref name=Bid-Summary /> Caltrans revised their estimate to {{US$|665000000|2001|round=-5}} in May 2001 when more funds were appropriated for California's Toll Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program in Assembly Bill 1171.<ref>{{cite California statute |year=2001 |chapter=907 |page=7396}} {{cite web |url=ftp://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1171_bill_20011014_chaptered.html |title=Assembly Bill 1171 |publisher=California Legislative Information |format=PDF |access-date=November 20, 2015}}</ref> The cost was again adjusted during an August 2004 review by Caltrans, this time to {{US$|914000000|2004|round=-5}}.<ref name=\"programreport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/baybridge/seismic_retrofit_program_reports/TBSRPSecondQuarterReportEndingJune302005.pdf |title=Toll Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program Report, Second Quarter 2005 |author=California Department of Transportation| access-date=November 20, 2015}}</ref> The final cost of the retrofit, however, was $778 million, or $136 million below this August 2004 estimate.<ref name=\"programreport\" />\n\n===Third lanes===\n[[File:Richmond California.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial photo of bay]]\n[[Image:Wfm richmond bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of the bridge and the surrounding area]]\n\nIn both directions, the bridge is wide enough to accommodate three lanes of traffic. Currently the third lane on the lower deck is used as a right-hand shoulder or a \"breakdown lane\" and is marked along the bridge with the signs \"Emergency Parking Only\". The third lane on the upper deck is a separated bicycle and pedestrian path<ref name=\"bike\"/>.\n\nIn 1977, Marin County was suffering one of its worst droughts in history. A temporary on-surface pipeline, six miles (10&nbsp;km) long, was placed in the third lane. The pipe transferred 8,000,000 gallons of water a day from the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]]'s mains in Richmond to Marin's 170,000 residents.  By 1978, the drought subsided and the pipeline was removed.  The disused third lane was then restriped as a shoulder.\n\nIn 1989, after the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], the third lane was opened up as a normal lane to accommodate increased traffic after the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] was shut down because of a failure of that span.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Many commuters from San Francisco drove across the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin and then across the Richmond\u2013San Rafael Bridge to go to Oakland (and vice versa). After the Bay Bridge was reopened, the third lane was again closed.\n\nOn February 11, 2015, the [[Bay Area Toll Authority]] approved a plan to install a protected bike and pedestrian path on the wide shoulder of the upper deck of the bridge. The path was expected to be complete in 2017, <ref name=\"bike\">{{cite web|last1=Rivera|first1=Renee|title=Richmond-San Rafael Bridge Bike Path approved|url=https://bikeeastbay.org/news/richmond-san-rafael-bridge-bike-path-approved|website=bikeeastbay.org|publisher=East Bay Bicycle Coalition|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref> however it opened on November 16, 2019.<ref>https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/17/long-awaited-richmond-san-rafael-bridge-transbay-bike-lane-opens/</ref> As part of the same project, a third eastbound lane<ref>{{cite news|last1=Prado|first1=Mark|title=Big changes planned for Richmond-San Rafael Bridge|url=http://www.marinij.com/general-news/20150211/big-changes-planned-for-richmond-san-rafael-bridge|accessdate=August 5, 2015|work=Marin Independent Journal|date=February 11, 2015}}</ref> was added the previous year on the lower deck to be available for evening commutes.<ref name=3rdLane>{{cite news|last1=Prado|first1=Mark|title=Third lane on Richmond-San Rafael Bridge open for business|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/04/23/third-lane-on-richmond-san-rafael-bridge-open-for-business/|accessdate=May 3, 2018|agency=East Bay Times|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> \n\n\n\n{{Wide image|Richmond-San Rafeal Bridge wide.jpg<!--Note: The filename of this photo is a misspelling of the bridge's name.-->|500px|View from the east end of the bridge (Richmond) looking southwest toward Southern Marin.

The bridge was closed on the morning of Friday, January 4, 2008 as a southerly wind gusting to nearly {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} buffeted the span, knocking over four trucks on the lower deck and one truck on the upper deck. The bridge was closed for six hours. It was re-opened by late afternoon as the strong winds subsided.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThis was not the first closure due to high winds. A tractor-trailer overturned in high winds in 1963, forcing the closure of two lanes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SBS19630131.1.1 |title=Storm, Wind Lash Bay City |author= |agency=AP |date=January 31, 1963 |newspaper=San Bernardino Sun |accessdate=April 16, 2018}}</ref> At least one previous event occurred in the late 1970s when high northerly winds forced the CHP to close the bridge. Wind gusts (reported in the Marin Independent Journal) reached 80&nbsp;mph.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nOn October 27, 2000 the toll plaza allowed people to cross free of charge due to a \"shelter in place\" order affecting toll booth operators.  The order was given by the [[Richmond Fire Department]] in response to a release of toxic gas from a recycling plant.<ref>[http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2000-10-27/article/1831?headline=Man-dies-in-recycling-plant-explosion--Daily-Planet-wire-reports- Man dies in recycling plant explosion], October 27, 2000, access date July 3, 2012</ref>\n\nOn February 7, 2019 the bridge was closed for several hours due to concrete falling from the upper deck to the lower.<ref>[https://www.sfgate.com/traffic/article/580-richmond-san-rafael-bridge-closed-concrete-13598563.php Falling concrete closes Richmond-San Rafael Bridge in both directions] February 7, 2019</ref>\n\n==In popular culture & film==\nThe novel ''Abuse of Power'' by [[Michael Savage]] has several important scenes set on the bridge. In one, the hero Jack Hatfield escapes his enemies by climbing the work ladders built into the piers.In the film ''Magnum Force'', the bridge is in the background when Dirty Harry and the rookie cop are on motorcycles on the ship's decks where they attempt to subdue each other.<ref>Scene 34.

There were reports of cars being damaged while traveling on the lower deck by fist-sized concrete chunks falling from the joints of upper deck slabs.\n\nA major part of the retrofit involved the long concrete causeway on the Marin side, which as part of the retrofit program, was nearly completely replaced. Because of the active use of the bridge, Caltrans designed the project to allow the bridge to remain open to traffic. For economy, schedule efficiency and traffic impact mitigation, much of the repair work was fabricated off site and shipped to the bridge by barge.\n\nTo reduce impacts to traffic the major work was performed at night.  Caltrans kept two lanes of traffic moving in each direction during daylight hours, then reduced that flow to a single lane in each direction at night. Thus, one trestle was completely closed, and the other trestle had two-way traffic.\n\nThe concrete segments of the trestle were precast in [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] and barged to the site. At monthly intervals, tugs positioned barges with one or two {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, 500-ton pre-cast concrete roadway segments, which a 900-ton barge-mounted crane lifted into place. Earlier, either two or four of the corroded, {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid}} concrete segments of the old roadway were removed by crane. Then, a pile driver moved into position and drove new piles. After the new concrete road segment was in place, steel plates were used to temporarily fill the gaps, and the roadway was ready for morning traffic. At times, construction backed up traffic to Highway 101 into central San Rafael.\n\nThe completion of this retrofit, on September 22, 2005 was celebrated as a success despite the many challenges, including the deaths of two workers.\n\nThe retrofit was originally estimated by Caltrans engineers at {{US$|329000000|1999|round=-5}},<ref name=\"sfgate\" /> but Caltrans adjusted the estimate to {{US$|393272000|2000|round=-5}} in 2000 during the bidding process.<ref name=Bid-Summary>{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/esc/tollbridge/Rich-SR/0438U4/docs/bidsummary.pdf |title=Bid Summary, Contract No. 04-0438U4 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=August 9, 2000 |website=State of California Department of Transportation |accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> While most of the resulting bids were close to {{US$|545000000|2000|round=-5}}, the low bid came in at {{US$|484403479|2000|round=-5}} from the Tutor-Saliba/Koch/Tidewater Joint Venture.<ref name=Bid-Summary /> Caltrans revised their estimate to {{US$|665000000|2001|round=-5}} in May 2001 when more funds were appropriated for California's Toll Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program in Assembly Bill 1171.<ref>{{cite California statute |year=2001 |chapter=907 |page=7396}} {{cite web |url=ftp://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/asm/ab_1151-1200/ab_1171_bill_20011014_chaptered.html |title=Assembly Bill 1171 |publisher=California Legislative Information |format=PDF |access-date=November 20, 2015}}</ref> The cost was again adjusted during an August 2004 review by Caltrans, this time to {{US$|914000000|2004|round=-5}}.<ref name=\"programreport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/baybridge/seismic_retrofit_program_reports/TBSRPSecondQuarterReportEndingJune302005.pdf |title=Toll Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program Report, Second Quarter 2005 |author=California Department of Transportation| access-date=November 20, 2015}}</ref> The final cost of the retrofit, however, was $778 million, or $136 million below this August 2004 estimate.<ref name=\"programreport\" />\n\n===Third lanes===\n[[File:Richmond California.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial photo of bay]]\n[[Image:Wfm richmond bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photo of the bridge and the surrounding area]]\n\nIn both directions, the bridge is wide enough to accommodate three lanes of traffic. Currently the third lane on the lower deck is used as a right-hand shoulder or a \"breakdown lane\" and is marked along the bridge with the signs \"Emergency Parking Only\". The third lane on the upper deck is a separated bicycle and pedestrian path<ref name=\"bike\"/>.\n\nIn 1977, Marin County was suffering one of its worst droughts in history. A temporary on-surface pipeline, six miles (10&nbsp;km) long, was placed in the third lane. The pipe transferred 8,000,000 gallons of water a day from the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]]'s mains in Richmond to Marin's 170,000 residents.  By 1978, the drought subsided and the pipeline was removed.  The disused third lane was then restriped as a shoulder.\n\nIn 1989, after the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]], the third lane was opened up as a normal lane to accommodate increased traffic after the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] was shut down because of a failure of that span.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Many commuters from San Francisco drove across the Golden Gate Bridge into Marin and then across the Richmond\u2013San Rafael Bridge to go to Oakland (and vice versa). After the Bay Bridge was reopened, the third lane was again closed.\n\nOn February 11, 2015, the [[Bay Area Toll Authority]] approved a plan to install a protected bike and pedestrian path on the wide shoulder of the upper deck of the bridge. The path was expected to be complete in 2017, <ref name=\"bike\">{{cite web|last1=Rivera|first1=Renee|title=Richmond-San Rafael Bridge Bike Path approved|url=https://bikeeastbay.org/news/richmond-san-rafael-bridge-bike-path-approved|website=bikeeastbay.org|publisher=East Bay Bicycle Coalition|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}</ref> however it opened on November 16, 2019.<ref>https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/17/long-awaited-richmond-san-rafael-bridge-transbay-bike-lane-opens/</ref> As part of the same project, a third eastbound lane<ref>{{cite news|last1=Prado|first1=Mark|title=Big changes planned for Richmond-San Rafael Bridge|url=http://www.marinij.com/general-news/20150211/big-changes-planned-for-richmond-san-rafael-bridge|accessdate=August 5, 2015|work=Marin Independent Journal|date=February 11, 2015}}</ref> was added the previous year on the lower deck to be available for evening commutes.<ref name=3rdLane>{{cite news|last1=Prado|first1=Mark|title=Third lane on Richmond-San Rafael Bridge open for business|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2018/04/23/third-lane-on-richmond-san-rafael-bridge-open-for-business/|accessdate=May 3, 2018|agency=East Bay Times|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> \n\n\n\n{{Wide image|Richmond-San Rafeal Bridge wide.jpg<!--Note: The filename of this photo is a misspelling of the bridge's name.-->|500px|View from the east end of the bridge (Richmond) looking southwest toward Southern Marin.

The bridge was closed on the morning of Friday, January 4, 2008 as a southerly wind gusting to nearly {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} buffeted the span, knocking over four trucks on the lower deck and one truck on the upper deck. The bridge was closed for six hours. It was re-opened by late afternoon as the strong winds subsided.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nThis was not the first closure due to high winds. A tractor-trailer overturned in high winds in 1963, forcing the closure of two lanes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SBS19630131.1.1 |title=Storm, Wind Lash Bay City |author= |agency=AP |date=January 31, 1963 |newspaper=San Bernardino Sun |accessdate=April 16, 2018}}</ref> At least one previous event occurred in the late 1970s when high northerly winds forced the CHP to close the bridge.

[[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|Her accolades]] include one [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance|Grammy Award]], and an additional seven Grammy Award nominations in various categories.\n\nThe daughter of actor [[Brandon Maggart]], Apple was born in [[New York City]] but was raised alternating between New York and her father's home in [[Los Angeles]]. Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, ''[[Tidal (album)|Tidal]]'', containing songs written when Apple was 17, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Rock Performance for the single \"[[Criminal (Fiona Apple song)|Criminal]]\". She followed with ''[[When the Pawn...]]'' (1999), produced by [[Jon Brion]], which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified platinum.\n\nFor her third album, ''[[Extraordinary Machine]]'' (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest [[Epic Records]], erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified [[Gold album|gold]], and nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'', which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 2013. Apple's upcoming fifth studio album, ''[[Fetch the Bolt Cutters]]'', is scheduled to be released on April 17th, 2020.\n\nShe has sold over 10 million albums worldwide and has received numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Fiona Apple|awards and nominations]], including a [[Grammy Award]], 2 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] and a [[Billboard Music Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in 1977 and raised on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], Apple is the daughter of singer Diane McAfee and actor [[Brandon Maggart]], who met when both were cast in the Broadway musical ''[[Applause (musical)|Applause]]''.<ref><!--?REPEAT1?-->{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/06/hiding-out-with-fiona-apple-musical-hermit.html|title=\u2018I Just Want to Feel Everything\u2019: Hiding Out With Fiona Apple, Musical Hermit|date=June 17, 2012|accessdate=March 1, 2016|work=Vulture}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/05/arts/a-message-far-less-pretty-than-the-face.html | title=A Message Far Less Pretty Than the Face | last=Ehrlich | first=Dimitri | work=The New York Times | date=January 5, 1997}}</ref> Her father is from [[Tennessee]], and through him, Apple has [[Melungeon]] ancestry.<ref name=wtf /> Her maternal grandparents were dancer Millicent Green and [[big band]] vocalist Johnny McAfee.
