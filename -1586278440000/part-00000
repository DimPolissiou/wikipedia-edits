Mansfield recommenced playing the cello, an occupation that she believed she would take up professionally,<ref name=\"NZ\" /> but she also began contributing to the college newspaper with such dedication that she eventually became its editor.<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /><ref name=\"Writing\" /> She was particularly interested in the works of the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and [[Oscar Wilde]],<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /> and she was appreciated among her peers for her vivacious and charismatic approach to life and work.<ref name=\"Writing\" />\n\nMansfield met fellow writer Ida Baker (also known as Lesley Moore),<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /> a South African, at the college, and they became lifelong friends.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Mansfield did not become involved in much political activity during her time in London. For example, she did not actively support the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffragette movement in the UK]] (women in New Zealand [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|had gained the right to vote]] in 1893).<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" />\n\n=== Travelling across Europe ===\nMansfield travelled in [[Continental Europe]] between 1903 and 1906, staying mainly in Belgium and Germany. After finishing her schooling in England she returned to New Zealand and only then began in earnest to write [[short stories]]. She had several works published in the ''Native Companion'' (Australia), her first paid writing work, and by this time she had her heart set on becoming a professional writer.<ref name=Writing/> This was also the first occasion on which she used the pseudonym \"K. Mansfield\".<ref name=NZ/> She rapidly grew weary of the provincial New Zealand lifestyle and of her family, and two years later headed back to London.<ref name=SelectedStories/> Her father sent her an annual allowance of 100 pounds for the rest of her life.<ref name=Bio/> In later years she expressed both admiration and disdain for New Zealand in her journals, but she was never able to return there because of her [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\nMansfield had two romantic relationships with women that are notable for their prominence in her journal entries. She continued to have male lovers, and attempted to repress her feelings at certain times. Her first same-sex romantic relationship was with [[Maata Mahupuku]] (sometimes known as Martha Grace), a wealthy young M\u0101ori woman whom she had first met at Miss Swainson's school in Wellington and then again in London in 1906. In June 1907, she wrote:<blockquote>\"I want Maata\u2014I want her as I have had her\u2014terribly. This is unclean I know but true.\"</blockquote>She often referred to Maata as Carlotta. She wrote about Maata in several short stories. Maata married in 1907, but it is claimed that she sent money to Mansfield in London.<ref>The Canoes of Kupe. Roberta McIntyre. Fraser Books. Masteron. 2012.</ref> The second relationship, with Edith Kathleen Bendall, took place from 1906 to 1908. Mansfield also professed her adoration for her in her journals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://socsci.flinders.edu.au/wmst/awsa2001/pdf/papers/Laurie.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090325142350/http://flinders.edu.au/socsci/womensstudies/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 March 2009 |title=Queering Katherine |author=Alison J. Laurie |publisher=Victoria University of Wellington |accessdate=23 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Return to London===\nAfter having returned to London in 1908, Mansfield quickly fell into a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] way of life. She published only one story and one poem during her first 15 months there.<ref name=Writing/> Mansfield sought out the Trowell family for companionship, and while Arnold was involved with another woman, Mansfield embarked on a passionate affair with his brother Garnet.<ref name=NZ/> By early 1909, she had become pregnant by Garnet though Trowell's parents disapproved of the relationship, and the two broke up. She then hastily entered into a marriage with George Bowden, a teacher of singing 11 years her senior;<ref name=Tele>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/bokatherine.xml |title=So many afterlives from one short life |author=Ali Smith |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> they were married on 2 March, but she left him the same evening, before the marriage could be consummated.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nAfter Mansfield had a brief reunion with Garnet, Mansfield's mother, Annie Beauchamp, arrived in 1909. She blamed the breakdown of the marriage to Bowden on a lesbian relationship between Mansfield and Baker, and she quickly had her daughter dispatched to the [[spa town]] of [[Bad W\u00f6rishofen]] in Bavaria, Germany. Mansfield [[miscarriage|miscarried]] after attempting to lift a suitcase on top of a cupboard. It is not known whether her mother knew of this miscarriage when she left shortly after arriving in Germany, but she cut Mansfield out of her will.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nMansfield's time in Bavaria had a significant effect on her literary outlook. In particular, she was introduced to the works of [[Anton Chekhov]]. Some biographers accuse her of plagiarizing Chekhov with one of her early short stories.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3560098/Sincerely-Katherine-Mansfield.html |title=Sincerely, Katherine Mansfield |last=Wilson |first=A.N. |date=September 8, 2008 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> She returned to London in January 1910. She then published more than a dozen articles in [[Alfred Richard Orage]]'s socialist magazine ''[[The New Age]]'', and became a friend and lover of [[Beatrice Hastings]], who lived with Orage.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article692912.ece \"As mad and bad as it gets\"], Frank Witford, ''The Sunday Times'', 30 July 2006</ref> Her experiences of Germany formed the foundation of her first published collection, ''[[In a German Pension]]'' (1911), which she later described as \"immature\".<ref name=\"NZ\" /><ref name=Writing/>\n\n===Contributing to ''Rhythm''===\nSoon afterward, Mansfield submitted a lightweight story to a new avant-garde magazine called ''[[Rhythm (literary magazine)|Rhythm]]''. The piece was rejected by the magazine's editor [[John Middleton Murry]], who requested something darker. Mansfield responded with \"[[The Woman at the Store]]\", a tale of murder and mental illness.<ref name=SelectedStories/> Mansfield was inspired at this time by [[Fauvism]].<ref name=SelectedStories/><ref name=NZ/>\n\n[[File:Mansfield1.jpg|thumb|right|Mansfield in 1912]]\nMansfield and Murry began a relationship in 1911 that culminated in their marriage in 1918, although she left him twice, in 1911 and 1913.<ref name=Biog2>{{cite web |url=http://www.katherinemansfield.net/life/briefbio2.htm |title=Katherine's relationship with John Middleton Murry |author=Kathleen Jones |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106133224/http://www.katherinemansfield.net/life/briefbio2.htm |archive-date=6 January 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe publisher of ''Rhythm'', [[Charles Granville]] (sometimes known as Stephen Swift), absconded to Europe in October 1912, and left Murry responsible for the debts the magazine had accumulated. Mansfield pledged her father's allowance towards the magazine, but it was discontinued, being reorganised as ''[[The Blue Review]]'' in 1913 and folding after three issues.<ref name=NZ/> Mansfield and Murry were persuaded by their friend [[Gilbert Cannan]] to rent a cottage next to his windmill in [[Cholesbury]], Buckinghamshire in 1913, in an attempt to alleviate Mansfield's ill health.<ref>{{cite book |last=Farr |first=Diana |title=Gilbert Cannan A Georgian Prodigy |year=1978 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=0-7011-2245-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gilbertcannangeo0000pull }}</ref> In January 1914, the couple moved to Paris, in the hope that a change of setting would make writing easier for both of them. Mansfield wrote only one story during her time there, \"[[Something Childish But Very Natural]]\", before Murry was recalled to London to declare bankruptcy.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nMansfield had a brief affair with the French writer [[Francis Carco]] in 1914. Her visit to him in Paris in February 1915<ref name=NZ/> is retold in her story \"[[An Indiscreet Journey]]\".<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\n=== Impact of World War I ===\nKatherine Mansfield's life and work were changed in 1915 by the death of her beloved younger brother, Leslie Heron \"Chummie\" Beauchamp,<ref>Elizabeth Bowen, Introduction, in ''Stories by Katherine Mansfield'', New York: Vintage Books, an imprint of Random House, 1956</ref> as a New Zealand soldier in France. She began to take refuge in nostalgic reminiscences of their childhood in [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/biography/mansfield.htm |title=Katherine Mansfield |publisher=Britishempire.co.uk |accessdate=25 May 2007}}</ref> In a poem describing a dream she had shortly after his death, she wrote:\n\n{{Quote|By the remembered stream my brother stands<br>Waiting for me with berries in his hands...<br>\"These are my body. Sister, take and eat.\"<ref name=SelectedStories/>}}\n\nAt the beginning of 1917, Mansfield and Murry separated,<ref name=SelectedStories/> although he continued to visit her at her new apartment.<ref name=NZ/> Ida Baker, whom Mansfield often called, with a mixture of affection and disdain, her \"wife\", moved in with her shortly afterwards.<ref name=Tele/> Mansfield entered into her most prolific period of writing after 1916, which began with several stories, including \"[[Mr Reginald Peacock's Day]]\" and \"[[A Dill Pickle]]\", being published in ''The New Age''. [[Virginia Woolf]] and her husband [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who had recently set up the [[Hogarth Press]], approached her for a story, and Mansfield presented to them \"[[Prelude (short story)|Prelude]]\", which she had begun writing in 1915 as \"The Aloe\". The story depicts a New Zealand family moving house.\n\n=== Diagnosis of tuberculosis ===\nIn December 1917, Mansfield was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. For part of spring and summer 1918, she joined her close friend the American painter [[Anne Estelle Rice]] at [[Looe]] in [[Cornwall]], in the hope of recovering. There, Rice painted a famous portrait of her dressed in red, a vibrant colour Mansfield liked and suggested herself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/41995 |title=Loading... {{!}} Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |website=collections.tepapa.govt.nz |language=en |access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref> The painting known as the ''Portrait of Katherine Mansfield'' is now exhibited in [[Te Papa Tongarewa Museum]] of New Zealand. Mansfield wrote in a letter to Murry about being Rice's model:<blockquote>A. came early and began the great painting \u2014 me in that red, brick red frock with flowers everywhere. It's awfully interesting, even now. I painted her in my way as she painted me in hers: her eyes \u2026 little blue flowers plucked this morning.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Letter to John Middleton Murry [17 June 1918] |title=The Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield, vol. 2 |editor1-last=O'Sullivan |editor1-first=Vincent |editor2-last=Scott |editor2-first=Margaret |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1987 |location=New York |isbn=978-0198126140 |pages=244\u201345 }}</ref></blockquote>Then, rejecting the idea of staying in a [[sanatorium]] on the grounds that it would cut her off from writing,<ref name=\"Writing\" /> she moved abroad to avoid the English winter.<ref name=\"NZ\" /> She stayed at a half-deserted, cold hotel in [[Bandol]], France, where she became depressed but continued to produce stories, including \"[[Je ne parle pas fran\u00e7ais]]\". \"[[Bliss (short story)|Bliss]]\", the story that lent its name to her second collection of stories in 1920, was also published in 1918. Her health continued to deteriorate and she had her first lung [[haemorrhage]] in March.<ref name=\"NZ\" />\n\nBy April, Mansfield's divorce from Bowden had been finalised, and she and Murry married, only to part again two weeks later.<ref name=NZ/> They came together again, however, and in March 1919 Murry became editor of ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', a magazine for which Mansfield wrote more than 100 book reviews (collected posthumously as ''Novels and Novelists''). During the winter of 1918\u201319 she and Baker stayed in a villa in [[Sanremo|San Remo]], Italy. Their relationship came under strain during this period; after she wrote to Murry to express her feelings of depression, he stayed over Christmas.<ref name=NZ/> Although her relationship with Murry became increasingly distant after 1918<ref name=NZ/> and the two often lived apart,<ref name=Biog2/> this intervention of his spurred her on, and she wrote \"[[The Man Without a Temperament]]\", the story of an ill wife and her long-suffering husband. Mansfield followed her first collection of short stories, ''Bliss'' (1920), with another collection, ''[[The Garden Party (short story collection)|The Garden Party]]'', published in 1922.\n\n===Last years and death===\nMansfield spent her last years seeking increasingly unorthodox cures for her tuberculosis. In February 1922, she consulted the Russian physician Ivan Manoukhin, whose \"revolutionary\" treatment, which consisted of bombarding her [[spleen]] with [[X-rays]], caused Mansfield to develop heat flashes and numbness in her legs.\n\nIn October 1922, Mansfield moved to [[G. I. Gurdjieff|Georges Gurdjieff]]'s [[Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man]] in [[Fontainebleau]], France, where she was put under the care of [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olgivanna Lazovitch Hinzenburg]] (who later married [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]). As a guest rather than a pupil of Gurdjieff, Mansfield was not required to take part in the rigorous routine of the institute,<ref>[[Linda Lappin]]. \"Katherine Mansfield and D. H. Lawrence, A Parallel Quest\", ''Katherine Mansfield Studies: The Journal of the Katherine Mansfield Society, Vol 2'', Edinburgh University Press, 2010, pp.72-86.</ref> but she spent much of her time there with her mentor, Alfred Richard Orage, and her last letters inform Murry of her attempts to apply some of Gurdjieff's teachings to her own life.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SdkKAQAAMAAJ&q=collected+letters+of+katherine+mansfield&dq=collected+letters+of+katherine+mansfield |title=The Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield |editor=Vincent O'Sullivan and Margaret Scott |page=360 |year=2008 |isbn=9780198183990}}</ref>\n\nMansfield suffered a fatal pulmonary haemorrhage in January 1923, after running up a flight of stairs.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OP_bJDyvBnoC&pg=PT126&lpg=PT126&dq=%22katherine+mansfield%22+stairs+murry |title=The Creative Mystique: From Red Shoes Frenzy to Love and Creativity |author=Susan Kavaler-Adler |page=113 |year=1996 |isbn=0-415-91412-4}}</ref> She died on 9 January, and was buried at Cimetiere d\u2019Avon, [[Avon, Seine-et-Marne|Avon]] (near Fontainebleau), France.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition.</ref>\n\nMansfield was a prolific writer in the final years of her life. Much of her work remained unpublished at her death, and Murry took on the task of editing and publishing it in two additional volumes of short stories (''The Dove's Nest'' in 1923, and ''Something Childish'' in 1924); a volume of poems; ''The Aloe''; ''Novels and Novelists''; and collections of her letters and journals.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe following high schools in New Zealand have a [[House system|house]] named after Mansfield: [[Whangarei Girls' High School]]; [[Rangitoto College]], [[Westlake Girls' High School]], and [[Macleans College]] in [[Auckland]]; [[Tauranga Girls' College]]; [[Wellington Girls' College]]; [[Rangiora High School]] in North [[Canterbury]], and [[Southland Girls' High School]] in [[Invercargill]]. She has also been honoured at [[Karori]] Normal School in [[Wellington]], which has a stone monument dedicated to her with a plaque commemorating her work and her time at the school, and at [[Samuel Marsden Collegiate School]] (previously Fitzherbert Terrace School) with a painting, and an award in her name.\n\nHer birthplace in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]], Wellington has been preserved as the [[Katherine Mansfield House and Garden]], and a park is dedicated to her.\n\nA street in [[Menton]], France, where she lived and wrote, is named after her.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.la-croix.com/Archives/2007-06-09/Menton-le-havre-secret-de-Katherine-Mansfield.-_NP_-2007-06-09-293407 |title=Menton, le havre secret de Katherine Mansfield. |last=La-Croix.com |date=2007-06-09 |website=La Croix |language=fr |access-date=2018-08-22}}</ref> A fellowship is offered annually to enable a New Zealand writer to work at her former home, the Villa Isola Bella, and New Zealand's pre-eminent short story competition is named in her honour.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thearts.co.nz/katherine-mansfield-menton-fellowship |title=Katherine Mansfield Menton Fellowship |date=2015-09-16 |work=The Arts Foundation |access-date=2018-08-22 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nMansfield was the subject of a 1973 [[BBC]] miniseries, ''[[A Picture of Katherine Mansfield]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]].

At the age of 19, she left New Zealand and settled in England, where she became a friend of writers such as [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Virginia Woolf]]. Mansfield was diagnosed with [[extrapulmonary tuberculosis]] in 1917; the disease claimed her life at the age of 34.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMansfield was born Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp in 1888 into a socially prominent family in [[Wellington]], New Zealand. Her grandfather was [[Arthur Beauchamp]], who briefly represented the {{NZ electorate link|Picton}} electorate in parliament. Her extended family included the author Countess [[Elizabeth von Arnim]], and her great-great-uncle was Victorian artist [[Charles Robert Leslie]]. Her father [[Harold Beauchamp]] became the chairman of the [[Bank of New Zealand]] and was knighted in 1923.<ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.katherinemansfield.com/mansfield/|title=Katherine Mansfield:1888\u20131923 \u2013 A Biography |publisher=Katharinemansfield.com |accessdate=12 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014022656/http://www.katherinemansfield.com/mansfield/ |archivedate=14 October 2008 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"DNZB Beauchamp\">{{DNZB |last=Nicholls |first=Roberta |id=2b14 |title=Beauchamp, Harold |accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> Her mother was Annie Beauchamp, whose brother married the daughter of [[Richard Seddon]].\n\nShe had two older sisters, a younger sister and a younger brother, born in 1894.<ref name=\"SelectedStories\">{{cite book |author=Katherine Mansfield |title=Selected Stories |publisher=Oxford World's Classics |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-283986-2}}</ref><ref name=\"DNZB Beauchamp\" /><ref name=\"Scholefield 1950\">{{cite book |last=Scholefield |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Scholefield |title=New Zealand Parliamentary Record, 1840\u20131949 |edition=3rd |origyear=First ed. published 1913 |year=1950 |publisher=Govt.

Here Mansfield spent the happiest years of her childhood, and she used some of those memories as an inspiration for the short story \"[[Prelude (short story)|Prelude]]\".<ref name=\"Bio\" />\n[[File:Katherine Mansfield Birthplace, New Zealand.jpg|thumb|right|[[Katherine Mansfield House and Garden]] in [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon, Wellington]]]]\n\nHer first printed stories appeared in the ''High School Reporter'' and the [[Wellington Girls College|Wellington Girls' High School]] magazine (the family returned to Wellington proper in 1898),<ref name=Bio/> in 1898 and 1899.<ref name=Writing>{{cite web |url=http://www.katherinemansfield.com/mansfield/her_write.asp |title=Mansfield: Her Writing |publisher=Katharinemansfield.com |accessdate=12 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014065750/http://www.katherinemansfield.com/mansfield/her_write.asp |archive-date=14 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Her first formally published story \"[https://wellington.recollect.co.nz/nodes/view/2515 His Little Friend]\" appeared the following year in a society magazine, ''New Zealand Graphic and Ladies Journal''.<ref>Yska, Redmer, ''A Strange Beautiful Excitement: Katherine Mansfield's Wellington'', Otago University Press, 2017</ref> In 1902 she became enamoured of Arnold Trowell, a cellist, although her feelings were for the most part not reciprocated.<ref name=NZ>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Whi071Kota-t1-g1-t8.html |title=Katherine Mansfield, 1888\u20131923 |author=Joanna Woods |publisher=[[Victoria University of Wellington]] |work=K\u014dtare 2007, Special Issue \u2013 Essays in New Zealand Literary Biography \u2013 Series One: 'Women Prose Writers to World War I' |year=2007 |accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> Mansfield was herself an accomplished cellist, having received lessons from Trowell's father.<ref name=Bio/>\n\nMansfield wrote in her journals of feeling alienated in New Zealand, and of how she had become disillusioned because of the repression of the [[M\u0101ori people]]. M\u0101ori characters often are portrayed in a sympathetic or positive light in her later stories, such as \"[[How Pearl Button Was Kidnapped]]\".<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\n=== Moving to London ===\nMansfield moved to London in 1903, where she attended [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] along with her sisters. Mansfield recommenced playing the cello, an occupation that she believed she would take up professionally,<ref name=\"NZ\" /> but she also began contributing to the college newspaper with such dedication that she eventually became its editor.<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /><ref name=\"Writing\" /> She was particularly interested in the works of the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and [[Oscar Wilde]],<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /> and she was appreciated among her peers for her vivacious and charismatic approach to life and work.<ref name=\"Writing\" />\n\nMansfield met fellow writer Ida Baker (also known as Lesley Moore),<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" /> a South African, at the college, and they became lifelong friends.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Mansfield did not become involved in much political activity during her time in London. For example, she did not actively support the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffragette movement in the UK]] (women in New Zealand [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|had gained the right to vote]] in 1893).<ref name=\"SelectedStories\" />\n\n=== Travelling across Europe ===\nMansfield travelled in [[Continental Europe]] between 1903 and 1906, staying mainly in Belgium and Germany. After finishing her schooling in England she returned to New Zealand and only then began in earnest to write [[short stories]]. She had several works published in the ''Native Companion'' (Australia), her first paid writing work, and by this time she had her heart set on becoming a professional writer.<ref name=Writing/> This was also the first occasion on which she used the pseudonym \"K. Mansfield\".<ref name=NZ/> She rapidly grew weary of the provincial New Zealand lifestyle and of her family, and two years later headed back to London.<ref name=SelectedStories/> Her father sent her an annual allowance of 100 pounds for the rest of her life.<ref name=Bio/> In later years she expressed both admiration and disdain for New Zealand in her journals, but she was never able to return there because of her [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\nMansfield had two romantic relationships with women that are notable for their prominence in her journal entries. She continued to have male lovers, and attempted to repress her feelings at certain times. Her first same-sex romantic relationship was with [[Maata Mahupuku]] (sometimes known as Martha Grace), a wealthy young M\u0101ori woman whom she had first met at Miss Swainson's school in Wellington and then again in London in 1906. In June 1907, she wrote:<blockquote>\"I want Maata\u2014I want her as I have had her\u2014terribly. This is unclean I know but true.\"</blockquote>She often referred to Maata as Carlotta. She wrote about Maata in several short stories. Maata married in 1907, but it is claimed that she sent money to Mansfield in London.<ref>The Canoes of Kupe. Roberta McIntyre. Fraser Books. Masteron. 2012.</ref> The second relationship, with Edith Kathleen Bendall, took place from 1906 to 1908. Mansfield also professed her adoration for her in her journals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://socsci.flinders.edu.au/wmst/awsa2001/pdf/papers/Laurie.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090325142350/http://flinders.edu.au/socsci/womensstudies/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 March 2009 |title=Queering Katherine |author=Alison J.

She published only one story and one poem during her first 15 months there.<ref name=Writing/> Mansfield sought out the Trowell family for companionship, and while Arnold was involved with another woman, Mansfield embarked on a passionate affair with his brother Garnet.<ref name=NZ/> By early 1909, she had become pregnant by Garnet though Trowell's parents disapproved of the relationship, and the two broke up. She then hastily entered into a marriage with George Bowden, a teacher of singing 11 years her senior;<ref name=Tele>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/bokatherine.xml |title=So many afterlives from one short life |author=Ali Smith |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> they were married on 2 March, but she left him the same evening, before the marriage could be consummated.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nAfter Mansfield had a brief reunion with Garnet, Mansfield's mother, Annie Beauchamp, arrived in 1909. She blamed the breakdown of the marriage to Bowden on a lesbian relationship between Mansfield and Baker, and she quickly had her daughter dispatched to the [[spa town]] of [[Bad W\u00f6rishofen]] in Bavaria, Germany. Mansfield [[miscarriage|miscarried]] after attempting to lift a suitcase on top of a cupboard. It is not known whether her mother knew of this miscarriage when she left shortly after arriving in Germany, but she cut Mansfield out of her will.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nMansfield's time in Bavaria had a significant effect on her literary outlook. In particular, she was introduced to the works of [[Anton Chekhov]]. Some biographers accuse her of plagiarizing Chekhov with one of her early short stories.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3560098/Sincerely-Katherine-Mansfield.html |title=Sincerely, Katherine Mansfield |last=Wilson |first=A.N. |date=September 8, 2008 |work=The Telegraph |access-date=January 8, 2019}}</ref> She returned to London in January 1910. She then published more than a dozen articles in [[Alfred Richard Orage]]'s socialist magazine ''[[The New Age]]'', and became a friend and lover of [[Beatrice Hastings]], who lived with Orage.<ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article692912.ece \"As mad and bad as it gets\"], Frank Witford, ''The Sunday Times'', 30 July 2006</ref> Her experiences of Germany formed the foundation of her first published collection, ''[[In a German Pension]]'' (1911), which she later described as \"immature\".<ref name=\"NZ\" /><ref name=Writing/>\n\n===Contributing to ''Rhythm''===\nSoon afterward, Mansfield submitted a lightweight story to a new avant-garde magazine called ''[[Rhythm (literary magazine)|Rhythm]]''. The piece was rejected by the magazine's editor [[John Middleton Murry]], who requested something darker. Mansfield responded with \"[[The Woman at the Store]]\", a tale of murder and mental illness.<ref name=SelectedStories/> Mansfield was inspired at this time by [[Fauvism]].<ref name=SelectedStories/><ref name=NZ/>\n\n[[File:Mansfield1.jpg|thumb|right|Mansfield in 1912]]\nMansfield and Murry began a relationship in 1911 that culminated in their marriage in 1918, although she left him twice, in 1911 and 1913.<ref name=Biog2>{{cite web |url=http://www.katherinemansfield.net/life/briefbio2.htm |title=Katherine's relationship with John Middleton Murry |author=Kathleen Jones |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106133224/http://www.katherinemansfield.net/life/briefbio2.htm |archive-date=6 January 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe publisher of ''Rhythm'', [[Charles Granville]] (sometimes known as Stephen Swift), absconded to Europe in October 1912, and left Murry responsible for the debts the magazine had accumulated. Mansfield pledged her father's allowance towards the magazine, but it was discontinued, being reorganised as ''[[The Blue Review]]'' in 1913 and folding after three issues.<ref name=NZ/> Mansfield and Murry were persuaded by their friend [[Gilbert Cannan]] to rent a cottage next to his windmill in [[Cholesbury]], Buckinghamshire in 1913, in an attempt to alleviate Mansfield's ill health.<ref>{{cite book |last=Farr |first=Diana |title=Gilbert Cannan A Georgian Prodigy |year=1978 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=0-7011-2245-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gilbertcannangeo0000pull }}</ref> In January 1914, the couple moved to Paris, in the hope that a change of setting would make writing easier for both of them. Mansfield wrote only one story during her time there, \"[[Something Childish But Very Natural]]\", before Murry was recalled to London to declare bankruptcy.<ref name=NZ/>\n\nMansfield had a brief affair with the French writer [[Francis Carco]] in 1914. Her visit to him in Paris in February 1915<ref name=NZ/> is retold in her story \"[[An Indiscreet Journey]]\".<ref name=SelectedStories/>\n\n=== Impact of World War I ===\nKatherine Mansfield's life and work were changed in 1915 by the death of her beloved younger brother, Leslie Heron \"Chummie\" Beauchamp,<ref>Elizabeth Bowen, Introduction, in ''Stories by Katherine Mansfield'', New York: Vintage Books, an imprint of Random House, 1956</ref> as a New Zealand soldier in France. She began to take refuge in nostalgic reminiscences of their childhood in [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/biography/mansfield.htm |title=Katherine Mansfield |publisher=Britishempire.co.uk |accessdate=25 May 2007}}</ref> In a poem describing a dream she had shortly after his death, she wrote:\n\n{{Quote|By the remembered stream my brother stands<br>Waiting for me with berries in his hands...<br>\"These are my body. Sister, take and eat.\"<ref name=SelectedStories/>}}\n\nAt the beginning of 1917, Mansfield and Murry separated,<ref name=SelectedStories/> although he continued to visit her at her new apartment.<ref name=NZ/> Ida Baker, whom Mansfield often called, with a mixture of affection and disdain, her \"wife\", moved in with her shortly afterwards.<ref name=Tele/> Mansfield entered into her most prolific period of writing after 1916, which began with several stories, including \"[[Mr Reginald Peacock's Day]]\" and \"[[A Dill Pickle]]\", being published in ''The New Age''. [[Virginia Woolf]] and her husband [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who had recently set up the [[Hogarth Press]], approached her for a story, and Mansfield presented to them \"[[Prelude (short story)|Prelude]]\", which she had begun writing in 1915 as \"The Aloe\". The story depicts a New Zealand family moving house.\n\n=== Diagnosis of tuberculosis ===\nIn December 1917, Mansfield was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. For part of spring and summer 1918, she joined her close friend the American painter [[Anne Estelle Rice]] at [[Looe]] in [[Cornwall]], in the hope of recovering. There, Rice painted a famous portrait of her dressed in red, a vibrant colour Mansfield liked and suggested herself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/41995 |title=Loading... {{!}} Collections Online - Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa |website=collections.tepapa.govt.nz |language=en |access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref> The painting known as the ''Portrait of Katherine Mansfield'' is now exhibited in [[Te Papa Tongarewa Museum]] of New Zealand. Mansfield wrote in a letter to Murry about being Rice's model:<blockquote>A. came early and began the great painting \u2014 me in that red, brick red frock with flowers everywhere. It's awfully interesting, even now. I painted her in my way as she painted me in hers: her eyes \u2026 little blue flowers plucked this morning.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Letter to John Middleton Murry [17 June 1918] |title=The Collected Letters of Katherine Mansfield, vol. 2 |editor1-last=O'Sullivan |editor1-first=Vincent |editor2-last=Scott |editor2-first=Margaret |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1987 |location=New York |isbn=978-0198126140 |pages=244\u201345 }}</ref></blockquote>Then, rejecting the idea of staying in a [[sanatorium]] on the grounds that it would cut her off from writing,<ref name=\"Writing\" /> she moved abroad to avoid the English winter.<ref name=\"NZ\" /> She stayed at a half-deserted, cold hotel in [[Bandol]], France, where she became depressed but continued to produce stories, including \"[[Je ne parle pas fran\u00e7ais]]\". \"[[Bliss (short story)|Bliss]]\", the story that lent its name to her second collection of stories in 1920, was also published in 1918. Her health continued to deteriorate and she had her first lung [[haemorrhage]] in March.<ref name=\"NZ\" />\n\nBy April, Mansfield's divorce from Bowden had been finalised, and she and Murry married, only to part again two weeks later.<ref name=NZ/> They came together again, however, and in March 1919 Murry became editor of ''[[The Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', a magazine for which Mansfield wrote more than 100 book reviews (collected posthumously as ''Novels and Novelists''). During the winter of 1918\u201319 she and Baker stayed in a villa in [[Sanremo|San Remo]], Italy. Their relationship came under strain during this period; after she wrote to Murry to express her feelings of depression, he stayed over Christmas.<ref name=NZ/> Although her relationship with Murry became increasingly distant after 1918<ref name=NZ/> and the two often lived apart,<ref name=Biog2/> this intervention of his spurred her on, and she wrote \"[[The Man Without a Temperament]]\", the story of an ill wife and her long-suffering husband. Mansfield followed her first collection of short stories, ''Bliss'' (1920), with another collection, ''[[The Garden Party (short story collection)|The Garden Party]]'', published in 1922.\n\n===Last years and death===\nMansfield spent her last years seeking increasingly unorthodox cures for her tuberculosis. In February 1922, she consulted the Russian physician Ivan Manoukhin, whose \"revolutionary\" treatment, which consisted of bombarding her [[spleen]] with [[X-rays]], caused Mansfield to develop heat flashes and numbness in her legs.\n\nIn October 1922, Mansfield moved to [[G. I.

Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds.

These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]].

[[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

In 1954, they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe original trophy weighs over 130 pounds, and sits on a four-foot wide base. It resides permanently at Augusta National and depicts the clubhouse of the classic course. The replica, which is significantly smaller, stands just 6.5 inches tall and weighs 20 pounds. The champion and the runner-up both have their names engraved on the permanent trophy, solidifying themselves in golf history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/09/19/masters-trophy-facts-size-weight-history-97937 |title=The Masters Trophy facts: Size, weight, history and more |date=September 19, 2016 |website=GolfNewsNet.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Double Eagle trophy was introduced in 1967 when [[Bruce Devlin]] holed out for double eagle on number 8.

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club.

These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

After a number of small attempts to reuse the abandoned air force base, [[Airborne Express]] purchased the facility in 1979 for $850,000, a fraction of the estimated $100 million spent to construct it{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2014}}.

The legislation will facilitate green economic development by creating financial incentives for the creation of green collar jobs. The City Council passed the measure in response to an economic grassroots movement initiated in October 2008 by two Wilmington High School graduates, Mark Rembert and Taylor Stuckert, aided by Pure Blue Energy, LLC a consulting firm out of North Carolina.

Following its closure in 1971, the economy of the city hovered in recession for more than a decade. After a number of small attempts to reuse the abandoned air force base, [[Airborne Express]] purchased the facility in 1979 for $850,000, a fraction of the estimated $100 million spent to construct it{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=November 2014}}. During the next 24 years, Airborne invested more than $250 million to build a hub for its national delivery network, including new sort centers, a {{convert|9000|ft|m|adj=on}} runway, aircraft hangars, [[machine shop]]s, [[flight simulator]]s, a state of art [[control tower]], and a modern administration building to accommodate an estimated 6,000 employees and its fleet of 125 [[DC-8]], [[DC-9]] and [[Boeing 767]] aircraft.\n\nIn 2003, Airborne Express reorganized and [[ABX Air]], Inc. was created.  ABX Air is a contract freight forwarding business with the primary customer being [[DHL Express|DHL]], one of the world's largest international shipping firms. ABX's parent company, [[Air Transport Services Group]], is based in Wilmington. Owned by the [[Deutsche Post]] WorldNet, a German [[holding company]], DHL consolidated its US flight and sorting hub operations in Wilmington in 2005.  Restructuring in May 2008 resulted in eight thousand layoffs,<ref>[http://www.daytondailynews.com/b/content/oh/story/business/2008/05/29/ddn052908dhlweb.html?cxntlid=inform_artr]</ref> and six months later the Wilmington hub was closed, resulting in another eight thousand layoffs.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/11/10/dhl.closing.wilmington/index.html \"DHL Job Cuts Devastate Ohio Community,\" CNN]</ref>\n\nThe facility closed in July 2009, and DHL moved to a much smaller sorting operation at the [[Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport]]. Wilmington's airport hosts a comparatively smaller Maintenance Repair and Overhaul venture, along with Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, employing several hundred employees under the auspices of the ABX Air parent company, ATSG (Air Transport Services Group).<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2009/02/24/323027/abx-parents-moves-forward-with-mro-unit.html] MRO Unit advanced by Airborne parent company.

The legislation will facilitate green economic development by creating financial incentives for the creation of green collar jobs. The City Council passed the measure in response to an economic grassroots movement initiated in October 2008 by two Wilmington High School graduates, Mark Rembert and Taylor Stuckert, aided by Pure Blue Energy, LLC a consulting firm out of North Carolina.

Wreck Cove makes up half of that hydro capacity, making it a key provider of reliable, renewable energy needed to complement and back up the 600 MW of clean \u2013 but unpredictable \u2013 [[wind power]] on the province's electrical system. The Wreck Cove hydroelectric facility is the only one in the province that can go from zero to full output in under 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Tour\">{{cite news |last1=McNeil |first1=Greg |title=Public heads underground to tour Wreck Cove Hydro facility |url=https://www.saltwire.com/news/local/public-heads-underground-to-tour-wreck-cove-hydro-facility-9466/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=Cape Breton Post |publisher=SaltWire Network |date=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nWreck Cove primary purpose is to generate electricity, to supply Nova Scotia Powers' [[electrical grid]], but the unique nature of the installation also allows Wreck Cove to play a critical role in NS Power\u2019s ability to meet the reliability standards defined by [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[Northeast Power Coordinating Council]] (NPCC) and also provides other Grid Reliability Services:\n\n===NERC/NPCC requirements===\n\n====Black Start Requirements====\nUnder NERC, Nove Scotia Power must maintain multiple [[black start]] pathways to re-start the grid should a black-out ever occur. Wreck Cove is one of the two pathways Nova Scotia Power uses to meet this NERC requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Planning Reserve Margin====\nNova Scotia Power must maintain sufficient capacity to serve its [[peak load]] as well as additional capacity for the planning reserve margin (PRM). The PRM acts as a resource to respond to a contingency to ensure customer load can be served in the event unexpected generation restrictions or supply requirements arise. For example, the PRM capacity ensures adequate generation in the event that one or more generation resources are unavailable or cannot run at full capacity at the time of system peak. Planning reserves also account for uncertainties in demand forecasting and resource availability. The Wreck Cove system contributes approximately 8 percent towards NS Power\u2019s total required capacity in 2020, assuming a PRM of 20 percent.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Operating Reserve Capacity Requirements (10 min reserve)====\nNERC/NPCC requires electric utilities to have their largest single energy production source covered by an alternative source in reserve capacity. Currently, NS Power\u2019s largest single unit is [[Point Aconi Generating Station]] which produces 168 MW of operating capacity. Wreck Cove Units 1 and 2 have an accredited capability of 106 MW each unit (212 MW total), making this facility an important provider of this service. As such, the reliable operation of the Wreck Cove Generating Station provides Nova Scotia Power\u2019s ability to meet this requirement. NPCC also requires that operating reserve capacity be available and on the grid within 10 minutes. If Wreck Cove\u2019s Units 1 and 2 are off-line, they can be brought onto the grid and reach full capacity within the 10-minute requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Tie-Line Regulation====\nWreck Cove assists with providing tie-line regulation. Nova Scotia Power is required to have reserve capacity available for changes in demand across the tie-line to [[New Brunswick]]. Because Wreck Cove is capable of changing its output at the rate of 20 MW/min, it is more effective in responding to fluctuations in Nova Scotia system load and wind generation than slower acting thermal generation sources, which can be moved at a rate of 0.5 MW to 2 MW per minute.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Energy Balancing and Wind Following===\nWreck Cove 1 has been utilized in recent years as a means of balancing energy generation throughout the cycles associated with wind generation. Nova Scotia Power\u2019s hydroelectric generation provides load/wind following services, meaning that the hydroelectric generation is dispatchable and can be used to mitigate the impacts resulting from the high variability of wind generation resources and associated forecasting variations. Although wind following was not the original intent for the use of Wreck Cove, having the ability to utilize Wreck Cove in this way has supported the development and integration of wind generation on the grid. This service is related to the Tie-Line Regulation discussed above, but over a longer time frame. The flexibility of Wreck Cove\u2019s load response is also critical to managing periods of short term, large scale load changes (pickup and drop-off) from industrial customers on the grid.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Grid Reliability Services===\n\n====Load Shaving Capacity====\nWreck Cove provides critical peak load shaving capacity for the short periods of high load that occur daily, typically during morning and evening peak hours. Given Wreck Cove can be brought on-line quickly for these periods of high load ramping, thermal generation resources which cannot be cycled off-and-on frequently can be more economically dispatched.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Scheduling and Dispatch====\nWreck Cove is a source of 212 MW of stored power for Nova Scotia Power to use when needed. It can operate at maximum power for 4-6 hours depending on conditions, at which time it needs to allow water from farther upstream in the watershed to make its way to Surge Lake.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Reactive Supply and Voltage Control====\nNova Scotia Power\u2019s 33 hydro plants/50 hydro units provide 180 MVar of dynamic reactive power to the system. The Nova Scotia Power System Operator controls generators to absorb or produce reactive power to control system voltage. Wreck Cove is located at the eastern end of the transmission grid and therefore its ability to support load is less important than generation closer to the load centre; however, due to its relative size, its dynamic reactive power contributes to stabilizing the grid following disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Primary Frequency Response====\nWreck Cove, like all hydro and thermal generators, is equipped with speed governors which maintain the scheduled grid frequency of 60 Hz. It provides a significant contribution to system inertia, which stabilizes the grid frequency during disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====System Strength====\nHydro generation contributes to system inertia, which allows the system to ride through fault conditions, and short circuit strength, which provides the high fault current levels needed to activate system protection devices (inverter-based wind, tidal and solar do not materially contribute to this).<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nBetween 1975 and 1978, more than 2.5 million cubic metres of rock were blasted and removed to construct the facility\u2019s 11 major [[dam]]s and associated wing dams.  All are [[Dam#Earth-fill_dams|earth dams]] or [[Dam#Rock-fill_dams|rockfill dams]] with an impervious material in the middle (the core dam), with filter material at both sides and rockfill on each dam for stability.<ref name=\"Investigation\">{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Ronald |title=Wreck Cove Hydro-Electric Investigation |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |date=1 October 1974 |issue=9 |pages=1-12 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=243 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |publisher=Breton Books |location=Wreck Cove, NS |issn=0319-4639 |oclc=1941799}}</ref>\n\nThe development involved the diversion of seven headwater streams, including Indian Brook, West Indian Brook and MacMillan's Brook, Wreck Cove River, MacLeod's Brook, the Ingonish River and the headwaters of [[Ch\u00e9ticamp River]].

Wreck Cove makes up half of that hydro capacity, making it a key provider of reliable, renewable energy needed to complement and back up the 600 MW of clean \u2013 but unpredictable \u2013 [[wind power]] on the province's electrical system. The Wreck Cove hydroelectric facility is the only one in the province that can go from zero to full output in under 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Tour\">{{cite news |last1=McNeil |first1=Greg |title=Public heads underground to tour Wreck Cove Hydro facility |url=https://www.saltwire.com/news/local/public-heads-underground-to-tour-wreck-cove-hydro-facility-9466/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=Cape Breton Post |publisher=SaltWire Network |date=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nWreck Cove primary purpose is to generate electricity, to supply Nova Scotia Powers' [[electrical grid]], but the unique nature of the installation also allows Wreck Cove to play a critical role in NS Power\u2019s ability to meet the reliability standards defined by [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[Northeast Power Coordinating Council]] (NPCC) and also provides other Grid Reliability Services:\n\n===NERC/NPCC requirements===\n\n====Black Start Requirements====\nUnder NERC, Nove Scotia Power must maintain multiple [[black start]] pathways to re-start the grid should a black-out ever occur. Wreck Cove is one of the two pathways Nova Scotia Power uses to meet this NERC requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Planning Reserve Margin====\nNova Scotia Power must maintain sufficient capacity to serve its [[peak load]] as well as additional capacity for the planning reserve margin (PRM). The PRM acts as a resource to respond to a contingency to ensure customer load can be served in the event unexpected generation restrictions or supply requirements arise. For example, the PRM capacity ensures adequate generation in the event that one or more generation resources are unavailable or cannot run at full capacity at the time of system peak. Planning reserves also account for uncertainties in demand forecasting and resource availability. The Wreck Cove system contributes approximately 8 percent towards NS Power\u2019s total required capacity in 2020, assuming a PRM of 20 percent.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Operating Reserve Capacity Requirements (10 min reserve)====\nNERC/NPCC requires electric utilities to have their largest single energy production source covered by an alternative source in reserve capacity. Currently, NS Power\u2019s largest single unit is [[Point Aconi Generating Station]] which produces 168 MW of operating capacity. Wreck Cove Units 1 and 2 have an accredited capability of 106 MW each unit (212 MW total), making this facility an important provider of this service. As such, the reliable operation of the Wreck Cove Generating Station provides Nova Scotia Power\u2019s ability to meet this requirement. NPCC also requires that operating reserve capacity be available and on the grid within 10 minutes. If Wreck Cove\u2019s Units 1 and 2 are off-line, they can be brought onto the grid and reach full capacity within the 10-minute requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Tie-Line Regulation====\nWreck Cove assists with providing tie-line regulation. Nova Scotia Power is required to have reserve capacity available for changes in demand across the tie-line to [[New Brunswick]]. Because Wreck Cove is capable of changing its output at the rate of 20 MW/min, it is more effective in responding to fluctuations in Nova Scotia system load and wind generation than slower acting thermal generation sources, which can be moved at a rate of 0.5 MW to 2 MW per minute.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Energy Balancing and Wind Following===\nWreck Cove 1 has been utilized in recent years as a means of balancing energy generation throughout the cycles associated with wind generation. Nova Scotia Power\u2019s hydroelectric generation provides load/wind following services, meaning that the hydroelectric generation is dispatchable and can be used to mitigate the impacts resulting from the high variability of wind generation resources and associated forecasting variations. Although wind following was not the original intent for the use of Wreck Cove, having the ability to utilize Wreck Cove in this way has supported the development and integration of wind generation on the grid. This service is related to the Tie-Line Regulation discussed above, but over a longer time frame. The flexibility of Wreck Cove\u2019s load response is also critical to managing periods of short term, large scale load changes (pickup and drop-off) from industrial customers on the grid.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Grid Reliability Services===\n\n====Load Shaving Capacity====\nWreck Cove provides critical peak load shaving capacity for the short periods of high load that occur daily, typically during morning and evening peak hours. Given Wreck Cove can be brought on-line quickly for these periods of high load ramping, thermal generation resources which cannot be cycled off-and-on frequently can be more economically dispatched.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Scheduling and Dispatch====\nWreck Cove is a source of 212 MW of stored power for Nova Scotia Power to use when needed. It can operate at maximum power for 4-6 hours depending on conditions, at which time it needs to allow water from farther upstream in the watershed to make its way to Surge Lake.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Reactive Supply and Voltage Control====\nNova Scotia Power\u2019s 33 hydro plants/50 hydro units provide 180 MVar of dynamic reactive power to the system. The Nova Scotia Power System Operator controls generators to absorb or produce reactive power to control system voltage. Wreck Cove is located at the eastern end of the transmission grid and therefore its ability to support load is less important than generation closer to the load centre; however, due to its relative size, its dynamic reactive power contributes to stabilizing the grid following disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Primary Frequency Response====\nWreck Cove, like all hydro and thermal generators, is equipped with speed governors which maintain the scheduled grid frequency of 60 Hz. It provides a significant contribution to system inertia, which stabilizes the grid frequency during disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====System Strength====\nHydro generation contributes to system inertia, which allows the system to ride through fault conditions, and short circuit strength, which provides the high fault current levels needed to activate system protection devices (inverter-based wind, tidal and solar do not materially contribute to this).<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nBetween 1975 and 1978, more than 2.5 million cubic metres of rock were blasted and removed to construct the facility\u2019s 11 major [[dam]]s and associated wing dams.  All are [[Dam#Earth-fill_dams|earth dams]] or [[Dam#Rock-fill_dams|rockfill dams]] with an impervious material in the middle (the core dam), with filter material at both sides and rockfill on each dam for stability.<ref name=\"Investigation\">{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Ronald |title=Wreck Cove Hydro-Electric Investigation |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |date=1 October 1974 |issue=9 |pages=1-12 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=243 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |publisher=Breton Books |location=Wreck Cove, NS |issn=0319-4639 |oclc=1941799}}</ref>\n\nThe development involved the diversion of seven headwater streams, including Indian Brook, West Indian Brook and MacMillan's Brook, Wreck Cove River, MacLeod's Brook, the Ingonish River and the headwaters of [[Ch\u00e9ticamp River]].

Characters include [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]], [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hulk]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], [[Scarlet Witch]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Ultron]], [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[War Machine]] and some lesser known characters such as [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Fin Fang Foom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-12-lego-marvels-avengers-includes-six-films-from-the-mcu|title=Lego Marvel's Avengers covers six Marvel films|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=12 October 2015|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> It includes the characters of the Avengers team along with many others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150129005263/en/Warner-Bros.-Interactive-Entertainment-TT-Games-LEGO |title=Warner Bros.

Players often have to solve puzzles spread across the game environment, such as figuring out how to move a particular truck that is blocking their progression. As always, the game has its own unique quirks, for instance taking advantage of its large character library in areas that require two specific characters to team up in order to proceed. Boss battles also take the form of puzzles, often requiring careful timing. While action and fighting are spread liberally throughout the game, it is kept very child-friendly as per Lego custom. The game features [[New York City]] as the main large open-world hub, but also, for the first time, includes a dozen other movie significant areas players can travel to, including [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[South Africa]], The [[Helicarrier]], the Bartons' farm, [[Washington DC]] and Sokovia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/09/lego-marvels-avengers-is-loaded-with-superheroes-villians-cities-and-open-world-gameplay/|title=Lego Marvel\u2019s Avengers is loaded with superheroes, {{sic|villians|hide=y}}, cities, and open-world gameplay|first=Dean|last=Takadashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=9 December 2015|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref> These hubs also feature heavy playability, with hundreds of side quests and bonus levels such as rescuing citizens in trouble, races, and more. The main story actually takes up a fairly small fraction of the game's total \"completion\". Whilst the game's story is predominantly focused on the two Avengers films there are single levels based on ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', ''Iron Man 3'', ''Thor: The Dark World'' and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.\n\n===Characters===\nThe game features over two hundred playable characters, including some characters (but not all) returning from the previous game. The heroes are drawn not just from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], but the comics as well. Director Arthur Parsons stated \"It's a celebration of everything Avengers. Comic books, movies, cartoons. It's everything you love about the Avengers in video games.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/11/8935305/lego-marvel-avengers-characters-comic-con-sdcc-2015|title=Lego Marvel's Avengers adds 100-plus characters, even more Stan Lee|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=11 July 2015|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref> Confirmed additional characters include [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Kamala Khan]] as Ms. Marvel, [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]]'s Captain America appearance, [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]], [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]'s [[Jane Foster (comics)#Cancer and becoming Thor|Thor]] form, [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] and [[Speed (comics)|Speed]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/lego-marvel-avengers-release-date |title=Kamala Khan, Jane Foster and More Join \u2018Lego Marvel\u2019s Avengers\u2019 This January |first=Luke |last=Brown |work=[[Comics Alliance]] |date=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120133819/http://comicsalliance.com/lego-marvel-avengers-release-date/ |archivedate=20 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Every two characters have their own unique team-up abilities. There are even separate ones for what character is triggering the attack, meaning nearly 800 team-up moves.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern European]] country of [[Sokovia]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\u2014[[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark/Iron Man]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers/Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner/Hulk]], [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow]], and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton/Hawkeye]]\u2014attack a [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] facility commanded by [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] in an attempt to retrieve [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]'s old scepter. After an encounter with two of Strucker's test subjects, twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro/Quicksilver]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch]], they retrieve the scepter. However, as Iron Man is about to leave with it, Wanda manipulates his mind, prompting a series of flashbacks that explain [[The Avengers (2012 film)|how the scepter ended up on Earth]].\n\nLoki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri]] and a servant of [[Thanos]], who provides him with the scepter and sends him to Earth to retrieve the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], a source of unlimited power, in exchange for an army to subjugate Earth. At a remote research facility of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and his lieutenant [[Maria Hill]] arrive to oversee the experiments of a research team led by physicist [[Erik Selvig|Dr. Erik Selvig]] on the Tesseract, which has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly opens a wormhole, bringing Loki to Earth. He uses the scepter to brainwash Selvig, Barton, and many other agents to serve him and help him escape with the Tesseract before the facility explodes, despite Hill and another agent's efforts to stop him.\n\nIn response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative.\" Romanoff is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions, while [[Phil Coulson]] visits Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract. While talking with Fury, Rogers has flashabacks of [[Captain America: The First Avenger|his time fighting Hydra]] during [[World War II|World Ward II]] in the 1940s; during a raid on [[Arnim Zola]]'s train, Rogers' partner and friend [[Bucky Barnes]] fell off a cliff and was presumed dead. In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract while Loki causes a distraction, leading to his defeat at the hands of Stark, Rogers and Romanoff. While escorting Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D., their jet is attacked by Thor, who frees his adoptive brother in the hopes of convincing him to abandon his plan and return to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. After a fight between Stark, Rogers, and Thor, the latter agrees to let Loki be imprisoned on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Iron Man attempt to locate the Tesseract.\n\nWhile Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract, Rogers searches through S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files cases and soon discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Rogers and Stark manage to repair the engine, leaving the Helicarrier stranded in the air, while Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control, and Thor subdues Hulk, but Loki escapes after wounding Coulson. After the Avengers reunite, Fury motivates into working as a team. They steal a Quinjet and use it to get to [[New York City]], where Loki inserts the Tesseract into a device built by Selving, opening a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] that allows the Chitauri fleet to invade Earth.\n\nAfter Banner transforms into the Hulk, the Avengers battle the Chitauri army together. Hulk subdues Loki while Romanoff frees Selvig from Loki's control, learning that the wormhole generator can be shut down using the scepter, and Stark redirects a nuclear missle launched by the World Security Council to the Chitauri's mother ship, destroying it and killing all the Chitauri on Earth. His armor runs out of power and he crashes back on Earth, just as Romanoff shuts down the generator. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed. Meanwhile, Thanos is informed of Loki's failure, and the Avengers are shown celebrating in a restaurant. A disguised Strucker steals Loki's scepter and takes it back to his base where he and Dr. List begin experimenting on Pietro and Wanda, ending the flashback.\n\nReturning to the Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem and decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron]]\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and crashes the Avengers' celebration party, taking control of Stark's Iron Legion. After the Avengers destroy all his drones, Ultron escapes with the scepter, using the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones, and recruits the Maximoffs to help him. They meet with arms dealer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] to obtain [[Wakanda|Wakandan]] [[vibranium]] and manage to escape, despite the Avenger's attempt to stop them, after Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.\n\nA worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears that Wanda' hallucinations had incited, forces the Avengers into hiding at Barton's farm. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination. Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In [[Seoul]], Ultron brainwashes the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho with Loki's scepter and has her use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. Before he can upload himself into the body, Wand reads his mind and learns his plan for human extinction, leading the Maximoffs to turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff and Barton fight Ultron and his drones in a stolen truck and succeed in retrieving the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. The fight causes a train to derail, but Rogers and the Maximoffs manage to stop it.\n\nThe Avengers argue over Stark's plan to upload J.A.R.V.I.S.\u2014who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet\u2014into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow is one of the six [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]], the most powerful objects in existence. The newly activated [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who helps him transform into the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in the Helicarrier with Hill, [[War Machine]], and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate the civilians in flying lifeboats. Quicksilver dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wando abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets downwards, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and destroy the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in the [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]], while Vision confronts and destroys Ultron's last remaining body.\n\nLater, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. As Stark leaves, Barton retires off-screen, and Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: War Machine, [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], Vision, and Wanda.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Thanos, displeased with the failure of his pawns to collect the Infinity Stones for him, dons the Infinity Gauntlet and intends to it himself.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Audio===\nUnlike ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', which used original voice acting, ''Lego Marvel's Avengers'' utilizes audio from the six films being adapted for the game, including voice and music, similar to ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Lego Movie Videogame]]'', ''[[Lego The Hobbit (video game)|Lego The Hobbit]]'', and ''[[Lego Jurassic World]]''.

Players often have to solve puzzles spread across the game environment, such as figuring out how to move a particular truck that is blocking their progression. As always, the game has its own unique quirks, for instance taking advantage of its large character library in areas that require two specific characters to team up in order to proceed. Boss battles also take the form of puzzles, often requiring careful timing. While action and fighting are spread liberally throughout the game, it is kept very child-friendly as per Lego custom. The game features [[New York City]] as the main large open-world hub, but also, for the first time, includes a dozen other movie significant areas players can travel to, including [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], [[South Africa]], The [[Helicarrier]], the Bartons' farm, [[Washington DC]] and Sokovia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/12/09/lego-marvels-avengers-is-loaded-with-superheroes-villians-cities-and-open-world-gameplay/|title=Lego Marvel\u2019s Avengers is loaded with superheroes, {{sic|villians|hide=y}}, cities, and open-world gameplay|first=Dean|last=Takadashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=9 December 2015|access-date=26 January 2016}}</ref> These hubs also feature heavy playability, with hundreds of side quests and bonus levels such as rescuing citizens in trouble, races, and more. The main story actually takes up a fairly small fraction of the game's total \"completion\". Whilst the game's story is predominantly focused on the two Avengers films there are single levels based on ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', ''Iron Man 3'', ''Thor: The Dark World'' and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.\n\n===Characters===\nThe game features over two hundred playable characters, including some characters (but not all) returning from the previous game. The heroes are drawn not just from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], but the comics as well. Director Arthur Parsons stated \"It's a celebration of everything Avengers. Comic books, movies, cartoons. It's everything you love about the Avengers in video games.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/11/8935305/lego-marvel-avengers-characters-comic-con-sdcc-2015|title=Lego Marvel's Avengers adds 100-plus characters, even more Stan Lee|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=11 July 2015|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref> Confirmed additional characters include [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Kamala Khan]] as Ms. Marvel, [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]]'s Captain America appearance, [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]], [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]'s [[Jane Foster (comics)#Cancer and becoming Thor|Thor]] form, [[Wiccan (comics)|Wiccan]] and [[Speed (comics)|Speed]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/lego-marvel-avengers-release-date |title=Kamala Khan, Jane Foster and More Join \u2018Lego Marvel\u2019s Avengers\u2019 This January |first=Luke |last=Brown |work=[[Comics Alliance]] |date=5 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120133819/http://comicsalliance.com/lego-marvel-avengers-release-date/ |archivedate=20 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Every two characters have their own unique team-up abilities.

After an encounter with two of Strucker's test subjects, twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro/Quicksilver]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch]], they succesfully retrieve the scepter. However, as Iron Man is about to leave with it, Wanda manipulates his mind, prompting a series of flashbacks that explain [[The Avengers (2012 film)|how the scepter ended up on Earth]].\n\nLoki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri]] and a servant of [[Thanos]], who provides him with the scepter and sends him to Earth to retrieve the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], a source of unlimited power, in exchange for an army to subjugate Earth. At a remote research facility of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], director [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and his lieutenant [[Maria Hill]] arrive to oversee the experiments of a research team led by physicist [[Erik Selvig|Dr. Erik Selvig]] on the Tesseract, which has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly opens a wormhole, bringing Loki to Earth. He uses the scepter to brainwash Selvig, Barton, and many other agents to serve him and help him escape with the Tesseract before the facility explodes, despite Hill and another agent's efforts to stop him.\n\nIn response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative.\" Romanoff is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions, while [[Phil Coulson]] visits Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract. While talking with Fury, Rogers has flashabacks of [[Captain America: The First Avenger|his time fighting Hydra]] during [[World War II|World Ward II]] in the 1940s; during a raid on [[Arnim Zola]]'s train, Rogers' partner and friend [[Bucky Barnes]] fell off a cliff and was presumed dead. In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract while Loki causes a distraction, leading to his defeat at the hands of Stark, Rogers and Romanoff. While escorting Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D., their jet is attacked by Thor, who frees his adoptive brother in the hopes of convincing him to abandon his plan and return to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. After a fight between Stark, Rogers, and Thor, the latter agrees to let Loki be imprisoned on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Iron Man attempt to locate the Tesseract.\n\nWhile Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract, Rogers searches through S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files cases and soon discovers that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Rogers and Stark manage to repair the engine, leaving the Helicarrier stranded in the air, while Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control, and Thor subdues Hulk, but Loki escapes after wounding Coulson. After the Avengers reunite, Fury motivates into working as a team. They steal a Quinjet and use it to get to [[New York City]], where Loki inserts the Tesseract into a device built by Selving, opening a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] that allows the Chitauri fleet to invade Earth.\n\nAfter Banner transforms into the Hulk, the Avengers battle the Chitauri army together. Hulk subdues Loki while Romanoff frees Selvig from Loki's control, learning that the wormhole generator can be shut down using the scepter, and Stark redirects a nuclear missle launched by the World Security Council to the Chitauri's mother ship, destroying it and killing all the Chitauri on Earth. His armor runs out of power and he crashes back on Earth, just as Romanoff shuts down the generator. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed. Meanwhile, Thanos is informed of Loki's failure, and the Avengers are shown celebrating in a restaurant. A disguised Strucker steals Loki's scepter and takes it back to his base where he and Dr. List begin experimenting on Pietro and Wanda, ending the flashback.\n\nReturning to the Avengers Tower, Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem and decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron]]\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and crashes the Avengers' celebration party, taking control of Stark's Iron Legion. After the Avengers destroy all his drones, Ultron escapes with the scepter, using the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones, and recruits the Maximoffs to help him. They meet with arms dealer [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Ulysses Klaue]] to obtain [[Wakanda|Wakandan]] [[vibranium]] and manage to escape, despite the Avenger's attempt to stop them, after Wanda subdues them with haunting visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.\n\nA worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears that Wanda' hallucinations had incited, forces the Avengers into hiding at Barton's farm. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination. Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In [[Seoul]], Ultron brainwashes the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho with Loki's scepter and has her use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. Before he can upload himself into the body, Wand reads his mind and learns his plan for human extinction, leading the Maximoffs to turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff and Barton fight Ultron and his drones in a stolen truck and succeed in retrieving the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. The fight causes a train to derail, but Rogers and the Maximoffs manage to stop it.\n\nThe Avengers argue over Stark's plan to upload J.A.R.V.I.S.\u2014who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet\u2014into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow is one of the six [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Stones]], the most powerful objects in existence. The newly activated [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who helps him transform into the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in the Helicarrier with Hill, [[War Machine]], and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate the civilians in flying lifeboats. Quicksilver dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wando abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets downwards, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and destroy the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in the [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]], while Vision confronts and destroys Ultron's last remaining body.\n\nLater, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. As Stark leaves, Barton retires off-screen, and Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: War Machine, [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], Vision, and Wanda.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Thanos, displeased with the failure of his pawns to collect the Infinity Stones for him, dons the Infinity Gauntlet and intends to it himself.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Audio===\nUnlike ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', which used original voice acting, ''Lego Marvel's Avengers'' utilizes audio from the six films being adapted for the game, including voice and music, similar to ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Lego Movie Videogame]]'', ''[[Lego The Hobbit (video game)|Lego The Hobbit]]'', and ''[[Lego Jurassic World]]''.

The station airs a [[hot adult contemporary]] format. CING's studios are located on Main Street West in Hamilton, while its transmitter is located atop the [[Niagara Escarpment]] near Upper Centennial Parkway. CING is owned by [[Corus Entertainment]].\n\nCING was launched in 1976 by Burlington Broadcasting, at 107.9 FM in [[Burlington, Ontario]]. Initially an [[easy listening]] and then an [[oldies]] station, the station switched to a [[dance music]] format in the summer of 1991, which garnered a huge audience, after several months of adding new-age music to its mixture of classical and middle-of-the-road music. The station applied to the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) a number of times in the 1980s for frequency changes in the hopes of better reaching the more lucrative [[Toronto]] market, but was denied each time.<ref>(CRTC), Government of Canada, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission.

Its signal can be heard in Hamilton, the [[Greater Toronto Area]], the Niagara Region, and even [[Buffalo, New York]]. The station is marketed towards both Hamilton and Toronto.\n\n[[File:CING FM 2013.png|thumb|Fresh FM logo|right|150px]]\n\n==FM 108 era==\nCING-FM began on September 23, 1976, as a [[beautiful music]] format featuring mostly instrumental versions of pop favorites. The first song heard on the 107.9 FM frequency was \"[[Sing (The Carpenters song)|Sing]]\" by [[The Carpenters]]. The station began experimenting with playing oldies during the overnight period in 1978; the response was positive, and by 1980 oldies shows constituted the majority of the program schedule. During the 1980s, FM 108 divided its programming between oldies and [[middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] music, and was known for its personable oldies announcers, including Glen Darling, Norman B., Steve Richards/Mortenson, Wes Atkinson, Burt Thombs, Clint Trueman, Jay Brown, Dale Patterson (webmaster for Rock Radio Scrapbook), the Shadow, Dave Terryberry, Larry Smith, and the infamous Rockin Robin.\n\nFM 108 began to phase out its oldies programming in the fall of 1989 with the addition of [[dance music]] programming (\"Rhythm Radio\") in evenings and overnights;<ref name=\"Inc.1996\">{{cite journal|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=Dance Compilations Moving in Canada|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68|date=25 May 1996|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=68\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> the station continued with its soft AC/MOR format during the rest of the day on weekdays, as \"Daytime Lite and Rhythm at Nite.\" Oldies programming was relegated to Saturdays. The last oldies show on FM 108, hosted by Dale Patterson, aired on September 29, 1990. \"Daytime Lite\" ended on September 2, 1991, and the dance format expanded full-time (first as \"Dance 108\", and then to \"Energy 108\" in the mid-1990s).<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/hamiltonspectator/doc/436515093.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+21%2C+1991&author=Greg+Quill+TORONTO+STAR&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=B.2&desc=Dance+radio+a+wild+success+story Dance radio a wild success story], Greg Quill, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', November 21, 1991</ref>\n\n==Energy 108 era==\nIn 1997, the station was acquired by [[Shaw Communications]]. Following the change in ownership, Energy's format shifted from dance music to [[contemporary hit radio|mainstream CHR]]. Dance, rap, hip-hop, rock, and pop all received equal airplay. A minor name change also took place, with ''Energy 108'' changing to ''Energy Radio''. Under Shaw's ownership, several other stations in Ontario, including [[CKDK-FM]] in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]]/[[London, Ontario|London]], [[CHAY-FM]] in [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]] and [[CKGE-FM]] in [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]]/[[Toronto]], also adopted the ''Energy Radio'' format, rebroadcasting CING much of the day. Shaw's radio operations were, in turn, spun off to [[Corus Entertainment]] in 1999.\n\n==History of 95.3 FM pre-CING==\n{{Main|CJXY-FM}}\n\nIn 1964, '''CHML-FM''' signed on at 95.3 FM, a sister to the [[CHML|AM station of the same callsign]]. In 1967, the station adopted the new callsign '''CKDS-FM'''. For many years, the station aired an [[easy listening]] format similar to CING, some of the time under the branding '''Lite FM 95.3.''' In September 1991, at the same time as CING was becoming \"Dance 108\", CKDS changed its callsign to [[CJXY-FM|CJXY]], and rebranded as '''Y95''' - a [[classic rock]] station that became a powerhouse in [[Southern Ontario]]. Danny Kingsbury was the architect of this new station as program director. Within 3 years, Y95 was beating sister station [[CILQ-FM]] from Toronto in the ratings - a huge feat for a station from Hamilton, since Hamilton and Toronto are considered to be two separate markets according to the BBM ratings panel and the CRTC. At its peak, the morning show consisted of Jeff Lumby, Tedd Colbear and Todd Lewis. The afternoon drive team consisted of Scott Thompson, Lori Love (now at [[CHRE-FM]]) and Dave Spragge. Eventually, new ownership decided to prop up Q107 by weakening Y95; the classic rock format was moved to the weaker 107.9 frequency.\n\n==Frequency switch; subsequent format changes==\n[[File:CING FM broadcast area.png|thumb|left|Broadcast area map for CING FM as of 2017.]]\nOn August 31, 2001, CING and [[CJXY-FM]] swapped frequencies. CING moved to its current 95.3 frequency, and CJXY took over the 107.9 FM frequency. The frequency switch brought with it a change in the network's sound, with the mainstream CHR format making way for a [[hot adult contemporary]] format. With CING now available over a wider geographic area, the other stations dropped their CING simulcasts in 2002. The new format mirrored the format of Toronto's market leader [[CHUM-FM]], which resulted in very low ratings.\n\nOn August 9, 2002, at 6 p.m., the station dropped its troubled Hot AC format (and the \"Energy\" moniker), and began [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with stand-up comedy bits. The final songs on \"Energy\" were \"[[Rhythm is a Dancer]]\" by [[Snap!]] and \"[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]\" by [[Roy Rogers]]. On August 19, 2002, at 7 a.m., the station flipped to country, branded as ''Country 95.3''. The first song on \"Country\" was \"Small Town Saturday Night\" by [[Hal Ketchum]].<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/hamiltonspectator/doc/270122757.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug%208,%202002&author=&pub=The%20Spectator&edition=&startpage=D.11&desc=Hamilton's%20Energy%2095.3%20crosses%20over%20to%20country \"Hamilton's Energy 95.3 crosses over to country\"].</ref><ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/hamiltonspectator/doc/266997036.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug%2029,%202002&author=McArthur,%20Greg&pub=The%20Record&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Oldies%20back%20on%201090%20AM;%20Energy%2095.3%20goes%20country%20as%20radio%20stations%20change%20formats \"Oldies back on 1090 AM\"].</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 2009, at 3 p.m., CING-FM switched formats from country to [[classic hits]], branded as ''Vinyl 95.3''.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/hamiltonspectator/doc/270363686.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov%2017,%202009&author=Arnold,%20Steve&pub=The%20Spectator&edition=&startpage=A.13&desc=Country%20radio%20goes%20quiet;%20Format%20doesn't%20rope%20in%20enough%20listeners,%20company%20says \"Country radio goes quiet\"].</ref>{{Dead link|date=August 2018}} The final song on \"Country\" was ''[[The Dance (song)|The Dance]]'' by [[Garth Brooks]], while the first song on \"Vinyl\" was ''[[Start Me Up]]'' by [[The Rolling Stones]]. The station's playlist featured the greatest hits of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, and was considered to be the first oldies/classic hits station in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] on FM after the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] permitted the oldies format to be heard full-time on FM for the first time. Locally, the station competed against AM station [[CKOC]]; after Christmas of that year, the station also competed against [[adult hits]] station [[CHBM-FM|CHBM]] in Toronto, which lost their oldies outlet on [[CHUM (AM)|1050 CHUM]], which flipped to a simulcast of [[CP24]] in March of that year.\n\nIn its latter months, the station broadened their playlist to include 90s and current tracks. With this change, however, the station's ratings began to slide.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, at 9:53&nbsp;a.m., the station changed its format back to Hot AC, now branded as ''95.3 Fresh FM''.<ref>[http://rwcrn.com/corus-expands-fresh-fm-to-hamilton Corus expands FRESH FM to Hamilton] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308094903/http://rwcrn.com/corus-expands-fresh-fm-to-hamilton |date=2016-03-08 }}, ''Canadian Radio News - RWCRN'', April 10, 2013</ref> After the format change back to hot AC, the station became the fourth radio station owned by Corus to adopt the ''Fresh FM'' branding. While most of the previous format's airstaff (including Toronto market veterans Gord James, John Novak and Bob Saint) was let go, Darrin and Colleen remain in mornings with their producer Mike moving to evenings after a brief jockless period.\n\nOn February 13, 2015, CING-FM rebranded to ''95.3 Fresh Radio'', in conjunction with Corus rebranding all of their \"Fresh FM\" stations to the new branding on the same date and time.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/91991/corus-launches-national-fresh-radio-brand-across-canada/ \"Corus Launches National Fresh Radio Brand Across Canada - RadioInsight\"]. 13 February 2015.</ref>\n\nOn March 26, 2019, at 8 a.m., CING-FM rebranded as ''Energy 95.3''. The last song on \u201cFresh\u201d was \u201c[[Good Feeling (song)|Good Feeling]]\u201d by [[Flo Rida]], while the first song on the revived \u201cEnergy\u201d was \u201c[[High Hopes (Panic! at the Disco song)|High Hopes]]\u201d by [[Panic! At the Disco]]. The change brought with it a new morning show, Tucker and Maura, formerly of [[CKFM-FM|CKFM]] in Toronto. Former morning hosts Colleen Rusholme moved to afternoon drive, while Darrin Laidman decided to leave the company. Later that year, Rusholme departed for [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]] sister station [[CJOT-FM]], and was replaced with the syndicated Brooke & Jubal, based out of [[KQMV]] in [[Seattle]]. CING is the second station in Canada to air the syndicated Brooke and Jubal show following Ottawa sister station [[CKQB]], and the first to air it in afternoons.\n\nCING competes with local stations [[CKLH-FM]] and [[CHRE-FM]], as well as neighboring stations [[CHUM-FM]] and [[CHFI-FM]] (from [[Toronto]]) and [[CHYM-FM]] (from [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]).\n\n==HD Radio==\nIn 2012, CING signed on [[HD Radio]] operations. Initially, their HD-2 subchannel was testing mostly with traffic and weather reports, as well as gas price reports.<ref>[http://blog.fagstein.com/2014/01/16/crtc-hd-radio/ \"CRTC looking at bringing HD Radio to Canada\"]. 17 January 2014.</ref> CING is the first Canadian radio station to utilize the technology.

During the 1980s, FM 108 divided its programming between oldies and [[middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] music, and was known for its personable oldies announcers, including Glen Darling, Norman B., Steve Richards/Mortenson, Wes Atkinson, Burt Thombs, Clint Trueman, Jay Brown, Dale Patterson (webmaster for Rock Radio Scrapbook), the Shadow, Dave Terryberry, Larry Smith, and the infamous Rockin Robin.\n\nFM 108 began to phase out its oldies programming in the fall of 1989 with the addition of [[dance music]] programming (\"Rhythm Radio\") in evenings and overnights;<ref name=\"Inc.1996\">{{cite journal|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=Dance Compilations Moving in Canada|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68|date=25 May 1996|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=68\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> the station continued with its soft AC/MOR format during the rest of the day on weekdays, as \"Daytime Lite and Rhythm at Nite.\" Oldies programming was relegated to Saturdays. The last oldies show on FM 108, hosted by Dale Patterson, aired on September 29, 1990. \"Daytime Lite\" ended on September 2, 1991, and the dance format expanded full-time (first as \"Dance 108\", and then to \"Energy 108\" in the mid-90's).<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/hamiltonspectator/doc/436515093.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+21%2C+1991&author=Greg+Quill+TORONTO+STAR&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=B.2&desc=Dance+radio+a+wild+success+story Dance radio a wild success story], Greg Quill, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', November 21, 1991</ref>\n\n==Energy 108 era==\nIn 1997, the station was acquired by [[Shaw Communications]]. Following the change in ownership, Energy's format shifted from dance music to [[contemporary hit radio|mainstream CHR]]. Dance, rap, hip-hop, rock, and pop all received equal airplay. A minor name change also took place, with ''Energy 108'' changing to ''Energy Radio''. Under Shaw's ownership, several other stations in Ontario, including [[CKDK-FM]] in [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]]/[[London, Ontario|London]], [[CHAY-FM]] in [[Barrie, Ontario|Barrie]] and [[CKGE-FM]] in [[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]]/[[Toronto]], also adopted the ''Energy Radio'' format, rebroadcasting CING much of the day. Shaw's radio operations were, in turn, spun off to [[Corus Entertainment]] in 1999.\n\n==History of 95.3 FM pre-CING==\n{{Main|CJXY-FM}}\n\nIn 1964, '''CHML-FM''' signed on at 95.3 FM, a sister to the [[CHML|AM station of the same callsign]]. In 1967, the station adopted the new callsign '''CKDS-FM'''. For many years, the station aired an [[easy listening]] format similar to CING, some of the time under the branding '''Lite FM 95.3.''' In September 1991, at the same time as CING was becoming \"Dance 108\", CKDS changed its callsign to [[CJXY-FM|CJXY]], and rebranded as '''Y95''' - a [[classic rock]] station that became a powerhouse in [[Southern Ontario]]. Danny Kingsbury was the architect of this new station as program director. Within 3 years, Y95 was beating sister station [[CILQ-FM]] from Toronto in the ratings - a huge feat for a station from Hamilton, since Hamilton and Toronto are considered to be two separate markets according to the BBM ratings panel and the CRTC. At its peak, the morning show consisted of Jeff Lumby, Tedd Colbear and Todd Lewis. The afternoon drive team consisted of Scott Thompson, Lori Love (now at [[CHRE-FM]]) and Dave Spragge. Eventually, new ownership decided to prop up Q107 by weakening Y95; the classic rock format was moved to the weaker 107.9 frequency.\n\n==Frequency switch; subsequent format changes==\n[[File:CING FM broadcast area.png|thumb|left|Broadcast area map for CING FM as of 2017.]]\nOn August 31, 2001, CING and [[CJXY-FM]] swapped frequencies. CING moved to its current 95.3 frequency, and CJXY took over the 107.9 FM frequency. The frequency switch brought with it a change in the network's sound, with the mainstream CHR format making way for a [[hot adult contemporary]] format. With CING now available over a wider geographic area, the other stations dropped their CING simulcasts in 2002. The new format mirrored the format of Toronto's market leader [[CHUM-FM]], which resulted in very low ratings.\n\nOn August 9, 2002, at 6 p.m., the station dropped its troubled Hot AC format (and the \"Energy\" moniker), and began [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with stand-up comedy bits. The final songs on \"Energy\" were \"[[Rhythm is a Dancer]]\" by [[Snap!]] and \"[[Happy Trails (song)|Happy Trails]]\" by [[Roy Rogers]]. On August 19, 2002, at 7 a.m., the station flipped to country, branded as ''Country 95.3''. The first song on \"Country\" was \"Small Town Saturday Night\" by [[Hal Ketchum]].<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/hamiltonspectator/doc/270122757.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug%208,%202002&author=&pub=The%20Spectator&edition=&startpage=D.11&desc=Hamilton's%20Energy%2095.3%20crosses%20over%20to%20country \"Hamilton's Energy 95.3 crosses over to country\"].</ref><ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/hamiltonspectator/doc/266997036.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Aug%2029,%202002&author=McArthur,%20Greg&pub=The%20Record&edition=&startpage=B.1&desc=Oldies%20back%20on%201090%20AM;%20Energy%2095.3%20goes%20country%20as%20radio%20stations%20change%20formats \"Oldies back on 1090 AM\"].</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 2009, at 3 p.m., CING-FM switched formats from country to [[classic hits]], branded as ''Vinyl 95.3''.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/hamiltonspectator/doc/270363686.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov%2017,%202009&author=Arnold,%20Steve&pub=The%20Spectator&edition=&startpage=A.13&desc=Country%20radio%20goes%20quiet;%20Format%20doesn't%20rope%20in%20enough%20listeners,%20company%20says \"Country radio goes quiet\"].</ref>{{Dead link|date=August 2018}} The final song on \"Country\" was ''[[The Dance (song)|The Dance]]'' by [[Garth Brooks]], while the first song on \"Vinyl\" was ''[[Start Me Up]]'' by [[The Rolling Stones]]. The station's playlist featured the greatest hits of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, and was considered to be the first oldies/classic hits station in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] on FM after the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] permitted the oldies format to be heard full-time on FM for the first time. Locally, the station competed against AM station [[CKOC]]; after Christmas of that year, the station also competed against [[adult hits]] station [[CHBM-FM|CHBM]] in Toronto, which lost their oldies outlet on [[CHUM (AM)|1050 CHUM]], which flipped to a simulcast of [[CP24]] in March of that year.\n\nIn its latter months, the station broadened their playlist to include 90s and current tracks. With this change, however, the station's ratings began to slide.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, at 9:53&nbsp;a.m., the station changed its format back to Hot AC, now branded as ''95.3 Fresh FM''.<ref>[http://rwcrn.com/corus-expands-fresh-fm-to-hamilton Corus expands FRESH FM to Hamilton] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308094903/http://rwcrn.com/corus-expands-fresh-fm-to-hamilton |date=2016-03-08 }}, ''Canadian Radio News - RWCRN'', April 10, 2013</ref> After the format change back to hot AC, the station became the fourth radio station owned by Corus to adopt the ''Fresh FM'' branding.

The last song on \u201cFresh\u201d was \u201c[[Good Feeling (song)|Good Feeling]]\u201d by [[Flo Rida]], while the first song on the revived \u201cEnergy\u201d was \u201c[[High Hopes (Panic! at the Disco song)|High Hopes]]\u201d by [[Panic! At the Disco]]. The change brought with it a new morning show, Tucker and Maura, formerly of [[CKFM-FM|CKFM]] in Toronto. Former morning hosts Colleen Rusholme moved to afternoon drive, while Darrin Laidman decided to leave the company. Later that year, Rusholme departed for [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]] sister station [[CJOT-FM]], and was replaced with the syndicated Brooke & Jubal, based out of [[KQMV]] in [[Seattle]]. CING is the second station in Canada to air the syndicated Brooke and Jubal show following Ottawa sister station [[CKQB]], and the first to air it in afternoons.\n\nCING competes with local stations [[CKLH-FM]] and [[CHRE-FM]], as well as neighboring stations [[CHUM-FM]] and [[CHFI-FM]] (from [[Toronto]]) and [[CHYM-FM]] (from [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]).\n\n==HD Radio==\nIn 2012, CING signed on [[HD Radio]] operations.

In an effort to expand the league, the [[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation]] began approaching various business people in the country areas to gauge their interest in a statewide basketball competition. Among those approached were Brian Middleton and Graham Greenaway, residents of [[Geraldton]]. Middleton and Greenaway convinced Kevin Jones, the Administrator of the Geraldton Amateur Basketball Association (GABA), to join them in establishing a basketball team in Geraldton. With Jones leading the project, Middleton and Greenaway provided funding for the licence and became the team's private owners. They served as the licencees until the GABA eventually bought the rights to the team.<ref name=gero>{{cite web | url=http://www.geraldtonbuccaneers.com.au/History%20of%20the%20Buccs.aspx | title=History of the Buccs | work=GeraldtonBuccaneers.com.au | accessdate=14 March 2017}}</ref> Geraldton was joined by Albany and Bunbury, and then Kalgoorlie and Mandurah.<ref name=\"gero\" />\n\n===Early success===\n1989 saw the formation of the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL).

The Buccaneers compete in the Men's [[State Basketball League]] (SBL) and play their home games at Activewest Stadium. The team is affiliated with Geraldton Amateur Basketball Association (GABA), the major administrative basketball organisation in the region.\n\n==Team history==\n===Establishment===\nIn the 1980s, the highest level of basketball in the state of [[Western Australia]] was played in the [[Perth]]-based District Competition. In an effort to expand the league, the [[Basketball Western Australia|Western Australian Basketball Federation]] began approaching various business people in the country areas to gauge their interest in a statewide basketball competition. Among those approached were Brian Middleton and Graham Greenaway, residents of [[Geraldton]]. Middleton and Greenaway convinced Kevin Jones, the Administrator of the Geraldton Amateur Basketball Association (GABA), to join them in establishing a basketball team in Geraldton. With Jones leading the project, Middleton and Greenaway provided funding for the licence and became the team's private owners. They served as the licencees until the GABA eventually bought the rights to the team.<ref name=gero>{{cite web | url=http://www.geraldtonbuccaneers.com.au/History%20of%20the%20Buccs.aspx | title=History of the Buccs | work=GeraldtonBuccaneers.com.au | accessdate=14 March 2017}}</ref> Geraldton was joined by Albany and Bunbury, and then Kalgoorlie and Mandurah.<ref name=\"gero\" />\n\n===Early success===\n1989 saw the formation of the [[State Basketball League]] (SBL).

Several of the men, most notably Michaels, Nash, and Hall, wielded an immense amount of power within the company at the time, which they used to positively influence one another's careers.\n\nIn May 1996, The Kliq broke character at a [[House show|live event]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in an unscripted incident referred to as the \"Curtain Call\", which had far-reaching ramifications for the WWE specifically and the wrestling world as a whole. At a time when professional wrestling organizations worked to maintain [[Kayfabe|the illusion of storylines and characters]], the Curtain Call marked the first time that such high-profile performers had so publicly broken character, forcing the WWE and other wrestling organizations to begin acknowledging the scripted elements of their programming.\n\nThe Kliq was also the primary catalyst for two of the most well known [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stables]] in wrestling history: the [[The New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and the WWF/E, and [[D-Generation X]] (DX) in the WWF/E. Of the Kliq, Waltman would serve in both groups; Michaels and Triple H were members of DX while Nash and Hall performed with the nWo.\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation and early history ===\nThe Kliq was formed in 1994 by real-life friends Scott Hall (then known as Razor Ramon), Kevin Nash (Diesel), Michael Hickenbottom (Shawn Michaels) and Sean Waltman (1-2-3 Kid). In January 1995, Paul Levesque left WCW and arrived in the WWF as Hunter Hearst Helmsley (Triple H) and became the next member of The Kliq. Each man enjoyed a tremendous amount of popularity with fans, which allotted them a particular degree of control over their own careers. Nash, Hall, and Michaels, then among the company's most popular performers, came up with the idea of forming a backstage alliance, which would potentially allow them to consolidate even more power within the company. [[Bret Hart]], another of the company's top performers at the time, claims in his autobiography ''Hitman'' that he was also asked if he wanted to be part of The Kliq, but declined the offer: \"The thing I remember most about that tour was Shawn, Razor, and Nash talking to me in [[Hamburg]] about the idea of forming a clique of top guys who strictly took care of their own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brethart.com/bio/columns/trip-down-memory-lane-saskatoon-regina |title=A trip down memory lane (Saskatoon & Regina) |first=Bret |last=Hart |authorlink=Bret Hart |year=2007 |publisher=BretHart.com |accessdate=2008-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917002634/http://www.brethart.com/bio/columns/trip-down-memory-lane-saskatoon-regina |archivedate=2008-09-17 }}</ref> Levesque mentioned on the 2013 ''Triple H \u2013 Thy Kingdom Come'' DVD that he was recruited to the Kliq by Kevin Nash because he didn't do drugs or alcohol, and thus could serve as the group's  [[designated driver]] after events.\n\nMichaels claims that the name \"The Kliq\" was originally coined by [[Lex Luger]], due to the closeness of the five friends backstage.<ref name=hbk-p206>{{cite book|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|date=November 2006|page=206}}</ref> Although, Lex Luger had suggested that [[Davey Boy Smith]] created the name, because the five kept \"clicking\", referring to how often they talked.

In one instance, performer [[Carl Ouellet]], then performing as Jean-Pierre Lafitte, claimed that his scheduled defeat of Diesel was vetoed by Michaels, leading to a backstage confrontation between Ouellet and Michaels.<ref name=\"SLAM!

For the first time in modern pro-wrestling history, a major company was forced to acknowledge that its events were scripted; McMahon would later use this to his advantage in the development of several [[metafiction|meta-storylines]], including a skit on the October 6, 1997 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'' in which Michaels and Levesque, both in character, played footage of the Curtain Call incident.<ref>{{cite web|first=John |last=Petrie |title=Monday Night Raw: October 6, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |url=http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw100697 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030610164804/http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw100697 |archivedate=June 10, 2003 |accessdate=2008-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Before the Curtain Call, Levesque had been booked into the finals of the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996 King of the Ring]] tournament during the following summer, but his place \u2013 and the [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that usually went with it \u2013 would instead go to [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], igniting his [[Stone Cold Steve Austin#Austin 3:16 (1996\u20131997)|rise toward superstardom]], an event which ultimately helped the WWF defeat WCW in the [[Monday Night Wars]].<ref name=hbk-p226/><ref name=moon157/> Levesque's acceptance of his punishment and the respect it earned him resulted in him only suffering short-term repercussions.

Many fans criticized Kevin Nash for his booking tenure in WCW since it displayed the same self-promoting behavior associated with The Kliq on an even larger scale. Fans often pointed to Nash booking himself to win the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] from the then-undefeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and the [[Fingerpoke of Doom|subsequent match with Hogan]] as the most grievous of his \"offenses\". Nash, however, claims that he did not have booking power at the time of the incident.<ref>{{cite video|title=Shoot with Kevin Nash|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=3342|people=[[Kevin Nash|Nash, Kevin]]|medium=[[DVD]]|accessdate=2008-08-18|publisher=RF Video}}</ref> Nash's innocence claim is disputed in several [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] interviews by various WCW wrestlers from the time who claimed that he, Hogan and several others often refused to put other wrestlers over in order to keep themselves as the main stars.\n\n[[File:X-Pac 111007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Sean Waltman]] was a member of both the nWo and D-Generation X]]\nMeanwhile, Michaels and Levesque began to persuade WWF management to let them pair up on screen, but management was hesitant and wanted to keep The Kliq separated on-screen.<ref name=time/> They eventually aligned together in the faction [[D-Generation X]] (DX), with Levesque's \"Hunter Hearst Helmsley\" fictional persona gradually transformed and re-dubbed Triple H or HHH, and alongside Levesque's then-girlfriend and on-screen female \"bodyguard\" [[Chyna]].<ref name=time/> [[Rick Rude]] also temporarily joined the group (as a sort of on-screen bodyguard for Michaels), though his membership ended when he signed with WCW after his WWF contract expired in early November 1997.\n\nDX eventually became as influential to the Monday Night Wars as the nWo.

After Bret Hart claimed to have destroyed the Kliq and to have \"run [Scott Hall and Kevin Nash] outta town\", Michaels declared, \"The Kliq owns this [professional wrestling] business\", and said that it had really undergone \"expansion\" rather than \"destruction\". During a brief period in 1998, after Waltman's return to the WWF as X-Pac, in promos the members of D-Generation X made numerous references to their \"friends\" in the WCW. On the April 27, 1998 ''Raw'' (recorded live in [[Hampton, Virginia]]), DX (by now composed of Triple H, Waltman, [[Billy Gunn]], [[Road Dogg]] and [[Chyna]]) staged a mock \"invasion\" protest/paramilitary take-over of the nearby [[Norfolk Scope]], where ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' was being held. Triple H, riding in an [[Willys M38|M38]], chanted \"[[Moses|Let our people go!]]\" through a megaphone during the incident. Waltman called out, \"We just wanted to say 'what's up' to our boys Kevin Nash and Scott Hall\". DX also led a chant of \"WCW sucks\" by fans outside the arena who had tickets to the show (some of whom, Triple H alleged, had been given free tickets to ''Nitro'' by WCW in order to boost crowd numbers, a common trick promoters have done to fill arenas and increase concession and merchandise sales).\n\nIn 2002, after WCW had gone out of business, The nWo was reformed in the WWF with Hall, Nash and Hogan, the group's initial members. Hogan soon left the group after being attacked by Nash and Hall as a result of his turning into a fan favorite at [[WrestleMania X8]]. Other former members, including [[Big Show]] and Waltman, joined the group. Later, Shawn Michaels \u2013 after years away from the ring \u2013was introduced by Kevin Nash as the newest member of the nWo, and Michaels promised the rest of the group that he would soon deliver Triple H. After weeks of lobbying for Triple H's services, a backstage promo of The nWo wishing Triple H luck before the match aired. This included 4 members of The Kliq (Michaels, Nash, Waltman and Triple H), as Big Show appeared wishing Triple H good luck as well. The nWo told Triple H to \"throw up the hand signal\" if he needed any help out there. Shortly thereafter, Nash suffered a torn quadriceps (after returning the same night after time off due to a biceps injury) during a ten-man tag-team match, and the following week Vince McMahon disbanded The nWo. [[Eric Bischoff]] (acting as the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand General Manager) later tried to make Michaels Triple H's manager. This led to a short-lived reformation of DX, as Triple H turned on him the same night, setting off a long and heated [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] that took approximately two years to resolve.<ref name=hbk-p317>{{cite book|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|date=November 2006|pages=317\u2013323}}</ref><!-- Reference only covers from where it says \"This led to a......\" --> The year after, Nash returned from injury as a fan favorite and sided with Michaels against [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] (Triple H, [[Ric Flair]], [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[Randy Orton]]).\n\n=== Later formations ===\nMichaels and Triple H have reformed D-Generation X, first returning together for a six-month stint on the June 12, 2006 edition of Monday Night Raw. They would feud against [[The Spirit Squad]] ([[Kenny Dykstra|Kenny]], [[Johnny Jeter|Johnny]], [[Nick Mitchell|Mitch]], [[Dolph Ziggler|Nicky]], and [[Michael Brendli|Mikey]]), [[Big Show]] and Vince McMahon, and later the team of Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), until Triple H's legitimate knee injury in the beginning of 2007. They would reform again on August 2009 during Shawn Michaels' last year in the WWE. During this year, D-Generation X would capture the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Unified WWE Tag Team Championships]] at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2009)|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]] against Jericho and Big Show, which would become the start of the first and only title reign for Triple H and Shawn Michaels as a tag team. D-Generation X would later go on to disband in March 2010 (after losing the tag Team titles to Big Show and [[The Miz]]). Michaels would then focus heavily on ending the winning streak of [[The Undertaker]] at WrestleMania, having failed to do so at [[WrestleMania XXV]], and he would put his career on the line for their second WrestleMania encounter at [[WrestleMania XXVI]] which he would go on to lose and therefore end his career.\n\nHall, Nash and Waltman (then working for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]) would reunite in a stable called [[The Band (professional wrestling)|The Band]], where Hall and Nash won the [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]], but Hall and Waltman were released shortly after (and Nash's contract would expire later on in the year).\n\nOn April 2, 2011, The Kliq, consisting of Nash, Waltman, Triple H and Shawn Michaels, made a special appearance as Shawn Michaels was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] 2011. Scott Hall decided not to attend the Hall of Fame ceremony or other [[WrestleMania XXVII]] festivities due to concerns of remaining sober. In 2014, at the conclusion of Scott Hall's Hall of Fame induction, the members of The Kliq joined him onstage and reunited for the first time since the curtain call incident. They reunited again in 2015 on an episode of Raw, and then again at Nash's Hall Of Fame induction.\n\nA December 2014 episode of [[WWE Network]] show ''The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW'' focused on The Kliq.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/90228/next-nxt-star-expected-to-move-to-main-roster-top-bouts-for-the-rumble-hogan-talks-acceptance-of-gay-community-in-wrestling-new-title-belt-and-lots-more-wwe-news-.html?p=1|title=Next NXT Star Expected to Move to Main Roster, Top Bouts for the Rumble, Hogan talks of acceptance of gay community in wrestling, New Title Belt? and lots more WWE News|publisher=Pro Wrestling Insider|accessdate=2014-12-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Other associates ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nAlthough the core group of The Kliq has long been known there have always been rumours, suggestions and unofficial members either within the group or on the fringes looking in. The most consistently mentioned name is that of [[Justin Credible|Peter Polaco]] who at the time of The Kliq's formation was working for WWF as Aldo Montoya and would later go on to gain fame as Justin Credible in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]. He apparently became friends with Scott Hall who offered to mentor him and from there he ended up travelling with the rest of the group until he negotiated his WWF release in 1997. Polaco's association with the group is also lent weight by the fact that upon his return to WWF after the closure of ECW in 2001 he instantly aligned himself on TV with [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] with the two going on to form a short lived stable under the name of [[X-Factor (professional wrestling)|X-Factor]] along with [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] as the group's enforcer.\n\nAnother name that has had a long association with The Kliq is that of [[Louie Spicolli]], who was wrestling for the WWF in the early to mid 1990s under the name of Rad Radford. Spicolli's friendship with the group, much like Polaco's, descends from Scott Hall taking the youngster under his wing and having him travel with the rest of them on the road. Spicolli left the WWF after only a few months when he was released to deal with issues that he was having with substance abuse at the time. During this time, Spicolli worked for ECW for a number of months, during which time he could be seen using the now infamous \"Wolf Head\" signal during tapings and matches. In a later interview he denied the association, and asserted that the \"Wolf Head\" symbol was originally Bret Hart's gesture and The Wolfpac stole it. He said he used the symbol in ECW in order to \"take it back.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=ECW wrestlers talk about the KLIQ |publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_7v8nMGPOQ}}</ref> In late 1997, Spicolli returned to the spotlight by signing with WCW and was soon placed on screen as the [[Lackey (manservant)|lackey]] of Scott Hall, with the two engaging in a feud with [[Larry Zbyszko]]. However, the feud was never able to finish due to Spicolli's untimely death from a drug overdose at the age of 27. His death was never publicly acknowledged by any member of the group at the time, with only Zbyszko mentioning it on screen.\n\nPrior to her death in 2016, [[Chyna]] had an association with the group, not only as an original member of [[D-Generation X]], but also through her relationship with Triple H, along with another long-term relationship with Sean Waltman. Her link to The Kliq was unclear, with the details of her split from Triple H in 2000 never made public. Her relationship to Waltman was notorious for the release of a [[Celebrity sex tape|sextape]] in 2004 and Chyna being arrested for domestic assault in 2005 after a drug-fueled fight. It was thought the pair were no longer on speaking terms after going their separate ways to deal with a number of personal issues, including drug and alcohol addictions, as well as issues with depression. When Triple H was asked in 2015 about inducting Chyna into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], he cited the conflict between her work in the adult industry and WWE's current target audience as a reason it would not happen. However, when both Triple H and his wife [[Stephanie McMahon]] were asked the same question after Chyna died, they were both in favor of inducting her.\n\n[[File:Wolfsgru\u00df Graue Woelfe.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"Turkish Wolf\" hand gesture used by members of The Kliq]]\nOther people in the business have often had their names dropped into the hat but have never said either way whether they consider themselves to be a part of the group. The highest profile of these is probably [[Sid Eudy]], better known as Sycho Sid or Sid Vicious. Another high-profile name is [[Rick Rude]], who was both a member of the original [[D-Generation X]] and the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]]. Rude was involved in an incident in which he appeared on both ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' in the same night, protesting on Nitro about the treatment of [[Bret Hart]] during the [[Montreal Screwjob]] (Rude actually appeared on the live ''Nitro'' show with a mustache an hour before appearing on ''Raw'' (which was taped a week earlier) with a full beard). How this affected his standing in the group is unclear, however it has gone on record that prior to his death Rude was one of the most respected people in the business by members of The Kliq.\n\n[[Konnan]] is said to have enjoyed a very close friendship with both Nash and Hall during his run in WCW and was a member of both the nWo and the Wolfpac. Konnan was also influential in bringing in Sean Waltman to [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] for his run with the company throughout 2007 and 2008, with the two aligning on screen for a while as a part of [[La Legi\u00f3n Extranjera]]. [[Curt Hennig]], who was once a tag team partner of Hall during their days in the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]],<ref>[http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/c/curt-hennig-scott-hall/ Online World of Wrestling \u2013 Curt Hennig & Scott Hall]</ref> is also said to have had a long-running friendship with the group, and spent large amounts of his career working either with or against members of the group in various promotions.\n\nThe [[Bullet Club]] stable seen in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Ring of Honor]] pay homage to The Kliq by using the Wolfpac hand symbol, as well as the \"2 Sweet\" catchphrase and DX-style crotch chops. Its WWE offshoot, The Club, also uses the Wolfpac hand symbol. Bullet Club members [[Adam Cole]] and [[The Young Bucks]] (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) also created a subgroup named Superkliq.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)]]\n* [[Two Dudes with Attitudes]]\n* [[New World Order (professional wrestling)]]\n* [[D-Generation X]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{WWE}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kliq, The}}\n[[Category:History of WWE]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling controversies]]\n[[Category:The Kliq members| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Professional wrestling backstage stable}}\n{{Infobox Wrestling team\n|article_name = The Kliq\n|type         = C\n|image        = The Kliq Hall of Fame 2015.jpg\n|image_size   = \n|caption      = The Kliq in 2015\n|name        = The Kliq\n|members      = [[Shawn Michaels]]<br>[[Scott Hall]]<br>[[Kevin Nash]]<br>[[Triple H]]<br>[[Sean Waltman]]\n}}\n'''The Kliq''' was a backstage group in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]) during the mid-1990s, composed of [[Scott Hall]], [[Kevin Nash]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Paul Levesque]], and [[Sean Waltman]]. Several of the men, most notably Michaels, Nash, and Hall, wielded an immense amount of power within the company at the time, which they used to positively influence one another's careers.\n\nIn May 1996, The Kliq broke character at a [[House show|live event]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in an unscripted incident referred to as the \"Curtain Call\", which had far-reaching ramifications for the WWE specifically and the wrestling world as a whole. At a time when professional wrestling organizations worked to maintain [[Kayfabe|the illusion of storylines and characters]], the Curtain Call marked the first time that such high-profile performers had so publicly broken character, forcing the WWE and other wrestling organizations to begin acknowledging the scripted elements of their programming.\n\nThe Kliq was also the primary catalyst for two of the most well known [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stables]] in wrestling history: the [[The New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and the WWF/E, and [[D-Generation X]] (DX) in the WWF/E. Of the Kliq, Waltman would serve in both groups; Michaels and Triple H were members of DX while Nash and Hall performed with the nWo.\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation and early history ===\nThe Kliq was formed in 1994 by real-life friends Scott Hall (then known as Razor Ramon), Kevin Nash (Diesel), Michael Hickenbottom (Shawn Michaels) and Sean Waltman (1-2-3 Kid). In January 1995, Paul Levesque left WCW and arrived in the WWF as Hunter Hearst Helmsley (Triple H) and became the next member of The Kliq. Each man enjoyed a tremendous amount of popularity with fans, which allotted them a particular degree of control over their own careers. Nash, Hall, and Michaels, then among the company's most popular performers, came up with the idea of forming a backstage alliance, which would potentially allow them to consolidate even more power within the company. [[Bret Hart]], another of the company's top performers at the time, claims in his autobiography ''Hitman'' that he was also asked if he wanted to be part of The Kliq, but declined the offer: \"The thing I remember most about that tour was Shawn, Razor, and Nash talking to me in [[Hamburg]] about the idea of forming a clique of top guys who strictly took care of their own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brethart.com/bio/columns/trip-down-memory-lane-saskatoon-regina |title=A trip down memory lane (Saskatoon & Regina) |first=Bret |last=Hart |authorlink=Bret Hart |year=2007 |publisher=BretHart.com |accessdate=2008-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917002634/http://www.brethart.com/bio/columns/trip-down-memory-lane-saskatoon-regina |archivedate=2008-09-17 }}</ref> Levesque mentioned on the 2013 ''Triple H \u2013 Thy Kingdom Come'' DVD that he was recruited to the Kliq by Kevin Nash because he didn't do drugs or alcohol, and thus could serve as the group's  [[designated driver]] after events.\n\nMichaels claims that the name \"The Kliq\" was originally coined by [[Lex Luger]], due to the closeness of the five friends backstage.<ref name=hbk-p206>{{cite book|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|date=November 2006|page=206}}</ref> Although, Lex Luger had suggested that [[Davey Boy Smith]] created the name, because the five kept \"clicking\", referring to how often they talked.

In one instance, performer [[Carl Ouellet]], then performing as Jean-Pierre Lafitte, claimed that his scheduled defeat of Diesel was vetoed by Michaels, leading to a backstage confrontation between Ouellet and Michaels.<ref name=\"SLAM!

For the first time in modern pro-wrestling history, a major company was forced to acknowledge that its events were scripted; McMahon would later use this to his advantage in the development of several [[metafiction|meta-storylines]], including a skit on the October 6, 1997 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'' in which Michaels and Levesque, both in character, played footage of the Curtain Call incident.<ref>{{cite web|first=John |last=Petrie |title=Monday Night Raw: October 6, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |url=http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw100697 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030610164804/http://otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw100697 |archivedate=June 10, 2003 |accessdate=2008-08-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Before the Curtain Call, Levesque had been booked into the finals of the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996 King of the Ring]] tournament during the following summer, but his place \u2013 and the [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that usually went with it \u2013 would instead go to [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], igniting his [[Stone Cold Steve Austin#Austin 3:16 (1996\u20131997)|rise toward superstardom]], an event which ultimately helped the WWF defeat WCW in the [[Monday Night Wars]].<ref name=hbk-p226/><ref name=moon157/> Levesque's acceptance of his punishment and the respect it earned him resulted in him only suffering short-term repercussions.

Many fans criticized Kevin Nash for his booking tenure in WCW since it displayed the same self-promoting behavior associated with The Kliq on an even larger scale. Fans often pointed to Nash booking himself to win the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] from the then-undefeated [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] and the [[Fingerpoke of Doom|subsequent match with Hogan]] as the most grievous of his \"offenses\". Nash, however, claims that he did not have booking power at the time of the incident.<ref>{{cite video|title=Shoot with Kevin Nash|url=http://www.rfvideo.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWPROD&ProdID=3342|people=[[Kevin Nash|Nash, Kevin]]|medium=[[DVD]]|accessdate=2008-08-18|publisher=RF Video}}</ref> Nash's innocence claim is disputed in several [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] interviews by various WCW wrestlers from the time who claimed that he, Hogan and several others often refused to put other wrestlers over in order to keep themselves as the main stars.\n\n[[File:X-Pac 111007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Sean Waltman]] was a member of both the nWo and D-Generation X]]\nMeanwhile, Michaels and Levesque began to persuade WWF management to let them pair up on screen, but management was hesitant and wanted to keep The Kliq separated on-screen.<ref name=time/> They eventually aligned together in the faction [[D-Generation X]] (DX), with Levesque's \"Hunter Hearst Helmsley\" fictional persona gradually transformed and re-dubbed Triple H or HHH, and alongside Levesque's then-girlfriend and on-screen female \"bodyguard\" [[Chyna]].<ref name=time/> [[Rick Rude]] also temporarily joined the group (as a sort of on-screen bodyguard for Michaels), though his membership ended when he signed with WCW after his WWF contract expired in early November 1997.\n\nDX eventually became as influential to the Monday Night Wars as the nWo.

After Bret Hart claimed to have destroyed the Kliq and to have \"run [Scott Hall and Kevin Nash] outta town\", Michaels declared, \"The Kliq owns this [professional wrestling] business\", and said that it had really undergone \"expansion\" rather than \"destruction\". During a brief period in 1998, after Waltman's return to the WWF as X-Pac, in promos the members of D-Generation X made numerous references to their \"friends\" in the WCW. On the April 27, 1998 ''Raw'' (recorded live in [[Hampton, Virginia]]), DX (by now composed of Triple H, Waltman, [[Billy Gunn]], [[Road Dogg]] and [[Chyna]]) staged a mock \"invasion\" protest/paramilitary take-over of the nearby [[Norfolk Scope]], where ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' was being held. Triple H, riding in an [[Willys M38|M38]], chanted \"[[Moses|Let our people go!]]\" through a megaphone during the incident. Waltman called out, \"We just wanted to say 'what's up' to our boys Kevin Nash and Scott Hall\". DX also led a chant of \"WCW sucks\" by fans outside the arena who had tickets to the show (some of whom, Triple H alleged, had been given free tickets to ''Nitro'' by WCW in order to boost crowd numbers, a common trick promoters have done to fill arenas and increase concession and merchandise sales).\n\nIn 2002, after WCW had gone out of business, The nWo was reformed in the WWF with Hall, Nash and Hogan, the group's initial members. Hogan soon left the group after being attacked by Nash and Hall as a result of his turning into a fan favorite at [[WrestleMania X8]]. Other former members, including [[Big Show]] and Waltman, joined the group. Later, Shawn Michaels \u2013 after years away from the ring \u2013was introduced by Kevin Nash as the newest member of the nWo, and Michaels promised the rest of the group that he would soon deliver Triple H. After weeks of lobbying for Triple H's services, a backstage promo of The nWo wishing Triple H luck before the match aired. This included 4 members of The Kliq (Michaels, Nash, Waltman and Triple H), as Big Show appeared wishing Triple H good luck as well. The nWo told Triple H to \"throw up the hand signal\" if he needed any help out there. Shortly thereafter, Nash suffered a torn quadriceps (after returning the same night after time off due to a biceps injury) during a ten-man tag-team match, and the following week Vince McMahon disbanded The nWo. [[Eric Bischoff]] (acting as the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand General Manager) later tried to make Michaels Triple H's manager. This led to a short-lived reformation of DX, as Triple H turned on him the same night, setting off a long and heated [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feud]] that took approximately two years to resolve.<ref name=hbk-p317>{{cite book|title=Heartbreak & Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story|first=Shawn|last=Michaels|authorlink=Shawn Michaels|author2=Feigenbaum, Aaron |isbn=1-4165-2645-5|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|date=November 2006|pages=317\u2013323}}</ref><!-- Reference only covers from where it says \"This led to a......\" --> The year after, Nash returned from injury as a fan favorite and sided with Michaels against [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] (Triple H, [[Ric Flair]], [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[Randy Orton]]).\n\n=== Later formations ===\nMichaels and Triple H have reformed D-Generation X, first returning together for a six-month stint on the June 12, 2006 edition of Monday Night Raw. They would feud against [[The Spirit Squad]] ([[Kenny Dykstra|Kenny]], [[Johnny Jeter|Johnny]], [[Nick Mitchell|Mitch]], [[Dolph Ziggler|Nicky]], and [[Michael Brendli|Mikey]]), [[Big Show]] and Vince McMahon, and later the team of Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), until Triple H's legitimate knee injury in the beginning of 2007. They would reform again on August 2009 during Shawn Michaels' last year in the WWE. During this year, D-Generation X would capture the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Unified WWE Tag Team Championships]] at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2009)|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]] against Jericho and Big Show, which would become the start of the first and only title reign for Triple H and Shawn Michaels as a tag team. D-Generation X would later go on to disband in March 2010 (after losing the tag Team titles to Big Show and [[The Miz]]). Michaels would then focus heavily on ending the winning streak of [[The Undertaker]] at WrestleMania, having failed to do so at [[WrestleMania XXV]], and he would put his career on the line for their second WrestleMania encounter at [[WrestleMania XXVI]] which he would go on to lose and therefore end his career.\n\nHall, Nash and Waltman (then working for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]) would reunite in a stable called [[The Band (professional wrestling)|The Band]], where Hall and Nash won the [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]], but Hall and Waltman were released shortly after (and Nash's contract would expire later on in the year).\n\nOn April 2, 2011, The Kliq, consisting of Nash, Waltman, Triple H and Shawn Michaels, made a special appearance as Shawn Michaels was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] 2011. Scott Hall decided not to attend the Hall of Fame ceremony or other [[WrestleMania XXVII]] festivities due to concerns of remaining sober. In 2014, at the conclusion of Scott Hall's Hall of Fame induction, the members of The Kliq joined him onstage and reunited for the first time since the curtain call incident. They reunited again in 2015 on an episode of Raw, and then again at Nash's Hall Of Fame induction.\n\nA December 2014 episode of [[WWE Network]] show ''The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW'' focused on The Kliq.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/90228/next-nxt-star-expected-to-move-to-main-roster-top-bouts-for-the-rumble-hogan-talks-acceptance-of-gay-community-in-wrestling-new-title-belt-and-lots-more-wwe-news-.html?p=1|title=Next NXT Star Expected to Move to Main Roster, Top Bouts for the Rumble, Hogan talks of acceptance of gay community in wrestling, New Title Belt? and lots more WWE News|publisher=Pro Wrestling Insider|accessdate=2014-12-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Other associates ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nAlthough the core group of The Kliq has long been known there have always been rumours, suggestions and unofficial members either within the group or on the fringes looking in. The most consistently mentioned name is that of [[Justin Credible|Peter Polaco]] who at the time of The Kliq's formation was working for WWF as Aldo Montoya and would later go on to gain fame as Justin Credible in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]. He apparently became friends with Scott Hall who offered to mentor him and from there he ended up travelling with the rest of the group until he negotiated his WWF release in 1997. Polaco's association with the group is also lent weight by the fact that upon his return to WWF after the closure of ECW in 2001 he instantly aligned himself on TV with [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] with the two going on to form a short lived stable under the name of [[X-Factor (professional wrestling)|X-Factor]] along with [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] as the group's enforcer.\n\nAnother name that has had a long association with The Kliq is that of [[Louie Spicolli]], who was wrestling for the WWF in the early to mid 90's under the name of Rad Radford. Spicolli's friendship with the group, much like Polaco's, descends from Scott Hall taking the youngster under his wing and having him travel with the rest of them on the road. Spicolli left the WWF after only a few months when he was released to deal with issues that he was having with substance abuse at the time. During this time, Spicolli worked for ECW for a number of months, during which time he could be seen using the now infamous \"Wolf Head\" signal during tapings and matches. In a later interview he denied the association, and asserted that the \"Wolf Head\" symbol was originally Bret Hart's gesture and The Wolfpac stole it. He said he used the symbol in ECW in order to \"take it back.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=ECW wrestlers talk about the KLIQ |publisher=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_7v8nMGPOQ}}</ref> In late 1997, Spicolli returned to the spotlight by signing with WCW and was soon placed on screen as the [[Lackey (manservant)|lackey]] of Scott Hall, with the two engaging in a feud with [[Larry Zbyszko]]. However, the feud was never able to finish due to Spicolli's untimely death from a drug overdose at the age of 27. His death was never publicly acknowledged by any member of the group at the time, with only Zbyszko mentioning it on screen.\n\nPrior to her death in 2016, [[Chyna]] had an association with the group, not only as an original member of [[D-Generation X]], but also through her relationship with Triple H, along with another long-term relationship with Sean Waltman. Her link to The Kliq was unclear, with the details of her split from Triple H in 2000 never made public. Her relationship to Waltman was notorious for the release of a [[Celebrity sex tape|sextape]] in 2004 and Chyna being arrested for domestic assault in 2005 after a drug-fueled fight. It was thought the pair were no longer on speaking terms after going their separate ways to deal with a number of personal issues, including drug and alcohol addictions, as well as issues with depression. When Triple H was asked in 2015 about inducting Chyna into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], he cited the conflict between her work in the adult industry and WWE's current target audience as a reason it would not happen. However, when both Triple H and his wife [[Stephanie McMahon]] were asked the same question after Chyna died, they were both in favor of inducting her.\n\n[[File:Wolfsgru\u00df Graue Woelfe.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"Turkish Wolf\" hand gesture used by members of The Kliq]]\nOther people in the business have often had their names dropped into the hat but have never said either way whether they consider themselves to be a part of the group. The highest profile of these is probably [[Sid Eudy]], better known as Sycho Sid or Sid Vicious. Another high-profile name is [[Rick Rude]], who was both a member of the original [[D-Generation X]] and the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]]. Rude was involved in an incident in which he appeared on both ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' and ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' in the same night, protesting on Nitro about the treatment of [[Bret Hart]] during the [[Montreal Screwjob]] (Rude actually appeared on the live ''Nitro'' show with a mustache an hour before appearing on ''Raw'' (which was taped a week earlier) with a full beard). How this affected his standing in the group is unclear, however it has gone on record that prior to his death Rude was one of the most respected people in the business by members of The Kliq.\n\n[[Konnan]] is said to have enjoyed a very close friendship with both Nash and Hall during his run in WCW and was a member of both the nWo and the Wolfpac. Konnan was also influential in bringing in Sean Waltman to [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] for his run with the company throughout 2007 and 2008, with the two aligning on screen for a while as a part of [[La Legi\u00f3n Extranjera]]. [[Curt Hennig]], who was once a tag team partner of Hall during their days in the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]],<ref>[http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/c/curt-hennig-scott-hall/ Online World of Wrestling \u2013 Curt Hennig & Scott Hall]</ref> is also said to have had a long-running friendship with the group, and spent large amounts of his career working either with or against members of the group in various promotions.\n\nThe [[Bullet Club]] stable seen in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Ring of Honor]] pay homage to The Kliq by using the Wolfpac hand symbol, as well as the \"2 Sweet\" catchphrase and DX-style crotch chops. Its WWE offshoot, The Club, also uses the Wolfpac hand symbol. Bullet Club members [[Adam Cole]] and [[The Young Bucks]] (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) also created a subgroup named Superkliq.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)]]\n* [[Two Dudes with Attitudes]]\n* [[New World Order (professional wrestling)]]\n* [[D-Generation X]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{WWE}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kliq, The}}\n[[Category:History of WWE]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling controversies]]\n[[Category:The Kliq members| ]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo/fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kliq"}
