It recounts the ''[[rishi]]'' Shandilya as performing a grand ''[[Yajna]]'' in the Sharda area, involving the local people and hundreds of worthy priests. During the ''Yajna'', a beautiful woman appeared, introducing herself as a [[Brahmin]]i who wished to participate. She said that she and her companion had come a long way and asked for food. Shandilya welcomed her and told her that the rules of the ''Yajna'' forbade him from giving her the food: the ''Yajna'' had to be completed, and the ''Purohits'' fed first. The Brahmini grew angry and declared herself to be [[V\u0101c]], the Vedic goddess and [[Adi Parashakti|Divine Mother]]. She revealed to him that the [[Paramatman]] he worshipped was the essence of the goddess. In her anger, she transformed before him into the divine ''Neela'' (or ''blue'') form of [[Saraswati]], with ornaments, weapons, and clouds, and declared that she would absorb the world. In shock, remorse and fear, Shandilya collapsed and died. Seeing his remorse, the goddess had him revived with ''[[Amrita]]'', the elixir of life, and transformed into a different, graceful form of Saraswati. Addressing him as \"son\", she told him that she was pleased with his devotion and compassion and would grant him whatever he wished. Shandilya, addressing her as the Divine Mother, asked her to revive the dead and restore the village and forest. Saraswati did so, instructing him to build his [[ashram]] at the base of the hill near the Madhumati river (present-day Neelum River). She took her abode there at Sharada Peeth.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tikkoo|first=Brij Nath|url=https://archive.org/details/ShriSharadaMahatmyaBrijNathTikkoo|title=Shri Sharada Mahatmya|publisher=Vikas Printing Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Ajmer|pages=(ii), 1, 7\u201313}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative account holds that Shandilya prayed to the goddess Sharada with great devotion, and was rewarded when she appeared to him and promised to show him her real, divine form. She advised him to look for the Sharada forest, and his journey was filled with miraculous experiences. On his way, he had a vision of the god [[Ganesha]] on the eastern side of a hill. When he reached the Neelum river, he bathed in it and saw half his body turn golden. Eventually, the goddess revealed herself to him in her triple form of Sharada, Saraswati and Vagdevi, and invited him to her abode. As he was preparing for a ritual, he drew water from the ''Mah\u0101sindhu''. Half of this water transformed into honey, and became a stream, now known as the ''Madhumati'' stream.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nA third account holds that during a fight between good and evil, the goddess Sharada saved a mythical container of knowledge and hid it in a hole in the ground.

The two mountains overlooking the valley, Shardi and Nardi, are named after them. One day, Narada saw, from her abode on the mountain, that Sharada had died, and that giants were fleeing from her body. Furious, she summoned them and ordered them to build her a tomb, which became Sharada Peeth. The second legend says that there one was a giant who loved a princess. She desired a palace, and so he began work. At the time of morning [[Adhan|azan]], by which time he was supposed to have finished, the roof remained incomplete, and for that reason, Sharada Peeth today remains without a roof.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u2013120\" />\n\n== Literary and cultural references ==\n[[File:View_From_Sharda_Fort,_Azad_Jammu_&_Kashmir,_Pakistan.jpg|alt=|thumb|320x320px|View of Neelum Valley from Sharada Peeth, where King Jayasimha's Royal Army would have camped]]Sharada Peeth has appeared in various historical and literary texts.

Three princes, Lothana, Vigraharaja and Bhoja, rebelled against [[Lohara dynasty#Jayasimha|King Jayasimha of Kashmir]]. These princes, pursued by the Royal Army, sought refuge in the upper Kishenganga Valley, in the Sirahsila Castle. Kalhana believed that the Royal Army took refuge in Sharada Peeth, because it had the open space required for a temporary military village, and because the area surrounding the Sirahsila Castle was not large enough to host a camp for a siege without the siege force being vulnerable to archers.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u20131202\" />[[File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|299x299px|Adi Shankara, who opened Sharada Peeth's south door]]In the 14th century text ''Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam'', there is a test, unique to Sharada Peeth, known as the ''Sarvajna Peetham'', or Throne of Omniscience.

As he approached the southern door, he was stopped by various learned men from the [[Nyaya]] school of philosophy, Buddhists, [[Digambara|Digambara Jains]], and the followers of [[Jaimini]]. Engaging with them, he managed to persuade all of them of his proficiency in philosophy, and they stood aside to let him open the entrance. Finally, as he was about to ascend the throne, he heard the voice of the goddess Sharada challenging him. The voice said that omniscience was not enough if one was impure, and that Shankara, who lived in the palace of King Amaruka, could not be pure. Shankara replied that his body had never committed a sin, and the sins committed by another could not blemish him.

It sits on a hill, and is approached via a stone stairway to the remains of a thick stone wall and ruined gateway. The ruins appear to enclose a rectangular area, which at one point would have had its corners aligned with the cardinal points of the compass. The temple is square in plan, and sits on a square plinth, with its doorway facing west. There are five steps between the ground and the entrance, which at one point would have had a half-vaulted ceiling, behind which lay a [[Trefoil arch]] leading to the inner sanctum. Today, this area is exposed to the sky. There are some suggestions that the roof was made of stone, but the temple's roof was more recently made of wood, and some historians suggest that this has always been the case.<ref name=\":3\" /> The facades are repetitive, possibly because architects disliked plain outside walls, or else possibly so that even if the spire collapsed, a visitor would be able to tell what the temple originally looked like. The design is simple, with a plain conical Sharada spire. Possibly, the simplicity of the design means that the temple was designed (or more likely, later reconstructed) as a plainer architectural second to the Martand Sun Temple for local worshippers. Both the Martand Sun Temple and the [[Malot]] Fort are designed similarly, but more ornately.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Rashid|first=Salman|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1398483/heritage-goddess-of-the-mountains|title=Heritage: Goddess of the Mountains|date=1 April 2018|work=Dawn|access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=50em}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Pollock\n|first=Sheldon\n|year=2006\n|title=Language of the Gods in the World of Men\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|ref=harv\n}}.\n*{{cite book |last1=Chitkara |first1=M.G |title=Kashmir Shaivism: Under Siege |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CK0DFijayQC&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2002 |publisher=A.P.H.Publishing Corporation |location= New Delhi|isbn=8176483605 |year=2002 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Pandit |first=Bansi|title=Explore Kashmiri Pandits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsoC6GWr47QC&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=sharda&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2008 |publisher=Dharma Publications |location=USA |language= |isbn=0963479865 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sharada Peeth}}\n*[http://www.pbase.com/hgharib/shardatemple Photo gallery of Sharada Peeth]\n\n{{Ancient Dharmic centres of Higher Learning|state=expanded}}\n{{Hindu temples in Pakistan}}\n{{Cultural heritage sites in Azad Kashmir}}\n\n[[Category:Adi Shankara]]\n[[Category:Destroyed temples]]\n[[Category:Buddhist universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmiri Brahmins]]\n[[Category:Saraswati temples]]\n[[Category:Ancient universities of the Indian subcontinent]]\n[[Category:Forts in Azad Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Neelam District]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Azad Kashmir]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-protected|reason=Persistent [[WP:Disruptive editing|disruptive editing]]|small=yes}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use Pakistani English|date=March 2018}}\n\n{{Infobox religious building\n| name                  = Sharada Peeth\n| native_name           = {{plainlist}}\n* {{nq|\u0634\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0627 \u067e\u06cc\u0679\u06be}}\n* \u0936\u093e\u0930\u0926\u093e \u092a\u0940\u0920\n* \ud804\uddaf\ud804\uddb3\ud804\uddab\ud804\udda2\ud804\uddb3 \ud804\udda5\ud804\uddb5\ud804\udd9c\n{{endplainlist}}\n| native_name_lang      = Kashmiri\n| image                 = [[File:Sharda Fort, Azad Jammu & Kashmir.jpg|centre|frameless|350x350px]]\n| image_upright         = \n| alt                   = \n| caption               = Ruins of Sharada Peeth\n| image2                = \n| caption2              =\n| map_type              = Kashmir#Pakistan\n| map_size              =  \n| map_alt               = \n| map_relief            = \n| map_caption           = Sharada Peeth\n| coordinates           = {{coord|34|47|31|N|74|11|24|E|display=inline}}\n| coordinates_footnotes =\n| religious_affiliation = [[Hinduism]]\n| locale                = \n| location              = [[Sharda, Azad Kashmir|Sharda]], [[Azad Kashmir]]\n| deity                 = [[Saraswati|Sharada]]\n| rite                  = [[Shaktism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Vedism]] \n| sect                  = \n| tradition             = \n| festival              = <!-- or | festivals = -->\n| cercle                = \n| sector                = \n| municipality          = \n| district              = [[Neelam Valley]]\n| territory             = [[Azad Kashmir]]\n| prefecture            = \n| state                 = \n| province              = \n| region                = \n| country               = [[Pakistan]]\n| administration        = \n| consecration_year     = \n| organisational_status = <!-- or | organizational_status = -->\n| functional_status     = \n| heritage_designation  = Undesignated\n| ownership             = \n| governing_body        = \n| leadership            = \n| bhattaraka            = \n| patron                = \n| website               = \n| architect             = \n| architecture_type     = \n| architecture_style    = Kashmiri<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://heritage-india.com/medieval-stone-temples-of-kashmir/|title=The Unexplored Medieval Stone Temples of Kashmir|last=Singh|first=Rajesh|website=Heritage India Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925035448/https://heritage-india.com/medieval-stone-temples-of-kashmir/|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=|access-date=25 September 2018|quote=However, a few still stand in different states of preservation at places like Martand, Avantipur, Pattan, Buniar, Pandrethan and Payar, reflecting not only the remarkable temple construction activity that once existed in Kashmir but also showcasing a distinct architectural style.

During the ''Yajna'', a beautiful woman appeared, introducing herself as a [[Brahmin]]i who wished to participate. She said that she and her companion had come a long way and asked for food. Shandilya welcomed her and told her that the rules of the ''Yajna'' forbade him from giving her the food: the ''Yajna'' had to be completed, and the ''Purohits'' fed first. The Brahmini grew angry and declared herself to be [[V\u0101c]], the Vedic goddess and [[Adi Parashakti|Divine Mother]]. She revealed to him that the [[Paramatman]] he worshipped was the essence of the goddess. In her anger, she transformed before him into the divine ''Neela'' (or ''blue'') form of [[Saraswati]], with ornaments, weapons, and clouds, and declared that she would absorb the world.

Addressing him as \"son\", she told him that she was pleased with his devotion and compassion and would grant him whatever he wished. Shandilya, addressing her as the Divine Mother, asked her to revive the dead and restore the village and forest.

These included priests and traders, as well as saints and their disciples. As a religious ritual, Kashmiri Pandit theologians across Kashmir would place their manuscripts in covered platters before idols of the goddess Sharada, to obtain her blessings. They believed that the goddess would convey approval of the pages of writings by leaving them undisturbed, and disapproval by leaving the pages ruffled. In addition, an annual fair would be held at Shardi village, with pilgrims travelling through [[Kupwara]] (in present-day Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir), in worship of the goddess Sharada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ikashmir.net/sharda/sharda5.html|title=Kashmir: Religious Practices|website=ikashmir.net|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Kashmiri Pandits believe that the Sharada pilgrimage parallels Shandilya's journey, and that the act of bathing in the confluence of the Neelum River and Madhumati stream cleanses the pilgrim of their sins.<ref name=\":32\" /> In 1947, the Kashmiri saint Swami Nand Lal Ji moved some of the stone idols to Tikker in [[Kupwara]].

It sits on a hill, and is approached via a stone stairway to the remains of a thick stone wall and ruined gateway. The ruins appear to enclose a rectangular area, which at one point would have had its corners aligned with the cardinal points of the compass. The temple is square in plan, and sits on a square plinth, with its doorway facing west. There are five steps between the ground and the entrance, which at one point would have had a half-vaulted ceiling, behind which lay a [[Trefoil arch]] leading to the inner sanctum. Today, this area is exposed to the sky. There are some suggestions that the roof was made of stone, but the temple's roof was more recently made of wood, and some historians suggest that this has always been the case.<ref name=\":3\" /> The facades are repetitive, possibly because architects disliked plain outside walls, or else possibly so that even if the spire collapsed, a visitor would be able to tell what the temple originally looked like. The design is simple, with a plain conical Sharada spire. Possibly, the simplicity of the design means that the temple was designed (or more likely, later reconstructed) as a plainer architectural second to the Martand Sun Temple for local worshippers. Both the Martand Sun Temple and the [[Malot]] Fort are designed similarly, but more ornately.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Rashid|first=Salman|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1398483/heritage-goddess-of-the-mountains|title=Heritage: Goddess of the Mountains|date=1 April 2018|work=Dawn|access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=50em}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Pollock\n|first=Sheldon\n|year=2006\n|title=Language of the Gods in the World of Men\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|ref=harv\n}}.\n*{{cite book |last1=Chitkara |first1=M.G |title=Kashmir Shaivism: Under Siege |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CK0DFijayQC&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2002 |publisher=A.P.H.Publishing Corporation |location= New Delhi|isbn=8176483605 |year=2002 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Pandit |first=Bansi|title=Explore Kashmiri Pandits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsoC6GWr47QC&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=sharda&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2008 |publisher=Dharma Publications |location=USA |language= |isbn=0963479865 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sharada Peeth}}\n*[http://www.pbase.com/hgharib/shardatemple Photo gallery of Sharada Peeth]\n\n{{Ancient Dharmic centres of Higher Learning|state=expanded}}\n{{Hindu temples in Pakistan}}\n{{Cultural heritage sites in Azad Kashmir}}\n\n[[Category:Adi Shankara]]\n[[Category:Destroyed temples]]\n[[Category:Buddhist universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmiri Brahmins]]\n[[Category:Saraswati temples]]\n[[Category:Ancient universities of the Indian subcontinent]]\n[[Category:Forts in Azad Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Neelam District]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Azad Kashmir]]\n", "name_user": "Vami IV", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLocal legends", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharada_Peeth"}

Most human populations throughout history validate this theory, as does the overall current global population. Populations of [[hunter-gatherer]]s fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food. The world human population began increasing after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and its increased food supply.<ref>GJ Armelagos, AH Goodman, KH Jacobs Population and environment - 1991 link.springer.com</ref> This was, subsequent to the [[Green Revolution]], followed by even more severely accelerated population growth, which continues today. Often, wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities; however, proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run. Peter Farb, for example, has commented on the paradox that \"intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population.\"<ref>Farb, Peter: 1978, ''Humankind''. Boston, Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Daniel Quinn has also focused on this phenomenon, which he calls the \"[[Food Race]]\" (comparable, in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe, to the [[nuclear arms race]]).\n\nCritics of this theory point out that, in the modern era, birth rates are lowest in the [[developed nation]]s, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply. The United Nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas, including Germany, Italy, Japan, and most of the states of the former Soviet Union, is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.<ref>Rosa, Daniele (2019). \"[http://www.affaritaliani.it/nel-2050-gli-italiani-saranno-20-milioni-meno-secondo-l-onu-612218.html Nel 2050 gli italiani saranno 20 milioni meno secondo l'Onu &#91;Translation: ''In 2050 the Italians will be 20 million less, according to the UN''&#93;]\". ''Affaritaliani''. Uomini & Affari Srl.</ref> This shows that, limited to the scope of the population living within a single given political boundary, particular human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply. However, the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major ''exporters'' of food to poorer populations, so that, \"it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas (Allaby, 1984; Pimentel et al., 1999) that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/bystrc/pub/pimentel.pdf|title=Human population numbers as a function of food supply|work=Russel Hopfenburg, David Pimentel, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA;2Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA}}\n</ref>\n\nRegardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability, the [[world population|human population]] is, on the global scale, undeniably increasing,<ref>[[Daniel Quinn]] (1996).

The depletion of these trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example, when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate because their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels will plummet. The DO levels dropping will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate. This along with climate change, and ocean acidification can cause the collapse of an ecosystem.\n\n===Depletion and destruction of resources===\n[[File:World energy consumption, 1970-2025, EIA.png|thumb|World energy consumption and predictions, 1970\u20132025.]]\nFurther environmental impacts that overpopulation may cause include [[depletion of natural resources]], especially [[fossil fuels]].<ref>Hubbert, M.K.

With the global population at about 7.5 billion, and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water, there is a demand for 15 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living (United). Weather patterns, elevation, and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water. Without clean water, good health is not a viable option. Besides drinking, water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life. In addition to drinking water, water is also used for bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, a variety of cleaning methods, recreation, watering lawns, and farm irrigation.\nIrrigation poses one of the largest problems, because without sufficient water to irrigate crops, the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation. In addition to water needed for crops and food, there is limited land area dedicated to food production, and not much more that is suitable to be added. Arable land, needed to sustain the growing population, is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply. There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population (Bashford 240). Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth. No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict. Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture, and there is not room for much more. Although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year, when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the plants may not be able to keep up (Biello). Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded. By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land, the soil becomes exhausted. Because the soil is exhausted, it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before, and is overall less productive. Therefore, by using resources beyond a sustainable level, the resource become nullified and ineffective, which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource. There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles.\n<ref>Bashford, Alison. \"Population, Geopolitics, and International Organizations in the Mid Twentieth Century.\" Journal of World History 19.3 (2008): 327\u2013347.

Two studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. [[Andrey Korotayev]], in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.<ref name=t1>{{cite journal|vauthors=Turchin P, Korotayev A|url=https://www.academia.edu/41550406|title=Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration|journal=[[Social Evolution & History]]|volume=5|issue=2|date=2006|pages=112\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nPopulation and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks).\n\nFurthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.<ref name=t1/><ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Korotayev A, Malkov A, Khaltourina D|url=http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?lang=en&blang=en&page=Book&id=37484|title=Introduction to Social Macrodynamics.

The latter factor stems from the fact that children [[child labor|perform a great deal of work]] in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions.\n\nMany countries have high population growth rates but lower [[total fertility rate]]s because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age, so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity.\n\"Demographic entrapment\" is a concept developed by Maurice King, Honorary Research Fellow at the [[University of Leeds]], who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its [[carrying capacity]], no possibility of migration, and exports too little to be able to import food.

Some solutions are to be applied on a global planetary level (e.g., via [[United Nations|UN]] resolutions), while some on a country or state government organization level, and some on a family or an individual level. Some of the proposed mitigations aim to help implement new social, cultural, behavioral and political norms to replace or significantly modify current norms.\n\nFor example, in societies like China, the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple. Other societies have implemented social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects. \"The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost. A variety of print materials (flyers, brochures, fact sheets, stickers) needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship, sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks (taxis / bus stands).\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.community.peacecorpsconnect.org/view/514/utilizing-social-marking-and-social-norms-to-addresss-problems-in-the-gambia |title=Utilizing social marketing and social norms to address problems in gambia |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=12 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSuch prompts work to introduce the problem so that new or modified social norms are easier to implement.

Cities and their expansion are also harmful to migrating birds and other species, which face the threat of starvation due to the clearing of their natural habitat for human habitation.\n\nIt may be that the rhetoric supporting city densification is a means of avoiding dealing with the actual problem of over population to begin with and rather than treating city densification as a symptom of the root problem, it has been promoted by the same interests that have profited from population increase e.g. property developers, the banking system, which invests in property development, industry, municipal councils <ref>Ehrlic, Population Bomb 1968 p.152-p.53</ref> seeking to increase their tax base and governments seeking permanent economic growth and expansion at any cost disregarding the impact it might have on the environment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/03/05/news/david-suzuki-fires-death-zone-trudeau-weaver-and-broken-system|title=David Suzuki fires off from the 'death zone' at Trudeau, Weaver and a broken system|date=March 5, 2018|website=National Observer|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Graph gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Afghanistanpop.svg | [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] shows a classic youth bulge.\nImage:Angola population pyramid 2005.png | [[Demographics of Angola|Angola]] shows the same, even more pronounced.\nImage:China population pyramid 2005.png| [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China|China]] had an extreme youth bulge until the 1960s, when it sharply curbed partly as an effect of the [[one-child policy]].\nImage:Uspop.svg | Compare the population pyramid of the USA which was bulging until the 1960s and has steadily slimmed since.\nFile:LibyaPopulation2011.jpg|A population pyramid based on the 2011 Libyan population.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Accelerating change]] (population growth is a factor)\n* [[Antinatalism]]\n* [[Behavioral sink]], a rat over-population experiment\n* [[Demographic trap]]\n* [[Demographics of the world]]\n* [[Earth system science]]\n* [[Ethnic bioweapon]]\n* [[Eugenics]]\n* [[Fertility and intelligence]]\n* [[Gaia hypothesis]]\n* [[Global catastrophic risk]]\n* [[Global issue]]\n* [[Human migration]]\n* [[Human population planning]]\n* [[Malthusianism]]\n* [[Malthusian trap]]\n* [[Overexploitation]]\n* [[Overshoot (population)]]\n* [[People smuggling]]\n* [[Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Population ageing]]\n* [[Reserve army of labour]]\n* [[Societal collapse]]\n* [[Tragedy of the commons]]\n* [[Urbanization]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prb.org/urbanization-an-environmental-force-to-be-reckoned-with/|title=Urbanization: An Environmental Force to be Reckoned With}}</ref>\n* [[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]]\n\n===Lists===\n* [[List of countries and dependencies by population]]\n* [[List of organisations campaigning for population stabilisation]]\n* [[List of people who have expressed views relating to overpopulation as a problem]]\n* [[List of population concern organizations]]\n\n===In documentary and art films===\n* ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]''\n* ''[[What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire]]''\n\n===In fiction===\n* [[:Category:Overpopulation fiction|Overpopulation fiction (category)]]\n\n===Other===\n* [[Overpopulation in domestic pets]]\n* [[Political demography]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* Michael E.

Similarly, the transition to farming about 10,000 years ago greatly increased the overall food supply, which was used to support more people. Food production further increased with the [[industrial revolution]] as machinery, [[fertilizer]]s, [[herbicide]]s, and [[pesticide]]s were used to increase land under cultivation as well as crop yields. Today, starvation is caused by economic and political forces rather than a lack of the means to produce food.<ref>Huesemann, M.H., and J.A. Huesemann (2011).

Most human populations throughout history validate this theory, as does the overall current global population. Populations of [[hunter-gatherer]]s fluctuate in accordance with the amount of available food. The world human population began increasing after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and its increased food supply.<ref>GJ Armelagos, AH Goodman, KH Jacobs Population and environment - 1991 link.springer.com</ref> This was, subsequent to the [[Green Revolution]], followed by even more severely accelerated population growth, which continues today. Often, wealthier countries send their surplus food resources to the aid of starving communities; however, proponents of this theory argue that this seemingly beneficial notion only results in further harm to those communities in the long run. Peter Farb, for example, has commented on the paradox that \"intensification of production to feed an increased population leads to a still greater increase in population.\"<ref>Farb, Peter: 1978, ''Humankind''. Boston, Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Daniel Quinn has also focused on this phenomenon, which he calls the \"[[Food Race]]\" (comparable, in terms of both escalation and potential catastrophe, to the [[nuclear arms race]]).\n\nCritics of this theory point out that, in the modern era, birth rates are lowest in the [[developed nation]]s, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, some developed countries have both a diminishing population and an abundant food supply. The United Nations projects that the population of 51 countries or areas, including Germany, Italy, Japan, and most of the states of the former Soviet Union, is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.<ref>Rosa, Daniele (2019). \"[http://www.affaritaliani.it/nel-2050-gli-italiani-saranno-20-milioni-meno-secondo-l-onu-612218.html Nel 2050 gli italiani saranno 20 milioni meno secondo l'Onu &#91;Translation: ''In 2050 the Italians will be 20 million less, according to the UN''&#93;]\".

However, the global population as a whole still grows in accordance with the total food supply and many of these wealthier countries are major ''exporters'' of food to poorer populations, so that, \"it is through exports from food-rich to food-poor areas (Allaby, 1984; Pimentel et al., 1999) that the population growth in these food-poor areas is further fueled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/bystrc/pub/pimentel.pdf|title=Human population numbers as a function of food supply|work=Russel Hopfenburg, David Pimentel, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA;2Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA}}\n</ref>\n\nRegardless of criticisms against the theory that population is a function of food availability, the [[world population|human population]] is, on the global scale, undeniably increasing,<ref>[[Daniel Quinn]] (1996).

The depletion of these trophic levels allow the lower trophic level to overpopulate, or populate very rapidly. For example, when the population of catfish is depleting due to overfishing, plankton will then overpopulate because their natural predator is being killed off. This causes an issue called eutrophication. Since the population all consumes oxygen the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels will plummet. The DO levels dropping will cause all the species in that area to have to leave, or they will suffocate. This along with climate change, and ocean acidification can cause the collapse of an ecosystem.\n\n===Depletion and destruction of resources===\n[[File:World energy consumption, 1970-2025, EIA.png|thumb|World energy consumption and predictions, 1970\u20132025.]]\nFurther environmental impacts that overpopulation may cause include [[depletion of natural resources]], especially [[fossil fuels]].<ref>Hubbert, M.K.

With the global population at about 7.5 billion, and each human theoretically needing 2 liters of drinking water, there is a demand for 15 billion liters of water each day to meet the minimum requirement for healthy living (United). Weather patterns, elevation, and climate all contribute to uneven distribution of fresh drinking water. Without clean water, good health is not a viable option. Besides drinking, water is used to create sanitary living conditions and is the basis of creating a healthy environment fit to hold human life. In addition to drinking water, water is also used for bathing, washing clothes and dishes, flushing toilets, a variety of cleaning methods, recreation, watering lawns, and farm irrigation.\nIrrigation poses one of the largest problems, because without sufficient water to irrigate crops, the crops die and then there is the problem of food rations and starvation. In addition to water needed for crops and food, there is limited land area dedicated to food production, and not much more that is suitable to be added. Arable land, needed to sustain the growing population, is also a factor because land being under or over cultivated easily upsets the delicate balance of nutrition supply. There are also problems with location of arable land with regard to proximity to countries and relative population (Bashford 240). Access to nutrition is an important limiting factor in population sustainability and growth. No increase in arable land added to the still increasing human population will eventually pose a serious conflict. Only 38% of the land area of the globe is dedicated to agriculture, and there is not room for much more. Although plants produce 54 billion metric tons of carbohydrates per year, when the population is expected to grow to 9 billion by 2050, the plants may not be able to keep up (Biello). Food supply is a primary example of how a resource reacts when its carrying capacity is exceeded. By trying to grow more and more crops off of the same amount of land, the soil becomes exhausted. Because the soil is exhausted, it is then unable to produce the same amount of food as before, and is overall less productive. Therefore, by using resources beyond a sustainable level, the resource become nullified and ineffective, which further increases the disparity between the demand for a resource and the availability of a resource. There must be a shift to provide adequate recovery time to each one of the supplies in demand to support contemporary human lifestyles.\n<ref>Bashford, Alison. \"Population, Geopolitics, and International Organizations in the Mid Twentieth Century.\" Journal of World History 19.3 (2008): 327\u2013347.

Modern usage of the term [[Lebensraum#Modern usage|\"lebensraum\"]] supports the idea that overpopulation may promote warfare through fear of resource scarcity and increasing numbers of youth lacking the opportunity to engage in peaceful employment (the [[War#Youth bulge|youth bulge theory]]).\n\n====Criticism of this hypothesis====\nThe [[hypothesis]] that population pressure causes increased [[warfare]] has been recently criticized on statistical grounds. Two studies focusing on specific historical societies and analyses of cross-cultural data have failed to find positive correlation between population density and incidence of warfare. [[Andrey Korotayev]], in collaboration with [[Peter Turchin]], has shown that such negative results do not falsify the population-warfare hypothesis.<ref name=t1>{{cite journal|vauthors=Turchin P, Korotayev A|url=https://www.academia.edu/41550406|title=Population Dynamics and Internal Warfare: A Reconsideration|journal=[[Social Evolution & History]]|volume=5|issue=2|date=2006|pages=112\u2013147}}</ref>\n\nPopulation and warfare are dynamical variables, and if their interaction causes sustained oscillations, then we do not in general expect to find strong correlation between the two variables measured at the same time (that is, unlagged). Korotayev and Turchin have explored mathematically what the dynamical patterns of interaction between population and warfare (focusing on internal warfare) might be in both stateless and state societies. Next, they have tested the model predictions in several empirical case studies: early modern England, [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] China, and the [[Roman Empire]]. Their empirical results have supported the population-warfare theory: that there is a tendency for population numbers and internal warfare intensity to oscillate with the same period but shifted in phase (with warfare peaks following population peaks).\n\nFurthermore, they have demonstrated that in the agrarian societies the rates of change of the two variables behave precisely as predicted by the theory: population rate of change is negatively affected by warfare intensity, while warfare rate of change is positively affected by population density.<ref name=t1/><ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Korotayev A, Malkov A, Khaltourina D|url=http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?lang=en&blang=en&page=Book&id=37484|title=Introduction to Social Macrodynamics.

The latter factor stems from the fact that children [[child labor|perform a great deal of work]] in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; it has been cited to explain the decline in birth rates in industrializing regions.\n\nMany countries have high population growth rates but lower [[total fertility rate]]s because high population growth in the past skewed the age demographic toward a young age, so the population still rises as the more numerous younger generation approaches maturity.\n\"Demographic entrapment\" is a concept developed by Maurice King, Honorary Research Fellow at the [[University of Leeds]], who posits that this phenomenon occurs when a country has a population larger than its [[carrying capacity]], no possibility of migration, and exports too little to be able to import food.

Some solutions are to be applied on a global planetary level (e.g., via [[United Nations|UN]] resolutions), while some on a country or state government organization level, and some on a family or an individual level. Some of the proposed mitigations aim to help implement new social, cultural, behavioral and political norms to replace or significantly modify current norms.\n\nFor example, in societies like China, the government has put policies in place that regulate the number of children allowed to a couple. Other societies have implemented social marketing strategies in order to educate the public on overpopulation effects. \"The intervention can be widespread and done at a low cost. A variety of print materials (flyers, brochures, fact sheets, stickers) needs to be produced and distributed throughout the communities such as at local places of worship, sporting events, local food markets, schools and at car parks (taxis / bus stands).\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.community.peacecorpsconnect.org/view/514/utilizing-social-marking-and-social-norms-to-addresss-problems-in-the-gambia |title=Utilizing social marketing and social norms to address problems in gambia |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=12 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSuch prompts work to introduce the problem so that new or modified social norms are easier to implement. Certain government policies are making it easier and more socially acceptable to use contraception and abortion methods.

Eric Drexler]], famous inventor of the futuristic concept of [[molecular nanotechnology]], has suggested in ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' that colonizing space will mean breaking the [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian limits]] to growth for the human species.\n\nIt may be possible for other parts of the Solar System to be inhabited by humanity at some point in the future. [[Geoffrey A. Landis|Geoffrey Landis]] of [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[Glenn Research Center]] in particular has pointed out that \"[at] cloud-top level, Venus is the paradise planet\", as one could construct [[aerostat]] habitats and [[Floating city (science fiction)|floating cities]] there easily, based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venusian atmosphere]]. [[Venus]] would, like also [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]], in the upper layers of their atmospheres, even afford a [[gravitation]] almost exactly as strong as [[g-force|that on Earth]] (''see'' [[colonization of Venus]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.universetoday.com/15570/colonizing-venus-with-floating-cities/ |title=Colonizing Venus With Floating Cities |author=Nancy Atkinson |date=16 July 2008 |work=[[Universe Today]] |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nMany [[science fiction]] authors, including [[Carl Sagan]], [[Arthur C.

According to Clarke, \"the population battle must be fought or won here on Earth\".<ref name = clarkebipeds/> The problem for these authors is not the lack of resources in space (as shown in books such as ''Mining the Sky''<ref>[[Mining the Sky: Untold Riches from the Asteroids, Comets, and Planets|Mining the Sky]] (1996) [[John&nbsp;S. Lewis]]. Addison Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-47959-1}}</ref>), but the physical impracticality of shipping vast numbers of people into space to \"solve\" overpopulation on Earth. However, [[Gerard K.

As such proponents of dense city life as a solution can be seen to be ignoring the intrinsic web of connections that allow a densely populated city to exist.  The pollution levels in the world's most dense cities alone can be seen to be self-evident of the amount of environmental destruction that densely populated cities cause.\n\nPaul Ehrlich pointed out in his book \"The Population Bomb\" (1968) and in \"The Annhilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals\" (2015) that dense cities create severely toxic environments, especially through the pollution of water sources.  Cities and their expansion are also harmful to migrating birds and other species, which face the threat of starvation due to the clearing of their natural habitat for human habitation.\n\nIt may be that the rhetoric supporting city densification is a means of avoiding dealing with the actual problem of over population to begin with and rather than treating city densification as a symptom of the root problem, it has been promoted by the same interests that have profited from population increase e.g. property developers, the banking system, which invests in property development, industry, municipal councils <ref>Ehrlic, Population Bomb 1968 p.152-p.53</ref> seeking to increase their tax base and governments seeking permanent economic growth and expansion at any cost disregarding the impact it might have on the environment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2018/03/05/news/david-suzuki-fires-death-zone-trudeau-weaver-and-broken-system|title=David Suzuki fires off from the 'death zone' at Trudeau, Weaver and a broken system|date=March 5, 2018|website=National Observer|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Graph gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Afghanistanpop.svg | [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] shows a classic youth bulge.\nImage:Angola population pyramid 2005.png | [[Demographics of Angola|Angola]] shows the same, even more pronounced.\nImage:China population pyramid 2005.png| [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China|China]] had an extreme youth bulge until the 1960s, when it sharply curbed partly as an effect of the [[one-child policy]].\nImage:Uspop.svg | Compare the population pyramid of the USA which was bulging until the 1960s and has steadily slimmed since.\nFile:LibyaPopulation2011.jpg|A population pyramid based on the 2011 Libyan population.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[Accelerating change]] (population growth is a factor)\n* [[Antinatalism]]\n* [[Behavioral sink]], a rat over-population experiment\n* [[Demographic trap]]\n* [[Demographics of the world]]\n* [[Earth system science]]\n* [[Ethnic bioweapon]]\n* [[Eugenics]]\n* [[Fertility and intelligence]]\n* [[Gaia hypothesis]]\n* [[Global catastrophic risk]]\n* [[Global issue]]\n* [[Human migration]]\n* [[Human population planning]]\n* [[Malthusianism]]\n* [[Malthusian trap]]\n* [[Overexploitation]]\n* [[Overshoot (population)]]\n* [[People smuggling]]\n* [[Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Population ageing]]\n* [[Reserve army of labour]]\n* [[Societal collapse]]\n* [[Tragedy of the commons]]\n* [[Urbanization]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prb.org/urbanization-an-environmental-force-to-be-reckoned-with/|title=Urbanization: An Environmental Force to be Reckoned With}}</ref>\n* [[Voluntary Human Extinction Movement]]\n\n===Lists===\n* [[List of countries and dependencies by population]]\n* [[List of organisations campaigning for population stabilisation]]\n* [[List of people who have expressed views relating to overpopulation as a problem]]\n* [[List of population concern organizations]]\n\n===In documentary and art films===\n* ''[[Koyaanisqatsi]]''\n* ''[[What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire]]''\n\n===In fiction===\n* [[:Category:Overpopulation fiction|Overpopulation fiction (category)]]\n\n===Other===\n* [[Overpopulation in domestic pets]]\n* [[Political demography]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* Michael E.

In fact, Houris are explicitly described as \"untouched by human and jinn\" indicates, that jinn could enter Jannah, too. Others however, deny the possibility for jinn to enter Jannah, they could merely try to avoid hell. Accordingly, in the afterlife the fires of hell will be brought forth to the jinn. While the infidel jinn will suffer in the flames, the pious jinn will turn to dust before they touch the flames. On the other hand, we find traditions which explains in more details the nature of jinn in paradise, such as inverting the invisibility of jinn, thus the jinn will turn into fixed forms, while they can not see humans anymore.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 97-99 (German)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Abu Hanifa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madhhab|schools jurisprudence]] of [[Sunnism]], the jinn might enter jannah, but, just like angels, they will receive no reward.

It is clear from the Quran, that the jinn might be thrown into Jahannam (hell), but does not mention explicitly the presence of jinn in Jannah. In fact, Houris are explicitly described as \"untouched by human and jinn\" indicates, that jinn could enter Jannah, too. Others however, deny the possibility for jinn to enter Jannah, they could merely try to avoid hell. Accordingly, in the afterlife the fires of hell will be brought forth to the jinn. While the infidel jinn will suffer in the flames, the pious jinn will turn to dust before they touch the flames. On the other hand, we find traditions which explains in more details the nature of jinn in paradise, such as inverting the invisibility of jinn, thus the jinn will turn into fixed forms, while they can not see humans anymore.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 97-99 (German)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Abu Hanifa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madhhab|schools jurisprudence]] of [[Sunnism]], the jinn might enter jannah, but, just like angels, they will receive no reward.
