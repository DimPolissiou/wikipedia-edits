The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque P.350</ref> Medina Ridge is the name American troops gave to a low rise, approximately seven miles (11&nbsp;km) long.\n\nThe battle, which was waged over approximately two hours, was considered by some sources the largest tank battle of the war.<ref>VUA Citation</ref> It took place west of [[Phase line (cartography)|Phase Line]] Kiwi, east of Phase Line Smash, and north of Phase Line Grape. Phase lines are map references occurring every few kilometers used to measure progress of an offensive operation.\n\n==History==\nThe 1st Armored Division, commanded by Major General Ron Griffith, consisted of some 3,000 vehicles including 348 [[M1A1 Abrams]] tanks. The 1st Armored Division's Cavalry Squadron\u20141-1 Cavalry\u2014made contact with the Medina Division and informed the Division Commander of the location of the enemy forces.  1st Armored Division's 2nd Brigade (comprising three battalions TF 4-70th Armor, TF 2-70th Armor and TF 1-35th Armor) saw major action in this battle and was commanded by Colonel [[Montgomery Meigs (born 1945)|Montgomery Meigs]] (a descendant of General [[Montgomery C. Meigs]] of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] fame)  3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, commanded by Colonel James Riley replaced 1st Armored Division's 1st Brigade for the duration of the war and was also heavily involved in the battle.<ref>Jayhawk! The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.27</ref>\n\nMedina Ridge was one of the few battles during [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]] in which American forces encountered significant [[Iraq]]i resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. The Iraqi forces were well-deployed such that they could not be seen by American forces advancing until after they had cleared the top of the ridgeline. This [[reverse slope defence|reverse slope position]] was intended to give the Iraqis protection from the powerful long-range direct fire of the [[M1 Abrams]] tanks and the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M2 Bradley]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s. \n\nDuring the battle the American forces destroyed 186 Iraqi tanks (mostly [[T-72|T-72M]]s, [[Asad Babil]]s and obsolete [[Type 69/79|Type 69]]s) and 127 armored vehicles.<ref>Carhart, Tom (1994).

New York: Random House. pp. 119\u2013204. {{ISBN|0671791656}}</ref> Only four Abrams tanks were hit by direct fire. Evidence suggests that some of them were hit by Iraqi T-72 fire.<ref name=\"Forty\">George Forty cites an M1A1 tank platoon leader from TF 1-37: \"Speculation continues concerning what knocked out our four tanks. The three most probable answers are T-72 main gun, dismounted anti-tank missile, or Apache launched Hellfire missile. The fact that Apaches were operating to our rear and witnesses' reports of high round trajectory support the friendly fire theory. However, ballistics reports suggest that 125&nbsp;mm HEAT rounds produced the damage on some of the tanks. Visual examination of others reveals one obvious sabot hole. Overall, the physical evidence implies that T-72 fire took out our tanks, but the friendly fire possibility cannot be excluded.\"</ref> Ballistics reports have further confirmed this as well as physical evidence such as obvious sabot holes.<ref name=\"Forty\"/>  All four were lost.<ref>Carhart, Tom (1994). Iron Soldiers: How America's 1st Armored Division Crushed Iraq's Elite Republican Guard. New York: Random House. p.323 {{ISBN|0671791656}}</ref> Thirty-eight of the Iraqi tanks were destroyed by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[AH-64 Apache]]s and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt II]]s. The 75th Field Artillery Brigade and Battery B, 25th Field Artillery, the division's target acquisition battery, conducted counterartillery fire missions and destroyed two Medina Field Artillery battalions in the process.<ref>Jayhawk!

The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.356</ref> \n\nOn 25 February, the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division conducted a 113km movement to contact to destroy elements of the 26th Infantry Division resulting in the capture of 299 Prisoners of War. On February 26, the 3rd Brigade was ordered to attack east to gain contact with and destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command in zone. The 3rd Brigade began an aggressive and continuous movement to contact which covered 74 km in 12 hours, while fighting multiple engagements throughout the day and night with elements of the 52nd Armored Division, 17th, Adnan, and Tawakalna Divisions. During one engagement with the Tawakalna Division the Brigade destroyed 27 Soviet export model T-72 tanks which had established a hasty defense to cover the Iraqi forces withdrawing from the Kuwaiti Theater of Operation.<ref name=\"VUA\"/>  \n\nAs the heaviest Armor Brigade, consisting of the 6th Battalion, 6th Infantry; the 1st Battalion, 35th Armor; the 2nd Battalion, 70th Armor; the 4th Battalion, 70th Armor; the 2nd Battalion, 1st Field Artillery and the 47th Support Battalion (Forward), the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division acted as the lead brigade during combat operations.<ref name=\"VUA\"/>  On 27 February, the 2nd Brigade was fully engaged with the Medina's 2nd Brigade and, in the largest single engagement of the war, destroyed 61 Iraqi T-72/T-55 tanks, 34 APCs and five SA-13 air defense systems in less than one hour.<ref>Carhart, Tom (1994).

As the Brigade attacked and fought through the Adnan Division, securing a RGFC major logistics base, it captured 465 POWs and made contact with the Medina Armored Division, which was augmented by elements of four other Iraqi divisions. A fierce battle ensued culminating in the destruction of 82 tanks, 31 Armored Personnel Carriers, 11 artillery pieces, 48 trucks, 3 AAA guns and captured 72 POWs for the loss of 2 Bradley Cavalry vehicles, 1 soldier killed, and 30 soldiers wounded.<ref name=\"VUA\"/> \n \nWhile conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command. The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division fought on the Division's right flank as it led the VII Corps main attack against the RGFC. Completing the destruction of the RGFC Brigade, the 3rd Brigade rejoined the Division transitioned to pursuit operations and continued its attack eastward. Executing an aggressive and continuous movement, the 3rd Brigade fought numerous engagements. The Brigade made contact with a tank battalion defending the western flank of a RGFC's major logistics base. The 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division raced eastward at a rate of 15 kilometres per hour. In 24 hours of nearly continuous combat, the 3rd Brigade destroyed or captured 547 vehicles, including 102 tanks, 81 armored personnel carriers, 34 artillery pieces, 15 AAA guns and captured hundreds of tons of supplies and 528 POWs. The 3rd Brigade completed this exemplary action without the loss of a single soldier or vehicle and only three soldiers WIA.<ref name=\"VUA\"/> \n\n1st Armored Division's aviation assets conducted thirty-nine straight hours of continuous combat operations, rotating companies into and out of the battle prior to and after the actions at Medina Ridge. Attack helicopters maintained a steady destructive presence in front of the Division, engaging targets of opportunity and rapidly shifting their focus and combat power as the scenario required. The Brigade's final battle commenced when the Division raced to clear its zone of advance to the Kuwaiti border prior to the impending cease-fire.<ref name=\"VUA\"/> \n\nAlthough the Iraqis used a correct defensive tactic by deploying their armor behind the ridge, this was not properly repeated through the rest of the war. In one incident, an Iraqi commander attempted to repeat what had been done at Medina but mistakenly deployed his armor too far from the ridgeline.<ref>Jayhawk! The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.355</ref>  This gave the American units the upper hand, as the Abrams tanks specialize in long-distance kills; their [[Chobham armor]] is extremely resistant to long-range fire. The American height advantage also reduced the effective range of the Iraqi tanks and presented the Iraqi gunners with a targeting situation for which they were under-trained.<ref>Jayhawk! The VII Corps in the Persian Gulf War by Bourque, p.355</ref> \n\nNevertheless, the Iraqis had fought hard, shooting down an A-10 Thunderbolt II,<ref>\"The Iraqis had skillfully dug in and camouflaged their firing line and placed a formidable protective ring of antiaircraft guns around it.

Vehicles and equipment which had been shipped from ports in Europe began to arrive on 4 January and by 12 January all the equipment had arrived. When hostilities commenced on 15 January 1991, the battalion was in the process of closing the last elements into TAA Thompson. The next month was spent task organizing, training, rehearsing, and preparing for the ground war.\n\nOn 24 February, Task Force 1\u201337 crossed the line of departure as part of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]]' attack against Iraqi forces. On 25 February, the battalion attacked and seized the division headquarters of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division destroying four [[armored vehicles]], eight air defense weapons and captured over forty [[Enemy Prisoners of War]] (EPW). After attacking all day on 26 February, TF 1\u201337, part of 3rd Brigade, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], made contact with a brigade of the Tawakalna Armored Division of the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] Forces Command (RGFC) which had established a defensive position to protect the flank of the RGFC and facilitate their escape from [[Kuwait]]. After a thirty-minute fire fight, TF 1\u201337 was ordered to assault the enemy position. The assault, conducted at night, in driving rain, resulted in the destruction of twenty-six [[T-72]] tanks, 47 [[armored personnel carriers]] (mostly [[BMP-1|BMP]]'s) and a handful of other vehicles, as well as the capture of over one hundred EPWs. TF 1\u201337 suffered the loss of four [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]] tanks destroyed and six personnel wounded in action. After consolidation and reorganization, the task force continued the attack throughout the night of 26\u201327 February, reestablishing contact with the RGFC at approximately 0530, 27 February. The task force continued to attack, fighting numerous engagements with elements of multiple Iraqi divisions throughout the 27th and into the morning of the 28 February. At 0800 local time, 28 February, the task force established a hasty defensive position astride the Iraq-Kuwait border. During the last 28 hours of the attack, TF 1\u201337 destroyed an additional thirty-one tanks, thirty-one BMPs, numerous other [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s, air defense weapons and trucks, and captured over 200 EPWs.\n\nFour days after the [[cease fire]], TF 1\u201337 moved nine miles (14&nbsp;km) further into [[Kuwait]]. Two missions were conducted to destroy additional enemy weapons, ammunition and equipment, bury enemy remains, and to recover the four [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]]'s which had been destroyed on 26 February.\n\nOn 24 March, TF 1\u201337 moved back into [[Iraq]] and established a defensive position in the vicinity of the Rumayilah oil fields. For the next three weeks, task force missions centered on refugee assistance and security operations. On 10 April, TF 1\u201337 began movement to the Rear Assembly Area (RAA) in the vicinity of [[King Khalid Military City]] (KKMC), [[Saudi Arabia]]. By 13 April, the task force had closed into the RAA and preparations began for the redeployment of the unit to Germany.\n\nOn 16 August 1991 the 1st Brigade, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was redesignated as the 3d Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3d Infantry Division]].\n\n== Unit Citations ==\n\n===2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division Valorous Unit Award Citation===\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division distinguished itself by gallantry in action from 26 to 28 February 1991, while conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command during operation DESERT STORM.

The Iraqi forces were well-deployed such that they could not be seen by American forces advancing until after they had cleared the top of the ridgeline. This [[reverse slope defence|reverse slope position]] was intended to give the Iraqis protection from the powerful long-range direct fire of the [[M1 Abrams]] tanks and the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M2 Bradley]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s. \n\nDuring the battle the American forces destroyed 186 Iraqi tanks (mostly [[T-72|T-72M]]s, [[Asad Babil]]s and obsolete [[Type 69/79|Type 69]]s) and 127 armored vehicles.<ref>Carhart, Tom (1994).

The three most probable answers are T-72 main gun, dismounted anti-tank missile, or Apache launched Hellfire missile. The fact that Apaches were operating to our rear and witnesses' reports of high round trajectory support the friendly fire theory. However, ballistics reports suggest that 125&nbsp;mm HEAT rounds produced the damage on some of the tanks. Visual examination of others reveals one obvious sabot hole.

Dyer, was alerted for deployment to the [[Persian Gulf]] on 8 November 1990. 1\u201337 Armor was the first brigade unit from [[Vilseck]] to deploy. 1\u201337 Armor was attached to the 3rd \"Bulldog\" Brigade from [[Warner Barracks in Bamberg, Germany|Warner Barracks in Bamberg]], Germany, under their former commander, Colonel Daniel Zannini. A small advance party deployed on 14 December and the main body began departing on 26 December. By 30 December, the battalion had arrived in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Vehicles and equipment which had been shipped from ports in Europe began to arrive on 4 January and by 12 January all the equipment had arrived. When hostilities commenced on 15 January 1991, the battalion was in the process of closing the last elements into TAA Thompson. The next month was spent task organizing, training, rehearsing, and preparing for the ground war.\n\nOn 24 February, Task Force 1\u201337 crossed the line of departure as part of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]]' attack against Iraqi forces. On 25 February, the battalion attacked and seized the division headquarters of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division destroying four [[armored vehicles]], eight air defense weapons and captured over forty [[Enemy Prisoners of War]] (EPW). After attacking all day on 26 February, TF 1\u201337, part of 3rd Brigade, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], made contact with a brigade of the Tawakalna Armored Division of the [[Republican Guard (Iraq)|Republican Guard]] Forces Command (RGFC) which had established a defensive position to protect the flank of the RGFC and facilitate their escape from [[Kuwait]]. After a thirty-minute fire fight, TF 1\u201337 was ordered to assault the enemy position. The assault, conducted at night, in driving rain, resulted in the destruction of twenty-six [[T-72]] tanks, 47 [[armored personnel carriers]] (mostly [[BMP-1|BMP]]'s) and a handful of other vehicles, as well as the capture of over one hundred EPWs. TF 1\u201337 suffered the loss of four [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]] tanks destroyed and six personnel wounded in action. After consolidation and reorganization, the task force continued the attack throughout the night of 26\u201327 February, reestablishing contact with the RGFC at approximately 0530, 27 February. The task force continued to attack, fighting numerous engagements with elements of multiple Iraqi divisions throughout the 27th and into the morning of the 28 February. At 0800 local time, 28 February, the task force established a hasty defensive position astride the Iraq-Kuwait border. During the last 28 hours of the attack, TF 1\u201337 destroyed an additional thirty-one tanks, thirty-one BMPs, numerous other [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]s, air defense weapons and trucks, and captured over 200 EPWs.\n\nFour days after the [[cease fire]], TF 1\u201337 moved nine miles (14&nbsp;km) further into [[Kuwait]]. Two missions were conducted to destroy additional enemy weapons, ammunition and equipment, bury enemy remains, and to recover the four [[M1 Abrams|M1A1]]'s which had been destroyed on 26 February.\n\nOn 24 March, TF 1\u201337 moved back into [[Iraq]] and established a defensive position in the vicinity of the Rumayilah oil fields. For the next three weeks, task force missions centered on refugee assistance and security operations. On 10 April, TF 1\u201337 began movement to the Rear Assembly Area (RAA) in the vicinity of [[King Khalid Military City]] (KKMC), [[Saudi Arabia]]. By 13 April, the task force had closed into the RAA and preparations began for the redeployment of the unit to Germany.\n\nOn 16 August 1991 the 1st Brigade, [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] was redesignated as the 3d Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3d Infantry Division]].\n\n== Unit Citations ==\n\n===2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division Valorous Unit Award Citation===\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division distinguished itself by gallantry in action from 26 to 28 February 1991, while conducting offensive operations against the Iraqi Republican Guard Forces Command during operation DESERT STORM.

The city is noted for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products. Dehradun houses various defense academies and research institutes, such as [[Indian Military Academy]], [[Rashtriya Indian Military College]], [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]], [https://www.oflox.com Oflox] and [[Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Lord [[Rama]], Lord Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. [[Dronacharya]], also known as \u2018Dronanagari\u2019 on the name of legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|left|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]]. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] in 1816.]]\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went on war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugowli]] where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised [[Landour]] and [[Mussoorie]] in 1827\u20131828.\n\n[[File:Capt john.jpg|thumb|Capt John War memorial maintained by army at Dehradun]]\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited.

In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000. Dehradun was made its interim capital.\n\n===Afghan Connection===\nDehradun's Afghan connection dated back to the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]], after which the Afghan Emir [[Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)]] was exiled by the British to Dehra Dun.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/Tracing-Doons-Afghan-connect/articleshow/47835111.cms|title=Tracing Doon's Afghan connect - Times of India|website=The Times of India}}</ref> He stayed in Mussoorie for over 6 years.

The present Mangla Devi Inter College, was once the Kabul Palace where Yakoob spent a few years of his life.

It was the birthplace of the second to last [[King of Afghanistan]], [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]]. Two quaint palaces \u2014 the Kabul Place in Dehradun and Balahissar Palace in Mussoorie \u2014 stand testimony to this connection with Afghanistan. They were built by these Afghan rulers in exile in India in the early part of the 20th Century and are palaces are a miniature replica of the palatial structures owned by the kings in Afghanistan. The Balahissar Palace has now been turned into Mussoorie's [[Wynberg Allen School]].

As the state capital, Dehradun is home to many government institutions. \n\nBuses are identified with blue bars. There are autorickshaws which are often used for transportation but blamed for pollution and noise. The evening buzz of Rajpur road is an attraction. The city centre is easily recognised by the [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]] (Ghanta Ghar), a structure with six functioning clocks. The statue of San Dijen placed in Shanti Niketan contributes to the beauty of the city. Dehradun has been home to artists and writers including [[Stephen Alter]], [[Nayantara Sahgal]], [[Allan Sealy]], [[Ruskin Bond]] and also to country singer [[Bobby Cash (singer)|Bobby Cash]].\n\nDehradun was home to freedom fighters whose names are engraved in gold on the Clock Tower.

Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats. Hemp is grown in great quantities in this region, so its yarn is frequently used as lining.\n\nThere are fairs ([[mela]]s) throughout the year.

The city is noted for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products. Dehradun houses various defense academies and research institutes, such as [[Indian Military Academy]], [[Rashtriya Indian Military College]], [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]], and [[Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Lord [[Rama]], Lord Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. [[Dronacharya]], also known as \u2018Dronanagari\u2019 on the name of legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|left|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]]. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] in 1816.]]\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went on war from 1814 to 1816.

As the state capital, Dehradun is home to many government institutions. \n\nBuses are identified with blue bars. There are autorickshaws which are often used for transportation but blamed for pollution and noise. The evening buzz of Rajpur road is an attraction. The city centre is easily recognised by the [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]] (Ghanta Ghar), a structure with six functioning clocks. The statue of San Dijen placed in Shanti Niketan contributes to the beauty of the city. Dehradun has been home to artists and writers including [[Stephen Alter]], [[Nayantara Sahgal]], [[Allan Sealy]], [[Ruskin Bond]] and also to country singer [[Bobby Cash (singer)|Bobby Cash]].\n\nDehradun was home to freedom fighters whose names are engraved in gold on the Clock Tower.

Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats. Hemp is grown in great quantities in this region, so its yarn is frequently used as lining.\n\nThere are fairs ([[mela]]s) throughout the year. Notable fairs include Magh Mela, held on 14 January and Jhanda Mela in March, a fair for the Hindu community, that attracts Hindus from all over India and abroad.\n\n==Sport==\nThe first indoor ice rink in India that meets the size requirements for [[ice hockey]], [[figure skating]], [[short track speed skating|short track]] and [[rink bandy]] was built in Dehradun.<ref name=IceRink>{{cite web |title=Nation's biggest ice-skating rink draws players from across country |author=Sandeep Rana |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101218/dplus.htm#1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524034007/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101218/dplus.htm#1 |archive-date=24 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[Cricket Association of Uttarakhand]] is the governing body of the cricket activities in the Uttarakhand state of India and the [[Uttarakhand cricket team]].

Formerly part of ''La [[Commission Scolaire J\u00e9r\u00f4me-Le Royer]]'', the school has been part of the [[English Montreal School Board]] since 1998.

Traditional uniform colours are white and grey. The motto is ''Finis Coronat Opus'' (Latin for \"The end crowns the work\").\n\n==History==\nLaurier Macdonald opened in September 1969 without a building. The new school was to serve the English-speaking Catholic population of the City of Saint-L\u00e9onard. While an older building at 5750 Metropolitan Autoroute (A-40) originally built as a factory was being converted into a high school, the Commission Scolaire J\u00e9r\u00f4me-Le Royer rented classrooms at a nearby Protestant school (Dunton High School) so that students could attend classes during the late afternoon and early evening. This arrangement ended in early 1970 when the Metropolitan Autoroute facility was ready. Within a few years, however, the old building's limitations were judged to be too serious, in spite of the renovations, and the school board began discussing the construction of a new building in earnest.\n\nThe changing political climate in the province proved to be a problem, however. The Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government had declared a moratorium on the construction of English schools shortly after its accession to power in the fall of 1976. A student strike was organized in the month of November 1973, led by a rebellious student named Frank Fazzari, to bring to the public\u2019s attention the harm caused by the treatment of all English speaking schools in the eastern part of Montreal.\n\nThe strike by students was the answer to the school being neglected by the Jerome le Royer School Board. An overpopulated school with the capacity of 800 students was being attended by 1200 students. The school was in complete disarray with one janitor to maintain the facilities, with no washroom facilities operational, doors with no locks, holes in cinder block walls, shortage of classrooms, and unsanitary conditions. Needless to say the facilities were not the ideal setting for teachers and students vying for the ultimate goal of a proper education.\n\nThe walkout was well documented in the English media along with the French media . A front-page article in the now defunct Montreal Star depicted the story of neglect with a picture of Frank Fazzari holding up one broken sink in the washroom as a symbol of defiance towards the neglect of English speaking students had to endure.\n\nAs this was happening, the J\u00e9r\u00f4me Le Royer School Board had just completed, in 1969, the most advanced comprehensive French speaking high school on the territory of Saint-L\u00e9onard, Antoine de St-Exup\u00e9ry, while Laurier Macdonald was nothing more than a school in rented facilities. This was much to the dismay of the population of Saint-L\u00e9onard's English speaking parents and students. The only positive benefit of the new Antoine de St-Exup\u00e9ry French high school was that the building formerly used to house French-speaking students was liberated. The Aim\u00e9 Renaud building (also a rented building on Metropolitan) became a junior English High School to feed Laurier Macdonald. This greatly alleviated the overcrowding at Laurier Macdonald. [[Aime Renaud High School]] was used as a junior high for Secondary I and II while Laurier Macdonald was used for Secondary III, IV and V.\n\nThe media pressure and exposure prompted a quick reaction from the school board with a meeting with the student council who presented a petition on behalf of the students with the demands that their school be equipped with the maintenance and the proper equipment to operate a school burdened by  overpopulation.\n\nThe board\u2019s reaction was a temporary closing of the school for one week and much to the dismay of all the members at the school board, they  managed to repair, paint and fix all the anomalies. in the school. The media was invited to see all the repairs.\n\nThis spurred the quest to build a school that would match the comprehensive high school of the French-speaking community. It is the belief of many that attended the first years at the Metropolitan facilities that their determination was to be the voice of defiance that led to the awakening of the necessity for better school facilities.\n\nA debt of gratitude is owed to Joseph Lalla for directing the students on the eve of the strike, with the use of his political savviness and  knowledge of using the media as a propaganda tool and the use of his telephone in his office to contact the media. \n\nThe school board then decided to extend a small elementary school, \u00c9cole Sir George-\u00c9tienne-Cartier, at the corner of [[Jean Talon Street|Jean-Talon]] and [[Viau Street|Viau streets]]. The project would not have been approved by the provincial Department of Education had it been presented otherwise. The new (and current building) opened for the 1983\u20134 school year. [[Roussin Academy High School|Roussin Academy]] in Pointe-aux-Trembles was closed and the students were transferred to the new Laurier Macdonald for the 1983\u20134 school year.\n\nLaurier Macdonald was a comprehensive high school from 1983 (or in French, ''\u00e9cole polyvalente'') until that distinction was abolished provincially in the early 1990s. These schools offered high school students the possibility of vocational training in the last cycle of secondary education. Today, the school is the only remaining English-language senior high school on the island of Montreal, serving only Secondary III, IV and V students. It has been non-confessional since the school board reorganization of 1998. Previously, public schools in the province of Quebec had been organized along confessional lines (Protestant or Catholic) instead of linguistic lines (English or French).\n\n===Past staff and alumni===\n\nLouis Balena served as the second principal of Laurier Macdonald, succeeding Miss T. Arbour, from the early 1970s until the late 1980s. Frank Vatrano and Tony Cambria succeeded him but both had short tenures, with Vatrano passing away shortly after becoming principal. Renzo Orsi (1991\u20131993) followed. He organized the ''Honours Plus'' Programme, the forerunner of today's IB Programme, and supported the expansion of the school's Communication Arts programme. Other principals included Joseph Lalla (1993\u20131996), Mario Tirelli (1996\u20132000), Pasquale Buttino(2000\u20132007), Eileen Kelly (2007\u20132011) and Luigi Santamaria (2011-present)\n\nNotable graduates of Laurier Macdonald include multiple, award-winning IMAX producer and filmmaker Pietro L. Serapiglia (class of 1973) \u2013 ''[[Titanica]]'', ''[[Super Speedway]]'', ''[[Rocky Mountain Express]]'',<ref>[http://www.stephenlow.com/company/team.html The Stephen Low Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113201951/http://www.stephenlow.com/company/team.html |date=2011-11-13 }}</ref> Grey Cup winners Randy Chevrier and [[Danny Maciocia]], former head coach of the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League, [[Frank Zampino]] (1976),<ref>Colombo, Carmen.

All designations were made posthumously.\n\nLaurier Macdonald High School is one of the few public high schools in the Montreal area to have an alumni association. It was founded by Francis Scardera (Class of 84) and is a registered non-profit association. The association helps organize 10, 20, and 25 year reunions. All proceeds go to special projects in the school. The association has a web site. Alumni can register their email addresses on the web site. Facebook groups are created for reunions as needed.\n\n==Today==\n\nThe reorganization of the school boards in 1998 opened up Laurier Macdonald to students from throughout the Island of Montreal, allowing anyone who lives (roughly) east of the D\u00e9carie Autoroute (A-15) to attend. Nevertheless, most students still come from Saint-L\u00e9onard and Anjou, with significant numbers from Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies, Laval and Montr\u00e9al-Nord. The student body is overwhelmingly Italian, Catholic and middle-class, reflecting the generally homogeneous make-up of Saint-L\u00e9onard's English-speaking population.\n\n[http://www.emsb.qc.ca/emsb_en/schools_en/highschool.asp?id=55 John Paul I Junior High School] (secondary I and II) is the main feeder school for Laurier Macdonald. The English elementary schools of St. Leonard (Dante, Honor\u00e9-Mercier, Pierre-de-Coubertin and General Vanier) are the main feeder schools for John Paul I Junior High School.\n\nLaurier Macdonald is not a 240 school (named for the corresponding section of the provincial Education Act) and therefore accepts any student eligible by law to receive English instruction in a Quebec public school. While the school's performance in the controversial Fraser Institute rankings has improved slowly over the past several years, Principal Pasquale Buttino commented in local newspapers in 2005 that he felt the school's academic record was being misrepresented. Buttino observed that Laurier Macdonald has always boasted a graduation rate of over ninety percent since it opened in 1969 and that many avant-garde projects, specifically those of the Communication Arts department, are not considered by the Fraser Institute during the preparation of school rankings.\n\n=== Athletics ===\n\nLaurier Macdonald was traditionally strong in basketball and football. During the 1980s, the school also won titles in swimming and volleyball. Since the 1990s, the school's strongest showings, including several championships, have been in soccer, track and field and flag football. During the 2003 outdoor season a milestone was achieved when Coach Sam Longo led both the senior and junior men's team to the GMAA championships. This achievement was displayed in The Montreal Gazette. Greats from the senior teams included Brian Ceterina, goalie. Several players from the squad have played for Quebec's provincial team including [[Massimo Di Ioia]] who currently plays for The Canadian U20 national team and has signed a pro contract with the Montreal Impact for the 2007 season. He led the team in scoring with an outstanding 27 goals in 12 regular season games and was named MVP for the men's soccer team. Many of the championship teams are honoured with mosaics in the school's sports complex. Championship banners hang in the gymnasium...\n\n=== Publications ===\n\nThe school regularly published several newspapers and magazines until they were all discontinued over the past several years. ''OPUS'', a quarterly school newspaper, won the ''Montreal Gazette'''s award for excellence in student journalism several times during the 1990s. Circulation peaked at over 5000 copies when the newspaper was distributed not only to students at Laurier Macdonald but also to those at its feeder schools in Saint-L\u00e9onard, Anjou and Pointe-aux-Trembles. Other publications included: ''Inkblot'' (student artwork), the ''Laureate'' (student creative writing and poetry), ''Mediascape'' (student photography) and ''Wrap-Up'', a daily school newsletter.\n\nThe Communication Arts department at Laurier Macdonald has become especially renowned over the past several years for its innovative curriculum. Students have published award-winning books on the Canadian immigrant experience which have received praise both at home and abroad.\n\n=== Laurier Macdonald RadioClub===\n\nRadio Laurier Macdonald began regular broadcasts in May 2006. The station broadcasts throughout the campus via [[carrier current]] on 560 AM.\n\nRadio RUNTS existed in the old Laurier Macdonald on Metropolitan. It was a 15-minute radio show that was broadcast over the intercom system once every 2 weeks at the end of the last period on Friday afternoons. When the move was made to new building, it became a lunchtime broadcast in the cafeteria.\n\nIn 2007 it was re-opened by former students; Gino Gentile, Michele Infante and Giuseppe Baldino until their graduating year of 2008. Unfortunately, the lack of funds and neglect of equipment caused it to forgotten and left behind ever since.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.emsb.qc.ca/LaurierMac/ Laurier Macdonald High School]\n*[http://www.emsb.qc.ca/ English Montreal School Board]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040205050210/http://www.lauriermacdonald.org/ Laurier Macdonald Alumni Foundation]\n*[http://www.progresstleonard.com/article-12303-Une-station-de-radio-a-LaurierMacdonald.html ''Une station de radio \u00e0 Laurier-Macdonald'' from ''Le Progr\u00e8s Saint-L\u00e9onard'' (French only)]\n\n{{Montreal Secondary Schools}}\n\n[[Category:English-language schools in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1969]]\n[[Category:High schools in Montreal]]\n[[Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Quebec]]\n[[Category:English Montreal School Board]]\n[[Category:Saint-Leonard, Quebec]]\n[[Category:1969 establishments in Quebec]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=February 2015}}\n{{Infobox school\n| name              = Laurier Macdonald High School\n| image             = \n| caption           = \n| address           = 7355 Viau Blvd.\n| city              = [[Saint-Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Leonard, Montreal]]\n| province          = [[Quebec]]\n| postcode          = [[Postal codes in Canada|H1S 3C3]]\n| country           = Canada\n| coordinates       = {{coord |45.5767|N|73.5855|W|display=inline}}\n| fundingtype       = English-language public school\n| motto             = {{lang-la|Finis Coronat Opus}}\n| motto_translation = \"The end crowns the work\"\n| established       = 1968\n| schoolboard       = [[English Montreal School Board]]\n| principal         = Pasquale Buttino (2000 - 2007)<br>Eileen Kelly (2007 - 2011)<br>Luigi Santamaria (2011 -)\n| grades_label      = [[Education in Canada#Levels in education|Grades]]\n| grades            = Secondary III, IV and V\n| enrollment        = over 800\n| accreditation     = [[International Baccalaureate Organization]] (IBO)\n| colours           = Orange and Black {{color box|orange}}{{color box|black}}\n| mascot            = [[Domestic sheep|Rams]]\n| free_label1       = Radio station\n| free_text1        = 560 AM ([[Carrier current]])\n| website           = {{URL|http://www.emsb.qc.ca/LaurierMac/}} \n}}\n'''Laurier Macdonald High School''' ({{lang-fr|'''\u00c9cole secondaire Laurier Macdonald'''}}),  abbreviated traditionally as \"LMAC\" but occasionally as \"LMHS,\" is an English-language public school in the east end of [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada.

Today, the school is the only remaining English-language senior high school on the island of Montreal, serving only Secondary III, IV and V students. It has been non-confessional since the school board reorganization of 1998. Previously, public schools in the province of Quebec had been organized along confessional lines (Protestant or Catholic) instead of linguistic lines (English or French).\n\n===Past staff and alumni===\n\nLouis Balena served as the second principal of Laurier Macdonald, succeeding Miss T. Arbour, from the early 1970s until the late 1980s. Frank Vatrano and Tony Cambria succeeded him but both had short tenures, with Vatrano passing away shortly after becoming principal. Renzo Orsi (1991\u20131993) followed. He organized the ''Honours Plus'' Programme, the forerunner of today's IB Programme, and supported the expansion of the school's Communication Arts programme. Other principals included Joseph Lalla (1993\u20131996), Mario Tirelli (1996\u20132000), Pasquale Buttino(2000\u20132007), Eileen Kelly (2007\u20132011) and Luigi Santamaria (2011-present)\n\nNotable graduates of Laurier Macdonald include multiple, award-winning IMAX producer and filmmaker Pietro L. Serapiglia (class of 1973) \u2013 ''[[Titanica]]'', ''[[Super Speedway]]'', ''[[Rocky Mountain Express]]'',<ref>[http://www.stephenlow.com/company/team.html The Stephen Low Company] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113201951/http://www.stephenlow.com/company/team.html |date=2011-11-13 }}</ref> Grey Cup winners Randy Chevrier and [[Danny Maciocia]], former head coach of the Edmonton Eskimos in the Canadian Football League, [[Frank Zampino]] (1976),<ref>Colombo, Carmen.

All designations were made posthumously.\n\nLaurier Macdonald High School is one of the few public High Schools in the Montreal area to have an alumni association. It was founded by Francis Scardera (Class of 84) and is a registered non-profit association. The association helps organize 10, 20, and 25 year reunions. All proceeds go to special projects in the school. The association has a web site. Alumni can register their email addresses on the web site. Facebook groups are created for reunions as needed.\n\n==Today==\n\nThe reorganization of the school boards in 1998 opened up Laurier Macdonald to students from throughout the Island of Montreal, allowing anyone who lives (roughly) east of the D\u00e9carie Autoroute (A-15) to attend. Nevertheless, most students still come from Saint-L\u00e9onard and Anjou, with significant numbers from Rivi\u00e8re-des-Prairies, Laval and Montr\u00e9al-Nord. The student body is overwhelmingly Italian, Catholic and middle-class, reflecting the generally homogeneous make-up of Saint-L\u00e9onard's English-speaking population.\n\n[http://www.emsb.qc.ca/emsb_en/schools_en/highschool.asp?id=55 John Paul I Junior High School] (secondary I and II) is the main feeder school for Laurier Macdonald. The English elementary schools of St. Leonard (Dante, Honor\u00e9-Mercier, Pierre-de-Coubertin and General Vanier) are the main feeder schools for John Paul I Junior High School.\n\nLaurier Macdonald is not a 240 school (named for the corresponding section of the provincial Education Act) and therefore accepts any student eligible by law to receive English instruction in a Quebec public school. While the school's performance in the controversial Fraser Institute rankings has improved slowly over the past several years, Principal Pasquale Buttino commented in local newspapers in 2005 that he felt the school's academic record was being misrepresented. Buttino observed that Laurier Macdonald has always boasted a graduation rate of over ninety percent since it opened in 1969 and that many avant-garde projects, specifically those of the Communication Arts department, are not considered by the Fraser Institute during the preparation of school rankings.\n\n=== Athletics ===\n\nLaurier Macdonald was traditionally strong in basketball and football. During the 1980s, the school also won titles in swimming and volleyball. Since the 1990s, the school's strongest showings, including several championships, have been in soccer, track and field and flag football. During the 2003 outdoor season a milestone was achieved when Coach Sam Longo led both the senior and junior men's team to the GMAA championships. This achievement was displayed in The Montreal Gazette. Greats from the senior teams included Brian Ceterina, goalie. Several players from the squad have played for Quebec's provincial team including [[Massimo Di Ioia]] who currently plays for The Canadian U20 national team and has signed a pro contract with the Montreal Impact for the 2007 season. He led the team in scoring with an outstanding 27 goals in 12 regular season games and was named MVP for the men's soccer team. Many of the championship teams are honoured with mosaics in the school's sports complex. Championship banners hang in the gymnasium...\n\n=== Publications ===\n\nThe school regularly published several newspapers and magazines until they were all discontinued over the past several years. ''OPUS'', a quarterly school newspaper, won the ''Montreal Gazette'''s award for excellence in student journalism several times during the 1990s. Circulation peaked at over 5000 copies when the newspaper was distributed not only to students at Laurier Macdonald but also to those at its feeder schools in Saint-L\u00e9onard, Anjou and Pointe-aux-Trembles. Other publications included: ''Inkblot'' (student artwork), the ''Laureate'' (student creative writing and poetry), ''Mediascape'' (student photography) and ''Wrap-Up'', a daily school newsletter.\n\nThe Communication Arts department at Laurier Macdonald has become especially renowned over the past several years for its innovative curriculum. Students have published award-winning books on the Canadian immigrant experience which have received praise both at home and abroad.\n\n=== Laurier Macdonald RadioClub===\n\nRadio Laurier Macdonald began regular broadcasts in May 2006. The station broadcasts throughout the campus via [[carrier current]] on 560 AM.\n\nRadio RUNTS existed in the old Laurier Macdonald on Metropolitan. It was a 15-minute radio show that was broadcast over the intercom system once every 2 weeks at the end of the last period on Friday afternoons. When the move was made to new building, it became a lunchtime broadcast in the cafeteria.\n\nIn 2007 it was re-opened by former students; Gino Gentile, Michele Infante and Giuseppe Baldino until their graduating year of 2008. Unfortunately, the lack of funds and neglect of equipment caused it to forgotten and left behind ever since.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.emsb.qc.ca/LaurierMac/ Laurier Macdonald High School]\n*[http://www.emsb.qc.ca/ English Montreal School Board]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040205050210/http://www.lauriermacdonald.org/ Laurier Macdonald Alumni Foundation]\n*[http://www.progresstleonard.com/article-12303-Une-station-de-radio-a-LaurierMacdonald.html ''Une station de radio \u00e0 Laurier-Macdonald'' from ''Le Progr\u00e8s Saint-L\u00e9onard'' (French only)]\n\n{{Montreal Secondary Schools}}\n\n[[Category:English-language schools in Quebec]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1969]]\n[[Category:High schools in Montreal]]\n[[Category:International Baccalaureate schools in Quebec]]\n[[Category:English Montreal School Board]]\n[[Category:Saint-Leonard, Quebec]]\n[[Category:1969 establishments in Quebec]]\n", "name_user": "Mkgordon", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Clarity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurier_Macdonald_High_School"}

[[codex|Codices]], [[paganism|pagan]] and [[Christianity|Christian]] texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The script developed into [[blackletter]] and became obsolete, though its revival in the [[Italian Renaissance]] forms the basis of more recent scripts.\n\n==Creation==\n[[File:Minuscule caroline.jpg|thumb|Page of text (folio 160v) from a Carolingian Gospel Book ([[British Library]], Add MS 11848), written in Carolingian minuscule. Text is [[Vulgate]] [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:15\u201326.]]\n\nThe script is derived from [[Uncial script|Roman half uncial]] and the [[insular script]]s that were being used in Irish and English monasteries.  The strong influence of Irish literati on the script can be seen in the distinctively cl\u00f3-Gaelach (Irish style) forms of the letters, especially a, e, d, g, s, and t.\n\nCarolingian minuscule was created partly under the patronage of the [[Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] (hence Carolingian). Charlemagne had a keen interest in learning, according to his biographer [[Einhard]] (here with [[apex (diacritic)|apices]]):\n\n<blockquote lang=\"la\" style=\"font-style: italic\">Tempt\u00e1bat et scr\u00edbere, tabul\u00e1sque et c\u00f3dicell\u00f3s ad hoc in lect\u00f3 sub cerv\u00edc\u00e1libus circumferre sol\u00e9bat, ut, cum vacuum tempus esset, manum litter\u00eds effigiend\u00eds adsu\u00e9sceret, sed parum successit labor praeposterus ac s\u00e9r\u00f3 incoh\u00e1tus.</blockquote>\n\n{{quote|He also tried to write, and used to keep tablets and blanks in bed under his pillow, that at leisure hours he might accustom his hand to form the letters; however, as he did not begin his efforts in due season, but late in life, they met with ill success.}}\n\nAs a part of Charlemagne's educational and religious reforms, he decreed that every church and monastery should have a copy of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]]. Charlemagne wanted to make the Vulgate Bible more readable for preachers and easier to copy for scribes. Thus, Marcia Colish explains,\n\n<blockquote>Charlemagne looked first to Anglo-Saxon England for a scholar to head his court school, finding him in Alcuin ({{circa|730\u2013804}}). He assigned to Alcuin the correction of the Vulgate. In conjunction with this project, and later in his career when he became abbot of Tours, Alcuin invented a new style of handwriting, the Caroline minuscule. This script was far more legible than earlier medieval hands and an improvement on Roman book hands, since it provided spaces between the words, more extensive punctuation, and a hierarchy of hands, with capitals used for titles, a mix of capitals and lower-case letters for subtitles or chapter headings, and lower case for the body of the text. With the newly corrected Bible, pastors would be able to base their teaching and preaching on what it actually said.<ref name=Marcia /></blockquote>\n\nAlthough Charlemagne was never fully literate, he understood the value of literacy and a uniform script in running his empire. Charlemagne sent for the English scholar [[Alcuin of York]] to run his palace school and [[scriptorium]] at his capital, [[Aachen]]. Efforts to supplant [[Merovingian script|Gallo-Roman]] and Germanic scripts had been under way before Alcuin arrived at Aachen, where he was master from 782 to 796, with a two-year break. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen, of which the [[Ada Gospels]] provided classic models, and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Marmoutier Abbey (Tours)]], where Alcuin withdrew from court service as an [[abbot]] in 796 and restructured the scriptorium.<ref name=\"Rand1929\">The production of the scriptorium at Tours was reconstructed by {{cite book|last=Rand|first=Edward Kennard |title=A Survey of the Manuscripts of Tours|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34DlAAAAMAAJ|year=1929|publisher=Harvard University Press|via=Mediaeval Academy of America}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nCarolingian minuscule was uniform, with rounded shapes in clearly distinguishable [[glyph]]s, disciplined and above all, legible. Clear capital letters and spaces between words became standard in Carolingian minuscule, which was one result of a campaign to achieve a culturally unifying standardization across the [[Carolingian Empire]].\n\nTraditional charters, however, continued to be written in a [[Merovingian script|Merovingian \"chancery hand\"]] long after manuscripts of Scripture and classical literature were being produced in the minuscule hand. Documents written in a local language, like [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin, tended to be expressed in traditional local script.\n\nCarolingian script generally has fewer [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] than other contemporary [[script (styles of handwriting)|scripts]], although the [[ampersand|''et'']] (''&''), ''\u00e6'', ''rt'', ''st'', and ''ct'' ligatures are common. The letter ''d'' often appears in an uncial form with an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] slanting to the left, but the letter ''g'' is essentially the same as the modern minuscule letter, rather than the previously common uncial ''\u1d79''. Ascenders are usually \"clubbed\" \u2013 they become thicker near the top.\n\nThe early period of the script, during Charlemagne's reign in the late 8th century and early 9th, still has widely varying letter forms in different regions. The uncial form of the letter ''a'', similar to a double ''c'' (''cc''), is still used in manuscripts from this period. There is also use of punctuation such as the [[question mark]], as in [[Beneventan script]] of the same period. The script flourished during the 9th century, when regional hands developed into an international standard, with less variation of letter forms. Modern [[glyph]]s, such as ''s'' and ''v'', began to appear (as opposed to the \"[[long s|long ''s'']]\" ''\u017f'' and ''u''), and ascenders, after thickening at the top, were finished with a three-cornered wedge. The script began to evolve slowly after the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, ligatures were rare and ascenders began to slant to the right and were finished with a fork. The letter ''w'' also began to appear. By the 12th century, Carolingian letters had become more angular and were written closer together, less legibly than in previous centuries; at the same time, the modern [[tittle|dotted]] ''i'' appeared. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[Image:Freising manuscript.jpg|thumb|A page of the [[Freising manuscripts]], showing 10th-century [[Slovene language|Slovene]] text written in Carolingian minuscule. [[Bavarian State Library]], Munich.]]\n\n==Spread==\nThe new script spread through Western Europe most widely where Carolingian influence was strongest. In luxuriously produced [[Lectionary|lectionaries]] that now began to be produced for princely patronage of abbots and bishops, legibility was essential. It reached far afield: the 10th century [[Freising manuscripts]], which contain the oldest [[Slovene language]], the first [[Latin alphabet|Roman-script]] record of any [[Slavic language]], are written in Carolingian minuscule. In [[Switzerland]], Carolingian was used in the Rhaetian and Alemannic minuscule types. Manuscripts written in '''Rhaetian minuscule''' tend to have slender letters, resembling Insular script, with the letters {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|t}}, and ligatures such as {{angbr|ri}}, showing similar to Visigothic and Beneventan. '''Alemannic minuscule''', used for a short time in the early 9th century, is usually larger and broader, very vertical compared to the slanting Rhaetian type. In [[Austria]], [[Salzburg]] was the major centre of Carolingian script, while [[Fulda]], [[Mainz]], and [[W\u00fcrzburg]] were the major centres in Germany. German minuscule tends to be oval-shaped, very slender, and slants to the right. It has uncial features as well, such as the ascender of the letter {{angbr|d}} slanting to the left, and vertical initial strokes of {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}}.\n\nIn northern Italy, the monastery at [[Bobbio]] used Carolingian minuscule beginning in the 9th century. Outside the sphere of influence of Charlemagne and his successors, however, the new legible hand was resisted by the [[Roman Curia]]; nevertheless the Romanesca type was developed in [[Rome]] after the 10th century. The script was not taken up in England and Ireland until ecclesiastic reforms in the middle of the 10th century; in Spain a traditionalist [[Visigothic script|Visigothic hand]] survived; and in southern Italy a '[[Beneventan script|Beneventan minuscule]]' survived in the lands of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[duchy of Benevento]] through the 13th century, although Romanesca eventually also appeared in southern Italy.\n\n==Role in cultural transmission==\nScholars during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] sought out and copied in the new legible standardized hand many Roman texts that had been wholly forgotten. Most of our knowledge of classical literature now derives from copies made in the [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Over 7000 manuscripts written in Carolingian script survive from the 8th and 9th centuries alone.\n\nThough the Carolingian minuscule was superseded by [[Blackletter|Gothic blackletter]] hands, it later seemed so thoroughly 'classic' to the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of the early [[Renaissance]] that they took these old Carolingian manuscripts to be [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] originals and modelled their Renaissance hand, the [[humanist minuscule]], on the Carolingian one.<ref name=\"Ullman1960\">{{cite book|last=Ullman|first=Berthold Louis |title=The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NE7hMosYD_YC|year=1960|publisher=Ed. di Storia e Letteratura|location=Rome|page=12|id=GGKEY:SC91X3J9KAG}}</ref> From there the script passed to the 15th- and 16th-century printers of books, such as [[Aldus Manutius]] of Venice. In this way it forms the basis of our modern lowercase typefaces. Indeed, 'Carolingian minuscule' is a style of [[typeface]], which approximates this historical hand, eliminating the nuances of size of capitals, long descenders, and so on.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ada Gospels]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/jmag0042/ingles.php?d=LATIN_PALEOGRAPHY.pdf 'Manual of Latin Palaeography'] (A comprehensive PDF file containing 82 pages profusely illustrated, June 2014).\n* [http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/history5.htm Carolingian minuscule] at Dr. Dianne Tillotson\u2019s website devoted to medieval writing\n* [http://robert-pfeffer.net/schriftarten/englisch/index.html Pfeffer Medi\u00e6val], a Carolingian minuscule typeface which also includes Gothic and Runic characters\n* [http://carolinenetwork.weebly.com Network for the Study of Caroline Minuscule], an international forum dedicated to the study of the script\n* [https://elmss.nuigalway.ie/catalogue More information at Earlier Latin Manuscripts]\n\n{{European calligraphy}}\n{{list of writing systems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carolingian Minuscule}}\n[[Category:8th century in Francia]]\n[[Category:Carolingian art]]\n[[Category:Latin-script calligraphy]]\n[[Category:Medieval scripts]]\n[[Category:Palaeographic letter variants]]\n[[Category:Western calligraphy]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Form of writing}}\n\n[[File: Carolineminuscel.jpg|thumb|Carolingian minuscule alphabet]]\n[[File:CarolingianMinuscule.jpg|frame|Example from 10th-century manuscript, [[Vulgate]] [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:5\u20138.]]\n\n'''Carolingian minuscule''' or '''Caroline minuscule''' is a [[hand (handwriting)|script]] which developed as a calligraphic standard in [[Europe]] so that the [[Latin alphabet]] of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]] could be easily recognized by the [[literate]] class from one region to another.

The script began to evolve slowly after the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, ligatures were rare and ascenders began to slant to the right and were finished with a fork. The letter ''w'' also began to appear. By the 12th century, Carolingian letters had become more angular and were written closer together, less legibly than in previous centuries; at the same time, the modern [[tittle|dotted]] ''i'' appeared. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[Image:Freising manuscript.jpg|thumb|A page of the [[Freising manuscripts]], showing 10th-century [[Slovene language|Slovene]] text written in Carolingian minuscule. [[Bavarian State Library]], Munich.]]\n\n==Spread==\nThe new script spread through Western Europe most widely where Carolingian influence was strongest. In luxuriously produced [[Lectionary|lectionaries]] that now began to be produced for princely patronage of abbots and bishops, legibility was essential. It reached far afield: the 10th century [[Freising manuscripts]], which contain the oldest [[Slovene language]], the first [[Latin alphabet|Roman-script]] record of any [[Slavic language]], are written in Carolingian minuscule. In [[Switzerland]], Carolingian was used in the Rhaetian and Alemannic minuscule types. Manuscripts written in '''Rhaetian minuscule''' tend to have slender letters, resembling Insular script, with the letters {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|t}}, and ligatures such as {{angbr|ri}}, showing similar to Visigothic and Beneventan. '''Alemannic minuscule''', used for a short time in the early 9th century, is usually larger and broader, very vertical compared to the slanting Rhaetian type. In [[Austria]], [[Salzburg]] was the major centre of Carolingian script, while [[Fulda]], [[Mainz]], and [[W\u00fcrzburg]] were the major centres in Germany. German minuscule tends to be oval-shaped, very slender, and slants to the right. It has uncial features as well, such as the ascender of the letter {{angbr|d}} slanting to the left, and vertical initial strokes of {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}}.\n\nIn northern Italy, the monastery at [[Bobbio]] used Carolingian minuscule beginning in the 9th century. Outside the sphere of influence of Charlemagne and his successors, however, the new legible hand was resisted by the [[Roman Curia]]; nevertheless the Romanesca type was developed in [[Rome]] after the 10th century. The script was not taken up in England and Ireland until ecclesiastic reforms in the middle of the 10th century; in Spain a traditionalist [[Visigothic script|Visigothic hand]] survived; and in southern Italy a '[[Beneventan script|Beneventan minuscule]]' survived in the lands of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[duchy of Benevento]] through the 13th century, although Romanesca eventually also appeared in southern Italy.\n\n==Role in cultural transmission==\nScholars during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] sought out and copied in the new legible standardized hand many Roman texts that had been wholly forgotten. Most of our knowledge of classical literature now derives from copies made in the [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Over 7000 manuscripts written in Carolingian script survive from the 8th and 9th centuries alone.\n\nThough the Carolingian minuscule was superseded by [[Blackletter|Gothic blackletter]] hands, it later seemed so thoroughly 'classic' to the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of the early [[Renaissance]] that they took these old Carolingian manuscripts to be [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] originals and modelled their Renaissance hand, the [[humanist minuscule]], on the Carolingian one.<ref name=\"Ullman1960\">{{cite book|last=Ullman|first=Berthold Louis |title=The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NE7hMosYD_YC|year=1960|publisher=Ed. di Storia e Letteratura|location=Rome|page=12|id=GGKEY:SC91X3J9KAG}}</ref> From there the script passed to the 15th- and 16th-century printers of books, such as [[Aldus Manutius]] of Venice. In this way it forms the basis of our modern lowercase typefaces. Indeed, 'Carolingian minuscule' is a style of [[typeface]], which approximates this historical hand, eliminating the nuances of size of capitals, long descenders, and so on.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ada Gospels]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://guindo.pntic.mec.es/jmag0042/ingles.php?d=LATIN_PALEOGRAPHY.pdf 'Manual of Latin Palaeography'] (A comprehensive PDF file containing 82 pages profusely illustrated, June 2014).\n* [http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/scripts/history5.htm Carolingian minuscule] at Dr. Dianne Tillotson\u2019s website devoted to medieval writing\n* [http://robert-pfeffer.net/schriftarten/englisch/index.html Pfeffer Medi\u00e6val], a Carolingian minuscule typeface which also includes Gothic and Runic characters\n* [http://carolinenetwork.weebly.com Network for the Study of Caroline Minuscule], an international forum dedicated to the study of the script\n* [https://elmss.nuigalway.ie/catalogue More information at Earlier Latin Manuscripts]\n\n{{European calligraphy}}\n{{list of writing systems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carolingian Minuscule}}\n[[Category:8th century in Francia]]\n[[Category:Carolingian art]]\n[[Category:Latin-script calligraphy]]\n[[Category:Medieval scripts]]\n[[Category:Palaeographic letter variants]]\n[[Category:Western calligraphy]]\n", "name_user": "Garnhami", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule"}

The antiwar activists, anticipating a reaction from the military, proceeded to form the Fort Hood Three Defense Committee and mobilized legal help for the Three. The June 30 press conference where the Three presented their initial statement was attended by [[Stokely Carmichael]], chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and Lincoln Lynch the public relations director of [[Congress of Racial Equality]]. Within weeks the antiwar movement, nationally and internationally, had taken up their cause.<ref name=\"EVW\"/>\n\nPete Seeger, the folk singer and [[social activist]], wrote a song for them called the ''Ballad Of The Fort Hood Three'', which included: \n\n{{Poemquote\n|text=<!-- or: 1= -->Come all you brave Americans and listen unto me,\nIf you can spare five minutes in this 20th century,\nI'll sing to you a story true as you will plainly see\nIt's about three U.S. soldiers they call the \"Fort Hood Three.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve been told in training that in Vietnam we must fight;\nAnd we may have to kill women and children, and that is quite all right;\nWe say this war\u2019s illegal, immoral, and unjust;\nWe\u2019re taking legal action, just the three of us.\n\nWe\u2019ll report for duty but we won\u2019t go overseas.\nWe\u2019re prepared to face court martial, but we won\u2019t fight for [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3|Ky]].\nWe three have talked it over, our decision now is clear,\nWe will not go to Vietnam, we\u2019ll fight for freedom here.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?id=3358&lang=en|title=Ballad Of The Fort Hood Three|publisher=Antiwar Songs}}</ref>}}\n\nDuring the court cases and prison time for the Three numerous demonstrations were held in their support.

The Three underwent two separate legal proceedings with numerous stages as they both sued the government in [[United States district court|Federal Court]] while being court-martialed by the military. They argued in their suit and court-martials that the war was illegal and immoral, while the military charged them with refusing direct orders to board a plane bound for Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward  |first=Beverly |editor-last=Falk |editor-first=Richard A. |title=The Vietnam War and International Law, Volume 3 |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2015 |pages=477-486 |chapter=Nuremberg Law and U.S. Courts |isbn=9781400868247}}</ref> The Federal suit was filed on June 30, 1966 in [[Washington, D.C.]], the same day as their initial public announcement. The suit, an application for a permanent injunction to bar the military from shipping them to Southeast Asia, was filed by their attorney, Stanley Faulkner.<ref name=\"DefenseCommittee\"/> However, because the Three were ordered to board the plane before their suit could be heard, they were court-martialed before their hearing in Federal Court.\n\nThe military at first considered charging the Three with the \"uttering of disloyal statements with intent to cause disaffection and disloyalty among the members of the military service and civilian population.\" They had been arrested and held under \"administrative restriction\" at [[Fort Dix]] in [[New Jersey]] while the Army deliberated. Instead, on July 14, 1966, the Army released them with orders to board a plane at [[McGuire Air Force Base]] bound for Vietnam. When the Three refused this order, they were rearrested and charged with \"insubordination.\" The Three's attorney said \"he believed the Army carefully maneuvered his clients into a court-martial situation\", probably preferring to avoid the legal issues around free speech.<ref name=\"NYTimesPlane\">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Richard|date=1966-07-15|title=3 G.I.'s Refuse to Board Plane For Vietnam and Are Arrested|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Federal suit===\n\nMeanwhile, the suit in Federal court had already run into serious trouble. On July 11, a Federal District judge had thrown it out without even allowing arguments to proceed for more than 15 minutes. The judge cut off the Three's attorney in mid-argument and read from a prepared opinion, \"it is not the function of the judiciary to entertain such litigation which challenges the validity, the wisdom or the propriety of the [[Commander in Chief]] of our armed forces\". The ''NY Times'' noted that \"it was rare for a judge here to dismiss a case on his own motion at such an early stage in the proceedings.\"<ref>{{cite news|date=1966-07-12|title=3 G.I.'s Lose Suit to Avoid Vietnam: Federal Judge Throws Out Bid to Enjoin McNamara|work=The New York Times}}</ref> The Three quickly appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], but were again rebuffed. On November 6, 1967 the case made its way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] as ''[[Mora v. McNamara]]'' ({{Ussc|389|934}}) which refused to hear it.

During three separate trials over three days, they each argued the war was illegal and immoral. They all cited the [[Nuremberg Code]] as precedent and Samas said, \u201cThe way I was brought up was to judge things with my conscience, and that is what I did.\u201d The men were defended as \"counterpoints to [[Adolf Eichmann]]\", the infamous Nazi who justified his war crimes by saying he was just following orders. The presiding Army law officer dismissed any argument about the legality of the war with the statement: \"I rule that it is a matter of law, that the war in Vietnam is legal, and I forbid you to argue that it isn't.\" The military court, then, convicted them of insubordination and gave each a dishonorable discharges and forfeiture of pay.

He had been in the antiwar movement before being drafted and even passed out antiwar leaflets at the induction center on his first day of processing. He also refused to sign the [[loyalty oath]] arguing that it was a violation of his Constitutional rights to be asked about organizational affiliations, but the Army insisted on taking him anyway. He came from a poor family and said, \"the first war I knew was against the poverty of Spanish Harlem.\" He grew up angry at the discrimination, lousy education, police brutality and unemployment he and his fellow Puerto Ricans experienced, describing the fight for \"the reconstruction of our country's ghettoes and the meeting of our social and educational needs\" as \"the only battle which makes sense\".<ref name=\"DefenseCommittee\"/><ref name=\"NYPost\">{{cite news|last=Bard|first=Bernard|date=1966-07-09|title=Anti-Viet GIs: Rebels With a Dream|work=New York Post}}</ref>\n\nSamas grew up on the West Coast, the son of a trucking company employee who later went into the furniture business.

The antiwar activists, anticipating a reaction from the military, proceeded to form the Fort Hood Three Defense Committee and mobilized legal help for the Three. The June 30 press conference where the Three presented their initial statement was attended by [[Stokely Carmichael]], chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] and Lincoln Lynch the public relations director of [[Congress of Racial Equality]]. Within weeks the antiwar movement, nationally and internationally, had taken up their cause.<ref name=\"EVW\"/>\n\nPete Seeger, the folk singer and [[social activist]], wrote a song for them called the ''Ballad Of The Fort Hood Three'', which included: \n\n{{Poemquote\n|text=<!-- or: 1= -->Come all you brave Americans and listen unto me,\nIf you can spare five minutes in this 20th century,\nI'll sing to you a story true as you will plainly see\nIt's about three U.S. soldiers they call the \"Fort Hood Three.\"\n\nWe\u2019ve been told in training that in Vietnam we must fight;\nAnd we may have to kill women and children, and that is quite all right;\nWe say this war\u2019s illegal, immoral, and unjust;\nWe\u2019re taking legal action, just the three of us.\n\nWe\u2019ll report for duty but we won\u2019t go overseas.\nWe\u2019re prepared to face court martial, but we won\u2019t fight for [[Nguy\u1ec5n Cao K\u1ef3|Ky]].\nWe three have talked it over, our decision now is clear,\nWe will not go to Vietnam, we\u2019ll fight for freedom here.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.antiwarsongs.org/canzone.php?id=3358&lang=en|title=Ballad Of The Fort Hood Three|publisher=Antiwar Songs}}</ref>}}\n\nDuring the court cases and prison time for the Three numerous demonstrations were held in their support.

The Three underwent two separate legal proceedings with numerous stages as they both sued the government in [[United States district court|Federal Court]] while being court-martialed by the military. They argued in their suit and court-martials that the war was illegal and immoral, while the military charged them with refusing direct orders to board a plane bound for Vietnam.<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward  |first=Beverly |editor-last=Falk |editor-first=Richard A. |title=The Vietnam War and International Law, Volume 3 |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2015 |pages=477-486 |chapter=Nuremberg Law and U.S. Courts |isbn=9781400868247}}</ref> The Federal suit was filed on June 30, 1966 in [[Washington, D.C.]], the same day as their initial public announcement. The suit, an application for a permanent injunction to bar the military from shipping them to Southeast Asia, was filed by their attorney, Stanley Faulkner.<ref name=\"DefenseCommittee\"/> However, because the Three were ordered to board the plane before their suit could be heard, they were court-martialed before their hearing in Federal Court.\n\nThe military at first considered charging the Three with the \"uttering of disloyal statements with intent to cause disaffection and disloyalty among the members of the military service and civilian population.\" They had been arrested and held under \"administrative restriction\" at [[Fort Dix]] in [[New Jersey]] while the Army deliberated. Instead, on July 14, 1966, the Army released them with orders to board a plane at [[McGuire Air Force Base]] bound for Vietnam. When the Three refused this order, they were rearrested and charged with \"insubordination.\" The Three's attorney said \"he believed the Army carefully maneuvered his clients into a court-martial situation\", probably prefering to avoid the legal issues around free speech.<ref name=\"NYTimesPlane\">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Richard|date=1966-07-15|title=3 G.I.'s Refuse to Board Plane For Vietnam and Are Arrested|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Federal suit===\n\nMeanwhile, the suit in Federal court had already run into serious trouble. On July 11, a Federal District judge had thrown it out without even allowing arguments to proceed for more than 15 minutes. The judge cut off the Three's attorney in mid-argument and read from a prepared opinion, \"it is not the function of the judiciary to entertain such litigation which challenges the validity, the wisdom or the propriety of the [[Commander in Chief]] of our armed forces\". The ''NY Times'' noted that \"it was rare for a judge here to dismiss a case on his own motion at such an early stage in the proceedings.\"<ref>{{cite news|date=1966-07-12|title=3 G.I.'s Lose Suit to Avoid Vietnam: Federal Judge Throws Out Bid to Enjoin McNamara|work=The New York Times}}</ref> The Three quickly appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]], but were again rebuffed. On November 6, 1967 the case made its way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] as ''[[Mora v. McNamara]]'' ({{Ussc|389|934}}) which refused to hear it. Two justices, however, dissented arguing that the Court should look into the issue of the legality of the war.<ref>{{cite news|last=Graham|first=Fred P.|date=1967-11-07|title=Stewart Bids Court Weigh Legality of U.S. War Role|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Courts-martial===\n\nTheir courts-martial, the first of their kind in the U.S. military during the Vietnam War, took place quickly in late September 1966. During three separate trials over three days, they each argued the war was illegal and immoral. They all cited the [[Nuremberg Code]] as precedent and Samas said, \u201cThe way I was brought up was to judge things with my conscience, and that is what I did.\u201d The men were defended as \"counterpoints to [[Adolf Eichmann]]\", the infamous Nazi who justified his war crimes by saying he was just following orders. The presiding Army law officer dismissed any argument about the legality of the war with the statement: \"I rule that it is a matter of law, that the war in Vietnam is legal, and I forbid you to argue that it isn't.\" The military court, then, convicted them of insubordination and gave each a dishonorable discharges and forfeiture of pay.

The court's opinion said, \"The legality under international law of the American presence in Vietnam is not a justiciable issue.\" Stanley Faulkner, the Three's lawyer, responded, \"Sustaining the President's power to conduct an undeclared war 10,000 miles from our shores resembles the unlimited powers once held by kings and more recently in our history by dictators.\"<ref>{{cite news|date=1967-09-27|title=2 G.I.'s in Protest Get Sentences Cut|work=The New York Times}}</ref> In July 1967, both Samas and Johnson had their sentences reduced to three years by a military review board.<ref>{{cite news|date=1967-07-07|title=3d Soldier Opposed to War in Vietnam Convicted|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n\nThe actions of The Fort Hood Three, because they occurred so early in the war, have been called \"a turning point in the broader antiwar movement\" and \"the beginning of a rank-and-file upsurge against military authority and [the] war.\" Because they reached out to and received significant support from the civilian antiwar movement, they \"helped to forge an enduring alliance between antiwar GIs and the civilian antiwar movement that encouraged thousands more GIs to join the resistance.\"<ref name=\"Waging Peace\"/><ref name=\"Moser\">{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Richard |date=1996 |title=The New Winter Soldiers: GI and Veteran Dissent During the Vietnam Era |url=https://archive.org/details/newwintersoldier0000mose/page/70 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/newwintersoldier0000mose/page/70 70] |isbn=978-0-8135-2242-5 }}</ref> Further, as they made clear in their initial statements, their opposition to the war was connected to their recognition of racial disparities in the military and the country as a whole. \"They were some of the earliest antiwar protesters to really connect opposition to the war abroad to the fight for racial equality at home.\"<ref name=\"HuffPost\"/> Years later, Johnson pointed out the parallel between the Three's position and [[Muhammad Ali]]'s famous statement made the same year: \"No Vietcong ever called me nigger.\"<ref name=\"Waging Peace\"/> By defending the right of the Vietnamese people to self determination, they were also setting an early precident for future military resisters.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Concerned Officers Movement]]\n* [[Donald W.
