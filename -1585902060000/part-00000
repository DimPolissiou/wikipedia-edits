{"title_page": "Multiversion concurrency control", "text_new": "{{short description|Concurrency control method commonly used by database management systems}}\n'''Multiversion concurrency control''' ('''MCC''' or '''MVCC'''), is a [[concurrency control]] method commonly used by [[database management system]]s to provide concurrent access to the database and in programming languages to implement [[transactional memory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clojure.org/reference/refs|title=Clojure - Refs and Transactions|website=clojure.org|access-date=2019-04-12}}</ref>\n\nWithout concurrency control, if someone is reading from a database at the same time as someone else is writing to it, it is possible that the reader will see a half-written or [[Consistency (database systems)|inconsistent]] piece of data. For instance, when making a wire transfer between two bank accounts if a reader reads the balance at the bank when the money has been withdrawn from the original account and before it has deposited in the destination account, it would seem that money has disappeared from the bank. [[ACID#Isolation|Isolation]] is the property that provides guarantees in the concurrent accesses to data. Isolation is implemented by means of a [[concurrency control]] protocol. The simplest way is to make all readers wait until the writer is done, which is known as a read-write [[lock (database)|lock]]. Locks are known to create contention especially between long read transactions and update transactions. MVCC aims at solving the problem by keeping multiple copies of each data item. In this way, each user connected to the database sees a ''snapshot'' of the database at a particular instant in time. Any changes made by a writer will not be seen by other users of the database until the changes have been completed (or, in database terms: until the [[Database transaction|transaction]] has been comm\n\nWhen an MVCC database needs to update a piece of data, it will not overwrite the original data item with new data, but instead creates a newer version of the data item. Thus there are multiple versions stored. The version that each transaction sees depends on the isolation level implemented. The most common isolation level implemented with MVCC is [[snapshot isolation]]. With snapshot isolation, a transaction observes a state of the data as when the transaction started. MVCC introduces the challenge of how to remove versions that become obsolete and will never be read. In some cases, a process to periodically sweep through and delete the obsolete versions is implemented. This is often a stop-the-world process that traverses a whole table and rewrites it with the last version of each data item. [[PostgreSQL]] adopts this approach with its VACUUM process. Other databases split the storage blocks into two parts: the data part and an undo log. The data part always keeps the last committed version. The undo log enables recreation of older versions of data. The main inherent limitation of this latter approach is that when there are update-intensive workloads, the undo log part runs out of space and then transactions are aborted as they cannot be given their snapshot. For a [[document-oriented database]] it also allows the system to optimize documents by writing entire documents onto contiguous sections of disk\u2014when updated, the entire document can be re-written rather than bits and pieces cut out or maintained in a linked, non-contiguous database structure.\n\nMVCC provides [[Data consistency#Point-in-time consistency|point-in-time consistent]] views. Read transactions under MVCC typically use a timestamp or transaction ID to determine what state of the DB to read, and read these versions of the data. Read and write transactions are thus [[Isolation (database systems)|isolated]] from each other without any need for locking. However, despite locks being unnecessary, they are used by some MVCC databases such as Oracle. Writes create a newer version, while concurrent reads access an older version.\n\n==Implementation==\nMVCC uses [[timestamp]]s ('''TS'''), and ''incrementing transaction IDs'', to achieve ''transactional consistency''. MVCC ensures a transaction ('''T''') never has to wait to ''Read'' a database object ('''P''') by maintaining several versions of the object. Each version of object '''P''' has both a ''Read Timestamp'' ('''RTS''') and a ''Write Timestamp'' ('''WTS''') which lets a particular transaction '''T<sub>i</sub>''' read the most recent version of the object which precedes the transaction's ''Read Timestamp'' '''RTS'''('''T<sub>i</sub>''').\n\n{{Clarify| text=If transaction '''T<sub>i</sub>''' wants to ''Write'' to object '''P''', and there is also another transaction '''T<sub>k</sub>''' happening to the same object, the Read Timestamp '''RTS'''('''T<sub>i</sub>''') must precede the Read Timestamp '''RTS'''('''T<sub>k</sub>'''), i.e., '''RTS'''('''T<sub>i</sub>''') < '''RTS'''('''T<sub>k</sub>''') | reason=This seems to contradict the next paragraph, which states that a transaction is aborted if its read timestamp is earlier than the latest read timestamp on an object|date=June 2018}}, for the object ''Write Operation'' ('''WTS''') to succeed. A ''Write'' cannot complete if there are other outstanding transactions with an earlier Read Timestamp ('''RTS''') to the same object. Like standing in line at the store, you cannot complete your checkout transaction until those in front of you have completed theirs.\n\nTo restate; every object ('''P''') has a ''Timestamp'' ('''TS'''), however if transaction '''T<sub>i</sub>''' wants to ''Write'' to an object, and the transaction has a ''Timestamp'' ('''TS''') that is earlier than the object's current Read Timestamp, '''TS'''('''T<sub>i</sub>''') < '''RTS'''('''P'''), then the transaction is aborted and restarted. (This is because a later transaction already depends on the old value.) Otherwise, '''T<sub>i</sub>''' creates a new version of object '''P''' and sets the read/write timestamp '''TS''' of the new version to the timestamp of the transaction '''TS'''='''TS'''('''T<sub>i</sub>''').<ref>Ramakrishnan, R., & Gehrke, J. (2000). Database management systems. Osborne/McGraw-Hill.</ref>\n\nThe drawback to this system is the cost of storing multiple versions of objects in the database. On the other hand, reads are never blocked, which can be important for workloads mostly involving reading values from the database. MVCC is particularly adept at implementing true [[snapshot isolation]], something which other methods of concurrency control frequently do either incompletely or with high performance costs.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Concurrent read-write ===\n\nAt Time = 1, the state of a database could be:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Time\n! Object 1\n! Object 2\n|-\n| 0 || \"Foo\" by T0 || \"Bar\" by T0\n|-\n| 1 || \"Hello\" by T1 ||\n|}\n\nT0 wrote Object 1=\"Foo\" and Object 2=\"Bar\". After that T1 wrote Object 1=\"Hello\" leaving Object 2 at its original value. The new value of Object 1 will supersede the value at 0 for all transactions that start after T1 commits at which point version 0 of Object 1 can be garbage collected.\n\nIf a long running transaction T2 starts a read operation of Object 2 and Object 1 after T1 committed and there is a concurrent update transaction T3 which deletes Object 2 and adds Object 3=\"Foo-Bar\", the database state will look like at time 2:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Time\n! Object 1\n! Object 2\n! Object 3\n|-\n| 0 || \"Foo\" by T0 || \"Bar\" by T0 ||\n|-\n| 1 || \"Hello\" by T1 || ||\n|-\n| 2 || || (deleted) by T3 || \"Foo-Bar\" by T3\n|}\n\nThere is a new version as of time 2 of Object 2 which is marked as deleted and a new Object 3. Since T2 and T3 run concurrently T2 sees the version of the database before 2 i.e. before T3 committed writes, as such T2 reads Object 2=\"Bar\" and Object 1=\"Hello\". This is how multiversion concurrency control allows snapshot isolation reads without any locks.\n\n==History==\n\nMultiversion concurrency control is described in some detail in the 1981 paper \"Concurrency Control in Distributed Database Systems\"<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=356842.356846 |title=Concurrency Control in Distributed Database Systems |last1=Bernstein |first1=Philip A. |last2=Goodman |first2=Nathan |authorlink=Phil Bernstein |year=1981 |work=ACM Computing Surveys}}</ref> by [[Phil Bernstein]] and Nathan Goodman, then employed by the [[Computer Corporation of America]].

No.25 was an identical vessel built at Nagasaki in 1895 from imported materials\n\n===Third Class===\nThese included the No.1, 5, 15, 26, 28, and 50-classes, which were armed with 2-3 torpedo tubes and 2 37mm guns.\n* No.1 Class; No.1 to No.4 were ordered from [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow, Poplar]] in 1879, modelled by Sir Edward Reed on the [[Royal Navy]]'s 100-foot type, and shipped in sections to Japan for assembly and launch in 1880. All four were relegated to harbour service in 1898, and were broken up in 1904.\n* No.5 Class; No.5 to No.14 were ordered under the 1882 Programme and were manufactured by [[Schneider-Creusot]] at [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]], based on the French 35-metre type.

They were completed between 1900 and 1904.\n\nAll of the vessels served in the [[Russo-Japanese war]], ''Kiji'' being [[Naval mine|mined]] off [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]], though seemingly she was salved. They were notable for their attacks on the Russian fleet on the night of 27/28 May 1905 during the [[Battle of Tsushima]], expending many torpedoes. They were able to inflict significant damage on a number of Russian ships, that were scuttled or sunk the next day.\n\nAfter serving in [[World War I]], all remaining fifteen vessels were decommissioned between 1919 and 1923, some were scrapped, others turned into auxiliaries.\n \n==Ships==\nUnder the 1897-98 Programme four torpedo boats were ordered from France as improved versions of the French ''Cyclone'' class torpedo boats built for the French Navy. These were all fabricated in France and shipped dis-assembled to Japan, where they were re-assembled.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Builder\n! Launched\n!

These were divided into three groups - the First, Second, and Third classes. The First-class torpedo boats were given names, while the Second and Third classes were given numbers prefixed by a No.(e.g No.28).\n \n===First Class===\nApart from the ''Hayabusa'' class, this group included three other boats: their armament consisted of three 360-mm torpedo tubes (except for the ''Kotaka'', which had 6) and with the exception of the ''Hayabusa'' class between 2 and 4 37mm guns. \n* the old [[Japanese torpedo boat Kotaka|''Kotaka'']] (built 1887), widely considered to be the first torpedo boat destroyer and certainly their immediate ancestor, \n* the ex-Chinese ''Fukuryu'' (built 1886 as ''Fulong'', captured 1896 in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]), \n* the [[Japanese torpedo boat Shirataka|''Shirataka'']] (built 1899).\n\n===Second Class=== \nThese included the No.22, 21, 29, 31, 39, and 67-classes, which were armed with 3 torpedo tubes and 2 or 3 37mm guns, with the exception of the No. 39 and 67 classes which instead of the 37mm guns had 2 3pdr guns.\n* No.21 Class; No.21 was built by Normand at Le Havre in 1892, based on the French 36-metre type.\n* No.22 Class; No.22 and No.23 were built by Schichau, Elbing in 1693. No.25 was an identical vessel built at Nagasaki in 1895 from imported materials\n\n===Third Class===\nThese included the No.1, 5, 15, 26, 28, and 50-classes, which were armed with 2-3 torpedo tubes and 2 37mm guns.\n* No.1 Class; No.1 to No.4 were ordered from [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow, Poplar]] in 1879, modelled by Sir Edward Reed on the [[Royal Navy]]'s 100-foot type, and shipped in sections to Japan for assembly and launch in 1880. All four were relegated to harbour service in 1898, and were broken up in 1904.\n* No.5 Class; No.5 to No.14 were ordered under the 1882 Programme and were manufactured by [[Creusot]] at [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]], based on the French 35-metre type. Shipped and re-assembled in Japan between 1890 and 1892. All were struck from the list in 1907-10.\n* No.15 Class; No.15 and No.20 were similarly built by [[Normand shipyard|Normand Shipyard, Le Havre]], but based on the French 34-metre type.\n* No.16 Class; No.16 to No.19 were further units of the No.5 Class built by Creusot in 1892.

The family tree includes reigning princes, bishops, generals and noblemen. De Castellane's great-great-uncle [[Boni de Castellane]] (1867\u20131932) was a Parisian dandy and legend of the Belle \u00c9poque who married American railroad heiress Anna Gould.<ref name=\"W\" /> He was twice elected d\u00e9put\u00e9 (congressperson) of the Basses-Alpes region of France.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} De Castellane was brought up by her maternal grandmother and her uncle, Gilles Dufour, one of [[Karl Lagerfeld]]\u2019s principal assistants, first at [[Fendi]] then [[Chanel]].<ref name=\"W\" />\n\nDe Castellane has commented that her love of jewelry making was triggered by watching her paternal grandmother, Silvia Rodriguez de Rivas, Countess de Castilleja de Guzman, \"''change her baubles to match her different outfits several times a day.''\" Her first jewelry-making feat was accomplished at the age of five when she dismantled a priceless charm-bracelet belonging to her mother in order to make a pair of earrings.

Creative director [[Karl Lagerfeld]] soon asked her to oversee the development of costume jewelry designs.

Born in [[Yapey\u00fa, Corrientes]], in modern-day Argentina, he left the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata at the early age of seven to study in [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Spain]].\n\nIn 1808, after taking part in the [[Peninsular War]] against France, San Mart\u00edn contacted in London, South American supporters of independence from Spain. In 1812, he set sail for [[Buenos Aires]] and offered his services to the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], present-day Argentina. After the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]] and time commanding the [[Army of the North]] during 1814, he organized a plan to defeat the Spanish forces that menaced the United Provinces from the north, using an alternative path to the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. This objective first involved the establishment of a new army, the [[Army of the Andes]], in [[Cuyo Province]], Argentina. From there, he led the [[Crossing of the Andes]] to Chile, and triumphed at the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] and the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]] (1818), thus [[Chilean War of Independence|liberating Chile]] from [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] rule. Then he sailed to attack the Spanish stronghold of [[Lima]], Peru.\n\nOn 12 July 1821, after seizing partial control of Lima, San Mart\u00edn was appointed Protector of [[Peru]], and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peruvian independence]] was officially declared on 28 July. On 22 July 1822, after a closed-door meeting with fellow ''{{lang|es|[[libertadores|libertador]]}}'' [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] at [[Guayaquil]], [[Ecuador]], Bol\u00edvar took over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Mart\u00edn unexpectedly left the country and resigned the command of his army, excluding himself from politics and the military, and moved to France in 1824. The details of 22 July meeting would be a subject of debate by later historians.\n\nSan Mart\u00edn is regarded as a national hero of Argentina and Peru, and one of the Liberators of Spanish South America. The [[Order of the Liberator General San Mart\u00edn]] (''{{lang|es|Orden del Libertador General San Mart\u00edn}}''), created in his honor, is the highest decoration conferred by the Argentine government.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\n{{main|Early life of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn}}\n\nJos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn was the fifth and last son of Juan de San Mart\u00edn, an unsuccessful Spanish soldier, and Gregoria Matorras del Ser. He was born in [[Yapey\u00fa, Corrientes]], an [[Indian Reductions|Indian reduction]] of [[Guaran\u00ed people]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=14\u201315}} The exact year of his birth is [[Early life of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn#Year of birth controversy|disputed]], as there are no records of his [[baptism]]. Later documents formulated during his life, such as passports, military career records and wedding documentation, gave him varying ages. Most of these documents point to his year of birth as either 1777 or 1778.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=11\u201312}} The family moved to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1781, when San Mart\u00edn was three or four years old.\n\nJuan requested to be transferred to Spain, leaving the Americas in 1783. The family settled in [[Madrid]], but as Juan was unable to earn a promotion, they moved to [[M\u00e1laga]]. Once in the city, San Mart\u00edn enrolled in M\u00e1laga's school of temporalities, beginning his studies in 1785.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=22\u201324}} It is unlikely that he finished the six-year-long elementary education, before he enrolled in the Regiment of [[Murcia]] in 1789, when he reached the required age of 11. He began his military career as a cadet in the Murcian Infantry Unit.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=24}}\n\n=== Military career in Europe ===\n\n{{main|Military career of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in Spain}}\n[[File:La Rendici\u00f3n de Bail\u00e9n (Casado del Alisal).jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Portrat of the battle of Bailen|The [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] was one of the most important battles fought by Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn at the [[Peninsular War]].]]\n\nSan Mart\u00edn took part in several Spanish campaigns in North Africa, fighting in [[Melilla]] and in [[Oran]] against the [[Moors]] in 1791, among others.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=24\u201326}} His rank was raised to Sub-Lieutenant in 1793, at the age of 15. He began a naval career during the [[War of the Second Coalition]], when Spain was allied with France against Great Britain, during the time of the [[French Revolution]]. His ship [[HMS Santa Dorothea (1798)|\"Santa Dorotea\"]] [[Action of 15 July 1798|was captured]] by British forces, who kept him prisoner for some time. Soon afterward, he continued to fight in southern Spain, mainly in [[Cadiz]] and [[Gibraltar]] with the rank of Second Captain of light infantry. He continued to fight Portugal on the side of Spain in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801. He was promoted to captain in 1804.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=26\u201327}} During his stay in C\u00e1diz he was influenced by the ideas of the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=28}}\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1808, San Mart\u00edn was named adjutant of [[Francisco Mar\u00eda Solano Ortiz de Rosas]]. Rosas, suspected of being an ''[[afrancesado]]'', was killed by a popular uprising which overran the barracks and dragged his corpse in the streets. San Mart\u00edn was appointed to the armies of [[Andaluc\u00eda]], and led a battalion of volunteers. In June 1808 his unit became incorporated into a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla force]] led by [[Juan de la Cruz Mourge\u00f3n]]. He was nearly killed during the [[battle of Arjonilla]], but was saved by Sergeant Juan de Dios. On 19 July 1808, Spanish and French forces engaged in the [[battle of Bail\u00e9n]], a Spanish victory that allowed the Army of Andalusia to attack and seize Madrid. For his actions during this battle, San Mart\u00edn was awarded a gold medal, and his rank raised to lieutenant colonel. On 16 May 1811, he fought in the [[battle of Albuera]] under the command of general [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Carr Beresford]]. By this time, the French armies held most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] under their control, except for C\u00e1diz.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=26\u201332}}\n\n[[File:Fragata George Canning.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of people leaving a ship|Arrival of San Mart\u00edn and [[Carlos Mar\u00eda de Alvear]] to Buenos Aires, aboard the frigate ''George Canning''.]]\n\nSan Mart\u00edn resigned from the Spanish army, for [[Military career of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in Spain#Return to South America|controversial reasons]], and moved to South America, where he joined the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]. Historians propose [[Military career of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in Spain#Return to South America|several explanations]] for this action: the common ones are that he missed his native land, that he was a British agent and the congruence of the goals of both wars. The first explanation suggests that when the wars of independence began San Mart\u00edn thought that his duty was to return to his country and serve in the military conflict. The second explanation suggests that Britain, which would benefit from the independence of the South American countries, sent San Mart\u00edn to achieve it. The third suggests that both wars were caused by the conflicts between Enlightenment ideas and absolutism, so San Mart\u00edn still waged the same war; the wars in the Americas only developed separatist goals after the Spanish [[Absolutist Restoration]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=33\u201350}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn was initiated in the [[Lodge of Rational Knights]] in 1811. They met at the house of [[Carlos Mar\u00eda de Alvear]], other members were [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]], Aldao, [[Manuel Blanco Encalada|Blanco Encalada]] and other ''[[criollo people|criollos]]'', American-born Spaniards. They agreed to return to their home lands and join the local revolutionary movements. San Mart\u00edn asked for his retirement from the military, and moved to Britain. He stayed in the country for a short time, and met many other South Americans at a lodge held at the house of Venezuelan general [[Francisco de Miranda]] at 27 Grafton Street (now 58 Grafton Way),<ref>{{cite book|last=Jaksic|first=Ivan|title=Andr\u00e9s Bello: Scholarship and Nation-Building in Nineteenth-Century Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgZGGI7xreEC&pg=PA33|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02759-5|page=33}}</ref> [[Bloomsbury]], London (the house now has a [[blue plaque]] with Miranda's name).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/francisco-de-miranda-blue-plaque | title=Francisco de Miranda Blue Plaque | publisher=londonremembers.com | accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> Then he sailed to Buenos Aires aboard the British frigate ''George Canning'', along with the South Americans Alvear, Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Vera and Mat\u00edas Zapiola, and the Spaniards Francisco Chilavert and Eduardo Kailitz. They arrived on 9 March 1812, to serve under the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=51\u201364}}\n\n== South America ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\n{{see also|Argentine War of Independence}}\n\nA few days after his arrival in Buenos Aires in the United Provinces (formally named the Argentine Republic in 1826), San Mart\u00edn was interviewed by the First Triumvirate. They appointed him a lieutenant colonel of cavalry, and asked him to create a cavalry unit, as Buenos Aires did not have good cavalry. He began to organize the [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]] with Alvear and Zapiola. As Buenos Aires lacked professional military leaders, San Mart\u00edn was entrusted with the protection of the whole city, but kept focused in the task of building the military unit.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=65\u201376}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn, Alvear and Zapiola established a local branch of the [[Lautaro Lodge|Lodge of Rational Knights]], along with morenists, the former supporters of the late [[Mariano Moreno]]. This lodge sought to promote liberal ideas; its secrecy hides whether it was a real [[Freemasonry|Masonic lodge]], or a lodge with political goals. It had no ties to the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]]. In September 1812, San Mart\u00edn married [[Mar\u00eda de los Remedios de Escalada]], a 14-year-old girl from one of the local wealthy families.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nThe lodge organized the [[Revolution of 8 October 1812]] when the terms of office of the triumvirs [[Manuel de Sarratea]] and [[Feliciano Chiclana]] ended. [[Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n]] promoted antimorenist new members, [[Manuel Obligado]] and [[Pedro Medrano]], by preventing the vote of three deputies and thus achieving a majority. As this caused a commotion, San Mart\u00edn and Alvear intervened with their military force, and the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]] disestablished the triumvirate. It was replaced by the [[Second Triumvirate (Argentina)|Second Triumvirate]] of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Paso]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Pe\u00f1a]] and [[Antonio \u00c1lvarez Jonte]].{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|pp=498\u2013500}} The new triumvirate called the [[Assembly of the Year XIII]] and promoted San Mart\u00edn to colonel.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=85\u201389}}\n\n==== San Lorenzo ====\n\n{{main|Battle of San Lorenzo}}\n[[File:Cabral, soldado heroico.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the battle of San Lorenzo, featuring Juan Bautista Cabral when he saved San Mart\u00edn's life|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, trapped under his dead horse during the [[battle of San Lorenzo]], is saved by [[Juan Bautista Cabral]].]]\n\n[[Montevideo]], on the other shore of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], was still a royalist stronghold. [[Jos\u00e9 Rondeau]] laid siege to it, but the Montevidean navy eluded it by pillaging nearby cities. San Mart\u00edn was sent with the new Regiment to watch the activities in the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] shore.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=91}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=73}}\n\nThe Regiment followed the navy from a distance, avoiding detection. They hid in the [[San Carlos Convent]], in [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe]]. San Mart\u00edn watched the enemy ships from the top of the convent during the night. The royalists disembarked at dawn, ready to pillage and the regiment charged into battle. San Mart\u00edn employed a [[pincer movement]] to trap the royalists. He led one column and [[Justo Berm\u00fadez]] the other.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=91}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=74}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn's horse was killed during the battle, and his leg was trapped under the corpse of the animal after the fall. A royalist, probably Zabala himself,{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=92}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=76}} attempted to kill San Mart\u00edn while he was trapped under his dead horse where he suffered a saber injury to his face, and a bullet wound to his arm. [[Juan Bautista Cabral]] and [[Juan Bautista Baigorria]] of San Mart\u00edn's regiment intervened and saved his life; Cabral was mortally wounded, and died shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=92}}\n\nThe battle did not have a notable influence on the war and did not prevent further pillage. Montevideo was finally subdued by [[William Brown (admiral)|Admiral Brown]] during the [[Second Banda Oriental campaign]].{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=76}} Antonio Zabala, the leader of the Montevidean army, served under San Mart\u00edn during the crossing of the Andes years later.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=93\u201395}}\n\n==== Army of the North ====\n\n[[File:Belgrano y San Mart\u00edn.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of two men hugging|Meeting of [[Manuel Belgrano]] and Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn at the [[Yatasto relay]].]]\n\nOnce again in Buenos Aires, San Mart\u00edn and his wife attended to the first official performance of the [[Argentine National Anthem]], on 28 May 1813 at the [[Coliseo Theater]]. Oral tradition has it that the premiere took place on 14 May 1813 at the home of aristocrat [[Mariquita S\u00e1nchez|Mariquita S\u00e1nchez de Thompson]], with San Mart\u00edn also attending, but there is no documentary evidence of that.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=102}} The lyrics of the new anthem included several references to the secessionist will of the time.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=101\u2013104}}\n\nAlthough they were still allies, San Mart\u00edn began to distance himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan [[caudillo]] [[Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas]], San Mart\u00edn thought that it was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The [[Army of the North]], which was operating at the [[Upper Peru]], was defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Vilcapugio|Vilcapugio]] and [[Battle of Ayohuma|Ayohuma]], so the triumvirate appointed San Mart\u00edn to head it, replacing [[Manuel Belgrano]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=104\u2013110}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|pp=506\u2013507}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn and Belgrano met at the [[Yatasto relay]]. The army was in poor condition, and San Mart\u00edn initially refused to remove Belgrano from the army, as it would hurt the soldiers' morale. However, the supreme director Gervasio Posadas (who replaced the triumvirate in government) insisted, and San Mart\u00edn acted as instructed. San Mart\u00edn stayed only a few weeks in Tucum\u00e1n, reorganizing the army and studying the terrain. He also had a positive impression of the [[guerrilla war]] waged by [[Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes]] against the royalists,{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|p=537}} similar to the Peninsular War. It was a defensive war, and San Mart\u00edn trusted that they could prevent a royalist advance in Jujuy.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=111\u2013121}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|p=581}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn had health problems in April 1814, probably caused by [[hematemesis]]. He temporarily delegated the command of the Army to colonel [[Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cruz]] and requested leave to recover. He moved to [[Santiago del Estero]], and then to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] where he slowly recovered. During this time King [[Ferdinand VII]] returned to the throne, began the absolutist restoration and began to organize an attack on the rogue colonies. After an interview with [[Tom\u00e1s Guido]], San Mart\u00edn came up with a plan: organize an army in Mendoza, cross the Andes to Chile, and move to Peru by sea; all while G\u00fcemes defended the north frontier. This would place him in Peru without crossing the harsh terrain of [[Upper Peru]], where two campaigns had already been defeated. To advance this plan, he requested the governorship of the Cuyo province, which was accepted. He took office on 6 September.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=123\u2013130}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n==== Governor of Cuyo ====\n\n[[File:Ejercito de los Andes.jpg|thumb|alt=Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn passing review of the Army of the Andes|Training of the [[Army of the Andes]] at camp Plumerillo.]]\n\nThe absolutist restoration in Spain and the growing influence of Artigas generated a political crisis in Buenos Aires, forcing Posadas to resign. Alvear became the new Supreme Director, but had to resign after three months. San Mart\u00edn's plan was complicated as well by the [[Disaster of Rancagua]], a royalist victory that restored absolutism in Chile, ending the ''[[Patria Vieja]]'' period. San Mart\u00edn initially proposed a regular-sized army, simply to reinforce Chile, but changed to propose a larger one, to liberate the country from the occupation.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=131}} Chileans [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]], [[Luis Carrera]] and [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Erdo\u00edza|Manuel Rodr\u00edguez]], the leaders of the deposed Chilean rule, sought refugee in Cuyo, along with their armies. O'Higgins and Rodr\u00edguez were well received, but the [[Carrera family|Carrera brothers]] intended to act as a [[government in exile]]. They ignored the local laws of Cuyo, and their soldiers committed acts of vandalism. San Mart\u00edn imprisoned them and sent them to Buenos Aires. They proposed a plan to liberate Chile, different to the one outlined by San Mart\u00edn, who rejected it as impractical. This initiated a rivalry between the Carreras and San Mart\u00edn.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=212}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 7}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn began immediately to organize the [[Army of the Andes]]. He drafted all the citizens who could bear arms and all the slaves from ages 16 to 30, requested reinforcements to Buenos Aires, and reorganized the economy for [[War economy|war production]]. He took another leave to restore his health four months after taking power, so Alvear appointed [[Gregorio Perdriel]]. This appointment was resisted by the Mendoza Cabildo, which ratified San Mart\u00edn.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=133\u2013136}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|p=526}}\n\nThe government of San Mart\u00edn repeated some of the ideas outlined in the ''[[Operations plan]]'', drafted by [[Mariano Moreno]] at the beginning of the war. A combination of incentives, confiscations and [[planned economy]] allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, saltpeter, sulfur and borax, which had several uses and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers. Father [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Beltr\u00e1n]] headed a military factory of 700 men, which produced rifles and horseshoes. San Mart\u00edn stayed on good terms with both the government of Buenos Aires and the provincial ''caudillos'', without fully allying with either one. He was able to receive provisions from both. He considered that the war of independence took priority over the [[Argentine Civil Wars|civil wars]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=143\u2013156}}<ref>John Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions 1808\u20131826'' (2nd ed. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe army was not ready as of the summer of 1815, delaying the crossing. Given the harsh conditions on the mountains, the crossing could only be done in the summer season, when there is less snow. Buenos Aires did not send more provisions after the ousting of Alvear. San Mart\u00edn proposed to resign and serve under Balcarce, if they would support the campaign. San Mart\u00edn and Guido wrote a report in the autumn of 1816, detailing to the Supreme Director [[Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez de Balcarce]] the full military plan of operations.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=157\u2013163}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn proposed that the country declare independence immediately, before the crossing.

He opposed the appointment of [[Jos\u00e9 Moldes]], a soldier from Salta who was against the policies of Buenos Aires, as he feared Moldes would break national unity. He rejected proposals to be appointed Supreme Director himself. He supported his friend and lodge member [[Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n]] for the office. Pueyrred\u00f3n resumed the military aid to Cuyo. The Congress of Tucum\u00e1n [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] on 9 July 1816.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=165\u2013178}} Congress discussed the type of government of the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] (modern Argentina). General Manuel Belgrano, who had made a diplomatic mission to Europe, informed them that independence would be more easily acknowledged by the European powers if the country established a monarchy. For this purpose, Belgrano proposed a [[Inca plan|plan]] to crown a noble of the [[Inca Empire]] as king (the [[Sapa Inca]] dynasty had been dethroned in the 16th century).{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|pp=549\u2013550}} San Mart\u00edn supported this proposal, as well as G\u00fcemes and most deputies, except for those from Buenos Aires, who undermined the project and prevented its approval.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=179\u2013189}}\n\nNeeding even more soldiers, San Mart\u00edn extended the [[Free negro|emancipation of slaves]] to the ages from 14 to 55, and even allowed them to be promoted to higher military ranks. He proposed a similar measure at the national level, but Pueyrred\u00f3n encountered severe resistance.  He included as well the Chileans who escaped Chile after the disaster of Rancagua, and organized them in four units, each one of infantry, cavalry, artillery and dragoons. At the end of 1816, the Army of the Andes had 5,000 men, 10,000 mules and 1,500 horses. San Martin organized [[military intelligence]], [[propaganda]] and [[disinformation]] to confuse the royalist armies (such as the specific routes taken in the Andes), boost the national fervor of his army and promote desertion among the royalists.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=191\u2013202}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=9\u201310}}\n\n==== Crossing of the Andes ====\n\n{{main|Crossing of the Andes}}\n[[File:Ejercito Libertador cruce de Cordillera de los andes.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of two riders on the top of a mountain|Generals Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (left) and [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] (right) during the [[crossing of the Andes]].]]\n\nAlthough the [[Congress of Tucum\u00e1n]] had already formalized the [[flag of Argentina]], the Army of the Andes did not use it, choosing a banner with two columns, light blue and white, and a coat of arms roughly similar to the [[Coat of arms of Argentina]].

The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, and that it had to be ready for combat right after the crossing. The army was divided in six [[Column (formation)|columns]], each taking a different path. Colonel [[Francisco Zelada]] in [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]] took the [[Come-Caballos pass]] towards [[Copiap\u00f3]]. [[Juan Manuel Cabot]], in [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], moved to [[Coquimbo]]. [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Le\u00f3n Lemos]] led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]].

He was supported in the south of the city and the countryside. The strategy was to occupy nearby villages, seize the royalists' weapons and flee. The attacks on Melipilla and San Fernando, and a failed one at Curic\u00f3, demoralized the royalists.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=214\u2013217}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 10}}\n\n=== Chile ===\n\n{{see also|Chilean War of Independence}}\n\n==== Battle of Chacabuco ====\n\n[[File:Battle of Chacabuco.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the battle of Chacabuco|The [[Battle of Chacabuco]] between the Army of the Andes and Spanish forces in 1817.]]\n{{main|Battle of Chacabuco}}\n\nThe columns that crossed the Andes began to take military actions. The column in the north led by Cabot defeated the royalists in Salala, seized Coquimbo and then Copiap\u00f3. In the south, [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]] captured [[Talca]].

Royalist commander [[Rafael Maroto]] converged his armies on that location as well. Maroto had 2,450 men and 5 pieces of artillery, San Mart\u00edn had 3,600 men and 9 pieces of artillery. The misdirection that concealed the path of the bulk of the Army allowed San Mart\u00edn this advantage, as other royalist forces were scattered in other regions of Chile.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=219\u2013220}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=84}}\n\nThe battle began on 12 February. San Mart\u00edn organized a pincer movement, with Soler leading the west column and O'Higgins the east one. O'Higgins, eager to avenge the defeat at Rancagua, rushed to the attack, instead of coordinating with Soler. This gave the royalists a brief advantage. San Mart\u00edn instructed Soler to rush the attack as well. The combined attack was successful and San Mart\u00edn's column secured the final victory. The battle ended with 600 royalists dead and 500 prisoners, with only 12 deaths and 120 injuries in the Army of the Andes.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=220\u2013221}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=85\u201392}}\n\nThe army triumphantly entered [[Santiago de Chile]] the following day.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=92}} Governor [[Francisco Marc\u00f3 del Pont]] attempted to escape to [[Valpara\u00edso]] and sail to Peru, but he was captured on 22 February and returned to Santiago.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=91\u201392}} Several other officials were captured as well and sent as prisoners to San Luis, Argentina.{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 18}} San Mart\u00edn sent Marc\u00f3 del Pont prisoner to Mendoza.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=221\u2013222}}\n\n==== Patria Nueva ====\n\n[[File:Ohiggins.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Bernardo O'Higgins|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]], commander of the [[Army of the Andes]] along with San Mart\u00edn, and [[Supreme Director of Chile]] after the victory at [[battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]].]]\n\nThree deputies from Coquimbo, Santiago and Concepci\u00f3n organized a new government, and proposed San Mart\u00edn as [[Supreme Director of Chile]].

He did not have a good reception this time. Pueyrred\u00f3n thought that Chile should compensate Buenos Aires for the money invested in their liberation, as the support to San Mart\u00edn reduced the support to Belgrano, and the [[Second Portuguese-Brazilian invasion of the Eastern Bank|Portuguese-Brazilian invasion of the Eastern Bank]] menaced Buenos Aires. Incapable of financial support, Buenos Aires sent lawyer Manuel Aguirre to the United States, to request aid and acknowledge the declaration of independence. However, the mission failed, as the United States stayed neutral in the conflict because they negotiated the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|purchase of Florida]] with Spain. The Chilean [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] had obtained ships on his own after the disaster of Rancagua, which he intended to use to liberate Chile; but as San Mart\u00edn had already done that, he refused to place his fleet under the Army of the Andes. Carrera was an enemy of O'Higgins and sought to navigate to Chile and depose him, so Pueyrred\u00f3n imprisoned him, and confiscated his ships.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=227\u2013234}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn requested help from British Admiral [[William Bowles (Royal Navy officer)|William Bowles]]. He wrote from Chile and expected to find him in Buenos Aires, but Bowles had embarked for R\u00edo de Janeiro. Bowles considered that San Mart\u00edn was more trustworthy than Alvear, and praised his monarchism. San Mart\u00edn did not obtain the ships and interrupted the correspondence with Bowles for some months. He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in Buenos Aires with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either Buenos Aires or foreign powers, San Mart\u00edn promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=235\u2013246}}\n\n==== Battle of Cancha Rayada ====\n\n{{main|Second Battle of Cancha Rayada}}\n[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the Chilean declaration of independence|The [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] took place on 18 February 1818, shortly before the battles of [[Second Battle of Cancha Rayada|Cancha Rayada]] and [[Battle of Maip\u00fa|Maip\u00fa]].]]\n\nThe failure to liberate Talcahuano was followed by naval reinforcements from the North. The viceroy of Peru sent [[Mariano Osorio]] in an attempt to reconquer Chile. The royalists would then advance by land from south to north towards Santiago. San Mart\u00edn thought that it was not possible to defend Concepci\u00f3n, so he ordered O'Higgins to leave the city. 50,000 Chileans took cattle and grain and moved north, burning everything else, so that they did not leave supplies for the royalists. As he had done with the Tucum\u00e1n Congress, San Mart\u00edn urged a declaration of independence, to legitimize the government and the military actions. The [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] was issued on 18 February 1818, one year after the battle of Chacabuco.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=247}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=102}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn, Las Heras and Balcarce met in [[Curic\u00f3]], and the royalists in [[Talca]], in a plain known as \"Cancha rayada\". As the patriots had a numeric advantage, 7,000 against 4,600, Osorio tried to avoid open battle, and tried instead a stealth operation. A spy informed San Mart\u00edn that Osorio would make a surprise attack in the night, but the army could not be prepared in time. 1,000 soldiers fled, 120 died, and San Mart\u00edn's assistant was killed. O'Higgins tried to resist with his unit, but retired when he was shot in the arm. Las Heras managed to retire his army in order, saving his 3,500 men. The patriots escaped to Santiago.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=247\u2013248}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=102\u2013107}}\n\nDespite the defeat, the soldiers were received as heroes in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential disaster for the patriot armies turned into a minor setback.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=107}} The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada reduced its size to 5,000 soldiers, which was closer to the royalist forces. They took position next to the [[Maipo River]], near Santiago.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=248}}\n\n==== Battle of Maip\u00fa ====\n\n[[File:Abrazo de Maip\u00fa Pedro Subercaseaux.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the battle of Maipu|The \"Embrace of Maip\u00fa\" between Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], after the victory in the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]].]]\n{{main|Battle of Maip\u00fa}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn made a brief reconnaissance of the royalist army, and noticed several flaws in their organization.

The patriot artillery on the right fired on the royalist infantry on the left. Manuel Escalada led mounted grenadiers to capture the royalist artillery, turning them against their owners. Burgos' regiment severely punished the patriot left wing, mainly composed of emancipated slaves, and took 400 lives. San Mart\u00edn ordered the mounted grenadiers led by [[Hilari\u00f3n de la Quintana]] to charge against the regiment. The firing suddenly ended and royalists began to fight with sword bayonets, under the cries \"Long live the king!\" and \"Long live the homeland!\" respectively. Finally, the royalists ended their cries and began to disperse.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=250\u2013251}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=108\u2013115}}\n\nWhen the regiment of Burgos realized that their line was broken, they stopped resisting, and the soldiers began to disperse. The cavalry pursued and killed most of them. At the end of the battle, the royalists had been trapped among the units of Las Heras in the west, Alvarado in the middle, Quintana in the east and the cavalries of Zapiola and Freire. Osorio tried to fall back to the hacienda \"Lo Espejo\" but could not reach it, so he tried to escape to Talcahuano. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez made his last stand at that hacienda, where 500 royalists died.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=251}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\nThe battle ended in the afternoon. O'Higgins, still injured by the wound received in Cancha Rayada, arrived during the final action at the hacienda. He claimed \"Glory to the savior of Chile!\", in reference to San Mart\u00edn, who praised him for going to the battlefield with his unhealed wound. They made an embrace on their horses, now known as the \"Embrace of Maip\u00fa\".{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=251}}\n\nThe battle of Maip\u00fa secured Chilean independence.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=118\u2013119}} Except for Osorio, who escaped with 200 cavalry, all top royalist military leaders were captured. All their armed forces were either killed or captured, and all their artillery, weapons, military hospitals, money and resources were lost. The victory was praised by G\u00fcemes, Bol\u00edvar and the international press.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=251\u2013254}}\n\n==== Fleet of the Pacific ====\n\n[[File:San Mart\u00edn en Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of San Mart\u00edn before the Congress of Buenos Aires|San Mart\u00edn before the Congress of Buenos Aires]]\n\nSan Mart\u00edn made a new request for ships to Bowles, but received no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, to make a similar request. He arrived to Mendoza a few days after the execution of the Chileans [[Luis Carrera|Luis]] and [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Carrera]], brothers of Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera.{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 32}} The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian [[Benjam\u00edn Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna]] indicts San Mart\u00edn, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodr\u00edguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; this death may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Mart\u00edn could not have taken part in it, as he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=265\u2013267}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn was not well received in Buenos Aires. Pueyrred\u00f3n initially declined to give further help, citing the conflicts with the federal caudillos and the organization of a huge royalist army in C\u00e1diz that would try to reconquer the La Plata basin. He thought that Chile should organize the navy against Peru, not Buenos Aires. San Mart\u00edn discussed with him and finally got financing of 500,000 pesos. He returned to Mendoza with his wife and daughter and received a letter from Pueyrred\u00f3n, who said that Buenos Aires could only deliver one-third of the promised funds. This complicated the project, as neither Santiago de Chile nor Mendoza had the resources needed. San Mart\u00edn resigned from the Army, but it is unclear whether his decision to resign was sincere or was to apply pressure to his backers. The government of Buenos Aires still considered San Mart\u00edn vital to the national defense, so Pueyrred\u00f3n agreed to pay the 500,000 pesos requested, and encouraged San Mart\u00edn to withdraw his resignation.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=269\u2013277}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn proposed to mediate between Buenos Aires and the [[Liga Federal]] led by Artigas. He thought that the civil war was counter-productive to national unity, and that an end to hostilities would free resources needed for the navy. He calculated that Artigas might condition the peace on a joint declaration of war to colonial Brazil; so San Mart\u00edn proposed to defeat the royalists first and then demand the return of the [[Banda Oriental|Eastern Bank]] to the United Provinces. O'Higgins recommended caution, fearing that San Mart\u00edn might be captured. Pueyrred\u00f3n rejected the mediation, as he did not recognize Artigas as an equal to negotiate with him.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=279\u2013286}}\n\n==== Act of Rancagua ====\n\n[[File:Revista de Rancagua Blanes.JPG|thumb|alt=Portrait of a parade of the Army of the Andes|Parade of the Army of the Andes in Rancagua.]]\n\nAlthough Artigas was defeated by the Luso-Brazilian armies, his allies [[Estanislao L\u00f3pez]] and [[Francisco Ram\u00edrez (governor)|Francisco Ram\u00edrez]] continued hostilities against Buenos Aires for its inactivity against the invasion. Pueyrred\u00f3n called the Army of the Andes and the [[Army of the North]] (led by Belgrano) to aid Buenos Aires in the conflict. Guido noted to San Mart\u00edn that if both armies did that, the north of Argentina and Chile would be easily reconquered by the royalists. San Mart\u00edn also knew that most of the soldiers of the Army of the Andes would not be willing to aid Buenos Aires in the civil war, as most were from other provinces or from Chile. San Mart\u00edn had doubts as well about the projected arrival of a large military expedition from Spain, as the absolutist restoration of Ferdinand VII had met severe resistance in Spain. San Mart\u00edn finally kept the Army in Chile when Belgrano's lieutenant Viamonte signed an armistice with L\u00f3pez; he thought that the conflict had ended.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=287\u2013293}}\n\nHowever, the minister of war [[Mat\u00edas de Irigoyen]] ordered once more the return of the Army of the Andes, and appointed [[Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cruz]] as its leader, displacing San Mart\u00edn. San Mart\u00edn resigned again, and observed that the Army would not be able to cross the Andes from Chile to Buenos Aires because the winter snow was blocking the trails. All the leaders of the military units of the Army of the Andes refused to go to Buenos Aires, as their soldiers would mutiny or desert. Facing both the resignation of San Mart\u00edn and the refusals to obey the orders, the Supreme Director canceled the orders, and the Army of the Andes stayed in Chile. With the sanction of the [[Argentine Constitution of 1819]], Pueyrred\u00f3n ended his mandate as Supreme Director, replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Rondeau]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=293\u2013299}}\n\nThe navy was finally completed in Chile, and British Earl [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] was appointed to lead it. But it was not sent to Peru immediately: there were still rumors of an attack from Spain, and if needed the navy would move to Buenos Aires and fight the Spanish ships. The civil war resumed and San Mart\u00edn attempted once more to mediate, to no effect. Rondeau again requested the return of the Army of the Andes, without success.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=301\u2013308}} San Mart\u00edn returned to Chile and prepared to take part in the naval actions against Peru, ignoring Buenos Aires.

The Army of the Andes had 4,000 soldiers instead, and Cochrane's navy another 1,600. With this disparity of forces, San Mart\u00edn tried to avoid battles. He tried instead to divide the enemy forces in several locations, as he did during the Crossing of the Andes, and trap the royalists with a pincer movement with either reinforcements of the [[Army of the North]] from the South or the army of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] from the North. He also tried to promote rebellions and insurrection within the royalist ranks, and promised the emancipation of any slaves that deserted their Peruvian masters and join the army of San Mart\u00edn. The spreading of the news of the [[Trienio Liberal|Liberal Triennium]], a liberal rebellion in Spain that reinstated the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], also sought to undermine royalist loyalty.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=334\u2013336}}\n\nThe navy sailed from Chile on 20 August 1820. It was composed of eight warships, eleven gunboats, 247 cannons and a crew of 1,600, most of them Chileans. There were 12 frigates, and a brig with the 4,000 soldiers of the Army of the Andes. San Mart\u00edn was the leader of the military expedition. They landed in [[Paracas Bay|Paracas]], 200&nbsp;km to the south of Lima, on 7 September, and occupied the nearby city of [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]], which was abandoned by the royalists.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=337}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 50}}\n\n==== Expedition of Peru ====\n\n[[File:El Batall\u00f3n Numancia recibe la Bandera del Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of a battalion changing sides n a battle|The Numancia battalion, formerly a royalist unit, joins the forces of San Mart\u00edn.]]\n\nPeruvian viceroy [[Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela, 1st Marquis of Viluma|Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela]] had instructions from Spain to negotiate with the patriots. Under an armistice the opponents celebrated a meeting in [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]]. The viceroy's deputies proposed to adopt the liberal Spanish constitution if San Mart\u00edn left the country, but the patriots requested instead that Spain grant the independence of Peru. The negotiations did not bear fruit.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=338}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=49\u201353}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn isolated Lima from the surrounding countryside, and sent [[Juan Antonio \u00c1lvarez de Arenales]] to promote rebellions among the natives. The Army of the Andes moved north of Lima by sea. San Mart\u00edn and Arenales besieged the city from two directions, and Cochrane attacked the port of El Callao. Cochrane captured the ship \"Esmeralda\", and the royalist regiment Numancia. Nearly 700 expeditionary soldiers of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] deserted and joined the patriots. Several populations in the north of Peru supported San Mart\u00edn, and Arenales defeated the royalists at the [[Battle of Pasco]]. More than 300 royalists joined the patriots, including [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=339\u2013340}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nHowever, the plans did not fully work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks,{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 55}} and the slaves did not join the army in the expected numbers. The Argentine provinces could not send the supporting army that San Mart\u00edn had requested earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, he wrote to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], trying to coordinate actions with him.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=341}}\n\nPezuela was deposed by a military-liberal coup, and [[Jos\u00e9 de la Serna e Hinojosa]] became the new viceroy. De la Serna called San Mart\u00edn to negotiate an end of hostilities. The result was the same than with Pezuela: De la Serna proposed to enact the 1812 Spanish constitution (Per\u00fa inside Spain), and San Mart\u00edn demanded the independence of Peru (with an independent monarchy). The rejection of the Spanish constitution was motivated by the disproportional representation of the Americas in the Constituent Assembly that wrote it. Both armies agreed a temporary armistice. San Mart\u00edn proposed to establish a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a European monarch, with a regency ruling in the interim. The proposal was rejected, on the grounds that they could not accept it without Ferdinand's approval.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=342\u2013347}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=58\u201359}}\n\n==== Protector of Peru ====\n\n[[File:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of San Mart\u00edn saluting the people of Peru|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn's proclamation of the independence of [[Peru]] on 28 July 1821 in [[Lima]]. Painting by [[Juan Lepiani]]]]\n\nAs hostilities renewed, San Mart\u00edn organized several guerrilla groups in the countryside, and laid siege to Lima, but did not force his entry, as he did not want to appear as a conqueror to the local population. However, De la Serna suddenly left the city with his army, for unknown reasons. San Mart\u00edn called for an [[open cabildo]] to discuss the independence of the country, which was agreed. With this approval, the authority in Lima, the support of the northern provinces and the port of El Callao under siege, San Mart\u00edn declared the independence of Peru on 28 July 1821. The war, however, had not ended yet.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=349\u2013353}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=59\u201363}}\n\nUnlike Chile, Peru had no local politicians of the stature of O'Higgins, so San Mart\u00edn became the leader of the government, even though he did not want to. He was appointed [[List of Presidents of Peru|Protector of Peru]]. As Peruvian society was highly conservative, San Mart\u00edn did not take the liberal ideas too far immediately. The provisional statutes contained few changes and ratified several existing laws.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=353\u2013358}} All the types of servitude imposed on the natives, such as [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] and [[Yanaconas|yanaconazgo]], were abolished, and the natives received citizenship. He did not abolish slavery completely, as Peru had 40,000 slaveowners, and declared \"[[freedom of wombs]]\" instead, which emancipated the sons of slaves; he emancipated as well the slaves of the royalists who left Lima. He also abolished the [[Inquisition]] and corporal punishment, and enacted [[freedom of speech]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=359\u2013368}} During his stay in Peru, San Mart\u00edn had a romance with [[Rosa Campuzano]], a woman from Guayaquil.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=381\u2013383}}\n\nThe royalist armies that stayed in the Peruvian countryside headed to Lima, led by Canterac. In a confusing episode, there was no battle, as neither one attacked. Canterac changed his path to El Callao, took resources from it, and returned to his base. There was no battle during their return either. Without resources, El Callao surrendered in a few days.{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=64\u201366}} Both armies took inadvisable actions: San Mart\u00edn allowed Canterac to receive reinforcements, and Canterac left a key military objective incapable to resist. There is no known documentation that provides a reasonable explanation of those events.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=369\u2013371}}\n\nCochrane had several disputes with San Mart\u00edn.{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 67}} He discussed several of his actions and tried to bypass his authority. During the blockade of El Callao, he proposed that O'Higgins take control of the mission and send any spoils of battle to Chile. As San Mart\u00edn was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Mart\u00edn was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Mart\u00edn in Chile.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=372\u2013383}}\n\nBol\u00edvar took control of Caracas with his victory at the [[battle of Carabobo]], and the [[Congress of C\u00facuta]] issued laws similar to those in Per\u00fa. [[Ecuadorian War of Independence|Guayaquil declared independence]], and Bol\u00edvar sent [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] to reinforce them. Sucre's forces were not enough, and requested help from San Mart\u00edn. Peru sent a military force of 1,300 men. Bol\u00edvar entered the city a month later, and claimed that for historical reasons Quito should be part of Colombia.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=383\u2013385}} San Mart\u00edn and Bol\u00edvar sought to generate [[Latin American integration]], but disagreed on the type of government: Bol\u00edvar proposed a republic, and San Mart\u00edn a constitutional monarchy, reasoning that it would be easier to receive international recognition for the now-independent South American nations.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=387\u2013395}} Peru and Colombia signed a treaty of integration, to be proposed to [[Chile]], the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Paraguay]], and at a later point to the [[United Provinces of Central America]] and the [[Empire of Brazil]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=397\u2013406}}\n\n=== Guayaquil conference ===\n\n{{main|Guayaquil conference}}\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of San Martin and Bol\u00edvar talking|The [[Guayaquil conference]] between [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn. The real conference took place inside an office, and not in the countryside as the portrait suggests.]]\n\nSan Mart\u00edn thought that if he joined forces with Bol\u00edvar he would be able to defeat the remnant royalist forces in Peru. Both liberators would meet in Quito, so San Mart\u00edn appointed Torre Tagle to manage the government during his absence. Bol\u00edvar was unable to meet San Mart\u00edn at the arranged date, so San Mart\u00edn returned to Lima, but still left Tagle in government. Bol\u00edvar moved from Quito to Guayaquil, which secured its independence. There were discussions on the future of the region: some factions wanted to join Colombia, others to join Peru, and others to become a new nation. Bol\u00edvar ended the discussion by annexing Guayaquil into Colombia. There was Peruvian pressure on San Mart\u00edn to do a similar thing, to annex Guayaquil to Peru.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=407\u2013409}}\n\nThe [[Guayaquil conference]] took place on 26 July 1822. They had two private meetings, on that day and the following one. As there were no witnesses or minutes, the content of their discussions can only be inferred from their later actions and their letters to other people. Some likely topics of discussion may have been a request of reinforcements, and an offer to combine the armies into a single one, with San Mart\u00edn ranked second to Bol\u00edvar.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=407\u2013421}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nThe minister [[Bernardo Monteagudo]] was removed from office by a Peruvian rebellion, during San Mart\u00edn's absence. San Mart\u00edn resigned as Protector of Peru a few days later and returned to [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile. Several reasons influenced him to resign. The military discipline of the Army of the Andes was compromised, but San Mart\u00edn was reluctant to take drastic action against his officers. The authority of San Mart\u00edn and Bol\u00edvar, and the local rivalry of their respective countries Peru and Colombia, limited their options for joint work: Colombians would not have liked Bol\u00edvar to give many of his forces to San Mart\u00edn, whilst Peruvians would not have liked their Protector to be second in command to Bol\u00edvar, and a joint command would complicate the maintenance of military discipline. Unlike Bol\u00edvar, backed up by the Colombian government, San Mart\u00edn did not have more resources than those he already had: Buenos Aires denied him any support, the other Argentine governors (such as [[Juan Bautista Bustos]]) supported him but did not have resources to provide, O'Higgins was about to be deposed in Chile, and Cochrane took the navy and left him without naval power. Finally, he felt that only a very strong authority would be able to prevent [[balkanization]], but refused to rule as a dictator himself.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=423\u2013437}}\n\n== Later life ==\n\n{{main|Later life of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn}}\n[[File:Jose de San Martin.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of an aged Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|General San Mart\u00edn in Paris, 1848.]]\n\nAfter his retirement, San Mart\u00edn intended to live in [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]]. Although the war of independence had ended in the region, the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] continued. The [[Unitarian Party|unitarians]] wanted to organize the country as a [[unitary state]] centered on [[Buenos Aires]], and the [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|federalists]] preferred a [[federation]] of provinces. San Mart\u00edn had good relations with the federal ''[[caudillo]]s'' and a personal feud with unitarian leader [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], but tried to stay neutral. San Mart\u00edn's wife, [[Mar\u00eda de los Remedios de Escalada]], died in 1823, so he returned to Buenos Aires. He took his daughter Mercedes Tomasa, who was living with her mother's family, and sailed to Europe.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=453\u2013465}}\n\nAfter a failed attempt to settle in France, he moved to Britain and then to the capital of present-day Belgium, [[Brussels]], where he settled. He intended to live there until Mercedes completed her education and then return to Argentina. Rivadavia visited Brussels and San Mart\u00edn intended to challenge him to a duel, but was dissuaded by Diego Paroissien.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=467\u2013476}}\n\nDespite his feud with Rivadavia, who was appointed [[President of Argentina]], San Mart\u00edn offered his military services in the [[Argentine-Brazilian War|War with Brazil]], but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal [[Manuel Dorrego]], and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in [[R\u00edo de Janeiro]] he was informed that the unitarian [[Juan Lavalle]] had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Mart\u00edn did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable to put down the federal rebellion against him, and offered San Mart\u00edn the government. San Mart\u00edn declined and returned to Brussels.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=477\u2013495}}\n\nBy this time the federal [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] had begun to pacify the civil war started by Lavalle and earned San Mart\u00edn's admiration. They began to exchange friendly letters. The [[Belgian Revolution]] and the [[cholera epidemic of 1831]] made San Mart\u00edn leave Brussels and move to Paris, where both San Mart\u00edn and his daughter became ill. They were helped by [[Mariano Balcarce]]. Mariano married Mercedes, and they had a daughter, Mar\u00eda Mercedes.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=497\u2013521}}\n\nIn 1837 France began a [[French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata|blockade of the Rio de la Plata]] against Rosas. San Mart\u00edn offered his military services to Rosas, which was declined because of San Mart\u00edn's advanced age, and condemned the role of the unitarians in that conflict, as they had allied themselves with France against their own nation. San Mart\u00edn bequeathed his [[Curved saber of San Mart\u00edn|curved saber]] to Rosas, because of his successful defense of the country. The conflict between France and Argentina renewed in the [[Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], which San Mart\u00edn condemned as well. During this time he met [[Florencio Varela (writer)|Florencio Varela]] and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=523\u2013558}}\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 revolution]], San Martin left Paris and moved to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], a small city in northern France. He was almost blind and had many health problems because of his advanced age, but continued to write letters and keep in touch with the news from South America. Shortly after receiving the news of the Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade, he died, three o'clock on 17 August 1850.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=559\u2013570}}\n\n== Remains ==\n\n[[File:SanMartinMausoleum.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of San Mart\u00edn's mausoleum|Mausoleum of San Mart\u00edn at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]].

Between 1850 and 1861, his corpse was buried in the crypt of the [[Basilica of Notre-Dame de Boulogne]]. He requested in his will to be taken to the cemetery without any [[funeral]], and to be moved to Buenos Aires thereafter. Balcarce informed Rosas and the foreign minister [[Felipe Arana]] of San Mart\u00edn's death. Balcarce oversaw the [[embalming]] of his remains and their temporary stay in a chapel of the city. He also sent San Martin's saber to Rosas.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=569\u2013574}}\n\nHowever, the rebellion of [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]] against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat at the [[battle of Caseros]] and the resulting chaos delayed the move of San Mart\u00edn's remains to Buenos Aires. Still, both Rosas and Urquiza organized public homages to San Mart\u00edn, despite the conflict. Buenos Aires seceded from Argentina as the [[state of Buenos Aires]], dominated by Unitarians who despised San Mart\u00edn. Thus, the move of his remains was postponed indefinitely. Aware that there were no favorable conditions for the project, Balcarce arranged a creation of a tomb in the Boulogne-sur-Mer cemetery.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=574\u2013577}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn's remains were finally repatriated on 29 May 1880, during the presidency of [[Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda]]. The mausoleum was placed inside the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]]. As San Mart\u00edn was suspected of being a [[Freemasonry|freemason]], the mausoleum was placed in an expanded wing of the Cathedral.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=584}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{main|Legacy of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn}}\n[[File:Mendoza - Cerro de la Gloria - Monumento.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of a freedom monument in Mendoza|The ''[[Cerro de la Gloria]]'', monument to the [[Army of the Andes]] at [[Mendoza, Argentina]]]]\nSan Mart\u00edn was first acclaimed as a national hero of Argentina by the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federals]], both during his life and immediately after his death.

By that time, several accounts of San Mart\u00edn were under way in many countries: Valent\u00edn Ledesma from [[Lima]] wrote in 1853 about San Mart\u00edn's campaign in Peru, and [[Benjam\u00edn Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna]] from [[Chile]] wrote in 1856 about the [[Chilean War of Independence]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=579}} With Mitre's book, San Mart\u00edn was universally acclaimed as the [[Libertadores|Liberator]] of Argentina, but his work introduced several inaccuracies to make San Mart\u00edn's campaign support Mitre's political project.

February 1778 \u2013 17 August 1850), known simply as '''Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn''' ({{IPA-es|xo\u02c8se \u00f0e san ma\u027e\u02c8tin|-|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn.ogg}}) or  ''[[libertadores|El Libertador of Argentina, Chile and Peru]]'',<ref>John Lynch, ''San Martin: Argentine Soldier, American Hero'' (2009)</ref> was a [[Spaniards|Spanish]]-[[Argentina|Argentine]] general and the prime leader of the southern and central parts of [[Spanish American wars of independence|South America's successful struggle for independence]] from the [[Spanish Empire]] who served as the [[President of Peru|Protector of Peru]]. Born in [[Yapey\u00fa, Corrientes]], in modern-day Argentina, he left the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata at the early age of seven to study in [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Spain]].\n\nIn 1808, after taking part in the [[Peninsular War]] against France, San Mart\u00edn contacted in London, South American supporters of independence from Spain. In 1812, he set sail for [[Buenos Aires]] and offered his services to the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], present-day Argentina. After the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]] and time commanding the [[Army of the North]] during 1814, he organized a plan to defeat the Spanish forces that menaced the United Provinces from the north, using an alternative path to the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. This objective first involved the establishment of a new army, the [[Army of the Andes]], in [[Cuyo Province]], Argentina. From there, he led the [[Crossing of the Andes]] to Chile, and triumphed at the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] and the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]] (1818), thus [[Chilean War of Independence|liberating Chile]] from [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] rule. Then he sailed to attack the Spanish stronghold of [[Lima]], Peru.\n\nOn 12 July 1821, after seizing partial control of Lima, San Mart\u00edn was appointed Protector of [[Peru]], and [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peruvian independence]] was officially declared on 28 July. On 22 July 1822, after a closed-door meeting with fellow ''{{lang|es|[[libertadores|libertador]]}}'' [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] at [[Guayaquil]], [[Ecuador]], Bol\u00edvar took over the task of fully liberating Peru. San Mart\u00edn unexpectedly left the country and resigned the command of his army, excluding himself from politics and the military, and moved to France in 1824. The details of 22 July meeting would be a subject of debate by later historians.\n\nSan Mart\u00edn is regarded as a national hero of Argentina and Peru, and one of the Liberators of Spanish South America. The [[Order of the Liberator General San Mart\u00edn]] (''{{lang|es|Orden del Libertador General San Mart\u00edn}}''), created in his honor, is the highest decoration conferred by the Argentine government.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n\n{{main|Early life of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn}}\n\nJos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn was the fifth and last son of Juan de San Mart\u00edn, an unsuccessful Spanish soldier, and Gregoria Matorras del Ser. He was born in [[Yapey\u00fa, Corrientes]], an [[Indian Reductions|Indian reduction]] of [[Guaran\u00ed people]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=14\u201315}} The exact year of his birth is [[Early life of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn#Year of birth controversy|disputed]], as there are no records of his [[baptism]]. Later documents formulated during his life, such as passports, military career records and wedding documentation, gave him varying ages. Most of these documents point to his year of birth as either 1777 or 1778.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=11\u201312}} The family moved to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1781, when San Mart\u00edn was three or four years old.\n\nJuan requested to be transferred to Spain, leaving the Americas in 1783. The family settled in [[Madrid]], but as Juan was unable to earn a promotion, they moved to [[M\u00e1laga]]. Once in the city, San Mart\u00edn enrolled in M\u00e1laga's school of temporalities, beginning his studies in 1785.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=22\u201324}} It is unlikely that he finished the six-year-long elementary education, before he enrolled in the Regiment of [[Murcia]] in 1789, when he reached the required age of 11. He began his military career as a cadet in the Murcian Infantry Unit.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=24}}\n\n=== Military career in Europe ===\n\n{{main|Military career of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in Spain}}\n[[File:La Rendici\u00f3n de Bail\u00e9n (Casado del Alisal).jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Portrat of the battle of Bailen|The [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] was one of the most important battles fought by Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn at the [[Peninsular War]].]]\n\nSan Mart\u00edn took part in several Spanish campaigns in North Africa, fighting in [[Melilla]] and in [[Oran]] against the [[Moors]] in 1791, among others.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=24\u201326}} His rank was raised to Sub-Lieutenant in 1793, at the age of 15. He began a naval career during the [[War of the Second Coalition]], when Spain was allied with France against Great Britain, during the time of the [[French Revolution]]. His ship [[HMS Santa Dorothea (1798)|\"Santa Dorotea\"]] [[Action of 15 July 1798|was captured]] by British forces, who kept him prisoner for some time. Soon afterward, he continued to fight in southern Spain, mainly in [[Cadiz]] and [[Gibraltar]] with the rank of Second Captain of light infantry. He continued to fight Portugal on the side of Spain in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801. He was promoted to captain in 1804.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=26\u201327}} During his stay in C\u00e1diz he was influenced by the ideas of the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=28}}\n\nAt the outbreak of the [[Peninsular War]] in 1808, San Mart\u00edn was named adjutant of [[Francisco Mar\u00eda Solano Ortiz de Rosas]]. Rosas, suspected of being an ''[[afrancesado]]'', was killed by a popular uprising which overran the barracks and dragged his corpse in the streets. San Mart\u00edn was appointed to the armies of [[Andaluc\u00eda]], and led a battalion of volunteers. In June 1808 his unit became incorporated into a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla force]] led by [[Juan de la Cruz Mourge\u00f3n]]. He was nearly killed during the [[battle of Arjonilla]], but was saved by Sergeant Juan de Dios. On 19 July 1808, Spanish and French forces engaged in the [[battle of Bail\u00e9n]], a Spanish victory that allowed the Army of Andalusia to attack and seize Madrid. For his actions during this battle, San Mart\u00edn was awarded a gold medal, and his rank raised to lieutenant colonel. On 16 May 1811, he fought in the [[battle of Albuera]] under the command of general [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Carr Beresford]]. By this time, the French armies held most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] under their control, except for C\u00e1diz.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=26\u201332}}\n\n[[File:Fragata George Canning.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Portrait of people leaving a ship|Arrival of San Mart\u00edn and [[Carlos Mar\u00eda de Alvear]] to Buenos Aires, aboard the frigate ''George Canning''.]]\n\nSan Mart\u00edn resigned from the Spanish army, for [[Military career of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in Spain#Return to South America|controversial reasons]], and moved to South America, where he joined the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]. Historians propose [[Military career of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn in Spain#Return to South America|several explanations]] for this action: the common ones are that he missed his native land, that he was a British agent and the congruence of the goals of both wars. The first explanation suggests that when the wars of independence began San Mart\u00edn thought that his duty was to return to his country and serve in the military conflict. The second explanation suggests that Britain, which would benefit from the independence of the South American countries, sent San Mart\u00edn to achieve it. The third suggests that both wars were caused by the conflicts between Enlightenment ideas and absolutism, so San Mart\u00edn still waged the same war; the wars in the Americas only developed separatist goals after the Spanish [[Absolutist Restoration]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=33\u201350}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn was initiated in the [[Lodge of Rational Knights]] in 1811. They met at the house of [[Carlos Mar\u00eda de Alvear]], other members were [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]], Aldao, [[Manuel Blanco Encalada|Blanco Encalada]] and other ''[[criollo people|criollos]]'', American-born Spaniards. They agreed to return to their home lands and join the local revolutionary movements. San Mart\u00edn asked for his retirement from the military, and moved to Britain. He stayed in the country for a short time, and met many other South Americans at a lodge held at the house of Venezuelan general [[Francisco de Miranda]] at 27 Grafton Street (now 58 Grafton Way),<ref>{{cite book|last=Jaksic|first=Ivan|title=Andr\u00e9s Bello: Scholarship and Nation-Building in Nineteenth-Century Latin America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgZGGI7xreEC&pg=PA33|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-02759-5|page=33}}</ref> [[Bloomsbury]], London (the house now has a [[blue plaque]] with Miranda's name).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/francisco-de-miranda-blue-plaque | title=Francisco de Miranda Blue Plaque | publisher=londonremembers.com | accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> Then he sailed to Buenos Aires aboard the British frigate ''George Canning'', along with the South Americans Alvear, Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Vera and Mat\u00edas Zapiola, and the Spaniards Francisco Chilavert and Eduardo Kailitz. They arrived on 9 March 1812, to serve under the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=51\u201364}}\n\n== South America ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\n{{see also|Argentine War of Independence}}\n\nA few days after his arrival in Buenos Aires in the United Provinces (formally named the Argentine Republic in 1826), San Mart\u00edn was interviewed by the First Triumvirate. They appointed him a lieutenant colonel of cavalry, and asked him to create a cavalry unit, as Buenos Aires did not have good cavalry. He began to organize the [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]] with Alvear and Zapiola. As Buenos Aires lacked professional military leaders, San Mart\u00edn was entrusted with the protection of the whole city, but kept focused in the task of building the military unit.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=65\u201376}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn, Alvear and Zapiola established a local branch of the [[Lautaro Lodge|Lodge of Rational Knights]], along with morenists, the former supporters of the late [[Mariano Moreno]]. This lodge sought to promote liberal ideas; its secrecy hides whether it was a real [[Freemasonry|Masonic lodge]], or a lodge with political goals. It had no ties to the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]]. In September 1812, San Mart\u00edn married [[Mar\u00eda de los Remedios de Escalada]], a 14-year-old girl from one of the local wealthy families.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nThe lodge organized the [[Revolution of 8 October 1812]] when the terms of office of the triumvirs [[Manuel de Sarratea]] and [[Feliciano Chiclana]] ended. [[Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n]] promoted antimorenist new members, [[Manuel Obligado]] and [[Pedro Medrano]], by preventing the vote of three deputies and thus achieving a majority. As this caused a commotion, San Mart\u00edn and Alvear intervened with their military force, and the [[Buenos Aires Cabildo]] disestablished the triumvirate. It was replaced by the [[Second Triumvirate (Argentina)|Second Triumvirate]] of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Paso]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Pe\u00f1a]] and [[Antonio \u00c1lvarez Jonte]].{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|pp=498\u2013500}} The new triumvirate called the [[Assembly of the Year XIII]] and promoted San Mart\u00edn to colonel.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=85\u201389}}\n\n==== San Lorenzo ====\n\n{{main|Battle of San Lorenzo}}\n[[File:Cabral, soldado heroico.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the battle of San Lorenzo, featuring Juan Bautista Cabral when he saved San Mart\u00edn's life|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, trapped under his dead horse during the [[battle of San Lorenzo]], is saved by [[Juan Bautista Cabral]].]]\n\n[[Montevideo]], on the other shore of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata]], was still a royalist stronghold. [[Jos\u00e9 Rondeau]] laid siege to it, but the Montevidean navy eluded it by pillaging nearby cities. San Mart\u00edn was sent with the new Regiment to watch the activities in the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] shore.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=91}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=73}}\n\nThe Regiment followed the navy from a distance, avoiding detection. They hid in the [[San Carlos Convent]], in [[San Lorenzo, Santa Fe]]. San Mart\u00edn watched the enemy ships from the top of the convent during the night. The royalists disembarked at dawn, ready to pillage and the regiment charged into battle. San Mart\u00edn employed a [[pincer movement]] to trap the royalists. He led one column and [[Justo Berm\u00fadez]] the other.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=91}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=74}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn's horse was killed during the battle, and his leg was trapped under the corpse of the animal after the fall.

Oral tradition has it that the premiere took place on 14 May 1813 at the home of aristocrat [[Mariquita S\u00e1nchez|Mariquita S\u00e1nchez de Thompson]], with San Mart\u00edn also attending, but there is no documentary evidence of that.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=102}} The lyrics of the new anthem included several references to the secessionist will of the time.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=101\u2013104}}\n\nAlthough they were still allies, San Mart\u00edn began to distance himself from Alvear, who controlled the Assembly and the lodge. Alvear opposed the merchants and the Uruguayan [[caudillo]] [[Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas]], San Mart\u00edn thought that it was risky to open such conflicts when the royalists were still a threat. The [[Army of the North]], which was operating at the [[Upper Peru]], was defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Vilcapugio|Vilcapugio]] and [[Battle of Ayohuma|Ayohuma]], so the triumvirate appointed San Mart\u00edn to head it, replacing [[Manuel Belgrano]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=104\u2013110}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|pp=506\u2013507}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn and Belgrano met at the [[Yatasto relay]]. The army was in poor condition, and San Mart\u00edn initially refused to remove Belgrano from the army, as it would hurt the soldiers' morale. However, the supreme director Gervasio Posadas (who replaced the triumvirate in government) insisted, and San Mart\u00edn acted as instructed. San Mart\u00edn stayed only a few weeks in Tucum\u00e1n, reorganizing the army and studying the terrain. He also had a positive impression of the [[guerrilla war]] waged by [[Mart\u00edn Miguel de G\u00fcemes]] against the royalists,{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|p=537}} similar to the Peninsular War. It was a defensive war, and San Mart\u00edn trusted that they could prevent a royalist advance in Jujuy.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=111\u2013121}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|p=581}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn had health problems in April 1814, probably caused by [[hematemesis]]. He temporarily delegated the command of the Army to colonel [[Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cruz]] and requested leave to recover. He moved to [[Santiago del Estero]], and then to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] where he slowly recovered. During this time King [[Ferdinand VII]] returned to the throne, began the absolutist restoration and began to organize an attack on the rogue colonies. After an interview with [[Tom\u00e1s Guido]], San Mart\u00edn came up with a plan: organize an army in Mendoza, cross the Andes to Chile, and move to Peru by sea; all while G\u00fcemes defended the north frontier. This would place him in Peru without crossing the harsh terrain of [[Upper Peru]], where two campaigns had already been defeated. To advance this plan, he requested the governorship of the Cuyo province, which was accepted. He took office on 6 September.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=123\u2013130}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n==== Governor of Cuyo ====\n\n[[File:Ejercito de los Andes.jpg|thumb|alt=Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn passing review of the Army of the Andes|Training of the [[Army of the Andes]] at camp Plumerillo.]]\n\nThe absolutist restoration in Spain and the growing influence of Artigas generated a political crisis in Buenos Aires, forcing Posadas to resign. Alvear became the new Supreme Director, but had to resign after three months. San Mart\u00edn's plan was complicated as well by the [[Disaster of Rancagua]], a royalist victory that restored absolutism in Chile, ending the ''[[Patria Vieja]]'' period. San Mart\u00edn initially proposed a regular-sized army, simply to reinforce Chile, but changed to propose a larger one, to liberate the country from the occupation.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=131}} Chileans [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]], [[Luis Carrera]] and [[Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Erdo\u00edza|Manuel Rodr\u00edguez]], the leaders of the deposed Chilean rule, sought refugee in Cuyo, along with their armies. O'Higgins and Rodr\u00edguez were well received, but the [[Carrera family|Carrera brothers]] intended to act as a [[government in exile]]. They ignored the local laws of Cuyo, and their soldiers committed acts of vandalism. San Mart\u00edn imprisoned them and sent them to Buenos Aires. They proposed a plan to liberate Chile, different to the one outlined by San Mart\u00edn, who rejected it as impractical. This initiated a rivalry between the Carreras and San Mart\u00edn.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=212}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 7}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn began immediately to organize the [[Army of the Andes]]. He drafted all the citizens who could bear arms and all the slaves from ages 16 to 30, requested reinforcements to Buenos Aires, and reorganized the economy for [[War economy|war production]]. He took another leave to restore his health four months after taking power, so Alvear appointed [[Gregorio Perdriel]]. This appointment was resisted by the Mendoza Cabildo, which ratified San Mart\u00edn.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=133\u2013136}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|p=526}}\n\nThe government of San Mart\u00edn repeated some of the ideas outlined in the ''[[Operations plan]]'', drafted by [[Mariano Moreno]] at the beginning of the war. A combination of incentives, confiscations and [[planned economy]] allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, saltpeter, sulfur and borax, which had several uses and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers. Father [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Beltr\u00e1n]] headed a military factory of 700 men, which produced rifles and horseshoes. San Mart\u00edn stayed on good terms with both the government of Buenos Aires and the provincial ''caudillos'', without fully allying with either one. He was able to receive provisions from both. He considered that the war of independence took priority over the [[Argentine Civil Wars|civil wars]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=143\u2013156}}<ref>John Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions 1808\u20131826'' (2nd ed. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe army was not ready as of the summer of 1815, delaying the crossing. Given the harsh conditions on the mountains, the crossing could only be done in the summer season, when there is less snow. Buenos Aires did not send more provisions after the ousting of Alvear. San Mart\u00edn proposed to resign and serve under Balcarce, if they would support the campaign. San Mart\u00edn and Guido wrote a report in the autumn of 1816, detailing to the Supreme Director [[Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez de Balcarce]] the full military plan of operations.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=157\u2013163}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn proposed that the country declare independence immediately, before the crossing. That way, they would be acting as a sovereign nation, and not as a mere rebellion.{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|pp=548\u2013549}} He had great influence over the [[Congress of Tucum\u00e1n]], a Congress with deputies from the provinces, which was established in March 1816. He opposed the appointment of [[Jos\u00e9 Moldes]], a soldier from Salta who was against the policies of Buenos Aires, as he feared Moldes would break national unity. He rejected proposals to be appointed Supreme Director himself. He supported his friend and lodge member [[Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n]] for the office. Pueyrred\u00f3n resumed the military aid to Cuyo. The Congress of Tucum\u00e1n [[Argentine Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] on 9 July 1816.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=165\u2013178}} Congress discussed the type of government of the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] (modern Argentina). General Manuel Belgrano, who had made a diplomatic mission to Europe, informed them that independence would be more easily acknowledged by the European powers if the country established a monarchy. For this purpose, Belgrano proposed a [[Inca plan|plan]] to crown a noble of the [[Inca Empire]] as king (the [[Sapa Inca]] dynasty had been dethroned in the 16th century).{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. I|pp=549\u2013550}} San Mart\u00edn supported this proposal, as well as G\u00fcemes and most deputies, except for those from Buenos Aires, who undermined the project and prevented its approval.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=179\u2013189}}\n\nNeeding even more soldiers, San Mart\u00edn extended the [[Free negro|emancipation of slaves]] to the ages from 14 to 55, and even allowed them to be promoted to higher military ranks. He proposed a similar measure at the national level, but Pueyrred\u00f3n encountered severe resistance.  He included as well the Chileans who escaped Chile after the disaster of Rancagua, and organized them in four units, each one of infantry, cavalry, artillery and dragoons. At the end of 1816, the Army of the Andes had 5,000 men, 10,000 mules and 1,500 horses. San Martin organized [[military intelligence]], [[propaganda]] and [[disinformation]] to confuse the royalist armies (such as the specific routes taken in the Andes), boost the national fervor of his army and promote desertion among the royalists.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=191\u2013202}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=9\u201310}}\n\n==== Crossing of the Andes ====\n\n{{main|Crossing of the Andes}}\n[[File:Ejercito Libertador cruce de Cordillera de los andes.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of two riders on the top of a mountain|Generals Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (left) and [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] (right) during the [[crossing of the Andes]].]]\n\nAlthough the [[Congress of Tucum\u00e1n]] had already formalized the [[flag of Argentina]], the Army of the Andes did not use it, choosing a banner with two columns, light blue and white, and a coat of arms roughly similar to the [[Coat of arms of Argentina]].

The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, and that it had to be ready for combat right after the crossing. The army was divided in six [[Column (formation)|columns]], each taking a different path. Colonel [[Francisco Zelada]] in [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]] took the [[Come-Caballos pass]] towards [[Copiap\u00f3]]. [[Juan Manuel Cabot]], in [[San Juan Province, Argentina|San Juan]], moved to [[Coquimbo]]. [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Le\u00f3n Lemos]] led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. San Mart\u00edn, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the [[Paso de Los Patos|Los Patos pass]], and [[Juan Gregorio de Las Heras]] another one across the [[Uspallata Pass]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=206\u2013208}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nThe whole operation took nearly a month. The armies took [[Drying (food)|dried food]] for the soldiers and [[fodder]] for the horses, because of the inhospitable conditions.

He was supported in the south of the city and the countryside. The strategy was to occupy nearby villages, seize the royalists' weapons and flee. The attacks on Melipilla and San Fernando, and a failed one at Curic\u00f3, demoralized the royalists.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=214\u2013217}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 10}}\n\n=== Chile ===\n\n{{see also|Chilean War of Independence}}\n\n==== Battle of Chacabuco ====\n\n[[File:Battle of Chacabuco.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the battle of Chacabuco|The [[Battle of Chacabuco]] between the Army of the Andes and Spanish forces in 1817.]]\n{{main|Battle of Chacabuco}}\n\nThe columns that crossed the Andes began to take military actions. The column in the north led by Cabot defeated the royalists in Salala, seized Coquimbo and then Copiap\u00f3. In the south, [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]] captured [[Talca]]. Las Heras routed royalist outposts in Juncalito and Potrerillos.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=76\u201379}} [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who came from Los Patos pass, defeated the royalists at Las Coimas.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=81\u201382}} This allowed the main columns to gather at Aconcagua valley, meeting at the slopes of Chacabuco. Royalist commander [[Rafael Maroto]] converged his armies on that location as well. Maroto had 2,450 men and 5 pieces of artillery, San Mart\u00edn had 3,600 men and 9 pieces of artillery. The misdirection that concealed the path of the bulk of the Army allowed San Mart\u00edn this advantage, as other royalist forces were scattered in other regions of Chile.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=219\u2013220}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=84}}\n\nThe battle began on 12 February. San Mart\u00edn organized a pincer movement, with Soler leading the west column and O'Higgins the east one. O'Higgins, eager to avenge the defeat at Rancagua, rushed to the attack, instead of coordinating with Soler. This gave the royalists a brief advantage. San Mart\u00edn instructed Soler to rush the attack as well. The combined attack was successful and San Mart\u00edn's column secured the final victory. The battle ended with 600 royalists dead and 500 prisoners, with only 12 deaths and 120 injuries in the Army of the Andes.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=220\u2013221}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=85\u201392}}\n\nThe army triumphantly entered [[Santiago de Chile]] the following day.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=92}} Governor [[Francisco Marc\u00f3 del Pont]] attempted to escape to [[Valpara\u00edso]] and sail to Peru, but he was captured on 22 February and returned to Santiago.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=91\u201392}} Several other officials were captured as well and sent as prisoners to San Luis, Argentina.{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 18}} San Mart\u00edn sent Marc\u00f3 del Pont prisoner to Mendoza.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=221\u2013222}}\n\n==== Patria Nueva ====\n\n[[File:Ohiggins.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of Bernardo O'Higgins|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]], commander of the [[Army of the Andes]] along with San Mart\u00edn, and [[Supreme Director of Chile]] after the victory at [[battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]].]]\n\nThree deputies from Coquimbo, Santiago and Concepci\u00f3n organized a new government, and proposed San Mart\u00edn as [[Supreme Director of Chile]].

He did not have a good reception this time. Pueyrred\u00f3n thought that Chile should compensate Buenos Aires for the money invested in their liberation, as the support to San Mart\u00edn reduced the support to Belgrano, and the [[Second Portuguese-Brazilian invasion of the Eastern Bank|Portuguese-Brazilian invasion of the Eastern Bank]] menaced Buenos Aires. Incapable of financial support, Buenos Aires sent lawyer Manuel Aguirre to the United States, to request aid and acknowledge the declaration of independence. However, the mission failed, as the United States stayed neutral in the conflict because they negotiated the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|purchase of Florida]] with Spain. The Chilean [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] had obtained ships on his own after the disaster of Rancagua, which he intended to use to liberate Chile; but as San Mart\u00edn had already done that, he refused to place his fleet under the Army of the Andes. Carrera was an enemy of O'Higgins and sought to navigate to Chile and depose him, so Pueyrred\u00f3n imprisoned him, and confiscated his ships.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=227\u2013234}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn requested help from British Admiral [[William Bowles (Royal Navy officer)|William Bowles]]. He wrote from Chile and expected to find him in Buenos Aires, but Bowles had embarked for R\u00edo de Janeiro. Bowles considered that San Mart\u00edn was more trustworthy than Alvear, and praised his monarchism. San Mart\u00edn did not obtain the ships and interrupted the correspondence with Bowles for some months. He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in Buenos Aires with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either Buenos Aires or foreign powers, San Mart\u00edn promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=235\u2013246}}\n\n==== Battle of Cancha Rayada ====\n\n{{main|Second Battle of Cancha Rayada}}\n[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of the Chilean declaration of independence|The [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] took place on 18 February 1818, shortly before the battles of [[Second Battle of Cancha Rayada|Cancha Rayada]] and [[Battle of Maip\u00fa|Maip\u00fa]].]]\n\nThe failure to liberate Talcahuano was followed by naval reinforcements from the North. The viceroy of Peru sent [[Mariano Osorio]] in an attempt to reconquer Chile. The royalists would then advance by land from south to north towards Santiago. San Mart\u00edn thought that it was not possible to defend Concepci\u00f3n, so he ordered O'Higgins to leave the city. 50,000 Chileans took cattle and grain and moved north, burning everything else, so that they did not leave supplies for the royalists. As he had done with the Tucum\u00e1n Congress, San Mart\u00edn urged a declaration of independence, to legitimize the government and the military actions. The [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] was issued on 18 February 1818, one year after the battle of Chacabuco.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=247}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|p=102}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn, Las Heras and Balcarce met in [[Curic\u00f3]], and the royalists in [[Talca]], in a plain known as \"Cancha rayada\". As the patriots had a numeric advantage, 7,000 against 4,600, Osorio tried to avoid open battle, and tried instead a stealth operation. A spy informed San Mart\u00edn that Osorio would make a surprise attack in the night, but the army could not be prepared in time. 1,000 soldiers fled, 120 died, and San Mart\u00edn's assistant was killed. O'Higgins tried to resist with his unit, but retired when he was shot in the arm. Las Heras managed to retire his army in order, saving his 3,500 men. The patriots escaped to Santiago.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=247\u2013248}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=102\u2013107}}\n\nDespite the defeat, the soldiers were received as heroes in Santiago.

The patriot artillery on the right fired on the royalist infantry on the left. Manuel Escalada led mounted grenadiers to capture the royalist artillery, turning them against their owners. Burgos' regiment severely punished the patriot left wing, mainly composed of emancipated slaves, and took 400 lives. San Mart\u00edn ordered the mounted grenadiers led by [[Hilari\u00f3n de la Quintana]] to charge against the regiment. The firing suddenly ended and royalists began to fight with sword bayonets, under the cries \"Long live the king!\" and \"Long live the homeland!\" respectively. Finally, the royalists ended their cries and began to disperse.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=250\u2013251}}{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=108\u2013115}}\n\nWhen the regiment of Burgos realized that their line was broken, they stopped resisting, and the soldiers began to disperse. The cavalry pursued and killed most of them. At the end of the battle, the royalists had been trapped among the units of Las Heras in the west, Alvarado in the middle, Quintana in the east and the cavalries of Zapiola and Freire. Osorio tried to fall back to the hacienda \"Lo Espejo\" but could not reach it, so he tried to escape to Talcahuano.

He claimed \"Glory to the savior of Chile!\", in reference to San Mart\u00edn, who praised him for going to the battlefield with his unhealed wound. They made an embrace on their horses, now known as the \"Embrace of Maip\u00fa\".{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=251}}\n\nThe battle of Maip\u00fa secured Chilean independence.{{sfn|Camogli|de Privitellio|2005|pp=118\u2013119}} Except for Osorio, who escaped with 200 cavalry, all top royalist military leaders were captured. All their armed forces were either killed or captured, and all their artillery, weapons, military hospitals, money and resources were lost.

San Mart\u00edn could not have taken part in it, as he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=265\u2013267}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn was not well received in Buenos Aires. Pueyrred\u00f3n initially declined to give further help, citing the conflicts with the federal caudillos and the organization of a huge royalist army in C\u00e1diz that would try to reconquer the La Plata basin. He thought that Chile should organize the navy against Peru, not Buenos Aires. San Mart\u00edn discussed with him and finally got financing of 500,000 pesos. He returned to Mendoza with his wife and daughter and received a letter from Pueyrred\u00f3n, who said that Buenos Aires could only deliver one-third of the promised funds. This complicated the project, as neither Santiago de Chile nor Mendoza had the resources needed. San Mart\u00edn resigned from the Army, but it is unclear whether his decision to resign was sincere or was to apply pressure to his backers. The government of Buenos Aires still considered San Mart\u00edn vital to the national defense, so Pueyrred\u00f3n agreed to pay the 500,000 pesos requested, and encouraged San Mart\u00edn to withdraw his resignation.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=269\u2013277}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn proposed to mediate between Buenos Aires and the [[Liga Federal]] led by Artigas. He thought that the civil war was counter-productive to national unity, and that an end to hostilities would free resources needed for the navy. He calculated that Artigas might condition the peace on a joint declaration of war to colonial Brazil; so San Mart\u00edn proposed to defeat the royalists first and then demand the return of the [[Banda Oriental|Eastern Bank]] to the United Provinces. O'Higgins recommended caution, fearing that San Mart\u00edn might be captured. Pueyrred\u00f3n rejected the mediation, as he did not recognize Artigas as an equal to negotiate with him.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=279\u2013286}}\n\n==== Act of Rancagua ====\n\n[[File:Revista de Rancagua Blanes.JPG|thumb|alt=Portrait of a parade of the Army of the Andes|Parade of the Army of the Andes in Rancagua.]]\n\nAlthough Artigas was defeated by the Luso-Brazilian armies, his allies [[Estanislao L\u00f3pez]] and [[Francisco Ram\u00edrez (governor)|Francisco Ram\u00edrez]] continued hostilities against Buenos Aires for its inactivity against the invasion. Pueyrred\u00f3n called the Army of the Andes and the [[Army of the North]] (led by Belgrano) to aid Buenos Aires in the conflict. Guido noted to San Mart\u00edn that if both armies did that, the north of Argentina and Chile would be easily reconquered by the royalists. San Mart\u00edn also knew that most of the soldiers of the Army of the Andes would not be willing to aid Buenos Aires in the civil war, as most were from other provinces or from Chile. San Mart\u00edn had doubts as well about the projected arrival of a large military expedition from Spain, as the absolutist restoration of Ferdinand VII had met severe resistance in Spain. San Mart\u00edn finally kept the Army in Chile when Belgrano's lieutenant Viamonte signed an armistice with L\u00f3pez; he thought that the conflict had ended.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=287\u2013293}}\n\nHowever, the minister of war [[Mat\u00edas de Irigoyen]] ordered once more the return of the Army of the Andes, and appointed [[Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez de la Cruz]] as its leader, displacing San Mart\u00edn. San Mart\u00edn resigned again, and observed that the Army would not be able to cross the Andes from Chile to Buenos Aires because the winter snow was blocking the trails. All the leaders of the military units of the Army of the Andes refused to go to Buenos Aires, as their soldiers would mutiny or desert. Facing both the resignation of San Mart\u00edn and the refusals to obey the orders, the Supreme Director canceled the orders, and the Army of the Andes stayed in Chile. With the sanction of the [[Argentine Constitution of 1819]], Pueyrred\u00f3n ended his mandate as Supreme Director, replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Rondeau]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=293\u2013299}}\n\nThe navy was finally completed in Chile, and British Earl [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]] was appointed to lead it. But it was not sent to Peru immediately: there were still rumors of an attack from Spain, and if needed the navy would move to Buenos Aires and fight the Spanish ships. The civil war resumed and San Mart\u00edn attempted once more to mediate, to no effect. Rondeau again requested the return of the Army of the Andes, without success.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=301\u2013308}} San Mart\u00edn returned to Chile and prepared to take part in the naval actions against Peru, ignoring Buenos Aires.

The Army of the Andes had 4,000 soldiers instead, and Cochrane's navy another 1,600. With this disparity of forces, San Mart\u00edn tried to avoid battles. He tried instead to divide the enemy forces in several locations, as he did during the Crossing of the Andes, and trap the royalists with a pincer movement with either reinforcements of the [[Army of the North]] from the South or the army of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] from the North. He also tried to promote rebellions and insurrection within the royalist ranks, and promised the emancipation of any slaves that deserted their Peruvian masters and join the army of San Mart\u00edn. The spreading of the news of the [[Trienio Liberal|Liberal Triennium]], a liberal rebellion in Spain that reinstated the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], also sought to undermine royalist loyalty.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=334\u2013336}}\n\nThe navy sailed from Chile on 20 August 1820. It was composed of eight warships, eleven gunboats, 247 cannons and a crew of 1,600, most of them Chileans. There were 12 frigates, and a brig with the 4,000 soldiers of the Army of the Andes. San Mart\u00edn was the leader of the military expedition. They landed in [[Paracas Bay|Paracas]], 200&nbsp;km to the south of Lima, on 7 September, and occupied the nearby city of [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]], which was abandoned by the royalists.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=337}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 50}}\n\n==== Expedition of Peru ====\n\n[[File:El Batall\u00f3n Numancia recibe la Bandera del Ej\u00e9rcito Libertador.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of a battalion changing sides n a battle|The Numancia battalion, formerly a royalist unit, joins the forces of San Mart\u00edn.]]\n\nPeruvian viceroy [[Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela, 1st Marquis of Viluma|Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela]] had instructions from Spain to negotiate with the patriots. Under an armistice the opponents celebrated a meeting in [[Miraflores District, Lima|Miraflores]]. The viceroy's deputies proposed to adopt the liberal Spanish constitution if San Mart\u00edn left the country, but the patriots requested instead that Spain grant the independence of Peru. The negotiations did not bear fruit.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=338}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=49\u201353}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn isolated Lima from the surrounding countryside, and sent [[Juan Antonio \u00c1lvarez de Arenales]] to promote rebellions among the natives. The Army of the Andes moved north of Lima by sea. San Mart\u00edn and Arenales besieged the city from two directions, and Cochrane attacked the port of El Callao. Cochrane captured the ship \"Esmeralda\", and the royalist regiment Numancia. Nearly 700 expeditionary soldiers of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] deserted and joined the patriots. Several populations in the north of Peru supported San Mart\u00edn, and Arenales defeated the royalists at the [[Battle of Pasco]]. More than 300 royalists joined the patriots, including [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=339\u2013340}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=53\u201355}}\n\nHowever, the plans did not fully work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks,{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 55}} and the slaves did not join the army in the expected numbers. The Argentine provinces could not send the supporting army that San Mart\u00edn had requested earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, he wrote to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], trying to coordinate actions with him.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=341}}\n\nPezuela was deposed by a military-liberal coup, and [[Jos\u00e9 de la Serna e Hinojosa]] became the new viceroy. De la Serna called San Mart\u00edn to negotiate an end of hostilities. The result was the same than with Pezuela: De la Serna proposed to enact the 1812 Spanish constitution (Per\u00fa inside Spain), and San Mart\u00edn demanded the independence of Peru (with an independent monarchy). The rejection of the Spanish constitution was motivated by the disproportional representation of the Americas in the Constituent Assembly that wrote it. Both armies agreed a temporary armistice. San Mart\u00edn proposed to establish a [[constitutional monarchy]] with a European monarch, with a regency ruling in the interim. The proposal was rejected, on the grounds that they could not accept it without Ferdinand's approval.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=342\u2013347}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=58\u201359}}\n\n==== Protector of Peru ====\n\n[[File:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of San Mart\u00edn saluting the people of Peru|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn's proclamation of the independence of [[Peru]] on 28 July 1821 in [[Lima]].

However, De la Serna suddenly left the city with his army, for unknown reasons. San Mart\u00edn called for an [[open cabildo]] to discuss the independence of the country, which was agreed. With this approval, the authority in Lima, the support of the northern provinces and the port of El Callao under siege, San Mart\u00edn declared the independence of Peru on 28 July 1821. The war, however, had not ended yet.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=349\u2013353}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=59\u201363}}\n\nUnlike Chile, Peru had no local politicians of the stature of O'Higgins, so San Mart\u00edn became the leader of the government, even though he did not want to. He was appointed [[List of Presidents of Peru|Protector of Peru]]. As Peruvian society was highly conservative, San Mart\u00edn did not take the liberal ideas too far immediately. The provisional statutes contained few changes and ratified several existing laws.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=353\u2013358}} All the types of servitude imposed on the natives, such as [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] and [[Yanaconas|yanaconazgo]], were abolished, and the natives received citizenship. He did not abolish slavery completely, as Peru had 40,000 slaveowners, and declared \"[[freedom of wombs]]\" instead, which emancipated the sons of slaves; he emancipated as well the slaves of the royalists who left Lima. He also abolished the [[Inquisition]] and corporal punishment, and enacted [[freedom of speech]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=359\u2013368}} During his stay in Peru, San Mart\u00edn had a romance with [[Rosa Campuzano]], a woman from Guayaquil.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=381\u2013383}}\n\nThe royalist armies that stayed in the Peruvian countryside headed to Lima, led by Canterac. In a confusing episode, there was no battle, as neither one attacked. Canterac changed his path to El Callao, took resources from it, and returned to his base. There was no battle during their return either. Without resources, El Callao surrendered in a few days.{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=64\u201366}} Both armies took inadvisable actions: San Mart\u00edn allowed Canterac to receive reinforcements, and Canterac left a key military objective incapable to resist. There is no known documentation that provides a reasonable explanation of those events.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=369\u2013371}}\n\nCochrane had several disputes with San Mart\u00edn.{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II, p. 67}} He discussed several of his actions and tried to bypass his authority. During the blockade of El Callao, he proposed that O'Higgins take control of the mission and send any spoils of battle to Chile. As San Mart\u00edn was appointed Protector of Peru, Cochrane reasoned that San Mart\u00edn was no longer under Chilean command, and took the navy away. In later years Cochrane made accusations against San Mart\u00edn in Chile.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=372\u2013383}}\n\nBol\u00edvar took control of Caracas with his victory at the [[battle of Carabobo]], and the [[Congress of C\u00facuta]] issued laws similar to those in Per\u00fa. [[Ecuadorian War of Independence|Guayaquil declared independence]], and Bol\u00edvar sent [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] to reinforce them. Sucre's forces were not enough, and requested help from San Mart\u00edn. Peru sent a military force of 1,300 men. Bol\u00edvar entered the city a month later, and claimed that for historical reasons Quito should be part of Colombia.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|p=383\u2013385}} San Mart\u00edn and Bol\u00edvar sought to generate [[Latin American integration]], but disagreed on the type of government: Bol\u00edvar proposed a republic, and San Mart\u00edn a constitutional monarchy, reasoning that it would be easier to receive international recognition for the now-independent South American nations.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=387\u2013395}} Peru and Colombia signed a treaty of integration, to be proposed to [[Chile]], the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and [[Paraguay]], and at a later point to the [[United Provinces of Central America]] and the [[Empire of Brazil]].{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=397\u2013406}}\n\n=== Guayaquil conference ===\n\n{{main|Guayaquil conference}}\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of San Martin and Bol\u00edvar talking|The [[Guayaquil conference]] between [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn.

Both liberators would meet in Quito, so San Mart\u00edn appointed Torre Tagle to manage the government during his absence. Bol\u00edvar was unable to meet San Mart\u00edn at the arranged date, so San Mart\u00edn returned to Lima, but still left Tagle in government. Bol\u00edvar moved from Quito to Guayaquil, which secured its independence. There were discussions on the future of the region: some factions wanted to join Colombia, others to join Peru, and others to become a new nation. Bol\u00edvar ended the discussion by annexing Guayaquil into Colombia. There was Peruvian pressure on San Mart\u00edn to do a similar thing, to annex Guayaquil to Peru.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=407\u2013409}}\n\nThe [[Guayaquil conference]] took place on 26 July 1822. They had two private meetings, on that day and the following one. As there were no witnesses or minutes, the content of their discussions can only be inferred from their later actions and their letters to other people. Some likely topics of discussion may have been a request of reinforcements, and an offer to combine the armies into a single one, with San Mart\u00edn ranked second to Bol\u00edvar.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=407\u2013421}}{{sfn|Abad de Santill\u00e1n|1965|loc=Vol. II|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nThe minister [[Bernardo Monteagudo]] was removed from office by a Peruvian rebellion, during San Mart\u00edn's absence. San Mart\u00edn resigned as Protector of Peru a few days later and returned to [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile. Several reasons influenced him to resign. The military discipline of the Army of the Andes was compromised, but San Mart\u00edn was reluctant to take drastic action against his officers. The authority of San Mart\u00edn and Bol\u00edvar, and the local rivalry of their respective countries Peru and Colombia, limited their options for joint work: Colombians would not have liked Bol\u00edvar to give many of his forces to San Mart\u00edn, whilst Peruvians would not have liked their Protector to be second in command to Bol\u00edvar, and a joint command would complicate the maintenance of military discipline. Unlike Bol\u00edvar, backed up by the Colombian government, San Mart\u00edn did not have more resources than those he already had: Buenos Aires denied him any support, the other Argentine governors (such as [[Juan Bautista Bustos]]) supported him but did not have resources to provide, O'Higgins was about to be deposed in Chile, and Cochrane took the navy and left him without naval power. Finally, he felt that only a very strong authority would be able to prevent [[balkanization]], but refused to rule as a dictator himself.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=423\u2013437}}\n\n== Later life ==\n\n{{main|Later life of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn}}\n[[File:Jose de San Martin.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo of an aged Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|General San Mart\u00edn in Paris, 1848.]]\n\nAfter his retirement, San Mart\u00edn intended to live in [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]]. Although the war of independence had ended in the region, the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] continued. The [[Unitarian Party|unitarians]] wanted to organize the country as a [[unitary state]] centered on [[Buenos Aires]], and the [[Federalist Party (Argentina)|federalists]] preferred a [[federation]] of provinces. San Mart\u00edn had good relations with the federal ''[[caudillo]]s'' and a personal feud with unitarian leader [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], but tried to stay neutral. San Mart\u00edn's wife, [[Mar\u00eda de los Remedios de Escalada]], died in 1823, so he returned to Buenos Aires. He took his daughter Mercedes Tomasa, who was living with her mother's family, and sailed to Europe.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=453\u2013465}}\n\nAfter a failed attempt to settle in France, he moved to Britain and then to the capital of present-day Belgium, [[Brussels]], where he settled. He intended to live there until Mercedes completed her education and then return to Argentina. Rivadavia visited Brussels and San Mart\u00edn intended to challenge him to a duel, but was dissuaded by Diego Paroissien.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=467\u2013476}}\n\nDespite his feud with Rivadavia, who was appointed [[President of Argentina]], San Mart\u00edn offered his military services in the [[Argentine-Brazilian War|War with Brazil]], but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal [[Manuel Dorrego]], and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in [[R\u00edo de Janeiro]] he was informed that the unitarian [[Juan Lavalle]] had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Mart\u00edn did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable to put down the federal rebellion against him, and offered San Mart\u00edn the government. San Mart\u00edn declined and returned to Brussels.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=477\u2013495}}\n\nBy this time the federal [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] had begun to pacify the civil war started by Lavalle and earned San Mart\u00edn's admiration. They began to exchange friendly letters. The [[Belgian Revolution]] and the [[cholera epidemic of 1831]] made San Mart\u00edn leave Brussels and move to Paris, where both San Mart\u00edn and his daughter became ill. They were helped by [[Mariano Balcarce]]. Mariano married Mercedes, and they had a daughter, Mar\u00eda Mercedes.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=497\u2013521}}\n\nIn 1837 France began a [[French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata|blockade of the Rio de la Plata]] against Rosas. San Mart\u00edn offered his military services to Rosas, which was declined because of San Mart\u00edn's advanced age, and condemned the role of the unitarians in that conflict, as they had allied themselves with France against their own nation. San Mart\u00edn bequeathed his [[Curved saber of San Mart\u00edn|curved saber]] to Rosas, because of his successful defense of the country. The conflict between France and Argentina renewed in the [[Anglo-French blockade of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], which San Mart\u00edn condemned as well.

He was almost blind and had many health problems because of his advanced age, but continued to write letters and keep in touch with the news from South America. Shortly after receiving the news of the Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade, he died, three o'clock on 17 August 1850.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=559\u2013570}}\n\n== Remains ==\n\n[[File:SanMartinMausoleum.JPG|thumb|alt=Photo of San Mart\u00edn's mausoleum|Mausoleum of San Mart\u00edn at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]].

He requested in his will to be taken to the cemetery without any [[funeral]], and to be moved to Buenos Aires thereafter. Balcarce informed Rosas and the foreign minister [[Felipe Arana]] of San Mart\u00edn's death. Balcarce oversaw the [[embalming]] of his remains and their temporary stay in a chapel of the city. He also sent San Martin's saber to Rosas.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=569\u2013574}}\n\nHowever, the rebellion of [[Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza]] against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat at the [[battle of Caseros]] and the resulting chaos delayed the move of San Mart\u00edn's remains to Buenos Aires. Still, both Rosas and Urquiza organized public homages to San Mart\u00edn, despite the conflict. Buenos Aires seceded from Argentina as the [[state of Buenos Aires]], dominated by Unitarians who despised San Mart\u00edn. Thus, the move of his remains was postponed indefinitely. Aware that there were no favorable conditions for the project, Balcarce arranged a creation of a tomb in the Boulogne-sur-Mer cemetery.{{sfn|Galasso|2000|pp=574\u2013577}}\n\nSan Mart\u00edn's remains were finally repatriated on 29 May 1880, during the presidency of [[Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda]].
