The structure was planned in the wake of [[History of flooding in Canada#1948 Fraser River flood|devastating floods]] in a time of rapidly growing power demand, and if built, would have powered the largest [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] facility in North America. After a protracted environmental battle, Moran Dam was defeated in 1972, mainly over concerns of its adverse impact on [[salmon]] populations in the Fraser River basin. The shelving of the project also influenced cancellation of other hydro developments along the river, and today the Fraser remains one of the most productive salmon fisheries on the continent.\n\n==Proposal==\nAs early as 1934, the Moran Canyon site was identified as an excellent location for a large hydroelectric dam.<ref>Evenden, p. 186</ref> During the dam-building era of the mid-20th century,<ref name=\"encyclopediaofcn\" /> up to five major hydropower projects were proposed on the [[main stem]] of the Fraser River. The largest of these, a dam near the railway point of [[Moran, British Columbia|Moran]], some {{convert|20|km|mi}} upstream of [[Lillooet, British Columbia|Lillooet]], was put forth by the [[Moran Development Corporation]] (MDC).<ref>Evenden, p. 183</ref> This [[United States|American]] firm put forth US$500 million in 1952 to finance the construction of the dam, which would have been the tallest in the world.<ref name=\"blurb\" /> The Fraser River was favoured over other large rivers in BC, such as the [[Columbia River|Columbia]] or [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace]], because of its relative proximity to urban centres like [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]].<ref>Evenden, p. 192</ref>\n\nThe dam would have been {{convert|261|m|ft}} high, generating as much power on average as [[Grand Coulee Dam]] and two [[Hoover Dam]]s combined. Much of this energy would have been sold to the northwestern United States.<ref name=\"Mekonglesson\" /> It would form a gigantic reservoir {{convert|260|km|mi}} long, containing some {{convert|35.4|km3|acre.ft}} of water at maximum pool,<ref name=\"Evenden214\">Evenden, p. 214</ref> reaching almost to the city of [[Quesnel, British Columbia|Quesnel]].<ref name=\"blurb\"/> A significant portion of this capacity would be reserved for flood control as the dam had been proposed in the wake of major floods that occurred just three years before then, in 1948.<ref>McGillivray, p. 160</ref> The BC government gave MDC clearance to begin preliminary work at the site in 1955. However, MDC lacked the funds to build such a gigantic dam and to acquire all the lands that would be flooded under the reservoir, and a rival company, [[BC Electric]] (today part of [[BC Hydro]]), acquired similar rights to the site that same year.<ref>Evenden, p. 193</ref>\n\n==Controversy and defeat==\n{{Rquote|left|\u2026the economic cost of destroyed salmon runs would make the power produced by Moran Dam too expensive.|from ''Salmon Without Rivers: A History of the Pacific Salmon Crisis''<ref>Lichatowich and Lichatowich, p. 196</ref>}}\n\nMoran Dam's tremendous height would make artificial fish passage nearly impossible, and would thus cut off a large portion of the Fraser's prodigious runs of [[Pacific salmon]] and [[steelhead trout]].<ref name=\"BCHydro\" /> During the later 1950s and 1960s, determined opposition from environmentalists including [[Roderick Haig-Brown]],<ref>{{cite web\n| author     = Hume, Mark\n| url        = http://www.oakbay.sd61.bc.ca/staff/salexander/courses/socials-10/documents/no.10_roderick_haig_brown.pdf\n| title      = Roderick Haig-Brown: Before Greenpeace, before Suzuki, he defined conservationist\n| publisher  = Bell Globemedia\n| work       =\n| date       = 2005-04-03\n| accessdate = 2011-06-25}}</ref> fishermen and others stalled the project, citing that the dam would block access to over 70% of [[anadromous fish]] spawning habitat in the Fraser basin.

Much of this energy would have been sold to the northwestern United States.<ref name=\"Mekonglesson\" /> It would form a gigantic reservoir {{convert|260|km|mi}} long, containing some {{convert|35.4|km3|acre.ft}} of water at maximum pool,<ref name=\"Evenden214\">Evenden, p. 214</ref> reaching almost to the city of [[Quesnel, British Columbia|Quesnel]].<ref name=\"blurb\"/> A significant portion of this capacity would be reserved for flood control as the dam had been proposed in the wake of major floods that occurred just three years before then, in 1948.<ref>McGillivray, p. 160</ref> The BC government gave MDC clearance to begin preliminary work at the site in 1955. However, MDC lacked the funds to build such a gigantic dam and to acquire all the lands that would be flooded under the reservoir, and a rival company, [[BC Electric]] (today part of [[BC Hydro]]), acquired similar rights to the site that same year.<ref>Evenden, p. 193</ref>\n\n==Controversy and defeat==\n{{Rquote|left|\u2026the economic cost of destroyed salmon runs would make the power produced by Moran Dam too expensive.|from ''Salmon Without Rivers: A History of the Pacific Salmon Crisis''<ref>Lichatowich and Lichatowich, p. 196</ref>}}\n\nMoran Dam's tremendous height would make artificial fish passage nearly impossible, and would thus cut off a large portion of the Fraser's prodigious runs of [[Pacific salmon]] and [[steelhead trout]].<ref name=\"BCHydro\" /> During the later 1950s and 1960s, determined opposition from environmentalists including [[Roderick Haig-Brown]],<ref>{{cite web\n| author     = Hume, Mark\n| url        = http://www.oakbay.sd61.bc.ca/staff/salexander/courses/socials-10/documents/no.10_roderick_haig_brown.pdf\n| title      = Roderick Haig-Brown: Before Greenpeace, before Suzuki, he defined conservationist\n| publisher  = Bell Globemedia\n| work       =\n| date       = 2005-04-03\n| accessdate = 2011-06-25}}</ref> fishermen and others stalled the project, citing that the dam would block access to over 70% of [[anadromous fish]] spawning habitat in the Fraser basin.

He is best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the prestigious [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the West End in London, and then later taken to both New Zealand and to Broadway in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' in which he performed and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nIn the mid-'60s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the TV series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E.

Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary right-wing city gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> The \"[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]\" sketch was co-written by the four writers/performers of the series.<ref name=\"BrightRoss2001\">{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}</ref> The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Tim Brooke-Taylor and John Cleese, from ''At Last the 1948 Show'', was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the Monty Python style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch where Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of [[John Cleese]] and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches mentions John Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD with the title of ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]], however the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]] (and [[Bill Oddie]] joining the series for the second season).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", this series was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe also appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a public information film for the now-defunct E111 form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (His scene was the final one filmed for the movie). After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nTim appeared, with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden, in the [[Amnesty International]] show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' (during which they sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\"), and also appeared in the Amnesty International show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in the sketches \"Top of the Form\" (with John Cleese, Graham Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and \"Cha Cha Cha\" (with John Cleese and Graham Chapman).\n\nBrooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, and Bill Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with their song \"Funky Gibbon\". Brooke-Taylor also appeared with Graeme Garden in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' which started in 1972, and Tim still appears regularly. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGraeme Garden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Tim Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in usual game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He has appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. Around 1982, he branched out into pantomime as the Dame in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He is also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books based mainly on his radio and television work and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. He also took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]). Brooke-Taylor appeared on the premiere episode of the [[BBC]] golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrooke-Taylor married Christine Weadon in 1968 and they have two sons, Ben and Edward.<ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}</ref><ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}</ref> He lived in Berkshire.<ref>Old Wykehamist Record.</ref>\n\nBrooke-Taylor was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.<ref name=LG59808>{{London Gazette|issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=12 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/13455/obes_all_round...|title=OBEs all round...|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9510000/9510621.stm|title=BBC News - Today - Graeme Garden 'thought OBE letter was a bill'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8568812/Birthday-Honours-List-2011-in-pictures.html?image=6|title=Birthday Honours List 2011 in pictures|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/goodies-pair-thrilled-with-obes-16010736.html|title=Goodies pair 'thrilled' with OBEs|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nHe died from Covid-19 on 12 April 2020.<ref name=BBCDeath/>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Show/Film\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1968\n| ''[[One Man Band (unfinished film)|One Man Band]]''\n|  Reporter / Young aristocrat\n| Uncompleted/unreleased\n|-\n| 1969\n| ''[[The Thirteen Chairs]]''\n| Jackie\n|\n|-\n| 1971\n| ''[[The Statue (1971 film)|The Statue]]''\n| Hillcrest\n| \n|-\n| 1971\n| ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''\n| Computer Scientist\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1976\n| ''[[Pleasure at Her Majesty's]]''\n| Tim (with ''[[The Goodies]]'')\n| \n|-\n| 1981\n| ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''\n| Various\n|\n|-\n| 1988\n| ''Under the Bed''\n| Bin Man\n|\n|-\n|1989\n| ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight (film)|Asterix and the Big Fight]]''\n| Cacofonix\n| (English version, voice)\n|}\n\n===Television===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Show/Film\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1966\n| ''[[The Wednesday Play]]''\n| Uncredited role\n| Episode: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''\n|-\n| 1967\u201368\n| ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''\n| Various characters\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1968\n| ''[[How to Irritate People]]''\n| Various characters\n| Also a writer\n|-\n| 1968\u201369\n| ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]''\n| Various characters\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1968\u201369\n| ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]''\n| Various characters\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1970\u201382\n| ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''\n| Tim\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1976\u201379\n| ''[[Hello Cheeky]]''\n| Himself\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1983\u201384\n| ''[[Bananaman (TV series)|Bananaman]]''\n| Various voices\n| \n|-\n| 1984\u201388\n| ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]''\n| Derek Yates\n|\n|-\n| 1987\u201388\n| ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]''\n| Tom Hammond\n| \n|-\n| 1989\n| ''[[Barney (UK TV series)|Barney]]''\n| Barney (voice)\n|\n|-\n| 1992\n| ''[[The Upper Hand]]''\n| Trevor\n| Episode: Blind Date\n|-\n| 1997\n| ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''\n| Derek\n| Episode: Endgame\n|-\n| 1999\n| ''{{sortname|The|Nearly Complete and Utter History of Everything|The Nearly Complete and Utter History of Everything (film)}}''\n| Various characters\n| \n|-\n| 2004\n| ''Beat the Nation''\n| Quiz Co-Host\n| Co-Host with [[Graeme Garden]]\n|-\n| 2005\n| ''[[Absolute Power (comedy)|Absolute Power]]''\n| Peter Harrow\n| \n|-\n| 2005-2009\n| ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]''\n| Ronnie Smethers\n| Guest role\n|-\n| 2008\n| ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple]]''\n| Dr Edward Humbleby\n| Episode: 'Murder is Easy'\n|-\n| 2009\n| ''[[Horne and Corden]]''\n| Vicar\n| \n|-\n| 2010\u201311\n| ''[[Little Howard's Big Question]]''\n| Various characters\n| \n|-\n| 2013\n| ''Animal Antics''\n| Co-Host\n| \n|-\n| 2015\n| ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]''\n| Graham Parsons\n| Series 17: 132.

He is best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He had also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and has been a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for over 40 years.\n\nBrooke-Taylor was confirmed to have died on 12 April 2020 after contracting the Covid-19 virus.<ref name=BBCDeath>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52262490]  Tim Brooke-Taylor dies with coronavirus, aged 79, BBC</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read Economics and Politics before changing to read Law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the prestigious [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'' was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run, that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and the revue transferred to the West End in London, and then later taken to both New Zealand and to Broadway in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> He was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' in which he performed and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.  Other members of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' were [[John Cleese]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]], [[David Hatch]] and [[Jo Kendall]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nIn the mid-'60s, Brooke-Taylor performed in the TV series ''On the Braden Beat'' with Canadian [[Bernard Braden]], taking over the slot recently vacated by [[Peter Cook]] in his guise as [[E.

Brooke-Taylor played a reactionary right-wing city gent who believed he was the soul of tolerance.\n\nIn 1967, Brooke-Taylor became a writer/performer on the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> The \"[[Four Yorkshiremen sketch|Four Yorkshiremen]]\" sketch was co-written by the four writers/performers of the series.<ref name=\"BrightRoss2001\">{{Cite book\n|author1=Morris Bright\n|author2=Robert Ross\n|title=Fawlty Towers: fully booked\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AH-FAAAAIAAJ\n|accessdate=29 September 2010\n|year=2001\n|publisher=BBC\n|isbn=978-0-563-53439-6\n|page=60}}</ref> The sketch was one of the few which survived the destruction of the series (by the tapes being wiped), by [[David Frost]]'s Paradine Productions (which produced the series), and the sketch appears on the DVD of ''At Last the 1948 Show''. Footage of Tim Brooke-Taylor and John Cleese, from ''At Last the 1948 Show'', was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in Frost's pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the Monty Python style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, notably the job interview sketch where Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also notable as the first collaboration of [[John Cleese]] and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches mentions John Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nIn 1968\u201369, Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD with the title of ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]], however the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]] (and [[Bill Oddie]] joining the series for the second season).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", this series was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a huge television success, running for over a decade on both BBC TV and (in its final year) UK commercial channel [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of the Goodies, Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced by the UK commercial franchise [[Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe also appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a public information film for the now-defunct E111 form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971, he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'' (His scene was the final one filmed for the movie). After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nTim appeared, with Bill Oddie and Graeme Garden, in the [[Amnesty International]] show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' (during which they sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\"), and also appeared in the Amnesty International show ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' in the sketches \"Top of the Form\" (with John Cleese, Graham Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and \"Cha Cha Cha\" (with John Cleese and Graham Chapman).\n\nBrooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, and Bill Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with their song \"Funky Gibbon\". Brooke-Taylor also appeared with Graeme Garden in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' which started in 1972, and Tim still appears regularly. On 18 February 1981 Brooke-Taylor was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nGraeme Garden was a regular team captain on the political satire game show ''If I Ruled the World''. Tim Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode, and, during the game \"I Couldn't Disagree More\" he proposed that it was high time ''The Goodies'' episodes were repeated. Garden was obliged by the rules of the game to rebut this statement, and replied \"I couldn't disagree more... it was time to repeat them ten, fifteen years ago.\" This was followed by uproarious applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in usual game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He has appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. Around 1982, he branched out into pantomime as the Dame in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He is also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books based mainly on his radio and television work and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. He also took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]). Brooke-Taylor appeared on the premiere episode of the [[BBC]] golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrooke-Taylor married Christine Weadon in 1968 and they have two sons, Ben and Edward.<ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}</ref><ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}</ref> He lived in Berkshire.<ref>Old Wykehamist Record.</ref>\n\nBrooke-Taylor was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.<ref name=LG59808>{{London Gazette|issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=12 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/13455/obes_all_round...|title=OBEs all round...|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9510000/9510621.stm|title=BBC News - Today - Graeme Garden 'thought OBE letter was a bill'}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8568812/Birthday-Honours-List-2011-in-pictures.html?image=6|title=Birthday Honours List 2011 in pictures|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/goodies-pair-thrilled-with-obes-16010736.html|title=Goodies pair 'thrilled' with OBEs|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nHe died from Covid-19 on 12 April 2020.<ref name=BBCDeath/>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Show/Film\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1968\n| ''[[One Man Band (unfinished film)|One Man Band]]''\n|  Reporter / Young aristocrat\n| Uncompleted/unreleased\n|-\n| 1969\n| ''[[The Thirteen Chairs]]''\n| Jackie\n|\n|-\n| 1971\n| ''[[The Statue (1971 film)|The Statue]]''\n| Hillcrest\n| \n|-\n| 1971\n| ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''\n| Computer Scientist\n| Uncredited\n|-\n| 1976\n| ''[[Pleasure at Her Majesty's]]''\n| Tim (with ''[[The Goodies]]'')\n| \n|-\n| 1981\n| ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''\n| Various\n|\n|-\n| 1988\n| ''Under the Bed''\n| Bin Man\n|\n|-\n|1989\n| ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight (film)|Asterix and the Big Fight]]''\n| Cacofonix\n| (English version, voice)\n|}\n\n===Television===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" ;\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Show/Film\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1966\n| ''[[The Wednesday Play]]''\n| Uncredited role\n| Episode: ''[[Cathy Come Home]]''\n|-\n| 1967\u201368\n| ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]''\n| Various characters\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1968\n| ''[[How to Irritate People]]''\n| Various characters\n| Also a writer\n|-\n| 1968\u201369\n| ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]''\n| Various characters\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1968\u201369\n| ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]''\n| Various characters\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1970\u201382\n| ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''\n| Tim\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1976\u201379\n| ''[[Hello Cheeky]]''\n| Himself\n| Wrote for the series\n|-\n| 1983\u201384\n| ''[[Bananaman (TV series)|Bananaman]]''\n| Various voices\n| \n|-\n| 1984\u201388\n| ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]''\n| Derek Yates\n|\n|-\n| 1987\u201388\n| ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]''\n| Tom Hammond\n| \n|-\n| 1989\n| ''[[Barney (UK TV series)|Barney]]''\n| Barney (voice)\n|\n|-\n| 1992\n| ''[[The Upper Hand]]''\n| Trevor\n| Episode: Blind Date\n|-\n| 1997\n| ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]''\n| Derek\n| Episode: Endgame\n|-\n| 1999\n| ''{{sortname|The|Nearly Complete and Utter History of Everything|The Nearly Complete and Utter History of Everything (film)}}''\n| Various characters\n| \n|-\n| 2004\n| ''Beat the Nation''\n| Quiz Co-Host\n| Co-Host with [[Graeme Garden]]\n|-\n| 2005\n| ''[[Absolute Power (comedy)|Absolute Power]]''\n| Peter Harrow\n| \n|-\n| 2005-2009\n| ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]''\n| Ronnie Smethers\n| Guest role\n|-\n| 2008\n| ''[[Agatha Christie's Marple]]''\n| Dr Edward Humbleby\n| Episode: 'Murder is Easy'\n|-\n| 2009\n| ''[[Horne and Corden]]''\n| Vicar\n| \n|-\n| 2010\u201311\n| ''[[Little Howard's Big Question]]''\n| Various characters\n| \n|-\n| 2013\n| ''Animal Antics''\n| Co-Host\n| \n|-\n| 2015\n| ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]''\n| Graham Parsons\n| Series 17: 132.

Their names are a [[pun]] on the name of the 18th-century cabinet maker and furniture designer [[Thomas Chippendale]]. This was suggested by [[Bill \"Tex\" Henson]], a story artist at the studio.\n\nOf the two, Chip is portrayed as being safe, focused, and having a mind for logical scheming.  Dale, by contrast, is more laid-back, dim-witted, and impulsive, and has a very strong sense of humor.  Originally the two had a very similar appearance, but as a way to tell them apart, some differences were introduced: Chip has a small black nose and two centered protruding teeth, whereas Dale has a large dark red nose and a prominent [[diastema|gap]] between his [[incisor|buckteeth]].  Chip is also depicted as having smooth hair on top of his head while Dale's tends to be ruffled.\n\nIn most cartoons, they are antagonists against [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], [[Mickey Mouse]], or most often, [[Donald Duck]]. They were given their own series in the 1950s, but only three cartoons resulted under their name: ''Chicken in the Rough'' (1951), ''Two Chips and a Miss'' (1952) and ''The Lone Chipmunks'' (1954). The duo was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] three times in four years: in 1946 for ''[[Squatter's Rights]]'' (against Mickey and Pluto), in 1947 for ''[[Chip an' Dale]]'' and in 1949 for ''[[Toy Tinkers]]'' (both against [[Donald Duck]]).  \n\n==List of Chip 'n' Dale shorts==\nChip and Dale appear in the following 23 [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[short film]]s.

The scene, \"Acme's Funeral\", however, was cut from the final film. Storyboard artwork for this sequence survives, where they can be seen alongside characters such as [[Goofy]], [[Horace Horsecollar]], [[Clarabelle Cow]], [[Popeye]], [[Bluto]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]] and [[Droopy]]. [http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2011/08/02/from-the-jhm-archives-scenes-that-were-cut-out-of-quot-who-framed-roger-rabbit-quot.aspx]\n\nChip 'n' Dale occasionally appeared in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. They can also be spotted in the 1983 featurette ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' where they are seen dancing to the music inside Fezziwigs. They also appear at all the Disney Parks as well. In the new Mickey Mouse episode \"Space Walkies\", they made a brief cameo as they were being chased by Pluto.\n\n===Goofy Gophers===\nA recurring [[shtick]] often mistakenly attributed to Chip 'n' Dale is the characters' alleged use of politeness: \"After you,\" \u2026 \"No, I insist, after you!\" This gag, from the early-1900s [[Alphonse and Gaston]] comic strip, is used by another studio's characters: Warner Bros' [[Goofy Gophers|Mac and Tosh]] as the [[Goofy Gophers]]. However, in the 1950 short \"Out on a Limb,\" Chip 'n' Dale do engage in a round of this (possibly in reference to the Goofy Gophers) before Chip stops it from getting out of hand with a swift kick to Dale's rear end.\n\n===Voice actors===\nThe classic voices of Chip 'n' Dale were mostly provided by [[Helen Silbert]] and [[Dessie Flynn]], and [[Dessie Miller]], and [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]]. The earliest voices were provided by female office staff, without credit. In \"Private Pluto\" the chipmunks' speech was created by speeding up sound clips of normal speech. In a number of the shorts that followed, many of these same sound clips were used again, though later shorts used dialogue specifically recorded for that short.\n\nAt one point in \"Winter Storage\", Chip and Dale get into an argument while caught in a trap. When the scene switches to an outside view of the box (with Donald Duck sitting on the box) the dialogue being heard is actually a sped up segment of the voice-over narration from the Goofy short \"A Knight for a Day\".\n\nSince 1988, Chip has been voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]] and Dale has been voiced by [[Corey Burton]].\n\n==Video games==\n*Chip 'n' Dale appear in a ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (video game)|Rescue Rangers]]'' spin-off video game that was produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Capcom in 1990.

They help develop new technology for the heroes such as the Gummi Ship and Gummi phone.

Their names are a [[pun]] on the name of the 18th-century cabinet maker and furniture designer [[Thomas Chippendale]]. This was suggested by [[Bill \"Tex\" Henson]], a story artist at the studio.\n\nOf the two, Chip is portrayed as being safe, focused, and having a mind for logical scheming.  Dale, by contrast, is more laid-back, dim-witted, and impulsive, and has a very strong sense of humor.  Originally the two had a very similar appearance, but as a way to tell them apart, some differences were introduced: Chip has a small black nose and two centered protruding teeth, whereas Dale has a large dark red nose and a prominent [[diastema|gap]] between his [[incisor|buckteeth]].  Chip is also depicted as having smooth hair on top of his head while Dale's tends to be ruffled.\n\nIn most cartoons, they are antagonists against [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], [[Mickey Mouse]], or most often, [[Donald Duck]]. They were given their own series in the 1950s, but only three cartoons resulted under their name: ''Chicken in the Rough'' (1951), ''Two Chips and a Miss'' (1952) and ''The Lone Chipmunks'' (1954). The duo was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] three times in four years: in 1946 for ''[[Squatter's Rights]]'' (against Mickey and Pluto), in 1947 for ''[[Chip an' Dale]]'' and in 1949 for ''[[Toy Tinkers]]'' (both against [[Donald Duck]]).  \n\n==List of Chip 'n' Dale shorts==\nChip and Dale appear in the following 23 [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[short film]]s.

Additionally, they wear clothes in this series which reflect their personalities; Chip wears a leather jacket and fedora (much like [[Indiana Jones]]), while Dale wears a [[Hawaiian shirt]] (much like ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'').\n\n==Comics series==\nChip 'n' Dale also had their own comic book title, first from [[Dell Comics]] with ''[[Disney comics#Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' #517, 581,and 636, then their own title for issues #4-30 (1955\u201362), which was then continued by [[Gold Key Comics]] with #1-64 (1967\u201380), and later under its brand Whitman with #65-83 (1980\u201384).<ref>[Chip 'n' Dale second volume description http://www.comicvine.com/chip-n-dale/49-22729/?]</ref>\n\n==''Mickey Mouse Clubhouse''==\n{{main|Mickey Mouse Clubhouse}}\n[[File:Chip in Mickey's Space Adventure.jpg|thumb|right|Chip in Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]\nChip and Dale appear as guest stars in some ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' episodes:\n*\"Daisy Bo Peep\"\n*\"Donald's Big Balloon Race\"\n*\"Minnie's Birthday\" (Cameo)\n*\"Daisy's Dance\"\n*\"Pluto's Ball\"\n*\"Daisy in the Sky\"\n*\"Pluto's Best\"\n*\"Goofy the Great\"\n*\"Mickey's Great Clubhouse Hunt\"\n*\"Donald's Hiccups\"\n*\"Minnie's Picnic\"\n*\"Goofy in Training\"\n*\"Mickey's Big Band Concert\"\n*\"Clarabelle's Clubhouse Carnival\"\n*\"Minnie's Mystery\"\n*\"Mickey's Comet\"\n*\"Space Captain Donald\"\n*\"The Friendship Team\"\n*\"Goofy's Coconutty Monkey\"\n*\"Choo-Choo Express\"\n*\"Pluto's Playmate\"\n*\"Mickey's Adventures in Wonderland\"\n*\"Pluto's Dinosaur Romp\"\n*\"Road Rally\"\n*\"Mickey's Little Parade\"\n*\"Minnie's Mouseke-Calendar\"\n*\"Minnie's Masquerade\"\n*\"Space Adventure\"\n*\"Goofy's Thinking Cap\"\n*\"Minnie's Wizard of Dizz\"\n\n==''Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures''==\n{{main|Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures}}\n\nChip and Dale also make recurring appearances in ''Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures'' as mechanics.\n\n==''DuckTales''==\nChip 'n' Dale, based on their ''Rescue Rangers'' iterations, will appear in the 2017 TV series ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]''.<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/19/ducktales-rescue-rangers-talespin/|title=DuckTales surprises Comic-Con with Rescue Rangers, Daisy Duck, and Lin-Manuel Miranda|date=July 19, 2019}}</ref> Making their debut in the season 3 episode, \"Double-O-Duck in You Only Crash Twice!\", Chip 'n' Dale are depicted as ordinary chipmunks used as lab rats for an intelligence ray developed by the organization [[List of DuckTales characters#F.O.W.L.|F.O.W.L.]] After becoming smarter and anthropomorphic, they teamed up with [[Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers|two mice and a fly]] to escape their confines as well as help [[Launchpad McQuack]] defeat one of F.O.W.L.'s agents.<ref name=\"Double-O-Duck in You Only Crash Twice!\">{{cite episode|title=Double-O-Duck in You Only Crash Twice!|series=DuckTales|airdate=2020-04-11|season=3|number=50}}</ref>\n\n==Untitled Chip 'n' Dale series==\nThe characters will have an animated series that will be released on [[Disney+]] in 2020, co-produced by [[The Walt Disney Company France]] and [[Xilam Animation]].

The scene, \"Acme's Funeral\", however, was cut from the final film. Storyboard artwork for this sequence survives, where they can be seen alongside characters such as [[Goofy]], [[Horace Horsecollar]], [[Clarabelle Cow]], [[Popeye]], [[Bluto]], [[Felix the Cat]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]] and [[Droopy]]. [http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2011/08/02/from-the-jhm-archives-scenes-that-were-cut-out-of-quot-who-framed-roger-rabbit-quot.aspx]\n\nChip 'n' Dale occasionally appeared in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]''. They can also be spotted in the 1983 featurette ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' where they are seen dancing to the music inside Fezziwigs. They also appear at all the Disney Parks as well. In the new Mickey Mouse episode \"Space Walkies\", they made a brief cameo as they were being chased by Pluto.\n\n===Goofy Gophers===\nA recurring [[shtick]] often mistakenly attributed to Chip 'n' Dale is the characters' alleged use of politeness: \"After you,\" \u2026 \"No, I insist, after you!\" This gag, from the early-1900s [[Alphonse and Gaston]] comic strip, is used by another studio's characters: Warner Bros' [[Goofy Gophers|Mac and Tosh]] as the [[Goofy Gophers]]. However, in the 1950 short \"Out on a Limb,\" Chip 'n' Dale do engage in a round of this (possibly in reference to the Goofy Gophers) before Chip stops it from getting out of hand with a swift kick to Dale's rear end.\n\n===Voice actors===\nThe classic voices of Chip 'n' Dale were mostly provided by [[Helen Silbert]] and [[Dessie Flynn]], and [[Dessie Miller]], and [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]]. The earliest voices were provided by female office staff, without credit. In \"Private Pluto\" the chipmunks' speech was created by speeding up sound clips of normal speech. In a number of the shorts that followed, many of these same sound clips were used again, though later shorts used dialogue specifically recorded for that short.\n\nAt one point in \"Winter Storage\", Chip and Dale get into an argument while caught in a trap. When the scene switches to an outside view of the box (with Donald Duck sitting on the box) the dialogue being heard is actually a sped up segment of the voice-over narration from the Goofy short \"A Knight for a Day\".\n\nSince 1988, Chip has been voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]] and Dale has been voiced by [[Corey Burton]].\n\n==Video games==\n*Chip 'n' Dale appear in a ''[[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (video game)|Rescue Rangers]]'' spin-off video game that was produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Capcom in 1990. A [[Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 2|sequel]] was released in 1993.\n*Chip 'n' Dale appear in \"Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers: The Adventure in Nimnul's Castle\" a DOS game produced by Hi-Tech Expressions, Inc. in 1990.\n*Chip 'n' Dale make guest appearances in \"Mickey's Memory Challenge\" along with Gadget and Zipper.\n*Chip 'n' Dale appear in \"[[Mickey's 123: The Big Surprise Party]]\" a DOS game developed by [[Distinctive Software]] in 1990.\n*Chip 'n' Dale appear in ''[[Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour]]'' dressed in their ''Rescue Rangers'' outfits.\n*Chip 'n' Dale appear as opponents in the [[Game Boy Color]] version of ''[[Magical Tetris Challenge]]''.\n*Chip 'n' Dale appear in ''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]'' as meet-and-greet characters located in [[Mickey's Toontown]]. Although they are normally the sizes of actual chipmunks in their regular animated appearances, in this game they are scaled-up to the sizes of human children in order to converse with the player character.\n*Chip 'n' Dale appear in ''[[Disney's Toontown Online]]'' in Chip & Dale's Acorn Acres. Toons can go there to play miniature golf. This place has access to Donald's Dock and Bossbot Cog Headquarters.\n\n===''Kingdom Hearts'' series===\nIn the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series, Chip and Dale reside in Disney Castle as its chief engineers. They help develop new technology for the heroes such as the Gummi Ship and Gummi phone. Though making voiceless cameos in the first game, the two appear more prominently in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'', ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]'', and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]'', reprised by Tress MacNeille and Corey Burton respectively.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers merchandise]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.chipndaleonline.com/ Chip 'n' Dale Online]\n* {{Inducks character|Chip}}\n* {{Inducks character|Dale}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151125155308/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0029147/ Chip] on [[IMDb]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160323183410/http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0029145/ Dale] on [[IMDb]]\n* [http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/chipdale/chipdale.html Disney Archive Entry]\n\n{{Disney Characters}}\n{{Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers}}\n{{TV series and movies set in the Mickey Mouse universe}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chip and Dale}}\n[[Category:Animated duos]]\n[[Category:Anthropomorphic rodents]]\n[[Category:Dell Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Disney comics characters]]\n[[Category:Disney core universe characters]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1943]]\n[[Category:Fictional chipmunks]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Calisota]]\n[[Category:Gold Key Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Kingdom Hearts characters]]\n", "name_user": "Blazewing16", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDuckTales", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_%27n%27_Dale"}
