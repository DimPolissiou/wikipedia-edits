Bob does not care much if his thesis is valid, he just wants to get it done, so he can become an academic, since he thinks academia beats working for a living. Someone says, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with it. It's a lot of utter [[wikt:hogwash|hogwash]] anyhow.\" The interloper, who looks strangely familiar, and who Bob takes an instant dislike to, calls himself \"Joe\" and explains that he has come from the future through a Time Gate, a circle about {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter in the air behind Joe.  Joe tells Bob that great opportunities await him through the Gate and thousands of years in his future.  By way of demonstration, Joe tosses Bob's hat into the Gate. It disappears.\n\nBob is reluctant. Joe plies him with [[alcoholic beverages|drink]], which Joe (a stranger, from Bob's point of view) inexplicably retrieves from its hiding place in Bob's apartment, and Bob becomes intoxicated.  Finally, Joe is about to manhandle Bob through the Gate when another man appears, one who looks very much like Joe. The newcomer does not want Bob to go. During the ensuing fight, Bob gets punched, sending him through the Gate.\n\nHe recovers his senses in a strange place. A somewhat older-looking, bearded man explains that he is 30,000 years in the future. The man, calling himself Diktor, treats Bob to a sumptuous breakfast served by beautiful women, one of whom Bob speaks admiringly of. Diktor immediately gives that woman to Bob as a slave. Diktor explains that humans in the future are handsome, cultured in a primitive fashion, but much more docile and good natured than their ancestors.  An [[extraterrestrial life|alien race]] built the Gate and refashioned humanity into compliant slaves, but the aliens are gone now, leaving a world where a 20th-century \"go-getter\" can make himself king.\n\nDiktor asks him to go back through the Gate and bring back the man he finds on the other side. Bob agrees. Stepping through, he finds himself back in his own room, watching himself typing his thesis.  Without much memory of what happened before, he reenacts the scene, this time from the other point of view, and calling himself \"Joe\" so as not to confuse his earlier self. Just as he is about to shove Bob through the Gate, another version of himself shows up. The fight happens as before, and Bob goes through the Gate.\n\nHis future self claims that Diktor is just trying to tangle them up so badly that they can never get untangled, but Joe goes through and meets Diktor again.  Diktor gives him a list of things to buy in his own time and bring back.  A little annoyed by Diktor's manner, Bob argues with him, but eventually returns to the past, back in his room once again.\n\nHe lives through the same scene for the third time, then realizes that he is now free. He collects the items on Diktor's list, which seem to be things a 20th-century man could find useful in making himself king in the future, intentionally writing a [[bad check]] for the purchases. He then visits a woman he had been friends with, and has his way with her, smugly intending to never see her again. After returning to the future, he adjusts the Gate to send himself back to a point ten years earlier, to give himself time to establish himself as the local chieftain. Thus he hopes to preempt Diktor's influence, charting his own course instead. While setting the Gate, he finds two things beside the controls: his hat, and a notebook containing translations between English words and the language of Diktor's slaves.\n\nHe sets himself up as chief, taking precautions against the arrival of Diktor. He adopts the name, which is simply the local word for \"chief\" (the etymology is not explained \u2013 \"Diktor\" might be derived from \"doctor\", \"director\" and/or \"dictator\"). He experiments with the Time Gate, hoping to see its makers. Once, he does catch a glimpse of one and has a brief mental contact with it. The experience is so traumatizing that he runs away screaming, for the creature feels such sadness and heavy responsibility toward other beings, that Bob cannot bear it. He forces himself to return long enough to shut down the Gate, then stays away from it for more than two years. He does not notice that his hair has begun to whiten prematurely, as a result of the stress and shock. Having worn out the notebook through long use, he copies its text into a new, identical, one.\n\nOne day, upon setting the Gate to view his old room in the past, he sees three versions of himself in a familiar arrangement. Shortly, his earliest self comes through. The circle has closed. ''He'' is Diktor\u2014the only Diktor there ever was.<ref>Heinlein does not explain the etymology of \"diktor\". Bob White, in ''Fictional Languages'' (Ch. 3), points out that the title could have developed as a convergence of \"doctor\", \"director\" and \"dictator\", as the functions of a \"diktor\" include a bit of all three.</ref> Wondering who actually compiled the notebook, Diktor prepares to brief Bob, who has to orchestrate events to ensure his own future.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[Floyd C.
