He is best known for his international bestsellers ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (2000) and ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009).\n\n==Early life==\nDoxiadis was born in Australia, where his father, the architect [[Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis]] was working. Soon after his birth, the family returned to Athens, where Doxiadis grew up. Though his earliest interests were in poetry, fiction and the theatre, an intense interest in mathematics led Doxiadis to leave school at age fifteen, to attend [[Columbia University]], in [[New York City|New York]], from which he obtained a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in May 1972.{{source needed|date=December 2019}} He then attended the [[\u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes]] in [[Paris]] from which he got a master's degree{{source needed|date=December 2019}}, with a thesis on the mathematical modeling of the nervous system. His father\u2019s death and family reasons made him return to Greece in 1975, interrupting his graduate studies. In Greece, although involved for some years with the computer software industry, Doxiadis returned to his childhood and adolescence loves of theatre and the cinema, before becoming a full-time writer.\n\n==Work==\n\n===Fiction in Greek===\nDoxiadis began to write in Greek. His first published work was ''A Parallel Life'' (''\u0392\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2'', 1985), a novella set in the monastic communities of 4th century CE Egypt. His first novel, ''Makavettas'' (''\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03ad\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2'', 1988), recounted the adventures of a fictional power-hungry colonel at the time of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]]. Written in a tongue-in-cheek imitation of Greek folk military memoirs, such as that of [[Yannis Makriyannis]], it follows the plot of Shakespeare\u2019s ''[[Macbeth]]'', of which the eponymous hero\u2019s name is a Hellenized form. Doxiadis next novel, ''Uncle Petros and Goldbach\u2019s Conjecture'' (''\u039f \u0398\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u0395\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0393\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03bd\u03c4\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03c7'', 1992), was the first long work of fiction whose plot takes place in the world of pure mathematics research. The first Greek critics did not find the mathematical themes appealing, and it received mediocre reviews, unlike Doxiadis\u2019s first two works, which were well received. The novella ''The Three Little Men'' (''\u03a4\u03b1 \u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u0391\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1'', 1998), attempts a modern-day retelling of the tale of a classic fairy-tale.\n\n===Fiction in English===\nIn 1998, Doxiadis translated into English, significantly re-working, his third novel, which was published in England in 2000 as ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (UK publisher: [[Faber and Faber]]; United States publisher: [[Bloomsbury USA]].) The book became an international bestseller, and has been published to date in more than thirty-five languages. It has received the praise of, among others, Nobel Laureate [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]], British mathematician [[Sir Michael Atiyah]], critic [[George Steiner]] and psychiatrist [[Oliver Sacks]].

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |''APOE'' gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a shorter survival time after diagnosis than in AD. The difference in survival between AD and DLB could be because DLB is harder to diagnose, and may be diagnosed later in the course of the disease.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/> Falls\u2014caused by many factors including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and frailness\u2014increase [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name= Taylor2020/> [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most common form of neurodegnerative dementia after AD as of 2020.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Walker2015/> DLB itself is one of the three most common types of dementia, along with AD and vascular dementia.<ref name=NINDS2020Book>{{cite web|title=Lewy body dementia: Hope through research |url= https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Hope-Through-Research/Lewy-Body-Dementia-Hope-Through-Research |website= National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |publisher = US National Institutes of Health |accessdate= March 18, 2020 |date= January 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=Kosakav/>{{efn|name=CommonDem|Kosaka (2017) writes: \"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is now well known to be the second most frequent dementia following Alzheimer disease (AD).

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk of antipsychotics for people with DLB, educated caregivers are able to act as advocates for the person with DLB.<ref name=LBDACareMeds>{{cite web |url=

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are removed.<ref name=Boot2013/><ref name=LBDAEarlyCare>{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/go/early-stage-lbd-caregiving |title= Early stage LBD caregiving | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |''APOE'' gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a shorter survival time after diagnosis than in AD. The difference in survival between AD and DLB could be because DLB is harder to diagnose, and may be diagnosed later in the course of the disease.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/> Falls\u2014caused by many factors including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and frailness\u2014increase [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name= Taylor2020/> [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most common form of neurodegnerative dementia after AD as of 2020.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Walker2015/> DLB itself is one of the three most common types of dementia, along with AD and vascular dementia.<ref name=NINDS2020Book>{{cite web|title=Lewy body dementia: Hope through research |url= https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Hope-Through-Research/Lewy-Body-Dementia-Hope-Through-Research |website= National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke |publisher = US National Institutes of Health |accessdate= March 18, 2020 |date= January 10, 2020}}</ref><ref name=Kosakav/>{{efn|name=CommonDem|Kosaka (2017) writes: \"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is now well known to be the second most frequent dementia following Alzheimer disease (AD).

Its proprietors were the owners of the earlier Commercial Bank and the Calcutta Bank, who by mutual consent created Union Bank to replace these two banks. In 1840 it established an agency at Singapore, and closed the one at Mirzapore that it had opened in the previous year. Also in 1840 the Bank revealed that it had been the subject of a fraud by the bank's accountant. Union Bank was incorporated in 1845 but failed in 1848, having been insolvent for some time and having used new money from depositors to pay its dividends.<ref>Cooke, Charles Northcote (1863) ''The rise, progress, and present condition of banking in India''.

That honour belongs to the Bank of Upper India, which was established in 1863 and survived until 1913, when it failed, with some of its assets and liabilities being transferred to the [[Alliance Bank of Simla]].\n\nForeign banks too started to appear, particularly in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], in the 1860s.

[[HSBC]] established itself in [[Bengal]] in 1869.  Calcutta was the most active trading port in India, mainly due to the trade of the [[British Raj|British Empire]], and so became a banking centre.\n\nThe first entirely Indian joint stock bank was the [[Oudh Commercial Bank]], established in 1881 in [[Faizabad]]. It failed in 1958. The next was the [[Punjab National Bank]], established in [[Lahore]] in 1894, which has survived to the present and is now one of the largest banks in India.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th Century, the Indian economy was passing through a relative period of stability. Around five decades had elapsed since the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian rebellion]], and the social, industrial and other infrastructure had improved. Indians had established small banks, most of which served particular ethnic and religious communities.\n\nThe presidency banks dominated banking in India but there were also some exchange banks and a number of Indian [[Joint stock company|joint stock]] banks. All these banks operated in different segments of the economy. The exchange banks, mostly owned by Europeans, concentrated on financing foreign trade. Indian joint stock banks were generally under capitalised and lacked the experience and maturity to compete with the presidency and exchange banks. This segmentation let Lord Curzon to observe, \"In respect of banking it seems we are behind the times. We are like some old fashioned sailing ship, divided by solid wooden bulkheads into separate and cumbersome compartments.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe period between 1906 and 1911 saw the establishment of banks inspired by the [[Swadeshi]] movement. The Swadeshi movement inspired local businessmen and political figures to found banks of and for the Indian community. A number of banks established then have survived to the present such as [[Catholic Syrian Bank]], [[South Indian Bank|The South Indian Bank]], [[Bank of India]], [[Corporation Bank]], [[Indian Bank]], [[Bank of Baroda]], [[Canara Bank]] and [[Central Bank of India]].\n\nThe fervour of Swadeshi movement led to the establishment of many private banks in [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi district]], which were unified earlier and known by the name South Canara (South Kanara) district. Four nationalised banks started in this district and also a leading private sector bank. Hence undivided Dakshina Kannada district is known as \"Cradle of Indian Banking\".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe inaugural officeholder was the Britisher Sir Osborne Smith(1 April 1935), while C.

The years of the First World War were turbulent, and it took its toll with banks simply collapsing despite the [[Economy of India|Indian economy]] gaining indirect boost due to war-related economic activities.

Nevertheless, the [[partition of India]] in 1947 adversely impacted the economies of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[West Bengal]], paralysing banking activities for months. India's [[Partition of India|independence]] marked the end of a regime of the [[Laissez-faire]] for the Indian banking. The [[Government of India]] initiated measures to play an active role in the economic life of the nation, and the Industrial Policy Resolution adopted by the government in 1948 envisaged a [[mixed economy]]. This resulted in greater involvement of the state in different segments of the economy including banking and finance. The major steps to regulate banking included:\n\n* The [[Reserve Bank of India]], India's central banking authority, was established in April 1935, but was nationalized on 1 January 1949 under the terms of the Reserve Bank of India (Transfer to Public Ownership) Act, 1948 (RBI, 2005b).<ref name=RBIabout>{{cite web|accessdate=2019-09-06 | title = Reserve Bank of India - About Us|url=https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/AboutusDisplay.aspx| website= Reserve Bank of India }}</ref>\n* In 1949, the [[Banking Regulation Act, 1949|Banking Regulation Act]] was enacted, which empowered the [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) to regulate, control, and inspect the banks in India.\n* The Banking Regulation Act also provided that no new bank or branch of an existing bank could be opened without a license from the RBI, and no two banks could have common directors.\n\n===Nationalisation in 1969 and 1980===\nDespite the provisions, control and regulations of the [[Reserve Bank of India]], banks in India except the [[State Bank of India]] (SBI), remain owned and operated by private persons. By the 1960s, the Indian banking industry had become an important tool to facilitate the development of the [[Indian economy]].

Until the 1990s, the nationalized banks grew at a pace of around 4%, closer to the average growth rate of the Indian economy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Liberalisation in the 1990s ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the early 1990s, the then government embarked on a policy of [[Economic liberalisation in India|liberalisation]], licensing a small number of private banks. These came to be known as ''New Generation tech-savvy banks'', and included Global Trust Bank (the first of such new generation banks to be set up), which later amalgamated with Oriental Bank of Commerce, [[IndusInd Bank]], [[UTI Bank]] (since renamed [[Axis Bank]]), [[ICICI Bank]] and [[HDFC Bank]]. This move, along with the rapid growth in the [[economy of India]], revitalised the banking sector in India, which has seen rapid growth with strong contribution from all the three sectors of banks, namely, government banks, private banks and foreign banks.\n\nThe next stage for the Indian banking has been set up, with proposed relaxation of norms for foreign direct investment. All foreign investors in banks may be given voting rights that could exceed the present cap of 10% at present. It has gone up to 74% with some restrictions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe new policy shook the Banking sector in India completely. Bankers, till this time, were used to the 4\u20136\u20134 method (borrow at 4%; lend at 6%; go home at 4) of functioning. The new wave ushered in a modern outlook and tech-savvy methods of working for traditional banks. All this led to the retail boom in India. People demanded more from their banks and received more.\n\n==Current period==\n\nChanged no of nationalised bank\n[There has no exact data available now]\n{{Main|List of banks in India|l1=List of Banks in India}}\n\nThe Indian banking sector is broadly classified into scheduled banks and non-scheduled banks.

In quality of assets and capital adequacy, Indian banks are considered to have clean, strong and transparent balance sheets relative to other banks in comparable economies in its region. The Reserve Bank of India is an autonomous body, with minimal pressure from the government.\n\nWith the growth in the Indian economy expected to be strong for quite some time-especially in its services sector-the demand for banking services, especially [[retail banking]], mortgages and investment services are expected to be strong. One may also expect M&As, takeovers, and asset sales.\n\nIn March 2006, the Reserve Bank of India allowed [[Warburg Pincus]] to increase its stake in [[Kotak Mahindra Bank]] (a private sector bank) to 10%. This was the first time an investor was allowed to hold more than 5% in a private sector bank since the RBI announced norms in 2005 that any stake exceeding 5% in the private sector banks would need to be vetted by them.\n\nIn recent years critics have charged that the non-government owned banks are too aggressive in their loan recovery efforts in connection with housing, vehicle and personal loans.

Each of these banks is to open at least 25% of its branches in areas that do not have any other bank branches (unbanked regions).

Also in 1840 the Bank revealed that it had been the subject of a fraud by the bank's accountant. Union Bank was incorporated in 1845 but failed in 1848, having been insolvent for some time and having used new money from depositors to pay its dividends.<ref>Cooke, Charles Northcote (1863) ''The rise, progress, and present condition of banking in India''.

[[HSBC]] established itself in [[Bengal]] in 1869.  Calcutta was the most active trading port in India, mainly due to the trade of the [[British Raj|British Empire]], and so became a banking centre.\n\nThe first entirely Indian joint stock bank was the [[Oudh Commercial Bank]], established in 1881 in [[Faizabad]]. It failed in 1958. The next was the [[Punjab National Bank]], established in [[Lahore]] in 1894, which has survived to the present and is now one of the largest banks in India.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th Century, the Indian economy was passing through a relative period of stability. Around five decades had elapsed since the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|Indian rebellion]], and the social, industrial and other infrastructure had improved. Indians had established small banks, most of which served particular ethnic and religious communities.\n\nThe presidency banks dominated banking in India but there were also some exchange banks and a number of Indian [[Joint stock company|joint stock]] banks. All these banks operated in different segments of the economy. The exchange banks, mostly owned by Europeans, concentrated on financing foreign trade. Indian joint stock banks were generally under capitalised and lacked the experience and maturity to compete with the presidency and exchange banks. This segmentation let Lord Curzon to observe, \"In respect of banking it seems we are behind the times. We are like some old fashioned sailing ship, divided by solid wooden bulkheads into separate and cumbersome compartments.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe period between 1906 and 1911 saw the establishment of banks inspired by the [[Swadeshi]] movement. The Swadeshi movement inspired local businessmen and political figures to found banks of and for the Indian community. A number of banks established then have survived to the present such as [[Catholic Syrian Bank]], [[South Indian Bank|The South Indian Bank]], [[Bank of India]], [[Corporation Bank]], [[Indian Bank]], [[Bank of Baroda]], [[Canara Bank]] and [[Central Bank of India]].\n\nThe fervour of Swadeshi movement led to the establishment of many private banks in [[Dakshina Kannada]] and [[Udupi district]], which were unified earlier and known by the name South Canara (South Kanara) district.

The years of the First World War were turbulent, and it took its toll with banks simply collapsing despite the [[Economy of India|Indian economy]] gaining indirect boost due to war-related economic activities.

Nevertheless, the [[partition of India]] in 1947 adversely impacted the economies of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[West Bengal]], paralysing banking activities for months. India's [[Partition of India|independence]] marked the end of a regime of the [[Laissez-faire]] for the Indian banking. The [[Government of India]] initiated measures to play an active role in the economic life of the nation, and the Industrial Policy Resolution adopted by the government in 1948 envisaged a [[mixed economy]]. This resulted in greater involvement of the state in different segments of the economy including banking and finance.

By the 1960s, the Indian banking industry had become an important tool to facilitate the development of the [[Indian economy]].

Until the 1990s, the nationalized banks grew at a pace of around 4%, closer to the average growth rate of the Indian economy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Liberalisation in the 1990s ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the early 1990s, the then government embarked on a policy of [[Economic liberalisation in India|liberalisation]], licensing a small number of private banks. These came to be known as ''New Generation tech-savvy banks'', and included Global Trust Bank (the first of such new generation banks to be set up), which later amalgamated with Oriental Bank of Commerce, [[IndusInd Bank]], [[UTI Bank]] (since renamed [[Axis Bank]]), [[ICICI Bank]] and [[HDFC Bank]]. This move, along with the rapid growth in the [[economy of India]], revitalised the banking sector in India, which has seen rapid growth with strong contribution from all the three sectors of banks, namely, government banks, private banks and foreign banks.\n\nThe next stage for the Indian banking has been set up, with proposed relaxation of norms for foreign direct investment. All foreign investors in banks may be given voting rights that could exceed the present cap of 10% at present. It has gone up to 74% with some restrictions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe new policy shook the Banking sector in India completely. Bankers, till this time, were used to the 4\u20136\u20134 method (borrow at 4%; lend at 6%; go home at 4) of functioning. The new wave ushered in a modern outlook and tech-savvy methods of working for traditional banks. All this led to the retail boom in India. People demanded more from their banks and received more.\n\n==Current period==\n\nChanged no of nationalised bank\n[There has no exact data available now]\n{{Main|List of banks in India|l1=List of Banks in India}}\n\nThe Indian banking sector is broadly classified into scheduled banks and non-scheduled banks.

In quality of assets and capital adequacy, Indian banks are considered to have clean, strong and transparent balance sheets relative to other banks in comparable economies in its region. The Reserve Bank of India is an autonomous body, with minimal pressure from the government.\n\nWith the growth in the Indian economy expected to be strong for quite some time-especially in its services sector-the demand for banking services, especially [[retail banking]], mortgages and investment services are expected to be strong. One may also expect M&As, takeovers, and asset sales.\n\nIn March 2006, the Reserve Bank of India allowed [[Warburg Pincus]] to increase its stake in [[Kotak Mahindra Bank]] (a private sector bank) to 10%. This was the first time an investor was allowed to hold more than 5% in a private sector bank since the RBI announced norms in 2005 that any stake exceeding 5% in the private sector banks would need to be vetted by them.\n\nIn recent years critics have charged that the non-government owned banks are too aggressive in their loan recovery efforts in connection with housing, vehicle and personal loans. There are press reports that the banks' loan recovery efforts have driven defaulting borrowers to suicide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parinda.com/news/crime/20070918/2025/icici-personal-loan-customer-commits-suicide-after-alleged-harassment-recov |title=ICICI personal loan customer commits suicide after alleged harassment by recovery agents |publisher=Parinda.com |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403062824/http://www.parinda.com/news/crime/20070918/2025/icici-personal-loan-customer-commits-suicide-after-alleged-harassment-recov |archive-date=3 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/06/30/stories/2008063057470300.htm |title=Karnataka / Mysore News: ICICI Bank returns tractor to farmer's mother |work=The Hindu|date= 30 June 2008 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiatime.com/2007/11/07/icicis-third-eye/ |title=ICICI's third eye: It's Indiatime |publisher=Indiatime.com |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225120114/http://www.indiatime.com/2007/11/07/icicis-third-eye/ |archivedate=25 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy 2013 the Indian Banking Industry employed 1,175,149 employees and had a total of 109,811 branches in India and 171 branches abroad and manages an aggregate deposit of {{INRconvert|67504.54|b|to=USD EUR}} and [[Credit (finance)|bank credit]] of {{INRconvert|52604.59|b|to=USD EUR}}.

Her parents were Greek refugees from [[Constantinople]]. She is the fourth and last child of a large family, which despite its poverty, was rich in love and in artistic vein. The whole family gathered around the turntable and sang, while her father tried to teach children the steps of the [[waltz]] and the [[tango (ballroom)|tango]].

One day, the lead singer fell sick and sought Marinella as a replacement, who was willing to take the singer's place. At that moment, the Greek music world found one of its best representatives. Marinella became the lead singer of the troupe. She later joined the Military Theatre because the remuneration was better. At the same time she started her career as a singer at the \"Panorama\" centre of Thessaloniki, where Tolis Harmas {{Who|date=May 2015}} coined the name \"Marinella\" for her, inspired by his song.<ref>Compilation album ''Ta Logia Ine Peritta \u2013 50 Chronia Tragoudi'' (Booklet), Marinella, [[PolyGram|PolyGram Greece]]: 1715636, 2006</ref>\n\nShe released her first song in 1957, \"Nitsa, Elenitsa ''(Little Helen)''\".

Her parents were Greek refugees from [[Constantinople]]. She is the fourth and last child of a large family, which despite its poverty, was rich in love and in artistic vein. The whole family gathered around the turntable and sang, while her father tried to teach children the steps of the [[waltz]] and the [[tango (ballroom)|tango]]. From the age of four years singing on the radio broadcast in \"Pediki Ora ''(Children's Hour)''\" and later did ads for shops such as \"Melka\" in Thessaloniki, earning her first pocket money. She participated in many performances of children's theatre.<ref>Compilation album ''Marinella (Mia Agkalia Tragoudia)'' (Booklet), Minos [[EMI]] (Greece): 5807532, 2003</ref>\n\nAt age 15, she gave up her budding career to finish school, but by seventeen, her passion for the theatre is stirring and she joins the artistic group of Mary Laurent, a \"mpoulouki\" (so called then the singer troupes that traveled Greece end-to-end for performances) and plays small roles. One day, the lead singer fell sick and sought Marinella as a replacement, who was willing to take the singer's place. At that moment, the Greek music world found one of its best representatives. Marinella became the lead singer of the troupe. She later joined the Military Theatre because the remuneration was better. At the same time she started her career as a singer at the \"Panorama\" centre of Thessaloniki, where Tolis Harmas {{Who|date=May 2015}} coined the name \"Marinella\" for her, inspired by his song.<ref>Compilation album ''Ta Logia Ine Peritta \u2013 50 Chronia Tragoudi'' (Booklet), Marinella, [[PolyGram|PolyGram Greece]]: 1715636, 2006</ref>\n\nShe released her first song in 1957, \"Nitsa, Elenitsa ''(Little Helen)''\". Her early career was marked by her collaboration with singer [[Stelios Kazantzidis]]. Together they managed to become the greatest duet of Greece, unsurpassed even today. Starting at the night club \"Luxembourg\" in Thessaloniki where they enjoyed great success, they later moved to Athens, the capital, where they became widely known. They sang the songs of [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Manos Hadjidakis]], [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]], Giorgos Mitsakis, [[Giorgos Zambetas]], Apostolos Kaldaras, Theodoros Derveniotis, [[Stavros Xarchakos]], Christos Leontis, whom are considered the best composers of the era.\n\nMarinella married [[Stelios Kazantzidis]] on 7 May 1964 and they toured together in Germany and the United States. They divorced in September 1966. Marinella then began a solo career and eventually in 1974 married singer [[Tolis Voskopoulos]]. This second marriage also ended in divorce in 1981.\n\n==Early career==\nIn October 1970, Marinella participated in the V Festival Internacional da Can\u00e7ao Popular \u2013 Parte Internacion (FIC) in [[Rio de Janeiro]], representing [[Greece]] with the song \"Kyra Giorgena ''(Wife of George)''\", finishing 4th among 38 countries.

He described the creature as being playful and inquisitive, much like a monkey.

The programme follows a group of strangers who are invited to a secluded island where they are murdered one by one for their past crimes.\n\nThe serial, debuting to 6 million viewers, received critical acclaim with many praising the writing, performances, and cinematography. It also scored high ratings.\n\n==Synopsis==\nOn a hot day in late August 1939, eight people, all strangers to each other, are invited to a small, isolated island off the coast of [[Devon]], England, called Soldier's Island, by a \"Mr. and Mrs. Owen\". The guests settle in at the manor home on the island tended by two newly hired servants, a husband and wife, Mr. Thomas Rogers and Mrs. Ethel Rogers, but their hosts are absent. When the guests sit down to dinner, they notice the [[centrepiece]], ten abstract art deco figurines of jade, supposedly representing ten soldiers arranged in a circle. Afterward, Mr. Rogers puts on a [[gramophone record]], from which a voice accuses everyone present of a murder.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.agathachristie.com/news/article/filming-begins-on-agatha-christies-and-then-there|title= Filming begins on Agatha Christie's ''And Then There Were None''|website= agathachristie.com|accessdate= 24 December 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151116143425/http://www.agathachristie.com/news/article/filming-begins-on-agatha-christies-and-then-there|archive-date= 16 November 2015|url-status=dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Shortly after this, one of the party dies from poisoning, and then more and more people are murdered, all in methods synonymous with a poem affixed to the back of each bedroom door. With each death, the murderer removes a figurine from the centerpiece to coincide with the rhyme's sinister disappearance of each \"little soldier boy\". The remaining people decide to work together. They must discover who the murderer is before they run out of time and nobody remains.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Douglas Booth]] as Anthony James Marston\n* [[Charles Dance]] as Justice Lawrence John Wargrave\n* [[Maeve Dermody]] as Vera Elizabeth Claythorne\n* [[Burn Gorman]] as Detective Sergeant William Henry Blore\n* [[Anna Maxwell Martin]] as Ethel Rogers\n* [[Sam Neill]] as General John Gordon Macarthur\n* [[Miranda Richardson]] as Emily Caroline Brent\n* [[Toby Stephens]] as Doctor Edward George Armstrong\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Thomas Rogers\n* [[Aidan Turner]] as Philip Lombard\n* Harley Gallacher as Cyril Ogilvie Hamilton\n* Paul Chahidi as Isaac Morris\n* Charlie Russell as Audrey\n* Richard Hansell as Recording Artist\n* Christopher Hatherall as Fred Narracott\n* Ben Deery as Henry Richmond\n* Margot Edwards as Miss Brady\n* [[Rob Heaps]] as Hugo Hamilton \n* Celia Henebury as Leslie Macarthur\n* Tom Clegg as Landor\n* Daisy Waterstone as Beatrice\n* Catherine Bailey as Olivia Ogilvie Hamilton\n* Joseph Prowen as Edward Seton\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Conception===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 3|total_width=400\n | image1 = Douglas Booth - February 2011 - crop.jpg |width1=100|height1=110\n | alt1 = Douglas Booth\n | image2 =Miranda Richardson Met Opera 2010 Shankbone.jpg |width2=100|height2=125\n | alt2 = Miranda Richardson\n | image3 =Charles Dance 2012 (cropped).jpg |width3=100|height3=100\n | alt3 = Charles Dance\n | image4 =Maeve Dermody.jpg |width4=100|height4=140\n | alt4 = Maeve Dermody\n | image5 =Sam Neill 2010.jpg |width5=100|height5=125\n | alt5 = Sam Neill\n | image6 =Aidan Turner bearded.jpg |width6=100|height6=90\n | alt6 = Aidan Turner\n | footer = (''From top to bottom, left to right''), Douglas Booth, Miranda Richardson, Charles Dance, Maeve Dermody, Sam Neill and Aidan Turner.\n}}\n\n''And Then There Were None'' was commissioned by [[Ben Stephenson]] and [[Charlotte Moore (TV executive)|Charlotte Moore]] for the BBC to mark the 125th anniversary of Agatha Christie's birth.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2014/agatha-christie.html|title=BBC One to become new home of Agatha Christie in UK|work=BBC|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=3 April 2014}}</ref> The adaptation was produced by [[Mammoth Screen]] in partnership with Agatha Christie Productions.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/bbc-commissions-two-new-agatha-684037|title=BBC Commissions Two New Agatha Christie Adaptations|work=Hollywood Reporter|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=3 April 2014|author=Kemp, Stuart}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/bbc-plots-two-agatha-christie-adaptations-for-writers-125th-anniversary-1201123100|title=BBC Plots Agatha Christie Adaptations for Writer's 125th Anniversary|work=Variety|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=3 April 2014|author=Barraclough, Leo}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/commissioning/bbc-signs-agatha-christie-deal/5068155.article|title=BBC signs Agatha Christie deal|work=Broadcast|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=3 April 2014|author=Kanter, Jake}}</ref>\n\nWriter [[Sarah Phelps]] told the BBC that she was shocked by the starkness and brutality of the novel.

There is no host to greet them but there are domestic staff, Thomas and Ethel Rogers, a married couple. The \"guests\" find a copy of a children's rhyme, \"[[Ten Little Indians|Ten Little Soldiers]]\", in each of their rooms and ten jade figurines on the dining room table. After dinner, Mr Rogers, who had been instructed to do so, plays a gramophone record, in which all the guests as well as Mr and Mrs Rogers are named as being responsible for the death(s) of another human being for which they evaded punishment. One of the guests (Blore) is revealed to be an impostor using another name. Eight guests refute the accusations made against them, but Philip Lombard and Anthony Marston do not. Marston dies shortly thereafter from cyanide-laced gin in a similar manner to that of the first little soldier. The next day, the cook Mrs Rogers is found dead in her bed from unknown causes, matching the second verse from the poem.

After the General is found with his head smashed in with a telescope, the remaining seven realize that whoever left the mysterious message intends to make good on their threat, according to the rules of the [[Ten Little Indians|nursery rhyme]]. Wargrave proposes a damning theory to the others that the killer is one of them. After the butler, Mr Rogers, is found split open with an axe, and Miss Brent is impaled with one of her knitting needles, the five survivors band together to search all the rooms and belongings to unmask the killer and save themselves.\n| LineColor       = 9F260E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Episode 3\n| DirectedBy      = Craig Viveiros\n| WrittenBy       = Sarah Phelps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|12|28|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 8.33<ref name=\"BARB_Top30\"/><ref group=lower-alpha name=28day/>\n| ShortSummary    = Five of the original ten are left. Judge Wargrave is found, dressed up to match the Chancery verse of the poem, with a gunshot wound to the head. He is declared dead by Armstrong. The remaining four engage in a demented bacchanal with alcohol and drugs. Vera and Philip have sex. During the night, Armstrong leaves the house, leaving the other three to believe that he is the killer. Blore is ambushed and fatally stabbed by the killer wearing a bear skin rug. Subsequently, Armstrong's corpse is brought in by the tide. Vera manages to lift Philip's gun and when he charges at her, she shoots him dead. Delirious, she returns to her room where a noose is waiting. In a trance, she begins to hang herself. Then, Judge Wargrave walks in, quite alive, and reveals how he wanted to create an unsolvable mystery and punish the guilty, and how he intends to shoot himself to complete the poem. Vera tries to bargain with Wargrave, but he pulls the chair from under her and leaves her to die. He returns to the dining room, where he has set the table for two. He loads the revolver with the final bullet and shoots himself. The revolver recoils to land at the other table setting, thus creating a presumably unsolvable mystery for the police.\n| LineColor       =9F260E\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''And Then There Were None'' received critical acclaim and was a ratings success for the BBC, with the first episode netting over 6 million viewers and becoming the second most watched programme on [[Boxing Day]].

The guests settle in at the manor home on the island tended by two newly hired servants, a husband and wife, Mr. Thomas Rogers and Mrs. Ethel Rogers, but their hosts are absent. When the guests sit down to dinner, they notice the [[centrepiece]], ten abstract art deco figurines of jade, supposedly representing ten soldiers arranged in a circle. Afterward, Mr. Rogers puts on a [[gramophone record]], from which a voice accuses everyone present of a murder.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.agathachristie.com/news/article/filming-begins-on-agatha-christies-and-then-there|title= Filming begins on Agatha Christie's ''And Then There Were None''|website= agathachristie.com|accessdate= 24 December 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151116143425/http://www.agathachristie.com/news/article/filming-begins-on-agatha-christies-and-then-there|archive-date= 16 November 2015|url-status=dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref> Shortly after this, one of the party dies from poisoning, and then more and more people are murdered, all in methods synonymous with a poem affixed to the back of each bedroom door.

After the butler, Mr Rogers, is found split open with an axe, and Miss Brent is impaled with one of her knitting needles, the five survivors band together to search all the rooms and belongings to unmask the killer and save themselves.\n| LineColor       = 9F260E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Episode 3\n| DirectedBy      = Craig Viveiros\n| WrittenBy       = Sarah Phelps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|12|28|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 8.33<ref name=\"BARB_Top30\"/><ref group=lower-alpha name=28day/>\n| ShortSummary    = Five of the original ten are left. Judge Wargrave is found, dressed up to match the Chancery verse of the poem, with a gunshot wound to the head. He is declared dead by Armstrong. The remaining four engage in a demented bacchanal with alcohol and drugs. Vera and Philip have sex. During the night, Armstrong leaves the house, leaving the other three to believe that he is the killer. Blore is ambushed and fatally stabbed by the killer wearing a bear skin rug. Subsequently, Armstrong's corpse is brought in by the tide. Vera manages to lift Philip's gun and when he charges at her, she shoots him dead. Delirious, she returns to her room where a noose is waiting. In a trance, she begins to hang herself. Then, Judge Wargrave walks in, quite alive, and reveals how he wanted to create an unsolvable mystery and punish the guilty, and how he intends to shoot himself to complete the poem. Vera tries to bargain with Wargrave, but he pulls the chair from under her and leaves her to die. He returns to the dining room, where he has set the table for two. He loads the revolver with the final bullet and shoots himself. The revolver recoils to land at the other table setting, thus creating a presumably unsolvable mystery for the police.\n| LineColor       =9F260E\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n''And Then There Were None'' received critical acclaim and was a ratings success for the BBC, with the first episode netting over 6 million viewers and becoming the second most watched programme on [[Boxing Day]].
