It was written by [[Paul Cornell]] and directed by [[Joe Ahearne]]. It was one of three Doctor Who episodes that year to be nominated for the 2006 [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]].<ref name=hugo/>\n\nIn the episode, alien time traveller [[Ninth Doctor|the Doctor]] ([[Christopher Eccleston]]) agrees to take his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]) back to the day her father [[Pete Tyler|Pete]] ([[Shaun Dingwall]]) died in 1987. When Rose intervenes and pulls her father out of the path of a car, time is wounded and dangerous Reapers attack, threatening to erase history. Pete eventually realises that to get rid of the Reapers, he must throw himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him.\n\nLead writer and executive producer [[Russell T Davies]] conceived \"Father's Day\" as an emotionally driven time travel story to explore Rose's character. He chose Cornell to write the episode; Cornell had written spin-off material during the years the programme was on hiatus. The monster element of the story was expanded based on suggestions from Cornell and BBC Head of Drama [[Jane Tranter]], and the Reapers went through many designs. The episode was filmed in November 2004 at St Paul's Church and streets in Cardiff. \"Father's Day\" was watched by 8.06 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the focus on character and emotion.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[Ninth Doctor]] takes [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] to the day Rose's father [[Pete Tyler|Pete]] died so that Pete is not alone when he is killed in a hit-and-run accident. Upon their arrival in London in 1987, they witness the accident, but Rose is unable to go to comfort Pete. Going back to try again, Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside, saving his life. The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish. Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions, with the Doctor rebuking her for potentially damaging the timeline. Rose decides to go with Pete to his friend's wedding, while the Doctor walks back to the [[TARDIS]] only to find that it is now an empty shell. Strange flying beasts called Reapers appear and begin consuming people.\n\nRose and Pete drive to the wedding together, and the car that was meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. A Reaper attacks the wedding guests, including [[Jackie Tyler|Jackie]] and an infant Rose. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox the Reapers are fixing by consuming everyone within it. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it up in the middle of the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.\n\nPete realises that Rose is his and Jackie's daughter, and when Rose is unable to answer questions about how good a father he was, Pete realises he was meant to die in the accident. Jackie thinks Rose is Pete's daughter with another woman. In a fit of frustration Pete hands the baby Rose to adult Rose. The paradox worsens, and a Reaper is able to enter the church. The Doctor declares himself the oldest thing in the church and offers himself to the Reaper, which consumes him and disappears. The TARDIS key goes cold and drops to the ground.\n\nPete realises that he must die in order to restore the timeline. He runs in front of the car that was originally meant to kill him; it had continued to appear and disappear on the road just outside the church. The timeline is repaired, and the Reapers' victims including the Doctor reappear. The Doctor sends Rose to be with Pete, and she holds his hand until he dies.\n\n===Outside references===\n\"The Lamb and Flag\", a pub from the sitcom ''[[Bottom (TV series)|Bottom]]'', is referenced in the episode.<ref name=\"fact file\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S1_08|title=Father's Day: Fact File|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref>  It also features the 2002 song \"[[Don't Mug Yourself]]\" by [[The Streets]], indicating the damage to the timeline.<ref name=\"fact file\" /> Rose believes Pete to be \"a bit of a [[Del Boy]]\", referring to the character from 1980s comedy ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.<ref name=\"witd\"/> The 1987 song \"[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]\" by [[Rick Astley]] and the 1987 [[The Communards]] cover of the 1971 song \"[[Never Can Say Goodbye#The Communards version|Never Can Say Goodbye]]\" also feature in the episode.<ref>{{cite web |title=Father's Day, Series 1, Doctor Who - The Fourth Dimension - BBC One |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3KHbR9lRFbcmb9DWl7b48gv/the-fourth-dimension |website=BBC |accessdate=14 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Death drawing plain.jpg|thumb|right|The Reapers initially looked more like the Grim Reaper. (''Pictured'': an artist's representation of the Grim Reaper.)]]\nAccording to producer [[Phil Collinson]], showrunner [[Russell T Davies]] came up with the concept for \"Father's Day\" at an early stage in the planning of the series, as it was a \"perfect time travel story\".<ref name=\"confidential\"/> Davies wanted the storyline to be easy to follow and drawn from human emotions.<ref name=\"confidential\"/> Additionally, the previous seven episodes had established why Rose was a good companion, and so \"Father's Day\" shows that she does make mistakes, but in a relatable way.<ref name=\"confidential\"/> Davies chose [[Paul Cornell]] to write the episode; Cornell had written ''Doctor Who'' spin-off material, especially in novels for the ''[[Virgin New Adventures]]'', which bridged the gap between the classic series and the new.<ref name=\"doctorwhotv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/the-end-of-doctor-who-an-adventure-in-the-wilderness-54669.htm|title=THE END OF DOCTOR WHO: AN ADVENTURE IN THE WILDERNESS|website=Doctor Who Tv|last=Cohen-Kreshin|first=Levi|date=December 6, 2014|accessdate=February 17, 2020}}</ref> Davies originally intended that the episode be a small budget-saver character piece investigating the death of Rose's father, but Cornell suggested the addition of the Reapers and BBC Head of Drama [[Jane Tranter]] encouraged the additions of monsters to the new series.<ref name=\"witd\"/> Working titles for the episode included \"Wounded Time\" and \"Wound in Time\".<ref>{{cite book|first=J Shaun|last=Lyon|title=Back to the Vortex|publisher=Telos Publishing Ltd.|year=2005|ISBN=1903889782}}</ref>\n\nDavies and Cornell debated whether it should have been Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left ambiguous in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/> In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\">{{cite video|people=[[Phil Collinson|Collinson, Phil]]; [[Paul Cornell]]; [[Billie Piper]]|time=|date=2005|title=[[Audio commentary]] for \"''Father's Day''\"|medium=DVD|publisher=BBC|location=''Doctor Who: The Complete First Series''}}</ref> Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a [[bookmaker|betting shop]]. Pete's line \"I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault\" is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\" /> Originally Pete was to take a swig of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/>\n[[File:Father's Day (1986863580).jpg|thumb|left|St. Paul's Church in Grangetown.]]\nThe entire episode was shot in [[Cardiff]],<ref name=\"confidential\"/> in November 2004.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/><ref name=\"location\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.doctorwholocations.net/locations/parishofstpauls|title= The Parish of St Pauls|website=Doctor Who The Location Guide|accessdate=February 17, 2020}}</ref>  The weather changed frequently during filming, and the cast began to fall ill; Eccleston had a cold.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/> The production team selected several streets that looked similar.<ref name=\"confidential\"/> Most of the streets were in the community of [[Grangetown, Cardiff|Grangetown]]. The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets; only a few satellite dishes were taken down.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/> The church is St Paul's Church, also in Grangetown.<ref name=\"location\" /> The set of the Tylers' flat was redressed for the time period.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/> For the 1980s style, members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the 80s; for example, peach dresses and \"big hair\" were incorporated, but these elements were not meant to be distracting. [[Camille Coduri]], who played Jackie, wore a wig for this episode.<ref name=\"confidential\"/> Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too \"bouncy\".<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/> Piper was scared of holding the baby. Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode, but the number of hours they could work with the infant was limited, an \"artificial baby\" was used as a placeholder in some scenes.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/>\n\nThe Reapers went through many designs. Originally, they were supposed to be \"men in cowls\" based on the [[Grim Reaper]]; the final design retains some of this image with its \"[[scythe]]-like tail\".<ref name=\"RTreapers\"/> The original design was deemed too similar to creatures seen in \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\", and so were reworked into something more \"otherworldly\".<ref name=\"confidential\">{{cite episode|title=Time Trouble|series=[[Doctor Who Confidential]]|airdate=14 May 2005|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Three]]|seriesno=1|number=8}}</ref> They were not originally intended to fly. There was also discussion of how much they should resemble animals as opposed to the Grim Reaper; the end result is a mixture of the two approaches.<ref name=\"DVD commentary\"/> The final design had a \"shark quality\", bat wings, and a mouth influenced by the [[praying mantis]]. [[Vulture]] sound effects were used for its screech.<ref name=\"confidential\"/> The model was made over two months, being finished at the end of February 2005 rather than at the beginning of January as scheduled.<ref name=\"RTreapers\"/> The special effects team then had two or three weeks to complete the \"40-odd shots\" of the completely [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] Reapers in the episode.<ref name=\"RTreapers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/creating-the-reapers/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20100109031528/http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/creating-the-reapers/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-01-09|title=Creating the Reapers|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=May 2005|access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref> The episode ended up being more expensive than intended because of the CGI.<ref name=\"witd\"/>\n\nWhen time is damaged, one of the effects is that mobile telephones all begin to repeat the message, \"Watson, come here, I need you,\" purportedly [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s first words ever spoken over a telephone. However, historical records indicate the words to be \"Watson, come here, I want you.\"<ref name=\"witd\"/> The error was not present in Paul Cornell's original script, but crept in at some point during production.

He was also positive about the direction and Dingwall's performance, though he felt that removing the Doctor from the plot suggested that he would have done something else to resolve it, and he was not a fan of the scene where the Doctor tells two ordinary people how important their lives are, because it was \"cheesy\" and \"disconnected\" from the rest of the story.<ref name=\"witd\"/> Coauthor Graeme Burk was also positive, writing that it may be \"the best story this season\".

{"title_page": "Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg interpolation inequality", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg interpolation inequality''' is a result in the theory of [[Sobolev spaces]] that estimates the [[weak derivative]]s of a function.  The estimates are in terms of [[Lp space|''L''<sup>''p''</sup> norms]] of the function and its derivatives, and the inequality \u201cinterpolates\u201d among various values of ''p'' and orders of differentiation, hence the name.  The result is of particular importance in the theory of [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s. It was proposed by [[Louis Nirenberg]] and [[Emilio Gagliardo]].\n\n==Statement of the inequality==\n\nThe inequality concerns functions ''u'':&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;'''R'''.  Fix 1&nbsp;&le;''q'', ''r''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&infin; and a [[natural number]] ''m''.  Suppose also that a real number ''&alpha;'' and a natural number ''j'' are such that\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{j}{n} + \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{m}{n} \\right) \\alpha + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{q}\n</math>\nand\n:<math>\n\\frac{j}{m} \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1.\n</math>\nThen \n# every function ''u'':&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;'''R''' that lies in ''L''<sup>''q''</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) with ''m''<sup>th</sup> derivative in ''L''<sup>''r''</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) also has ''j''<sup>th</sup> derivative in ''L''<sup>''p''</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>);\n# and, furthermore, there exists a constant ''C'' depending only on ''m'', ''n'', ''j'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''&alpha;'' such that\n::<math>\n\\| \\mathrm{D}^{j} u \\|_{L^{p}} \\leq C \\| \\mathrm{D}^{m} u \\|_{L^{r}}^{\\alpha} \\| u \\|_{L^{q}}^{1 - \\alpha}.\n</math>\n\nThe result has two exceptional cases:\n# If ''j''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''mr''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' and ''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;&infin;, then it is necessary to make the additional assumption that either ''u'' tends to zero at infinity or that ''u'' lies in ''L''<sup>''s''</sup> for some finite ''s''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.\n# If 1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&infin; and ''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''/''r'' is a non-negative integer, then it is necessary to assume also that ''&alpha;''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;1.\n\nFor functions ''u'':&nbsp;&Omega;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;'''R''' defined on a [[bounded set|bounded]] [[Lipschitz domain]] &Omega;&nbsp;&sube;&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the interpolation inequality has the same hypotheses as above and reads\n\n:<math>\n\\| \\mathrm{D}^{j} u \\|_{L^{p}} \\leq C_{1} \\| \\mathrm{D}^{m} u \\|_{L^{r}}^{\\alpha} \\| u \\|_{L^{q}}^{1 - \\alpha} + C_{2} \\| u \\|_{L^{s}}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''s''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 is arbitrary;  naturally, the constants ''C''<sub>1</sub> and ''C''<sub>2</sub> depend upon the domain &Omega; as well as ''m'', ''n'' etc.\n\n==Consequences==\n\n* When ''&alpha;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the ''L''<sup>''q''</sup> norm of ''u'' vanishes from the inequality, and the Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg interpolation inequality then implies the [[Sobolev embedding theorem]].

The estimates are in terms of [[Lp space|''L''<sup>''p''</sup> norms]] of the function and its derivatives, and the inequality \u201cinterpolates\u201d among various values of ''p'' and orders of differentiation, hence the name.  The result is of particular importance in the theory of [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s. It was proposed by [[Louis Nirenberg]] and [[Emilio Gagliardo]].\n\n==Statement of the inequality==\n\nThe inequality concerns functions ''u'':&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;'''R'''.  Fix 1&nbsp;&le;''q'', ''r''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&infin; and a [[natural number]] ''m''.  Suppose also that a real number ''&alpha;'' and a natural number ''j'' are such that\n:<math>\n\\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{j}{n} + \\left( \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{m}{n} \\right) \\alpha + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{q}\n</math>\nand\n:<math>\n\\frac{j}{m} \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1.\n</math>\nThen \n# every function ''u'':&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;'''R''' that lies in ''L''<sup>''q''</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) with ''m''<sup>th</sup> derivative in ''L''<sup>''r''</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) also has ''j''<sup>th</sup> derivative in ''L''<sup>''p''</sup>('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>);\n# and, furthermore, there exists a constant ''C'' depending only on ''m'', ''n'', ''j'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''&alpha;'' such that\n::<math>\n\\| \\mathrm{D}^{j} u \\|_{L^{p}} \\leq C \\| \\mathrm{D}^{m} u \\|_{L^{r}}^{\\alpha} \\| u \\|_{L^{q}}^{1 - \\alpha}.\n</math>\n\nThe result has two exceptional cases:\n# If ''j''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''mr''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''n'' and ''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;&infin;, then it is necessary to make the additional assumption that either ''u'' tends to zero at infinity or that ''u'' lies in ''L''<sup>''s''</sup> for some finite ''s''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0.\n# If 1&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;&infin; and ''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''/''r'' is a non-negative integer, then it is necessary to assume also that ''&alpha;''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;1.\n\nFor functions ''u'':&nbsp;&Omega;&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;'''R''' defined on a [[bounded set|bounded]] [[Lipschitz domain]] &Omega;&nbsp;&sube;&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the interpolation inequality has the same hypotheses as above and reads\n\n:<math>\n\\| \\mathrm{D}^{j} u \\|_{L^{p}} \\leq C_{1} \\| \\mathrm{D}^{m} u \\|_{L^{r}}^{\\alpha} \\| u \\|_{L^{q}}^{1 - \\alpha} + C_{2} \\| u \\|_{L^{s}}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''s''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;0 is arbitrary;  naturally, the constants ''C''<sub>1</sub> and ''C''<sub>2</sub> depend upon the domain &Omega; as well as ''m'', ''n'' etc.\n\n==Consequences==\n\n* When ''&alpha;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the ''L''<sup>''q''</sup> norm of ''u'' vanishes from the inequality, and the Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg interpolation inequality then implies the [[Sobolev embedding theorem]].  (Note, in particular, that ''r'' is permitted to be 1.)\n* Another special case of the Gagliardo\u2013Nirenberg interpolation inequality is [[Ladyzhenskaya's inequality]], in which ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ''j''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 or 3, ''q'' and ''r'' are both 2, and ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.\n\n==References==\n* ''[[:it:Emilio Gagliardo|E.
