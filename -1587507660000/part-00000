Flying rings are also available which typically travel significantly farther than any traditional flying disc.

Others whistle when they reach a certain velocity in flight.\n\nThe term ''frisbee'' is often used [[Generic trademark|generically]] to describe all flying discs, but '''Frisbee''' is a registered trademark of the [[Wham-O]] toy company.

At first these were found objects such as rocks worn smooth in stream beds. Some were tossed for fun while others were used as weapons such as the discus. Throwing the [[discus]] became an event in the [[Olympic Games]] of Ancient Greece. Later, objects such as mats, hats, lids, pie tins, and cake pans were found to be perfect for tossing.\n\n[[Walter Fredrick Morrison]] and his future wife Lucile had fun tossing a popcorn can lid after a Thanksgiving Day dinner in 1937. They soon discovered a market for a light duty flying disc when they were offered 25 cents for a cake pan that they were tossing back and forth on a beach near Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\"History\" /> \"That got the wheels turning, because you could buy a cake pan for five cents, and if people on the beach were willing to pay a quarter for it, well\u2014there was a business,\" Morrison told ''[[The Virginian-Pilot]]'' newspaper in 2007.<ref name=\"VP\">{{cite news |title=50 years later, Frisbee still flying high |url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/272111 |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot |first=Earl |last=Swift|date=May 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe Morrisons continued their business until World War II, when he served in the Army Air Force flying [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47s]], and then was a prisoner of war.<ref name=\"VP\" /> After the war, Morrison sketched a design for an aerodynamically improved flying disc that he called the Whirlo-Way,<ref name=\"History\" /> after the famous racehorse.

They renamed them the Flyin-Saucer in the wake of reported [[Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting|unidentified flying object sightings]].<ref name=\"VP\" />\n\n\"We worked fairs, demonstrating it,\" Morrison told the ''Virginian-Pilot''.

Stochastic defects are more serious for tighter pitches; at 36 nm pitch defect rate does not drop below ~1e-9. Contact patterns have severe defectivity at larger dimensions.]]\nThe most obvious case requiring multiple patterning is when the feature pitch is below the resolution limit of the optical projection system. For a system with [[numerical aperture]] NA and wavelength \u03bb, any pitch below 0.5 \u03bb/NA would not be resolvable in a single wafer exposure. The resolution limit may also originate from stochastic effects, as in the case of [[Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography|EUV]].\nConsequently, 20 nm linewidth still requires EUV double patterning, due to larger defectivity at larger pitches.<ref>D.

As the line width shrinks, the tip radius shrinks. When the line tip is already less than the [[point spread function]] (k<sub>1</sub>~0.6-0.7), \nthe line tip naturally pulls back,<ref>C. A. Mack, Proc. SPIE 4226, 83 (2000).</ref> increasing the gap between opposite facing tips. The point spread function likewise limits the resolvable distance between the centers of the line tips (modeled as circles). This leads in turn to a tradeoff between reducing cell width and reducing cell height. The tradeoff is avoided by adding a cut/trim mask (see discussion below).<ref>[https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/breakfast-bytes/posts/tsmc-n7 TSMC N7 cut metal]</ref> Hence, for the EUV-targeted 7nm node, with an 18 nm metal linewidth (k<sub>1</sub>=0.44 for \u03bb=13.5 nm, NA=0.33), the line tip gap of less than 25 nm (k<sub>1</sub>=0.61) entails EUV single patterning is not sufficient; a second cut exposure is necessary.\n\n===Different parts of layout requiring different illuminations===\n[[File:Different_orientation_illuminations.png|thumb|left|350px|'''Different features require different illuminations.''' Different features in the same layout (as indicated by different colors) could require different illuminations, and hence, different exposures. While horizontal and vertical lines may be addressed with a common quadrupole illumination (blue), 45-degree orientations would suffer, as they require an entirely different quadrupole illumination (red). Consequently, to include all these cases would require separate exposures.]]\n\nWhen patterns include feature sizes near the resolution limit, it is common that different arrangements of such features will require specific illuminations for them to be printed. \n\nThe most basic example is horizontal dense lines vs. vertical lines (half-pitch < 0.35 \u03bb/NA), where the former requires a North-South dipole illumination while the latter requires an East-West dipole illumination. If both types are used (also known as cross-quadrupole C-Quad), the inappropriate dipole degrades the image of the respective line orientation.<ref>M. Burkhardt et al., Proc. SPIE 6520, 65200K (2007).</ref> Larger pitches up to \u03bb/NA can have both horizontal and vertical lines accommodated by quadrupole or QUASAR illumination, but diagonally spaced features and elbow features are degraded.<ref>E. Hendrickx et al., Proc. SPIE 6924, 69240L (2008).</ref><ref>W. N. Partlo et al., Prof. SPIE 1927, 137 (1993).</ref>\n\nIn [[DRAM]], the array and periphery are exposed at different [[Stepper#Illumination_and_the_challenges_of_improving_resolution|illumination]] conditions. For example, the array could be exposed with dipole illumination while the periphery could use annular illumination.<ref>T. Winkler et al., Proc. SPIE 5754, 1169 (2005).</ref> This situation applies to any set of patterns (half-pitch < 0.5 \u03bb/NA) with different pitches or different feature arrangements, e.g., rectangular arrays vs. staggered arrays.<ref>Y. Chen et al., J. Vac. Sci. & Tech. B 35, 06G601 (2017).</ref><ref>K. Tsujita et al., Proc. SPIE 6520, 652036 (2007).</ref><ref>T. Winkler et al., Proc. SPIE 5754, 1169 (2005).</ref><ref name=tian>K. Tian et al., Proc. SPIE 7274, 72740C (2009).</ref> Any of the individual patterns is resolvable, but a single illumination cannot be used simultaneously for all of them.\n\nThe inclusion of both isolated and dense features is a well-known instance of multi-pitch patterning. Subresolution assist features (SRAFs) have been designed to enable the patterning of isolated features when using illumination tailored for the dense features. However, not all pitch ranges can be covered. In particular, semi-dense features may not be easy to include.<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.16.7001&rep=rep1&type=pdf F. M. Schellenberg et al., DAC 2001,Adoption of OPC and the Impact on Design and Layout.]</ref><ref>V. Wiaux et al., Proc. SPIE 5040, 270 (2003).</ref>\n\n====Specific example: hole arrays====\n[[File:Array-specific_illuminations.png|thumb|right|350px|'''Array-specific illuminations.''' Different array configurations require different and mutually exclusive illuminations. To accommodate all of these would require different exposures with the different illuminations.]]\nFor the specific case of hole arrays (minimum half-pitch < 0.6 \u03bb/NA), three well-known cases require three entirely different illuminations. A regular array generally requires Quasar illumination, while the same array rotated 45 degrees results in a checkerboard array that requires C-quad illumination.<ref name=tian/> Different from both cases, an array with close to triangular or hexagonal symmetry requires hexapole illumination.<ref>B. Bilski et al., Proc. SPIE 10466, 1046605 (2017).</ref>\n\n===Multi-pitch patterns===\n[[File:SRAF OPC Hotspot.png|thumb|left|200px|'''OPC hotspot.''' Insufficient space (red region) for assist features to support 2x minimum metal pitch (MMP) in the presence of 1x MMP is prohibited.]]\n[[File:Illuminations for multipitch pattern.png|thumb|left|200px|'''Patterns with incompatible illuminations.''' Illuminations tailored for certain parts of a multi-pitch pattern may degrade other aspects. Here, the blue locations benefit the minimum line pitch, while the red locations benefit the line breaks but not the minimum line pitch.]]\nSometimes a feature pattern inherently contains more than one pitch, and furthermore, these pitches are incompatible to the extent that no [[Stepper#Illumination_and_the_challenges_of_improving_resolution|illumination]] can simultaneously image both pitches satisfactorily. A common example, again from DRAM, is the brick pattern defining the active regions of the array.<ref>[http://tedvc.com/6 Samsung 80nm DRAM]</ref> In addition to the narrow pitch of the active regions, there is also the pitch between the active region separations or breaks, which is double that of the narrow pitch in the same direction. When the narrow pitch is < \u03bb/NA (but still > 0.5 \u03bb/NA), it cannot be imaged simultaneously with the double pitch due to the focus limitations of the latter.\n\n===Small deviations from 2-beam interference===\n[[File:Minimum_line_gap_width.png|thumb|right|300px|For the case where dipole illumination is used, the minimum stable printed gap between line ends exceeds the line width. When the gap is drawn too small, the line ends will bridge.]]\nA two-beam interference pattern (half-pitch <0.5 \u03bb/NA) forms a set of regularly spaced lines. Breaks in such lines, e.g., brick patterns, are deviations from the interference pattern. Such breaks generally do not dominate the pattern, and are thus small deviations. These deviations are insufficient to completely offset the constructive or destructive interference of the underlying regular line pattern; sidelobes often result.<ref name=sidelobe>N. Singh and M. Mukherjee-Roy, Proc. SPIE vol. 4691, 1054 (2002).</ref><ref>J. Garofalo et al., J. Vac. Sci. & Tech. B 11, 2651 (1993).</ref> Line end gaps are easily bridged under dipole illumination.<ref>T. Matsuda et al., Proc. SPIE 7973, 797316 (2011).</ref> Another mask exposure (usually referred as a cut mask) is therefore necessary to break the line pattern more robustly.\n\n==Line cutting==\n[[File:Brick pattern distortion.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Brick pattern image distortion.''' The difference between cross-line and cross-break image is severe enough that a cut mask is needed.]]\n[[File:Line-cut_overlay.png|thumb|right|300px|'''Overlay between line and cut.''' The cut pattern overlay on the line is important to avoid edge placement error, leaving a portion of the line uncut. Moreover, a dose error can aggravate this.]]\n[[File:Rounding_of_rectangles_in_lithography.png|thumb|right|300px|'''Rounding of line cuts.''' A shorter line cut is subject to more severe rounding.]]\nThe earliest implementation of multiple patterning involved line cutting. This first occurred for Intel's 45nm node, for 160 nm gate pitch.<ref>[http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/~banerjee/course_E3238/Upload_files/ITJ_v12issue02.pdf Intel Technology Journal 45nm issue]</ref> The use of a second mask to cut lines defined by a first mask does not help increase feature density directly. Instead it allows definition of features, e.g., brick patterns, which are based on lines spaced at a minimum pitch, in particular, when the lines are near the resolution limit and are generated by the two-beam interference mentioned above. The two-beam interference still dominates the diffraction pattern.<ref name=sidelobe/>\n\nWhen applying the second mask to cut lines, the overlay relative to the first mask needs to be considered; otherwise, edge placement errors (EPE) may result. If the line pitch is already near the resolution limit, the cut pattern itself may have imaging difficulty, from reduced dose or focus window. In this case, more than one cut mask would have to be used, or else the cut has to extend over more than one line. Self-aligned cutting (to be discussed below) may be a preferred option.\n\n==Pitch splitting==\n[[Image:Trench doubling.svg|left|thumb| '''Double Expose, Double Etch (trenches):''' Photoresist coating over first pattern; etching adjacent to previous features; Photoresist removal]]\nThe earliest form of multiple patterning involved simply dividing a pattern into two or three parts, each of which may be processed conventionally, with the entire pattern combined at the end in the final layer. This is sometimes called ''pitch splitting'', since two features separated by one pitch cannot be imaged, so only skipped features can be imaged at once.  It is also named more directly as \"LELE\" (Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch). This approach has been used for the 20&nbsp;nm and 14&nbsp;nm nodes. The additional cost of extra exposures was tolerated since only a few critical layers would need them. A more serious concern was the effect of feature-to-feature positioning errors (overlay). Consequently, the self-aligned sidewall imaging approach (described below) has succeeded this approach.\n[[File:Pitch splitting.png|thumb|right|150px|'''Double patterning by pitch splitting.''' Double patterning by pitch splitting involves assigning adjacent features to two different masks, indicated by the different colors. It remains the simplest multiple patterning approach practiced today, and adds less cost than EUV.]]\nA \"brute force\" approach for patterning trenches involves a sequence of (at least) two separate exposures and etchings of independent patterns into the same layer. For each exposure, a different photoresist coating is required. When the sequence is completed, the pattern is a composite of the previously etched subpatterns. By interleaving the subpatterns, the pattern density can theoretically be increased indefinitely, the half-pitch being inversely proportional to the number of subpatterns used. For example, a 25&nbsp;nm half-pitch pattern can be generated from interleaving two 50&nbsp;nm half-pitch patterns, three 75&nbsp;nm half-pitch patterns, or four 100&nbsp;nm half-pitch patterns. The feature size reduction will most likely require the assistance of techniques such as chemical shrinks, thermal reflow, or shrink assist films. This composite pattern can then be transferred down into the final layer.\n\nThis is best described by considering a process example. A first exposure of photoresist is transferred to an underlying hardmask layer. After the photoresist is removed following the hardmask pattern transfer, a second layer of photoresist is coated onto the sample and this layer undergoes a second exposure, imaging features in between the features patterned in the hardmask layer. The surface pattern is made up of photoresist features edged between mask features, which can be transferred into the final layer underneath. This allows a doubling of feature density. \n\nA variation on this approach which eliminates the first hardmask etch is ''resist freezing'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Scaling-driven nanoelectronics - Resists|url=http://www2.imec.be:80/be_en/research/scaling-driven-nanoelectronics/lithography/resists.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323021819/http://www2.imec.be/be_en/research/scaling-driven-nanoelectronics/lithography/resists.html|archivedate=2010-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> which allows a second resist coating over the first developed resist layer.

A spacer is formed by deposition or reaction of the film on the previous pattern, followed by etching to remove all the film material on the horizontal surfaces, leaving only the material on the sidewalls. By removing the original patterned feature, only the spacer is left. However, since there are two spacers for every line, the line density has now doubled. This is commonly referred to as self-aligned double patterning (SADP). The spacer technique is applicable for defining narrow gates at half the original lithographic pitch, for example.\n\nAs pitch splitting has become more difficult due to possible differences in feature positions between different exposed parts, sidewall image transfer (SIT) has become more recognized as the necessary approach. The SIT approach typically requires a spacer layer to be formed on an etched feature's sidewall. If this spacer corresponds to a conducting feature, then ultimately it must be cut at no less than two locations to separate the feature into two or more conducting lines as typically expected. On the other hand, if the spacer corresponds to a dielectric feature, cutting would not be necessary. The prediction of how many cuts would be needed for advanced logic patterns has been a large technical challenge. Many approaches for [[spacer patterning]] have been published (some listed below), all targeting the improved management (and reduction) of the cuts.\n\nAs spacer materials are commonly [[hardmask]] materials, their post-etch pattern quality tends to be superior compared to photoresist profiles after etch, which are generally plagued by line edge roughness.<ref>X. Hua et al., J. Vac. Sci. Tech. B, vol. 24, pp. 1850-1858 (2006).</ref>\n\nThe main issues with the spacer approach are whether the spacers can stay in place after the material to which they are attached is removed, whether the spacer profile is acceptable, and whether the underlying material is attacked by the etch removing the material attached to the spacer. Pattern transfer is complicated by the situation where removal of the material adjacent to the spacers also removes a little of the underlying material. This results in higher topography on one side of the spacer than the other.<ref>Y-K Choi et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, vol. 107, pp. 3340-3343 (2003).</ref> Any misalignment of masks or excursion in pre-patterned feature critical dimension (CD) will cause the pitch between features to alternate, a phenomenon known as pitch walking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chao|first=Robin|last2=Kohli|first2=Kriti K.|last3=Zhang|first3=Yunlin|last4=Madan|first4=Anita|last5=Muthinti|first5=Gangadhara Raja|last6=Hong|first6=Augustin J.|last7=Conklin|first7=David|last8=Holt|first8=Judson|last9=Bailey|first9=Todd C.|date=2014-01-01|title=Multitechnique metrology methods for evaluating pitch walking in 14 nm and beyond FinFETs|journal=Journal of Micro/Nanolithography, MEMS, and MOEMS|volume=13|issue=4|pages=041411|doi=10.1117/1.JMM.13.4.041411|issn=1932-5150|bibcode=2014JMM&M..13d1411C}}</ref>\n\nThe positioning of the spacer also depends on the pattern to which the spacer is attached. If the pattern is too wide or too narrow, the spacer position is affected. However, this would not be a concern for critical memory feature fabrication processes which are self-aligned.\n\nWhen SADP is repeated, an additional halving of the pitch is achieved. This is often referred to as self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP). With 76&nbsp;nm being the expected minimum pitch for a single [[immersion lithography]] exposure,<ref>I. Bouchoms ''et al.'', Proc. SPIE 7274, 72741K (2009).</ref> 19&nbsp;nm pitch is now accessible with SAQP.\n\n==Self-aligned contact/via patterning==\n[[File:Self-aligned_via_patterning.png|thumb|left|500px|'''Self-aligned via dual-damascene patterning.''']]\nSelf-aligned contact and via patterning is an established method for patterning multiple contacts or vias from a single lithographic feature. It makes use of the intersection of an enlarged feature resist mask and underlying trenches which are surrounded by a pre-patterned hardmask layer. This technique is used in DRAM cells<ref>US Patent 6165880, assigned to TSMC.</ref> and is also used for advanced logic to avoid multiple exposures of pitch-splitting contacts and vias.<ref>Y. Loquet ''et al.'', Microelec. Eng. 107, 138 (2013).</ref><ref>US Patent 8813012, assigned to Synopsys.</ref><ref name=intel_sav>R. Brain ''et al.'', IITC 2009.</ref>\n\nSince 32&nbsp;nm node, Intel has applied the above-mentioned self-aligned via approach, which allows two vias separated by a small enough pitch (112.5&nbsp;nm for Intel 32&nbsp;nm metal)<ref>P. Packan ''et al.'', IEDM 2009.</ref> to be patterned with one resist opening instead of two separate ones.<ref name=intel_sav/> If the vias were separated by less than the single exposure pitch resolution limit, the minimum required number of masks would be reduced, as two separate masks for the originally separated via pair can now be replaced by a single mask for the same pair.\n\n==Spacer-is-dielectric (SID) SADP==\n[[File:SADP_flow_with_two_depositions.png|thumb|right|500px|Spacer-is-dielectric (SID) SADP based on two successive depositions as well as at least two etches.]]\n[[File:SID_SADP_triple_patterning.png|thumb|left|150px|SID SADP has 3x the resolution with allowing the extra mask for line cutting.]]\nIn self-aligned double patterning (SADP), the number of cut/block masks may be reduced or even eliminated in dense patches when the spacer is used to directly pattern inter-metal dielectric instead of metal features.<ref name=sid>Ref.: US Patent 8312394, assigned to Synopsys.</ref> The reason is the cut/block locations in the core/mandrel features are already patterned in the first mask. There are secondary features which emerge from the gaps between spacers after further patterning. The edge between a secondary feature and the spacer is self-aligned with the neighboring core feature.\n\n===2D SID spacer patterning===\nThe use of SID may be applied to 2D arrays, by iteratively adding features equidistant from the previously present features, doubling the density with each iteration.<ref>K. Oyama et al., Proc. SPIE 9051, 90510V (2014).</ref><ref>B. Mebarki ''et al.'', U. S. Patent 8,084,310, assigned to Applied Materials.</ref> Cuts not requiring tight positioning may be made on this spacer-generated grid.<ref name=\"C.

M. Park ''et al.'', IEDM 2015, 676 (2015).</ref> Each iteration of spacer patterning triples the density, effectively reducing 2D pitch by a factor of sqrt(3). This is particularly useful for DRAM since the capacitor layer can be fit to a honeycomb structure, making its patterning simpler.\n\n==Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning(SAQP)==\n[[File:SADP vs SAQP.png|thumb|right|220px|'''SADP vs. SAQP.''' Compared to SADP, SAQP adds another spacer, enabling further self-aligned processing that allows further pitch reduction.]]\nSADP may be applied twice in a row to achieve an effective pitch quartering. This is also known as self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP). With SAQP, the primary feature critical dimension (CD), as well as the spacing between such features, are each defined by either the first or second spacer.\n\n==Directed self-assembly (DSA)==\n[[File:Split_pattern_recombination_by_DSA.png|thumb|left|150px|''DSA recombines split vias.'' Two vias which normally would need separate exposures (red and blue) can be patterned together with DSA assistance using a single guiding pattern exposure (black border).]]\nThe number of masks used for sidewall spacer patterning may be reduced with the use of directed self-assembly (DSA) due to the provision of gridded cuts all at once within a printed area, which can then be selected with a final exposure.<ref>[http://www.semiconwest.org/sites/semiconwest.org/files/docs/SW2013_Mike%20Rieger_Synopsys.pdf Synopsis Presentation at Semicon West 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100302/http://www.semiconwest.org/sites/semiconwest.org/files/docs/SW2013_Mike%20Rieger_Synopsys.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"C.

H. Park ''et al.'', Soft Matter, 6, 120-125 (2010).</ref> The key benefit is the relatively simple processing, compared to multiple exposures or multiple depositions and etching. The main drawback of this technique is the relatively limited range of feature sizes and duty cycles for a given process formulation. Typical applications have been regular lines and spaces as well as arrays of closely packed holes or cylinders.<ref>C. G. Hardy and C. Tang, J. Polymer Sci. Pt. B: Polymer Phys., vol. 51, pp. 2-15 (2013).\n</ref> However, random, aperiodic patterns may also be generated using carefully defined guiding patterns.<ref>L-W. Chang ''et al.''IEDM 2010 Technical Digest, 752-755 (2010).</ref>\n\nThe line edge roughness in block copolymer patterns is strongly dependent on the interface tension between the two phases, which in turn, depends on the Flory \"chi\" (\u03c7) parameter.<ref>[https://www.nist.gov/pml/div683/conference/upload/wu_2011.pdf NIST 2011 report on LER in PS-b-PMMA DSA]</ref> A higher value of \u03c7 is preferred for reduced roughness; the interfacial width between domains is equal to 2a(6\u03c7)<sup>\u22121/2</sup>, where a is the statistical polymer chain length.<ref>A. N. Semenov, Macromolecules 26, 6617 (1993).</ref> Moreover, \u03c7N > 10.5 is required for sufficient phase segregation, where N is the degree of polymerization (number of monomer repeats in the chain). On the other hand, the half-pitch is equal to 2(3/\u03c0<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup>aN<sup>2/3</sup>\u03c7<sup>1/6</sup>. The fluctuations of the pattern widths are actually only weakly (square root) dependent on the logarithm of the half-pitch, so they become more significant relative to smaller half-pitches.\n\nDSA has not yet been implemented in manufacturing, due to defect concerns, where a feature does not appear as expected by the guided self-assembly.<ref>A. Gharbi et al., Proc. SPIE 9777, 97770T (2016).</ref>\n\n==Other multi-patterning techniques==\nThere have been numerous concerns that multiple patterning diminishes or even reverses the node-to-node cost reduction expected with [[Moore's Law]]. [[EUVL|EUV]] is more expensive than three 193i exposures (i.e., LELELE), considering the throughput.<ref name=civay>D. Civay ''et al.'', J. Micro/Nanolith. MEMS MOEMS 14, 023501 (2015).</ref> Moreover, EUV is more liable to print smaller mask defects not resolvable by 193i.<ref>K. Seki ''et al.'', Proc. SPIE 9658, 96580G (2015).</ref> Some aspects of other considered multi-patterning techniques are discussed below.\n\n===Self-aligned triple patterning (SATP)===\n[[File:SID SADP vs SATP.png|thumb|right|300px|'''SATP offers less overlay sensitivity.''' SATP achieves the same pattern as SID SADP but with less overlay sensitivity for the cut/trim mask.]]\nSelf-aligned triple patterning has been considered as a promising successor to SADP, due to its introduction of a second spacer offering additional 2D patterning flexibility and higher density.<ref>US Patent 7842601, assigned to Samsung.</ref><ref>Y. Chen ''et al.'', Proc. SPIE 7973, 79731P (2011).</ref>  A total of two masks (mandrel and trim) is sufficient for this approach.<ref>M. Mirsaeedi ''et al.'', IEEE Trans. VLSI Syst. 22, 1170 (2014).</ref> The only added cost relative to SADP is that of depositing and etching the second spacer. The main disadvantage of SATP succeeding SADP is that it would only be usable for one node. For this reason, self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) is more often considered. On the other hand, the conventional SID SADP flow may be extended quite naturally to triple patterning, with the second mask dividing the gap into two features.<ref>US Patent 7846849, assigned to Applied Materials.</ref>\n\n===Tilted ion implantation===\n[[File:Tilted ion implantation patterning.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Tilted ion implantation.''' Ion damage regions act as sidewall-aligned regions to be etched. A fundamental aspect of this approach is the correlation between damage width and damage pitch; both widen at the same time for fixed ion mask height and ion beam angle.]]\nTilted ion implantation was proposed in 2016 by the University of Berkeley as an alternative method of achieving the same result as spacer patterning.<ref>S. W. Kim et al., JVST B 34, 040608 (2016).</ref> Instead of core or mandrel patterns supporting deposited spacers, an ion masking layer pattern shields an underlying layer from being damaged by ion implantation, which leads to being etched away in a subsequent process. The process requires the use of angled ion beams which penetrate to just the right depth, so as not to damage already processed layers underneath. Also, the ion masking layer must behave ideally, i.e., blocking all ions from passing through, while also not reflecting off the sidewall. The latter phenomenon would be detrimental and defeat the purpose of the ion masking approach. Trenches as small as 9 nm have been achieved with this approach, using 15 keV Ar+ ion implantation at 15-degree angles into a 10 nm thermal SiO<sub>2</sub> masking layer. A fundamental aspect of this approach is the correlation between damage width and damage pitch; both widen at the same time for fixed ion mask height and ion beam angle.\n\n===Complementary polarity exposures===\nThe method of complementary exposures<ref name=complementary>F. T. Chen ''et al.'', Proc. SPIE 8326, 83262L (2012).</ref> is another way of reducing mask exposures for multiple patterning. Instead of multiple mask exposures for individual vias, cuts or blocks, two exposures of opposing or complementary polarity are used, so that one exposure removes interior portions of the previous exposure pattern. The overlapped regions of two polygons of opposite polarity do not print, while the non-overlapped regions define locations that print according to the polarity. Neither exposure patterns the target features directly. This approach was also implemented by IMEC as two \"keep\" masks for the M0A layer in their 7nm SRAM cell.<ref>S. Sakhare et al., Proc. SPIE 9427, 94270O (2015).</ref>\n\n===Self-aligned blocking or cutting===\n[[File:Self-aligned_blocking.png|thumb|right|150px|'''SADP with self-aligned blocking/cutting.'''

SPIE 10147, 1014704 (2017).</ref> The lines to be cut are divided into two materials, which can be etched selectively. One cut mask only cuts every other line made of one material, while the other cut mask cuts the remaining lines made of the other material.\n\n==EUV Multiple Patterning Possibilities==\n[[File:Line_end_stochastic.png|thumb|left|300px|'''EUV line end placement.''' EUV photon shot noise affects line end placement (for single exposure). Hence, line cutting would be preferred.]]\n[[File:2D_Layout_Decomposition.png|thumb|left|200px|'''EUV layout splitting due to different illuminations.''' This layout consists of vertical and horizontal lines requiring two different illuminations optimized for each, since the horizontal layout includes wider lines and spaces. Consequently, the layout needs to be split, even for EUV lithography. Furthermore, additional cut exposures are preferred for the gaps between line tips (circled).]]\nAlthough [[Extreme ultraviolet lithography|EUV]] has been projected to be the [[next-generation lithography]] of choice, it could still require more than one lithographic exposure, due to the foreseen need to first print a series of lines and then cut them; a single EUV exposure pattern has difficulty with line end-to-end spacing control.<ref name=setten/> In addition, the line end placement is significantly impacted by photon shot noise.<ref>[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/photon-shot-noise-impact-line-end-placement-frederick-chen Photon Shot Noise Impact on Line End Placement]</ref>\n\nThe existing 0.33 NA EUV tools are challenged below 16&nbsp;nm half-pitch resolution.<ref name=asmlbeol>T-B.

Consequently, there are more sources of variations and possible yield loss in multiple patterning. Where more than one exposure is involved, e.g., LELE or cut exposures for SAQP, the alignment between the exposures must be sufficiently tight. Current overlay capabilities are \u22480.6&nbsp;nm for exposures of equal density (e.g., LELE) and \u22482.0&nbsp;nm for dense lines vs. cuts/vias (e.g., SADP or SAQP) on dedicated or matched tools.<ref>[https://staticwww.asml.com/doclib/misc/asml_20140306_Extending_ArFi_immersion_scanner_capability_in_support_of_1xnm_production_nodes.pdf Extending immersion lithography to 1xnm nodes]</ref> In addition, each exposure must still meet specified width targets. Where spacers are involved, the width of the spacer is dependent on the initial deposition as well as the subsequent etching duration.

While EUV lithography satisfies 10-20 nm resolution by basic optical considerations, the occurrence of stochastic defects<ref>P. De Bisschop and E. Hendrickx, Proc. SPIE 10583, 105831K (2018).</ref> as well as other infrastructure gaps and throughput considerations prevent its adoption currently. Consequently, [[7nm]] tapeouts have largely proceeded without EUV.<ref>[http://www.tsmc.com/csr/en/update/innovationAndService/caseStudy/9/index.html TSMC tapeouts in 2018]</ref> In other words, the multiple patterning is not prohibitive, but more like a nuisance and growing expense. 5nm may be expected in 2020, with the evolution of multiple patterning and status of EUV considered at that time.\n\n===7nm and 5nm FinFETs===\nSelf-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) is already the established process to be used for patterning fins for [[7&nbsp;nm]] and [[5&nbsp;nm]] [[FinFET]]s.<ref>[http://spie.org/newsroom/6378-self-aligned-quadruple-patterning-to-meet-requirements-for-fins-with-high-density SAQP for FinFETs]</ref> With SAQP, each patterning step gives a critical dimension uniformity (CDU) value in the sub-nanometer range (3 sigma).

While it does not scale so aggressively laterally, the use of string stacking in 3D NAND would imply the use of multiple patterning (litho-etch style) to pattern the vertical channels.\n\nTypically, for NAND, SADP patterns a set of lines from a core mask, followed by using a trim mask to remove the loop ends, and connecting pads with a third mask.<ref>H.

Stochastic defects are more serious for tighter pitches; at 36 nm pitch defect rate does not drop below ~1e-9. Contact patterns have severe defectivity at larger dimensions.]]\nThe most obvious case requiring multiple patterning is when the feature pitch is below the resolution limit of the optical projection system. For a system with [[numerical aperture]] NA and wavelength \u03bb, any pitch below 0.5 \u03bb/NA would not be resolvable in a single wafer exposure. The resolution limit may also originate from stochastic effects, as in the case of EUV.\nConsequently, 20 nm linewidth still requires EUV double patterning, due to larger defectivity at larger pitches.<ref>D.

As the line width shrinks, the tip radius shrinks. When the line tip is already less than the [[point spread function]] (k<sub>1</sub>~0.6-0.7), \nthe line tip naturally pulls back,<ref>C. A. Mack, Proc. SPIE 4226, 83 (2000).</ref> increasing the gap between opposite facing tips. The point spread function likewise limits the resolvable distance between the centers of the line tips (modeled as circles). This leads in turn to a tradeoff between reducing cell width and reducing cell height. The tradeoff is avoided by adding a cut/trim mask (see discussion below).<ref>[https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/breakfast-bytes/posts/tsmc-n7 TSMC N7 cut metal]</ref> Hence, for the EUV-targeted 7nm node, with an 18 nm metal linewidth (k<sub>1</sub>=0.44 for \u03bb=13.5 nm, NA=0.33), the line tip gap of less than 25 nm (k<sub>1</sub>=0.61) entails EUV single patterning is not sufficient; a second cut exposure is necessary.\n\n===Different parts of layout requiring different illuminations===\n[[File:Different_orientation_illuminations.png|thumb|left|350px|'''Different features require different illuminations.''' Different features in the same layout (as indicated by different colors) could require different illuminations, and hence, different exposures. While horizontal and vertical lines may be addressed with a common quadrupole illumination (blue), 45-degree orientations would suffer, as they require an entirely different quadrupole illumination (red). Consequently, to include all these cases would require separate exposures.]]\n\nWhen patterns include feature sizes near the resolution limit, it is common that different arrangements of such features will require specific illuminations for them to be printed. \n\nThe most basic example is horizontal dense lines vs. vertical lines (half-pitch < 0.35 \u03bb/NA), where the former requires a North-South dipole illumination while the latter requires an East-West dipole illumination. If both types are used (also known as cross-quadrupole C-Quad), the inappropriate dipole degrades the image of the respective line orientation.<ref>M. Burkhardt et al., Proc. SPIE 6520, 65200K (2007).</ref> Larger pitches up to \u03bb/NA can have both horizontal and vertical lines accommodated by quadrupole or QUASAR illumination, but diagonally spaced features and elbow features are degraded.<ref>E.

Partlo et al., Prof. SPIE 1927, 137 (1993).</ref>\n\nIn [[DRAM]], the array and periphery are exposed at different [[Stepper#Illumination_and_the_challenges_of_improving_resolution|illumination]] conditions. For example, the array could be exposed with dipole illumination while the periphery could use annular illumination.<ref>T. Winkler et al., Proc. SPIE 5754, 1169 (2005).</ref> This situation applies to any set of patterns (half-pitch < 0.5 \u03bb/NA) with different pitches or different feature arrangements, e.g., rectangular arrays vs. staggered arrays.<ref>Y.

Subresolution assist features (SRAFs) have been designed to enable the patterning of isolated features when using illumination tailored for the dense features. However, not all pitch ranges can be covered. In particular, semi-dense features may not be easy to include.<ref>[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.16.7001&rep=rep1&type=pdf F.

To accommodate all of these would require different exposures with the different illuminations.]]\nFor the specific case of hole arrays (minimum half-pitch < 0.6 \u03bb/NA), three well-known cases require three entirely different illuminations. A regular array generally requires Quasar illumination, while the same array rotated 45 degrees results in a checkerboard array that requires C-quad illumination.<ref name=tian/> Different from both cases, an array with close to triangular or hexagonal symmetry requires hexapole illumination.<ref>B.

Illuminations tailored for certain parts of a multi-pitch pattern may degrade other aspects.

A common example, again from DRAM, is the brick pattern defining the active regions of the array.<ref>[http://tedvc.com/6 Samsung 80nm DRAM]</ref> In addition to the narrow pitch of the active regions, there is also the pitch between the active region separations or breaks, which is double that of the narrow pitch in the same direction. When the narrow pitch is < \u03bb/NA (but still > 0.5 \u03bb/NA), it cannot be imaged simultaneously with the double pitch due to the focus limitations of the latter.\n\n===Small deviations from 2-beam interference===\n[[File:Minimum_line_gap_width.png|thumb|right|300px|For the case where dipole illumination is used, the minimum stable printed gap between line ends exceeds the line width. When the gap is drawn too small, the line ends will bridge.]]\nA two-beam interference pattern (half-pitch <0.5 \u03bb/NA) forms a set of regularly spaced lines. Breaks in such lines, e.g., brick patterns, are deviations from the interference pattern. Such breaks generally do not dominate the pattern, and are thus small deviations. These deviations are insufficient to completely offset the constructive or destructive interference of the underlying regular line pattern; sidelobes often result.<ref name=sidelobe>N. Singh and M.

The cut pattern overlay on the line is important to avoid edge placement error, leaving a portion of the line uncut. Moreover, a dose error can aggravate this.]]\n[[File:Rounding_of_rectangles_in_lithography.png|thumb|right|300px|'''Rounding of line cuts.''' A shorter line cut is subject to more severe rounding.]]\nThe earliest implementation of multiple patterning involved line cutting. This first occurred for Intel's 45nm node, for 160 nm gate pitch.<ref>[http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/~banerjee/course_E3238/Upload_files/ITJ_v12issue02.pdf Intel Technology Journal 45nm issue]</ref> The use of a second mask to cut lines defined by a first mask does not help increase feature density directly. Instead it allows definition of features, e.g., brick patterns, which are based on lines spaced at a minimum pitch, in particular, when the lines are near the resolution limit and are generated by the two-beam interference mentioned above. The two-beam interference still dominates the diffraction pattern.<ref name=sidelobe/>\n\nWhen applying the second mask to cut lines, the overlay relative to the first mask needs to be considered; otherwise, edge placement errors (EPE) may result. If the line pitch is already near the resolution limit, the cut pattern itself may have imaging difficulty, from reduced dose or focus window. In this case, more than one cut mask would have to be used, or else the cut has to extend over more than one line. Self-aligned cutting (to be discussed below) may be a preferred option.\n\n==Pitch splitting==\n[[Image:Trench doubling.svg|left|thumb| '''Double Expose, Double Etch (trenches):''' Photoresist coating over first pattern; etching adjacent to previous features; Photoresist removal]]\nThe earliest form of multiple patterning involved simply dividing a pattern into two or three parts, each of which may be processed conventionally, with the entire pattern combined at the end in the final layer. This is sometimes called ''pitch splitting'', since two features separated by one pitch cannot be imaged, so only skipped features can be imaged at once.  It is also named more directly as \"LELE\" (Litho-Etch-Litho-Etch). This approach has been used for the 20&nbsp;nm and 14&nbsp;nm nodes. The additional cost of extra exposures was tolerated since only a few critical layers would need them. A more serious concern was the effect of feature-to-feature positioning errors (overlay). Consequently, the self-aligned sidewall imaging approach (described below) has succeeded this approach.\n[[File:Pitch splitting.png|thumb|right|150px|'''Double patterning by pitch splitting.''' Double patterning by pitch splitting involves assigning adjacent features to two different masks, indicated by the different colors. It remains the simplest multiple patterning approach practiced today, and adds less cost than EUV.]]\nA \"brute force\" approach for patterning trenches involves a sequence of (at least) two separate exposures and etchings of independent patterns into the same layer. For each exposure, a different photoresist coating is required. When the sequence is completed, the pattern is a composite of the previously etched subpatterns. By interleaving the subpatterns, the pattern density can theoretically be increased indefinitely, the half-pitch being inversely proportional to the number of subpatterns used. For example, a 25&nbsp;nm half-pitch pattern can be generated from interleaving two 50&nbsp;nm half-pitch patterns, three 75&nbsp;nm half-pitch patterns, or four 100&nbsp;nm half-pitch patterns. The feature size reduction will most likely require the assistance of techniques such as chemical shrinks, thermal reflow, or shrink assist films. This composite pattern can then be transferred down into the final layer.\n\nThis is best described by considering a process example. A first exposure of photoresist is transferred to an underlying hardmask layer. After the photoresist is removed following the hardmask pattern transfer, a second layer of photoresist is coated onto the sample and this layer undergoes a second exposure, imaging features in between the features patterned in the hardmask layer. The surface pattern is made up of photoresist features edged between mask features, which can be transferred into the final layer underneath. This allows a doubling of feature density. \n\nA variation on this approach which eliminates the first hardmask etch is ''resist freezing'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Scaling-driven nanoelectronics - Resists|url=http://www2.imec.be:80/be_en/research/scaling-driven-nanoelectronics/lithography/resists.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323021819/http://www2.imec.be/be_en/research/scaling-driven-nanoelectronics/lithography/resists.html|archivedate=2010-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> which allows a second resist coating over the first developed resist layer.

A spacer is formed by deposition or reaction of the film on the previous pattern, followed by etching to remove all the film material on the horizontal surfaces, leaving only the material on the sidewalls. By removing the original patterned feature, only the spacer is left. However, since there are two spacers for every line, the line density has now doubled. This is commonly referred to as self-aligned double patterning (SADP). The spacer technique is applicable for defining narrow gates at half the original lithographic pitch, for example.\n\nAs pitch splitting has become more difficult due to possible differences in feature positions between different exposed parts, sidewall image transfer (SIT) has become more recognized as the necessary approach. The SIT approach typically requires a spacer layer to be formed on an etched feature's sidewall. If this spacer corresponds to a conducting feature, then ultimately it must be cut at no less than two locations to separate the feature into two or more conducting lines as typically expected. On the other hand, if the spacer corresponds to a dielectric feature, cutting would not be necessary. The prediction of how many cuts would be needed for advanced logic patterns has been a large technical challenge. Many approaches for [[spacer patterning]] have been published (some listed below), all targeting the improved management (and reduction) of the cuts.\n\nAs spacer materials are commonly [[hardmask]] materials, their post-etch pattern quality tends to be superior compared to photoresist profiles after etch, which are generally plagued by line edge roughness.<ref>X. Hua et al., J. Vac. Sci. Tech. B, vol. 24, pp. 1850-1858 (2006).</ref>\n\nThe main issues with the spacer approach are whether the spacers can stay in place after the material to which they are attached is removed, whether the spacer profile is acceptable, and whether the underlying material is attacked by the etch removing the material attached to the spacer. Pattern transfer is complicated by the situation where removal of the material adjacent to the spacers also removes a little of the underlying material. This results in higher topography on one side of the spacer than the other.<ref>Y-K Choi et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, vol. 107, pp. 3340-3343 (2003).</ref> Any misalignment of masks or excursion in pre-patterned feature critical dimension (CD) will cause the pitch between features to alternate, a phenomenon known as pitch walking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chao|first=Robin|last2=Kohli|first2=Kriti K.|last3=Zhang|first3=Yunlin|last4=Madan|first4=Anita|last5=Muthinti|first5=Gangadhara Raja|last6=Hong|first6=Augustin J.|last7=Conklin|first7=David|last8=Holt|first8=Judson|last9=Bailey|first9=Todd C.|date=2014-01-01|title=Multitechnique metrology methods for evaluating pitch walking in 14 nm and beyond FinFETs|journal=Journal of Micro/Nanolithography, MEMS, and MOEMS|volume=13|issue=4|pages=041411|doi=10.1117/1.JMM.13.4.041411|issn=1932-5150|bibcode=2014JMM&M..13d1411C}}</ref>\n\nThe positioning of the spacer also depends on the pattern to which the spacer is attached. If the pattern is too wide or too narrow, the spacer position is affected. However, this would not be a concern for critical memory feature fabrication processes which are self-aligned.\n\nWhen SADP is repeated, an additional halving of the pitch is achieved. This is often referred to as self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP). With 76&nbsp;nm being the expected minimum pitch for a single [[immersion lithography]] exposure,<ref>I. Bouchoms ''et al.'', Proc. SPIE 7274, 72741K (2009).</ref> 19&nbsp;nm pitch is now accessible with SAQP.\n\n==Self-aligned contact/via patterning==\n[[File:Self-aligned_via_patterning.png|thumb|left|500px|'''Self-aligned via dual-damascene patterning.''']]\nSelf-aligned contact and via patterning is an established method for patterning multiple contacts or vias from a single lithographic feature. It makes use of the intersection of an enlarged feature resist mask and underlying trenches which are surrounded by a pre-patterned hardmask layer. This technique is used in DRAM cells<ref>US Patent 6165880, assigned to TSMC.</ref> and is also used for advanced logic to avoid multiple exposures of pitch-splitting contacts and vias.<ref>Y. Loquet ''et al.'', Microelec. Eng. 107, 138 (2013).</ref><ref>US Patent 8813012, assigned to Synopsys.</ref><ref name=intel_sav>R. Brain ''et al.'', IITC 2009.</ref>\n\nSince 32&nbsp;nm node, Intel has applied the above-mentioned self-aligned via approach, which allows two vias separated by a small enough pitch (112.5&nbsp;nm for Intel 32&nbsp;nm metal)<ref>P. Packan ''et al.'', IEDM 2009.</ref> to be patterned with one resist opening instead of two separate ones.<ref name=intel_sav/> If the vias were separated by less than the single exposure pitch resolution limit, the minimum required number of masks would be reduced, as two separate masks for the originally separated via pair can now be replaced by a single mask for the same pair.\n\n==Spacer-is-dielectric (SID) SADP==\n[[File:SADP_flow_with_two_depositions.png|thumb|right|500px|Spacer-is-dielectric (SID) SADP based on two successive depositions as well as at least two etches.]]\n[[File:SID_SADP_triple_patterning.png|thumb|left|150px|SID SADP has 3x the resolution with allowing the extra mask for line cutting.]]\nIn self-aligned double patterning (SADP), the number of cut/block masks may be reduced or even eliminated in dense patches when the spacer is used to directly pattern inter-metal dielectric instead of metal features.<ref name=sid>Ref.: US Patent 8312394, assigned to Synopsys.</ref> The reason is the cut/block locations in the core/mandrel features are already patterned in the first mask. There are secondary features which emerge from the gaps between spacers after further patterning. The edge between a secondary feature and the spacer is self-aligned with the neighboring core feature.\n\n===2D SID spacer patterning===\nThe use of SID may be applied to 2D arrays, by iteratively adding features equidistant from the previously present features, doubling the density with each iteration.<ref>K. Oyama et al., Proc. SPIE 9051, 90510V (2014).</ref><ref>B. Mebarki ''et al.'', U. S. Patent 8,084,310, assigned to Applied Materials.</ref> Cuts not requiring tight positioning may be made on this spacer-generated grid.<ref name=\"C.

M. Park ''et al.'', IEDM 2015, 676 (2015).</ref> Each iteration of spacer patterning triples the density, effectively reducing 2D pitch by a factor of sqrt(3). This is particularly useful for DRAM since the capacitor layer can be fit to a honeycomb structure, making its patterning simpler.\n\n==Self-Aligned Quadruple Patterning(SAQP)==\n[[File:SADP vs SAQP.png|thumb|right|220px|'''SADP vs. SAQP.''' Compared to SADP, SAQP adds another spacer, enabling further self-aligned processing that allows further pitch reduction.]]\nSADP may be applied twice in a row to achieve an effective pitch quartering. This is also known as self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP). With SAQP, the primary feature critical dimension (CD), as well as the spacing between such features, are each defined by either the first or second spacer.\n\n==Directed self-assembly (DSA)==\n[[File:Split_pattern_recombination_by_DSA.png|thumb|left|150px|''DSA recombines split vias.'' Two vias which normally would need separate exposures (red and blue) can be patterned together with DSA assistance using a single guiding pattern exposure (black border).]]\nThe number of masks used for sidewall spacer patterning may be reduced with the use of directed self-assembly (DSA) due to the provision of gridded cuts all at once within a printed area, which can then be selected with a final exposure.<ref>[http://www.semiconwest.org/sites/semiconwest.org/files/docs/SW2013_Mike%20Rieger_Synopsys.pdf Synopsis Presentation at Semicon West 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100302/http://www.semiconwest.org/sites/semiconwest.org/files/docs/SW2013_Mike%20Rieger_Synopsys.pdf |date=2015-09-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"C.

H. Park ''et al.'', Soft Matter, 6, 120-125 (2010).</ref> The key benefit is the relatively simple processing, compared to multiple exposures or multiple depositions and etching.

Chang ''et al.''IEDM 2010 Technical Digest, 752-755 (2010).</ref>\n\nThe line edge roughness in block copolymer patterns is strongly dependent on the interface tension between the two phases, which in turn, depends on the Flory \"chi\" (\u03c7) parameter.<ref>[https://www.nist.gov/pml/div683/conference/upload/wu_2011.pdf NIST 2011 report on LER in PS-b-PMMA DSA]</ref> A higher value of \u03c7 is preferred for reduced roughness; the interfacial width between domains is equal to 2a(6\u03c7)<sup>\u22121/2</sup>, where a is the statistical polymer chain length.<ref>A. N. Semenov, Macromolecules 26, 6617 (1993).</ref> Moreover, \u03c7N > 10.5 is required for sufficient phase segregation, where N is the degree of polymerization (number of monomer repeats in the chain). On the other hand, the half-pitch is equal to 2(3/\u03c0<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/3</sup>aN<sup>2/3</sup>\u03c7<sup>1/6</sup>. The fluctuations of the pattern widths are actually only weakly (square root) dependent on the logarithm of the half-pitch, so they become more significant relative to smaller half-pitches.\n\nDSA has not yet been implemented in manufacturing, due to defect concerns, where a feature does not appear as expected by the guided self-assembly.<ref>A. Gharbi et al., Proc. SPIE 9777, 97770T (2016).</ref>\n\n==Other multi-patterning techniques==\nThere have been numerous concerns that multiple patterning diminishes or even reverses the node-to-node cost reduction expected with [[Moore's Law]]. [[EUVL|EUV]] is more expensive than three 193i exposures (i.e., LELELE), considering the throughput.<ref name=civay>D. Civay ''et al.'', J. Micro/Nanolith.

SATP achieves the same pattern as SID SADP but with less overlay sensitivity for the cut/trim mask.]]\nSelf-aligned triple patterning has been considered as a promising successor to SADP, due to its introduction of a second spacer offering additional 2D patterning flexibility and higher density.<ref>US Patent 7842601, assigned to Samsung.</ref><ref>Y. Chen ''et al.'', Proc. SPIE 7973, 79731P (2011).</ref>  A total of two masks (mandrel and trim) is sufficient for this approach.<ref>M. Mirsaeedi ''et al.'', IEEE Trans. VLSI Syst. 22, 1170 (2014).</ref> The only added cost relative to SADP is that of depositing and etching the second spacer. The main disadvantage of SATP succeeding SADP is that it would only be usable for one node. For this reason, self-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) is more often considered. On the other hand, the conventional SID SADP flow may be extended quite naturally to triple patterning, with the second mask dividing the gap into two features.<ref>US Patent 7846849, assigned to Applied Materials.</ref>\n\n===Tilted ion implantation===\n[[File:Tilted ion implantation patterning.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Tilted ion implantation.''' Ion damage regions act as sidewall-aligned regions to be etched. A fundamental aspect of this approach is the correlation between damage width and damage pitch; both widen at the same time for fixed ion mask height and ion beam angle.]]\nTilted ion implantation was proposed in 2016 by the University of Berkeley as an alternative method of achieving the same result as spacer patterning.<ref>S. W. Kim et al., JVST B 34, 040608 (2016).</ref> Instead of core or mandrel patterns supporting deposited spacers, an ion masking layer pattern shields an underlying layer from being damaged by ion implantation, which leads to being etched away in a subsequent process. The process requires the use of angled ion beams which penetrate to just the right depth, so as not to damage already processed layers underneath. Also, the ion masking layer must behave ideally, i.e., blocking all ions from passing through, while also not reflecting off the sidewall. The latter phenomenon would be detrimental and defeat the purpose of the ion masking approach. Trenches as small as 9 nm have been achieved with this approach, using 15 keV Ar+ ion implantation at 15-degree angles into a 10 nm thermal SiO<sub>2</sub> masking layer. A fundamental aspect of this approach is the correlation between damage width and damage pitch; both widen at the same time for fixed ion mask height and ion beam angle.\n\n===Complementary polarity exposures===\nThe method of complementary exposures<ref name=complementary>F. T. Chen ''et al.'', Proc. SPIE 8326, 83262L (2012).</ref> is another way of reducing mask exposures for multiple patterning. Instead of multiple mask exposures for individual vias, cuts or blocks, two exposures of opposing or complementary polarity are used, so that one exposure removes interior portions of the previous exposure pattern. The overlapped regions of two polygons of opposite polarity do not print, while the non-overlapped regions define locations that print according to the polarity. Neither exposure patterns the target features directly. This approach was also implemented by IMEC as two \"keep\" masks for the M0A layer in their 7nm SRAM cell.<ref>S. Sakhare et al., Proc.

Consequently, there are more sources of variations and possible yield loss in multiple patterning. Where more than one exposure is involved, e.g., LELE or cut exposures for SAQP, the alignment between the exposures must be sufficiently tight. Current overlay capabilities are \u22480.6&nbsp;nm for exposures of equal density (e.g., LELE) and \u22482.0&nbsp;nm for dense lines vs. cuts/vias (e.g., SADP or SAQP) on dedicated or matched tools.<ref>[https://staticwww.asml.com/doclib/misc/asml_20140306_Extending_ArFi_immersion_scanner_capability_in_support_of_1xnm_production_nodes.pdf Extending immersion lithography to 1xnm nodes]</ref> In addition, each exposure must still meet specified width targets. Where spacers are involved, the width of the spacer is dependent on the initial deposition as well as the subsequent etching duration.

While EUV lithography satisfies 10-20 nm resolution by basic optical considerations, the occurrence of stochastic defects<ref>P. De Bisschop and E. Hendrickx, Proc. SPIE 10583, 105831K (2018).</ref> as well as other infrastructure gaps and throughput considerations prevent its adoption currently. Consequently, [[7nm]] tapeouts have largely proceeded without EUV.<ref>[http://www.tsmc.com/csr/en/update/innovationAndService/caseStudy/9/index.html TSMC tapeouts in 2018]</ref> In other words, the multiple patterning is not prohibitive, but more like a nuisance and growing expense. 5nm may be expected in 2020, with the evolution of multiple patterning and status of EUV considered at that time.\n\n===7nm and 5nm FinFETs===\nSelf-aligned quadruple patterning (SAQP) is already the established process to be used for patterning fins for [[7&nbsp;nm]] and [[5&nbsp;nm]] [[FinFET]]s.<ref>[http://spie.org/newsroom/6378-self-aligned-quadruple-patterning-to-meet-requirements-for-fins-with-high-density SAQP for FinFETs]</ref> With SAQP, each patterning step gives a critical dimension uniformity (CDU) value in the sub-nanometer range (3 sigma).

While it does not scale so aggressively laterally, the use of string stacking in 3D NAND would imply the use of multiple patterning (litho-etch style) to pattern the vertical channels.\n\nTypically, for NAND, SADP patterns a set of lines from a core mask, followed by using a trim mask to remove the loop ends, and connecting pads with a third mask.<ref>H.

It is a branch of [[animal husbandry]]. Sheep are raised principally for their meat ([[lamb and mutton]]), milk ([[sheep's milk]]), and fiber ([[wool]]). They also yield [[sheepskin]] and [[parchment]].\n\nSheep can be raised in a range of temperate climates, including arid zones. Farmers build [[fence]]s, housing, [[shearing shed]]s and other facilities on their property, such as for water, feed, transport and pest control. Most farms are managed so sheep can [[grazing|graze]] pastures, sometimes under the control of a [[shepherd]] or [[sheep dog]].\n\nThe major sources of income for a farm come from the sale of lambs and the [[Sheep shearing|shearing]] of sheep for their [[wool]]. Farmers can select from various [[List of sheep breeds|breeds]] suitable for their region and market conditions. When the farmer sees that a ewe (female adult) is showing signs of heat or [[estrus]], they can organise for mating with males. Newborn lambs are typically subjected to [[lamb marking]], which involves tail [[Docking (animal)|docking]], [[mulesing]], [[Earmark (agriculture)|earmarking]], and males may be [[castration|castrated]].<ref>[http://www.sheep101.info A Beginner's Guide to Raising Sheep] Sheep: A Beginner's Guide to Raising Sheep.</ref>\n\n==Sheep production worldwide==\n[[File:Sheep farming in Namibia (2017).jpg|thumb|300px|Sheep farming in [[Namibia]] (2017)]]\nAccording to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]] database of the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the top five  countries by number of heads of sheep (average from 1993 to 2013) were: [[mainland China]] (146.5 million heads), [[Australia]] (101.1 million), [[India]] (62.1 million), [[Iran]] (51.7 million), and the former [[Sudan]] (46.2 million).<ref name=\"FAOSTAT\">[http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QA/E FAOSTAT] database.</ref> Approximately 540 million sheep are slaughtered each year for meat wordwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QL|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the five countries with the largest number of heads of sheep were mainland China (175 million), Australia (75.5 million), India (53.8 million), the former Sudan (52.5 million), and Iran (50.2 million).

However, cow's milk contains less fat than ewe's milk.\n\n== Lambing ==\n{{See also|Lambing}}\n[[File:Traditional Otztaler sheep with 2 newborn lambs - panoramio.jpg|thumb|An ewe with two newborn lambs]]\nMost lambs begin life being born outdoors. 'Fall lambing,' \u2018winter lambing,\u2019 and 'spring lambing' are the practices of either [[Artificial insemination|artificial impregnating]] sheep or facilitating natural mating so that they give birth in fall, winter, and spring months.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_b/100B15.pdf|title=Sheep Production and Management|last=College of Agriculture and Home Economics|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Fall lambing is generally not done as the lamb crop percentage is likely to be low; ewes often need hormone therapy to induce estrus and ovulation, and farm labor is often busy elsewhere during fall lambing. Furthermore, fall-born lambs can be weak and small  because of heat stress during the summer gestation period. Spring lambing has the advantage of coinciding with the natural breeding and lambing seasons, but supplemental feed is often needed. The advantage of winter lambing is that the lambs are weaned in spring when pastures are most fertile. While this allows the lambs to grow more quickly, and be sold for slaughter during the summer (when prices are generally high), it results in roughly one in every four newborn lambs dying within within a few days of birth due to malnutrition, disease, or exposure to the harsh cold.

It is a branch of [[animal husbandry]]. Sheep are raised principally for their meat ([[lamb and mutton]]), milk ([[sheep's milk]]), and fiber ([[wool]]). They also yield [[sheepskin]] and [[parchment]].\n\nSheep can be raised in a range of temperate climates, including arid zones. Farmers build [[fence]]s, housing, [[shearing shed]]s and other facilities on their property, such as for water, feed, transport and pest control. Most farms are managed so sheep can [[grazing|graze]] pastures, sometimes under the control of a [[shepherd]] or [[sheep dog]].\n\nThe major sources of income for a farm come from the sale of lambs and the [[Sheep shearing|shearing]] of sheep for their [[wool]]. Farmers can select from various [[List of sheep breeds|breeds]] suitable for their region and market conditions. When the farmer sees that a ewe (female adult) is showing signs of heat or [[estrus]], they can organise for mating with males. Newborn lambs are typically subjected to [[lamb marking]], which involves tail [[Docking (animal)|docking]], [[mulesing]], [[Earmark (agriculture)|earmarking]], and males may be [[castration|castrated]].<ref>[http://www.sheep101.info A Beginner's Guide to Raising Sheep] Sheep: A Beginner's Guide to Raising Sheep.</ref>\n\n==Sheep production worldwide==\n[[File:Sheep farming in Namibia (2017).jpg|thumb|300px|Sheep farming in [[Namibia]] (2017)]]\nAccording to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]] database of the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], the top five  countries by number of heads of sheep (average from 1993 to 2013) were: [[mainland China]] (146.5 million heads), [[Australia]] (101.1 million), [[India]] (62.1 million), [[Iran]] (51.7 million), and the former [[Sudan]] (46.2 million).<ref name=\"FAOSTAT\">[http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QA/E FAOSTAT] database.</ref> Approximately 540 million sheep are slaughtered each year for meat wordwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QL|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the five countries with the largest number of heads of sheep were mainland China (175 million), Australia (75.5 million), India (53.8 million), the former Sudan (52.5 million), and Iran (50.2 million). In 2018 Mongolia has 30.2 million sheep. In 2013, the number of heads of sheep were distributed as follows: 44% in Asia, 28.2% in Africa; 11.2% in Europe, 9.1% in Oceania, 7.4% in the Americas.\n\nThe top producers of sheep meat (average from 1993 to 2013) were as follows: mainland China (1.6 million); Australia (618,000), [[New Zealand]] (519,000), the [[United Kingdom]] (335,000), and [[Turkey]] (288,857).<ref name=\"FAOSTAT\"/> The top five producers of sheep meat in 2013 were mainland China (2 million), Australia (660,000), New Zealand (450,000), the former Sudan (325,000), and Turkey (295,000).<ref name=\"FAOSTAT\"/>\n\n===U.S. sheep production===\nIn the [[United States]], inventory data on sheep began in 1867, when 45 million head of sheep were counted in the United States.<ref name=\"ERS\">[http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/animal-products/sheep,-lamb-mutton/background.aspx Sheep, Lamb & Mutton: Background], [[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[Economic Research Service]] (last updated May 26, 2012).</ref>  The numbers of sheep peaked in 1884 at 51 million head, and then declined over time to almost 6 million head.<ref name=\"ERS\"/>\n\nSince the 1960s, per capita consumption of lamb and mutton declined from nearly 5 pounds to just about 1 pound, due to competition from poultry, pork, beef, and other meats.<ref name=\"ERS\"/> Since the 1990s, U.S. sheep operations declined from around 105,000 to around 80,000 due to shrinking revenues and low rates of return.<ref name=\"ERS\"/> According to the [[Economic Research Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the \"sheep industry accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. livestock industry receipts.\"<ref name=\"ERS\"/>\n\n== Reproduction ==\n{{Main|Domestic sheep reproduction}}\n\n=== Lamb grafting and artificial rearing ===\nIf a lamb is not receiving enough milk from the ewe (because of triplet lambs, ewes with bad udders, or another reason), it is a good management practice to graft the lamb onto another ewe or to feed the lamb artificially. Orphan  lambs can be successfully raised on milk replacer, goat's milk, and cow's milk. However, cow's milk contains less fat than ewe's milk.\n\n== Lambing ==\n{{See also|Lambing}}\n[[File:Traditional Otztaler sheep with 2 newborn lambs - panoramio.jpg|thumb|An ewe with two newborn lambs]]\nMost lambs begin life being born outdoors. 'Fall lambing,' \u2018winter lambing,\u2019 and 'spring lambing' are the practices of either [[Artificial insemination|artificial impregnating]] sheep or facilitating natural mating so that they give birth in fall, winter, and spring months.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_b/100B15.pdf|title=Sheep Production and Management|last=College of Agriculture and Home Economics|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Fall lambing is generally not done as the lamb crop percentage is likely to be low; ewes often need hormone therapy to induce estrus and ovulation, and farm labor is often busy elsewhere during fall lambing. Furthermore, fall-born lambs can be weak and small  because of heat stress during the summer gestation period. Spring lambing has the advantage of coinciding with the natural breeding and lambing seasons, but supplemental feed is often needed. The advantage of winter lambing is that the lambs are weaned in spring when pastures are most fertile. While this allows the lambs to grow more quickly, and be sold for slaughter during the summer (when prices are generally high), it results in roughly one in every four newborn lambs dying within within a few days of birth due to malnutrition, disease, or exposure to the harsh cold. In the UK, it results in around 4 million newborn lamb deaths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animalaid.org.uk/the-issues/our-campaigns/animal-farming/suffering-farmed-sheep/|title=The suffering of farmed sheep|website=Animal Aid|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> 'Accelerated lambing' is the practice of lambing more than once a year, typically every 6 to 8 months.

Although it was eventually revealed that Ward was a Hydra imposter, Dalton noted that that doesn't necessarily mean the relationships the character built with his S.H.I.E.L.D. team weren't genuine, since going undercover meant letting his guard down to make the other characters trust him, opening himself up to those relationships despite his ulterior motives.<ref name=\"DaltonReveal\" />\n\nFollowing the death of Garrett, the question was asked, \"Who is [Grant Ward] without someone telling him what to do?\" Dalton answered that \"he can follow commands really well. He can do and make tough choices and he can sometimes do unpleasant things in the name of something that he feels he believes in. But...I don\u2019t think that Ward knows the answer to that question himself.\" Dalton called the character a 'wildcard', since he was loyal to Garrett as a father figure rather than Hydra, \"and he was more about his teammates rather than the team\",<ref name=\"DaltonRebuilding\" /> later elaborating that \"It\u2019s not quite good guy, it\u2019s not quite bad guy.

There\u2019s a teacher-student relationship there as well as what seems like a genuinely romantic relationship. You see us really lovey-dovey in the cockpit and it\u2019s making everybody around us sick. In some ways, we have the most healthy relationship out of all of the other dynamics on the show, which is saying something because Ward is not a lovey-dovey kind of guy.
