After steadily expanding over the years, in 1994 Durbin's Coaches was sold to [[Badgerline]] and incorporated into their [[Bristol Omnibus Company]] subsidiary, later being re-branded as First Durbin.<ref name=\"Buy Out\">[http://www.transportsalariedstaffs.org.uk/union/tocreps/firstgroup/financial_summary.pdf Bristol Omnibus takeover Durbins Coaches]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (Retrieved 27 March 2012)</ref>\n\nA [[non-compete clause]] in the contract of sale prevented Roger Durbin from operating bus services in the Bristol area for three years. Whilst Roger Durbin left the company, Tony Lavoie, the marketing manager stayed with the company, moving to City Line's [[Lawrence Hill, Bristol|Lawrence Hill]] depot as the general manager for the Durbin operations.\n\nAfter a few months Lavoie left to start up his own bus company, Leisure Travel. By 1997, with a fleet of 24 vehicles, Roger Durbin joined as a partner in the business, and in 1998 the company began trading as South Gloucestershire Bus Company with a blue and white livery. Also during 1998 the pair purchased a local taxi firm which they renamed South Gloucestershire Taxi Company with a similar fleet name as the bus business. Durbin took on the bus side of the business while Lavoie looked after the running of the taxi company. During 1999 the original Durbin\u2019s Coaches business was reacquired from [[First West of England|First Bristol]], who had continued to trade as Durbin\u2019s Coaches and then First Durbin as a \u2018low cost\u2019 unit within First.\n\nThe company rapidly expanded over the next few years winning various tenders for supported services from [[Bristol City Council]] and [[South Gloucestershire Council]], at one point even operating route 620 from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to [[Stroud]]. During 2003 the goodwill and custom as well as the majority of the fleet of Eastville Coaches were bought from the proprietor Mr Phillips. A number of newer vehicles were brought in to update the fleet, however after 18 months the original Eastville Coaches began trading again and the coaches in the South Gloucestershire fleet with  Eastville Coaches branding lost their fleet name and gained 'www.southgloucestershirebus.co.uk A Durbin Group Company\u2019 fleetnames.\n\nAlso during 2003 the taxi operation was separated from the bus operation, which saw Lavoie leave the business.\n\nThe company continued to expand, picking up contracts with the [[University of the West of England]] (UWE) for student transport, [[Axa]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] for staff shuttles, [[Wessex Trains]] rail replacement and further tenders from Bristol City and South Gloucestershire Councils.\n\nThe fleet mainly consisted of second hand vehicles such as [[Leyland Lynx]] and [[Leyland Titan (B15)|Leyland Titans]], and [[Volvo B10M]]s for the coach fleet. There were two [[Dennis Dart SLF]]s that were new to Durbin in 2003 for Orange and UWE work. In 2007 South Gloucestershire was named the most un-environmentally-friendly bus operator in the country. It was also named the worst for customer service, although this hasn't been formally recognised since, the level of service has remained poor.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/1764686.Oxford_bus_fleet_greenest_in_UK/ Oxford bus fleet greenest in UK] ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' 17 October 2007</ref>\n\nIn June 2007 the bus operations of the company were sold to [[Rotala]] subsidiary [[Hallmark Connections|Flights Hallmark]].<ref>[http://www.rotalaplc.com/about/History_6.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053543/http://www.rotalaplc.com/about/History_6.html |date=21 September 2013 }} Rotala</ref><ref>[http://www.rotalaplc.com/company/Wessex_3.html About Wessex] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006040633/http://www.rotalaplc.com/company/Wessex_3.html |date=6 October 2013 }} Rotala</ref> The sale included 68 buses and was completed in stages until 31 March 2008, this being dictated by Bristol City and South Gloucestershire Councils needing to approve the transfer of the routes and because the licence was held in the name of the owners, not the company, so the services had to change operator licences.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:2hck9PXbUzUJ:www.tbus.org.uk/transit_314.pdf+&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESil6uyiY2SnPVBXSUMc3GrazT8ZdfT7cq46-6wTpIXXjAdQoclyFv6TIRV8nRgNPkIg3d1Fy5b-xPfhrXRUN2NCDJZPO3NSZUjs1jH9A58fJtDVl76re-mON0U5jjEexN8qXYkA&sig=AHIEtbQTqp1C_mlMKHbB3VacmjY0L5QcWA Rotala buys in the West Midlands & South West] ''Transit'' 29 June 2007 page 7</ref>\n\nThe services were slowly rebranded as [[Wessex Connect]], however the majority of the vehicles that Rotala purchased stayed in the blue South Gloucestershire livery and they were gradually disposed of as Rotala were able to replace them. Most of the low floor vehicles from the South Gloucestershire fleet were painted white with dark blue skirts and ended up with staying in Bristol or transferring to Rotala group company [[Diamond West Midlands|Central Connect]] in [[Birmingham]].\n\nFollowing the sale South Gloucestershire were left with school services, the 462 commuter service and the Axa 101 service, that both interworked with school services. Since then further corporate staff services have been up in and around Bristol as well as work on behalf of UWE, including shuttle bus and P&R for open days. The fleet has been continually updated since the sale in 2007 with more modern coaches and further second hand buses. All coaches are now white with a new South Gloucestershire fleet name in silver, and school vehicles are gradually being painted into an all over yellow scheme inspired by the purchase of a former [[Plymouth Citybus]] school vehicle. The light blue livery is no longer in use as all vehicles have either been sold or painted into the new yellow StudentLink livery.\n\nIn October 2019, the business was sold to [[Stagecoach West]] with 53 vehicles and the depot.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190924103723/https://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2019/2019-09-23a.aspx Britain's biggest bus and coach operator expanding in Bristol] Stagecoach 23 September 2019</ref>\n\n==National Express==\nIn March 2007, South Gloucestershire began operating three weekend journeys on [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] route 040 between [[Bristol bus station|Bristol]] and [[Victoria Coach Station|London]], due to increased passenger numbers on this route. In the months leading up to this, the company was providing regular duplicate coaches on route 040 and also other routes such as the 403 from [[Bath bus station|Bath]] to London and on cross country services from [[South West England]].\n\nDuring December 2007 South Gloucestershire operated the seasonal route 319 from Bristol to [[Birmingham coach station|Birmingham]]. The service was introduced to meet demand over the festive period until January 2008. From March 2008 several more additional weekend journeys were added to the 040 and these were operated by South Gloucestershire. In September 2008 South Gloucestershire began operating their first full-time National Express contract on route 200 between Bristol and [[Gatwick Airport]]. For this purpose a fleet of six tri-axle [[Caetano Levante]] [[Scania K-series|Scania K340EB6s]] were purchased, the first new coaches to be operated.\n\nFrom January 2010 South Gloucestershire began to operate the 040 on a full-time basis after taking over the route from [[First West of England|First Somerset & Avon]], who could trace back their history to the start of the service. The majority of journeys on the route were worked by the Levantes purchased for the 200, as well as three further examples acquired from National Express. From 2013 the tri-axle coaches began  to lose National Express branding so the use of standard coaches on the 040 is more common.\n\nFurther expansion came during August when the company took over operation of the 401/2, Wells/[[Frome]] to London and 403, Bath to London, which had previously been operated by First Somerset & Avon. A new fleet of 12 Caetano Levante bodied [[Volvo B9R]]s were reacquired for use on both the 200 and 401-3 services, although they were delayed arriving so the fleet used on the 200 service covered on the 403 because they were [[Low-emission zone]] compliant. This saw the use of spare coaches on the 200 service for a few weeks until all of the new coaches hadarrived.<ref>[http://www.lombard.co.uk/pdf/case-studies/sgbc.pdf South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach expands fleet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000337/http://www.lombard.co.uk/pdf/case-studies/sgbc.pdf |date=5 October 2013 }} Lombard</ref>\n\nIn May 2011 the Friday and Sunday only service 318 between Bristol and Birmingham was taken on having previously been operated by Applegates Coaches. During August 2011 the operations of Hookways of [[Meeth]] collapsed and South Gloucestershire provided emergency cover on routes 339 from [[Westward Ho!]] to [[Grimsby]] and 502 from Westward Ho! to London. In October the services were taken on, on a permanent basis and four new Volvo B9R/Caetano Levante were delivered in May 2012 to allow the upgrade of the routes;\n\nJanuary 2012 saw South Gloucestershire begin operating some journeys on route 444 from [[Gloucester]] to London, with [[Whittles]] covering other runs. This was previously operated by [[Stagecoach West]]'s Gloucester depot. An outstation was set up in Gloucester and a further 4 new Volvo B9R/Caetano Levante delivered for the service. In January 2013 operation of route 444 was transferred to Bennetts Coaches with South Gloucestershire gaining additional journeys on service 403 which were added to the timetable that month. I the same month, South Gloucestershire gained a further National Express contract for route 330 between [[Penzance]] and [[Nottingham]] after the previous operator, Premiere Travel, went into administration. A former Premiere Travel Levante also joined the fleet.\n\nRoute 318 was initially reduced to operating on Sundays only from the start of the new National Express timetable commencing on 13 May 2013, with the Friday service not operating after 10 May. However, by 24 May the Friday service on the route had been reinstated. It was however withdrawn again after 11 October 2013 meaning that the route now operates on Sundays only.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013 the company gained further diagrams on the National Express network including the former [[Yourbus]] diagram on route 040. This saw South Gloucestershire operate every journey on the route apart from four Friday/Sunday only diagrams which were operated by Chalfont Coaches. Other services introduced included a seasonal 317 service which operated a once daily departure between Bristol and [[Lymington]] and a service between London and [[Leeds Castle]]. As of September 2013 all of these journeys have now been withdrawn. September also saw South Gloucestershire take on a diagram on service 509 between London and [[Cardiff]] which had previously been operated National Express Operations. From November service 302 between Bristol and Northampton has also been taken over from [[Arriva Shires & Essex|Arriva MK Metro]], coincidentally this had previously been operated by [[FirstGroup]].\n\nThe company acquired further National Express work during summer 2014. Whilst the company's diagrams on route 200 between Bristol and Gatwick were slightly cut back in June 2014, route 337 between [[Paignton]] and [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] was taken over from MK Metro and in July 2014, the company started to operate route 401 between Bristol, [[Swindon]], Heathrow Airport and London.\n\nA further service introduced on 31 March 2015 was route 301 between [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]] and [[Oxford]] and operated alongside route 302, providing three journeys a day between Bristol and Oxford. In addition, from June 2015 the company took over Chalfont Coaches' Friday and Sunday workings on service 040 meaning that all journeys on this route were now contracted to South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach.\n\nSouth Gloucestershire had a varied fleet of National Express coaches that included:\n*1 Scania K114IB4/[[Irizar PB]]\n*6 Scania K340EB4/[[Caetano Levante]]\n*9 Scania K340EB6/Caetano Levante\n*5 VDL SB4000/[[Van Hool]] T9\n*20 [[Volvo B9R]]/Caetano Levante\n*4 [[Volvo B12B]]/[[Plaxton Panther]]\n\nSouth Gloucestershire operated on 12 National Express routes:<ref>[http://southgloucesterbc.com/national_express.html National Express]</ref>\n*040: [[Bristol bus station|Bristol]] to [[Victoria Coach Station|London]]\n*200: Bristol to [[Gatwick Airport]] via [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Heathrow Central bus station|Heathrow Airport]]\n*301: [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]] to [[Oxford]] via Bristol, [[Bath bus station|Bath]], [[Chippenham]], [[Corsham]] and [[Swindon]]\n*302: Bristol to [[Northampton]] via [[Bath, Somerset|Bath Spa]], [[Swindon]] and [[Oxford]]\n*318: Bristol to [[Birmingham coach station|Birmingham]] via [[Gloucester]] and [[Cheltenham Spa]] (Sundays only)\n*330: [[Penzance]] to [[Nottingham]]\n*337: [[Paignton]] to [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]\n*339: [[Westward Ho!]] to [[Grimsby]]\n*401: Bristol to London via [[University of the West of England]], Swindon & Heathrow Airport\n*402: [[Frome]] to London via [[Trowbridge]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] & Heathrow Airport\n*403: Bath to London via Chippenham & Heathrow Airport\n*502: [[Barnstaple]] to London\n*509: [[Cardiff]] to London via [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]\n\nOn 1 May 2017, South Gloucestershire ceased to be a National Express operator with the services to be taken over by [[Edwards Coaches]].<ref>[http://www.route-one.net/articles/Coach_routes/Edwards_buys_Avonmouth_depot Edwards buys Avonmouth depot] ''Route One'' 20 April 2017</ref>\n\n==Megabus==\nOn 1 May 2017, South Gloucestershire commenced operating four [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]] services.<ref>[https://uk.megabus.com/ServiceAdvisory.aspx?id=496&home=false Megabus.com Launches Services to Heathrow & Gatwick Airports] Megabus 19 April 2017</ref><ref>[http://www.route-one.net/articles/Operators/New_airport_routes_for_Megabus New Airport Routes for Megabus] ''Route One'' 20 April 2017</ref>\n*M6a: [[Barnstaple]] to [[Victoria Coach Station|London]] via [[Taunton]], [[Bristol bus station|Bristol]] & [[Heathrow Central bus station|Heathrow Airport]]\n*M14: [[Gloucester]] to London\n*M25: [[Cardiff]] to [[Gatwick Airport]] via Heathrow\n*M38: Barnstaple to [[Nottingham]]\n\n==Bus routes==\nSouth Gloucestershire's only scheduled bus services is route 462,  which runs at peak hour times from [[Emersons Green]], [[Mangotsfield]] and Bromley Heath to either [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] or [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] via [[Bristol city centre]].<ref>[http://www.southglos.gov.uk/Documents/Bus%20timetables/PTE110019.pdf Emersons Green - Temple Meads] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005055833/http://www.southglos.gov.uk/Documents/Bus%20timetables/PTE110019.pdf |date=5 October 2013 }} South Gloucestershire Council 18 April 2011</ref> One return diagram operates in each direction between Emersons Green and Clifton Triangle whilst the remaining journeys operate between Emersons Green and Bristol Temple Meads Railway Station.

After steadily expanding over the years, in 1994 Durbin's Coaches was sold to [[Badgerline]] and incorporated into their [[Bristol Omnibus Company]] subsidiary, later being re-branded as First Durbin.<ref name=\"Buy Out\">[http://www.transportsalariedstaffs.org.uk/union/tocreps/firstgroup/financial_summary.pdf Bristol Omnibus takeover Durbins Coaches]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (Retrieved 27 March 2012)</ref>\n\nA [[non-compete clause]] in the contract of sale prevented Roger Durbin from operating bus services in the Bristol area for three years. Whilst Roger Durbin left the company, Tony Lavoie, the marketing manager stayed with the company, moving to City Line's [[Lawrence Hill, Bristol|Lawrence Hill]] depot as the general manager for the Durbin operations.\n\nAfter a few months Lavoie left to start up his own bus company, Leisure Travel. By 1997, with a fleet of 24 vehicles, Roger Durbin joined as a partner in the business, and in 1998 the company began trading as South Gloucestershire Bus Company with a blue and white livery. Also during 1998 the pair purchased a local taxi firm which they renamed South Gloucestershire Taxi Company with a similar fleet name as the bus business. Durbin took on the bus side of the business while Lavoie looked after the running of the taxi company. During 1999 the original Durbin\u2019s Coaches business was reacquired from [[First West of England|First Bristol]], who had continued to trade as Durbin\u2019s Coaches and then First Durbin as a \u2018low cost\u2019 unit within First.\n\nThe company rapidly expanded over the next few years winning various tenders for supported services from [[Bristol City Council]] and [[South Gloucestershire Council]], at one point even operating route 620 from [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] to [[Stroud]]. During 2003 the goodwill and custom as well as the majority of the fleet of Eastville Coaches were bought from the proprietor Mr Phillips. A number of newer vehicles were brought in to update the fleet, however after 18 months the original Eastville Coaches began trading again and the coaches in the South Gloucestershire fleet with  Eastville Coaches branding lost their fleet name and gained 'www.southgloucestershirebus.co.uk A Durbin Group Company\u2019 fleetnames.\n\nAlso during 2003 the taxi operation was separated from the bus operation, which saw Lavoie leave the business.\n\nThe company continued to expand, picking up contracts with the [[University of the West of England]] (UWE) for student transport, [[Axa]] and [[Orange S.A.|Orange]] for staff shuttles, [[Wessex Trains]] rail replacement and further tenders from Bristol City and South Gloucestershire Councils.\n\nThe fleet mainly consisted of second hand vehicles such as [[Leyland Lynx]] and [[Leyland Titan (B15)|Leyland Titans]], and [[Volvo B10M]]s for the coach fleet. There were two [[Dennis Dart SLF]]s that were new to Durbin in 2003 for Orange and UWE work. In 2007 South Gloucestershire was named the most un-environmentally-friendly bus operator in the country. It was also named the worst for customer service, although this hasn't been formally recognised since, the level of service has remained poor.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/1764686.Oxford_bus_fleet_greenest_in_UK/ Oxford bus fleet greenest in UK] ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' 17 October 2007</ref>\n\nIn June 2007 the bus operations of the company were sold to [[Rotala]] subsidiary [[Hallmark Connections|Flights Hallmark]].<ref>[http://www.rotalaplc.com/about/History_6.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053543/http://www.rotalaplc.com/about/History_6.html |date=21 September 2013 }} Rotala</ref><ref>[http://www.rotalaplc.com/company/Wessex_3.html About Wessex] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006040633/http://www.rotalaplc.com/company/Wessex_3.html |date=6 October 2013 }} Rotala</ref> The sale included 68 buses and was completed in stages until 31 March 2008, this being dictated by Bristol City and South Gloucestershire Councils needing to approve the transfer of the routes and because the licence was held in the name of the owners, not the company, so the services had to change operator licences.<ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:2hck9PXbUzUJ:www.tbus.org.uk/transit_314.pdf+&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESil6uyiY2SnPVBXSUMc3GrazT8ZdfT7cq46-6wTpIXXjAdQoclyFv6TIRV8nRgNPkIg3d1Fy5b-xPfhrXRUN2NCDJZPO3NSZUjs1jH9A58fJtDVl76re-mON0U5jjEexN8qXYkA&sig=AHIEtbQTqp1C_mlMKHbB3VacmjY0L5QcWA Rotala buys in the West Midlands & South West] ''Transit'' 29 June 2007 page 7</ref>\n\nThe services were slowly rebranded as [[Wessex Connect]], however the majority of the vehicles that Rotala purchased stayed in the blue South Gloucestershire livery and they were gradually disposed of as Rotala were able to replace them. Most of the low floor vehicles from the South Gloucestershire fleet were painted white with dark blue skirts and ended up with staying in Bristol or transferring to Rotala group company [[Diamond West Midlands|Central Connect]] in [[Birmingham]].\n\nFollowing the sale South Gloucestershire were left with school services, the 462 commuter service and the Axa 101 service, that both interworked with school services. Since then further corporate staff services have been up in and around Bristol as well as work on behalf of UWE, including shuttle bus and P&R for open days. The fleet has been continually updated since the sale in 2007 with more modern coaches and further second hand buses. All coaches are now white with a new South Gloucestershire fleet name in silver, and school vehicles are gradually being painted into an all over yellow scheme inspired by the purchase of a former [[Plymouth Citybus]] school vehicle. The light blue livery is no longer in use as all vehicles have either been sold or painted into the new yellow StudentLink livery.\n\nIn October 2019, the business was sold to [[Stagecoach West]] with 53 vehicles and the depot.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190924103723/https://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2019/2019-09-23a.aspx Britain's biggest bus and coach operator expanding in Bristol] Stagecoach 23 September 2019</ref>\n\n==National Express==\nIn March 2007, South Gloucestershire began operating three weekend journeys on [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] route 040 between [[Bristol bus station|Bristol]] and [[Victoria Coach Station|London]], due to increased passenger numbers on this route. In the months leading up to this, the company was providing regular duplicate coaches on route 040 and also other routes such as the 403 from [[Bath bus station|Bath]] to London and on cross country services from [[South West England]].\n\nDuring December 2007 South Gloucestershire operated the seasonal route 319 from Bristol to [[Birmingham coach station|Birmingham]]. The service was introduced to meet demand over the festive period until January 2008. From March 2008 several more additional weekend journeys were added to the 040 and these were operated by South Gloucestershire. In September 2008 South Gloucestershire began operating their first full-time National Express contract on route 200 between Bristol and [[Gatwick Airport]]. For this purpose a fleet of six tri-axle [[Caetano Levante]] [[Scania K-series|Scania K340EB6s]] were purchased, the first new coaches to be operated.\n\nFrom January 2010 South Gloucestershire began to operate the 040 on a full-time basis after taking over the route from [[First West of England|First Somerset & Avon]], who could trace back their history to the start of the service. The majority of journeys on the route were worked by the Levantes purchased for the 200, as well as three further examples acquired from National Express. From 2013 the tri-axle coaches began  to lose National Express branding so the use of standard coaches on the 040 is more common.\n\nFurther expansion came during August when the company took over operation of the 401/2, Wells/[[Frome]] to London and 403, Bath to London, which had previously been operated by First Somerset & Avon. A new fleet of 12 Caetano Levante bodied [[Volvo B9R]]s were reacquired for use on both the 200 and 401-3 services, although they were delayed arriving so the fleet used on the 200 service covered on the 403 because they were [[Low-emission zone]] compliant. This saw the use of spare coaches on the 200 service for a few weeks until all of the new coaches hadarrived.<ref>[http://www.lombard.co.uk/pdf/case-studies/sgbc.pdf South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach expands fleet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005000337/http://www.lombard.co.uk/pdf/case-studies/sgbc.pdf |date=5 October 2013 }} Lombard</ref>\n\nIn May 2011 the Friday and Sunday only service 318 between Bristol and Birmingham was taken on having previously been operated by Applegates Coaches. During August 2011 the operations of Hookways of [[Meeth]] collapsed and South Gloucestershire provided emergency cover on routes 339 from [[Westward Ho!]] to [[Grimsby]] and 502 from Westward Ho! to London. In October the services were taken on, on a permanent basis and four new Volvo B9R/Caetano Levante were delivered in May 2012 to allow the upgrade of the routes;\n\nJanuary 2012 saw South Gloucestershire begin operating some journeys on route 444 from [[Gloucester]] to London, with [[Whittles]] covering other runs. This was previously operated by [[Stagecoach West]]'s Gloucester depot. An outstation was set up in Gloucester and a further 4 new Volvo B9R/Caetano Levante delivered for the service. In January 2013 operation of route 444 was transferred to Bennetts Coaches with South Gloucestershire gaining additional journeys on service 403 which were added to the timetable that month. I the same month, South Gloucestershire gained a further National Express contract for route 330 between [[Penzance]] and [[Nottingham]] after the previous operator, Premiere Travel, went into administration. A former Premiere Travel Levante also joined the fleet.\n\nRoute 318 was initially reduced to operating on Sundays only from the start of the new National Express timetable commencing on 13 May 2013, with the Friday service not operating after 10 May. However, by 24 May the Friday service on the route had been reinstated. It was however withdrawn again after 11 October 2013 meaning that the route now operates on Sundays only.\n\nDuring the summer of 2013 the company gained further diagrams on the National Express network including the former [[Yourbus]] diagram on route 040. This saw South Gloucestershire operate every journey on the route apart from four Friday/Sunday only diagrams which were operated by Chalfont Coaches. Other services introduced included a seasonal 317 service which operated a once daily departure between Bristol and [[Lymington]] and a service between London and [[Leeds Castle]]. As of September 2013 all of these journeys have now been withdrawn. September also saw South Gloucestershire take on a diagram on service 509 between London and [[Cardiff]] which had previously been operated National Express Operations. From November service 302 between Bristol and Northampton has also been taken over from [[Arriva Shires & Essex|Arriva MK Metro]], coincidentally this had previously been operated by [[FirstGroup]].\n\nThe company acquired further National Express work during summer 2014. Whilst the company's diagrams on route 200 between Bristol and Gatwick were slightly cut back in June 2014, route 337 between [[Paignton]] and [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] was taken over from MK Metro and in July 2014, the company started to operate route 401 between Bristol, [[Swindon]], Heathrow Airport and London.\n\nA further service introduced on 31 March 2015 was route 301 between [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]] and [[Oxford]] and operated alongside route 302, providing three journeys a day between Bristol and Oxford. In addition, from June 2015 the company took over Chalfont Coaches' Friday and Sunday workings on service 040 meaning that all journeys on this route were now contracted to South Gloucestershire Bus & Coach.\n\nSouth Gloucestershire had a varied fleet of National Express coaches that included:\n*1 Scania K114IB4/[[Irizar PB]]\n*6 Scania K340EB4/[[Caetano Levante]]\n*9 Scania K340EB6/Caetano Levante\n*5 VDL SB4000/[[Van Hool]] T9\n*20 [[Volvo B9R]]/Caetano Levante\n*4 [[Volvo B12B]]/[[Plaxton Panther]]\n\nSouth Gloucestershire operated on 12 National Express routes:<ref>[http://southgloucesterbc.com/national_express.html National Express]</ref>\n*040: [[Bristol bus station|Bristol]] to [[Victoria Coach Station|London]]\n*200: Bristol to [[Gatwick Airport]] via [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[Heathrow Central bus station|Heathrow Airport]]\n*301: [[University of Bristol|Bristol University]] to [[Oxford]] via Bristol, [[Bath bus station|Bath]], [[Chippenham]], [[Corsham]] and [[Swindon]]\n*302: Bristol to [[Northampton]] via [[Bath, Somerset|Bath Spa]], [[Swindon]] and [[Oxford]]\n*318: Bristol to [[Birmingham coach station|Birmingham]] via [[Gloucester]] and [[Cheltenham Spa]] (Sundays only)\n*330: [[Penzance]] to [[Nottingham]]\n*337: [[Paignton]] to [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]]\n*339: [[Westward Ho!]] to [[Grimsby]]\n*401: Bristol to London via [[University of the West of England]], Swindon & Heathrow Airport\n*402: [[Frome]] to London via [[Trowbridge]], [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]] & Heathrow Airport\n*403: Bath to London via Chippenham & Heathrow Airport\n*502: [[Barnstaple]] to London\n*509: [[Cardiff]] to London via [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]\n\nOn 1 May 2017, South Gloucestershire ceased to be a National Express operator with the services to be taken over by [[Edwards Coaches]].<ref>[http://www.route-one.net/articles/Coach_routes/Edwards_buys_Avonmouth_depot Edwards buys Avonmouth depot] ''Route One'' 20 April 2017</ref>\n\n==Megabus==\nOn 1 May 2017, South Gloucestershire commenced operating four [[Megabus (Europe)|Megabus]] services.<ref>[https://uk.megabus.com/ServiceAdvisory.aspx?id=496&home=false Megabus.com Launches Services to Heathrow & Gatwick Airports] Megabus 19 April 2017</ref><ref>[http://www.route-one.net/articles/Operators/New_airport_routes_for_Megabus New Airport Routes for Megabus] ''Route One'' 20 April 2017</ref>\n*M6a: [[Barnstaple]] to [[Victoria Coach Station|London]] via [[Taunton]], [[Bristol bus station|Bristol]] & [[Heathrow Central bus station|Heathrow Airport]]\n*M14: [[Gloucester]] to London\n*M25: [[Cardiff]] to [[Gatwick Airport]] via Heathrow\n*M38: Barnstaple to [[Nottingham]]\n\n==Bus routes==\nSouth Gloucestershire's only scheduled bus services is route 462,  which runs at peak hour times from [[Emersons Green]], [[Mangotsfield]] and Bromley Heath to either [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station]] or [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] via [[Bristol city centre]].<ref>[http://www.southglos.gov.uk/Documents/Bus%20timetables/PTE110019.pdf Emersons Green - Temple Meads] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005055833/http://www.southglos.gov.uk/Documents/Bus%20timetables/PTE110019.pdf |date=5 October 2013 }} South Gloucestershire Council 18 April 2011</ref> One return diagram operates in each direction between Emersons Green and Clifton Triangle whilst the remaining journeys operate between Emersons Green and Bristol Temple Meads Railway Station.

Proteins perform a variety of critical functions as [[enzyme]]s, structural proteins or [[hormone]]s and therefore, are crucial biological components. As a result, protein synthesis is regulated at multiple steps <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Alberts |first1=Bruce |title=Molecular biology of the cell |date=2015 |publisher=Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group |location=Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0815344643 |edition=  Sixth}}</ref>. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both [[prokaryote]]s and [[eukaryote]]s but there are some distinct differences.\n\nProtein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases - [[Transcription (biology)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. During transcription, a section of [[DNA]] encoding a protein, known as a [[gene]], is converted into a template molecule [[messenger RNA]] by enzymes - called [[RNA polymerases]] - in the nucleus of the cell <ref name=\"O'Connor 2010\">{{cite book |last1=O'Connor |first1=Clare |title=Essentials of Cell Biology |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge, MA |location=NPG Education |url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/essentials-of-cell-biology-14749010/ |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>. In eukaryotes, this messenger RNA (mRNA) is initially produced in a premature form which undergoes processing and modification through post-transcriptional modifications. The now mature mRNA is exported from the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] via [[nuclear pore]]s to the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome]]s in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s. The amino acids are joined together by [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[peptide bond]]s to form a polypeptide chain.\n\nFollowing translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein, for example, a protein must fold correctly to produce a functional [[active site]] required to function as an enzyme. In order to adopt a functional 3D shape, known as the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], the polypeptide chain must adopt a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. When the polypeptide chain has correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications can alter the protein's ability to function, where it is located within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and the protein's ability to [[protein-protein interaction|interact with other proteins]] <ref name =\"Wang 2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|pmid=24217768 |pmc=3915910 }}</ref>.\n\nProtein biosynthesis has a key role in disease, as changes and errors in this process through underlying [[mutation|DNA mutations]] or protein misfolding are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence. [[Nonsense mutation|Mutations can cause the polypeptide chain to be shorter]] by generating a [[stop codon|short stop sequence]] which causes early termination of translation. Alternatively, a mutation in the mRNA sequence can [[missense mutation|change the specific amino acid encoded at that position in the mRNA codon]] in the polypeptide chain <ref name=\"Scheper 2008\">{{cite journal |last1=Scheper |first1=Gert C. |last2=van der Knaap |first2=Marjo S. |last3=Proud |first3=Christopher G. |title=Translation matters: protein synthesis defects in inherited disease |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |date=2007 |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=711\u2013723 |doi=10.1038/nrg2142|pmid=17680008 }}</ref>.

In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional processing in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional processing is not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription.\n\nFirst, an enzyme known as a [[helicase]] acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the start of the gene (known as the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|3-prime]] (3') end) to the end of the gene (called the 5-prime (5') end). Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand.

In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule.

The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/> Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref> Through post-translational modification, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is expanded by 2 to 3 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Mario |last2=Walczak |first2=Michal J. |last3=Aebi |first3=Markus |last4=Wider |first4=Gerhard |title=Posttranslational Modifications of Intact Proteins Detected by NMR Spectroscopy: Application to Glycosylation |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2015 |volume=54 |issue=24 |pages=7096\u20137100 |doi=10.1002/anie.201502093}}</ref>.\n\nThere are four key types of post-translational modification:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n# Cleavage\n# Addition of chemical groups\n# Addition of complex molecules\n# Formation of intramolecular bonds\n\n===Cleavage===\n[[Proteolysis|Cleavage]] of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as [[proteases]].

Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification.<ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>\n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]].<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right)]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

During translation, the messenger RNA is read by [[ribosome]]s in the cytoplasm and the [[nucleotide]] sequence of the mRNA is used to determine the sequence of [[amino acid]]s.

In order to adopt a functional 3D shape, known as the [[protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], the polypeptide chain must adopt a series of smaller underlying structures called [[protein secondary structure|secondary structures]]. When the polypeptide chain has correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different [[post-translational modification]]s.

DNA has an [[Antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], double helix structure composed of two, complementary [[polynucleotide]] strands, held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNA - corresponding to a gene - to unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis - this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template strand) is known as the coding strand. \n\nThe enzyme [[RNA polymerase]] binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the start of the gene (known as the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|3-prime]] (3') end) to the end of the gene (called the 5-prime (5') end). Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesises a single strand of pre-mRNA (in the 5'-to-3' direction) through complementary [[base pair|base pairing]] with the exposed nucleotides on the template strand. The pre-mRNA molecule is built by the addition of nucleotides using a [[phosphodiester bond]] to the growing polynucleotide chain by RNA polymerase as it moves along the DNA template strand. Behind the RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin, so only 12 base pairs on the DNA are exposed at a time <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

However, there is one crucial difference in the nucleotide composition of DNA and mRNA molecules. DNA is composed of 4 bases - [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] (G, C, A and T) - RNA is also composed of 4 bases - guanine, cytosine, adenine and [[uracil]].

These distinct 5' and 3' mRNA modifications enable the cell to detect that the full mRNA message is present and intact, if both the 5' cap and 3' tail are present <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\nThis processed pre-mRNA molecule then undergoes the process of RNA splicing. Genes are composed of a series of introns and [[exon]]s, introns are nucleotide sequences within the gene that do not encode a protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences which directly encode a protein. Introns and exons are present in both the underlying DNA sequence and the pre-mRNA molecule, therefore, in order to produce an mature mRNA molecule encoding a protein,  splicing must occur <ref name=\"Toole2015\">{{cite book |last1=Toole |first1=Glenn |last2=Toole |first2=Susan |title=AQA biology A level.

In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation both occur in the cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020\">{{cite web |title=Stages of translation (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/gene-expression-central-dogma/translation-polypeptides/a/the-stages-of-translation |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Ribosome]]s are complex [[molecular machine]]s, made of a mixture of protein and RNA, arranged into two subunit (a large and small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5'-3' direction and uses the mRNA as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain.<ref name=\"Khan Academy 2020 - 2\">{{cite web |title=Nucleus and ribosomes (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/structure-of-a-cell/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/a/nucleus-and-ribosomes |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=10 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref> In order to translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules known as [[transfer RNA]]s (tRNA) to bring the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides within the molecule.<ref name=\"Cooper 2000\">{{cite book |last1=Cooper |first1=GM |title=The cell : a molecular approach |date=2000 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland (MA) |isbn=9780878931064 |edition=  2nd}}</ref> There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, which serve as adaptors in this process, each binds to a specific nucleotide sequence (known as a [[codon]]) in the mRNA molecule and delivering a specific amino acid.\n\nThe ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the [[start codon]] (AUG) and begins to translate the mRNA molecule using codon-anticodon base pairing. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in [[genetic code|triplets]] - three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to the codon on the mRNA molecule. For example, the first codon encountered on the mRNA molecule is the start codon, composed of the nucleotides AUG, the correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, the correct amino acid is methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its enzymatic activity [[peptidyl transferase]] to catalyse the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/>\n\nThe ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon, releasing the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected for, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule and synthesise an identical polypeptide - this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains.<ref name=\"Toole2015\"/> Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this happens, no tRNA can recognise it and a [[release factor]] induces the release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome <ref name=\"Cooper 2000\"/>.\n\n==Protein Folding==\n[[File:Protein folding figure.png|300px|thumb|Shows the process of protein folding from primary structure through to quaternary structure]]\n\nOnce synthesis of the polypeptide chain is completed by the ribosome, the polypeptide chain released and folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of [[protein structure]] is known as the [[protein primary structure|primary structure]], which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure ultimately changing the overall structure and function.\n\nThe primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an [[alpha helix]] or [[beta sheet]], these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein, this is its overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, whilst most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the [[protein quaternary structure|quaternary structure]]. Hence, this is a [[multi-subunit complex]] composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits <ref name=\"Khan proteins 2020\">{{cite web |title=Protein structure: Primary, secondary, tertiary & quatrenary (article) |url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure |website=Khan Academy |accessdate=11 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>.\n\n==Post-translational modifications==\nCompletion of protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing in the form of post-translation modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translation modification which can occur, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Duan 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Duan |first1=Guangyou |last2=Walther |first2=Dirk |last3=Radivojac |first3=Predrag |title=The Roles of Post-translational Modifications in the Context of Protein Interaction Networks |journal=PLOS Computational Biology |date=2015 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=e1004049 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004049|doi-access=free }}</ref> Through post-translational modification, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is expanded by 2 to 3 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] <ref name=\"Schubert 2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Schubert |first1=Mario |last2=Walczak |first2=Michal J. |last3=Aebi |first3=Markus |last4=Wider |first4=Gerhard |title=Posttranslational Modifications of Intact Proteins Detected by NMR Spectroscopy: Application to Glycosylation |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=2015 |volume=54 |issue=24 |pages=7096\u20137100 |doi=10.1002/anie.201502093}}</ref>.\n\nThere are four key types of post-translational modification:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Yu-Chieh |last2=Peterson |first2=Suzanne E |last3=Loring |first3=Jeanne F |title=Protein post-translational modifications and regulation of pluripotency in human stem cells |journal=Cell Research |date=2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=143\u2013160 |doi=10.1038/cr.2013.151|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n# Cleavage\n# Addition of chemical groups\n# Addition of complex molecules\n# Formation of intramolecular bonds\n\n===Cleavage===\n[[Proteolysis|Cleavage]] of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as [[proteases]].

Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a [[phosphate]] group to specific amino acids within the protein, mainly [[serine]], [[threonine]] and [[tyrosine]], by a protein [[kinase]]. Phosphorylation can drive proteins to interact with other proteins to produce a large, multi-protein complex <ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>.\n\n===Addition of complex molecules===\nPost-translational modification can incorporate more complex, larger molecules into the mature protein structure by covalently adding the molecule onto amino acids within the polypeptide chain. One common example of this is [[glycosylation]], which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification.<ref name=\"Schubert 2015\"/>\n\nIn glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a [[glycan]]) is covalently added to a protein by enzymes known as [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycoside hydrolases|glycosidases]] in the cytoplasmic organelles the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]]. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of target protein - in some cases glycosylation of the protein is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing [[solubility]] and mediates the protein binding to [[chaperone (protein)|chaperones]].<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\nThere are broadly two types of glycosylation, [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]]. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently bound to the nitrogen atom on an [[asparagine]] amino acid within the polypeptide chain. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the covalent sequential addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen atom in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n===Formation of covalent bonds===\n[[File:Formation of disulphide covalent bonds.png|300px|thumb|Shows the formation of disulphide covalent bonds as a post-translational modification. Disulphide bonds can either form within a single polypeptide chain (left) or between polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit protein complex (right)]]\nMany proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside of the cell, therefore, these proteins function as [[extracellular]] proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a variety of conditions outside the cell. In order to stabilise the functional, 3D structure of the protein, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in a multi-subunit complex. The most prevalent type of covalent bond is a [[disulfide|disulfide bond]] (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulphide bond is formed between two [[cysteine]] amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a sulphur atom, known as [[thiol]] functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilise the [[protein structure|pre-existing conformation]] of protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an [[redox|oxidation reaction]] between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidising environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidising environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalysed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment.<ref name=\"Alberts 2015\"/>\n\n==Role of Protein Synthesis in Disease==\nMany diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the genetic code of the gene and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding and unable to function. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including [[sickle cell disease]], known as single gene disorders.\n\n[[File:Sickle Cell Anaemia red blood cells in blood vessels.png|400px|thumb|A comparison between a healthy individual and a sufferer of sickle cell anaemia showing the different red blood cell shapes and differing flow within blood vessels]]\n\nSickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of [[haemoglobin]], a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen, the most dangerous of these diseases is known as sickle cell anaemia. Sickle cell anaemia is the most common [[genetic disorder|homozygous recessive single gene disorder]], meaning the individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the gene to suffer from the disease.

This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic \"sickle\" red blood cell shape, and reduces flexibility.

At the age of 18, he fought [[George Dixon (boxer)|George Dixon]] for the World Featherweight championship and beat him in a 15-round decision. In 1904 he beat [[Johnny Reagan]] in 20 rounds. One year later, he lost the crown to Tony Sullivan but regained it in February 1906 with a decision over Jimmy Walsh.\n\nAttell successfully defended his title eighteen times between 1906\u20131912, a division record for seventy years.  Among other opponents, Attell beat [[Battling Nelson]] and [[Johnny Kilbane]] during this period. He was often called \"The Little Champ\" or \"The Little Hebrew\" by newspapers. From 1909\u20131910, his brother Monte Attell, called the \"[[Nob Hill]] Terror\", held the Bantamweight Championship, making them the first brothers to hold world titles simultaneously. His brother, Caesar Attell also fought and was called \"Two and a Half,\" for always giving that amount whenever the hat was passed for charity at a boxing event, which he attended faithfully. During his time as world featherweight champion, Attell was allegedly involved with gambler/gangster [[Arnold Rothstein]]. According to some accounts, they became good friends during this period.\n\nAttell defeated American 1905 World Bantamweight Champion [[Jimmy Walsh (American boxer)|Jimmy Walsh]] three times in title matches; on September 12, 1907 for a ten-round decision in Indianapolis, on December 7, 1906 in a ten-round TKO in Los Angeles, and on February 22, 1906 for a fifteen-round decision in Chelsea, Massachusetts, in which Attell \"badly punished\" Walsh. Not surprisingly, Attell was the odds on favorite for the December 1906 fight. He met Attell twice in non-title matches on April 3, 1913 in New York in a ten-round loss by decision and on October 24, 1912, in a twelve-round draw in Boston.  After the April 3, 1913, New York bout, Walsh's manager Eddie Keevin filed charges against Attell with the New York boxing commission stating that Attell had used eye gouging against Walsh during the fight.<ref>\"Attell and Jimmy Walsh\", ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 16, 7 December 1906</ref><ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Jimmy Walsh|url=http://boxrec.com/boxer/57680|publisher=BoxRec|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref><ref>\"Charges Filed Against Attell\", ''The Salt Lake Tribune\", Salt Lake City, Utah, pg. 8, 8 April 1913</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nAttell lost his World Featherweight Title to Johnny Kilbane in 1912, in a 20-round decision.

He was alleged to have been the bag man for gambler [[Arnold Rothstein]] and to have given $10,000 to several Chicago White Sox players. They had in return agreed to throw the World Series with Cincinnati. When the scandal broke in 1920, Attell went to Canada for a year to avoid being subpoenaed. Rothstein was never convicted of the crime.\n\n===Black Sox Scandal===\nIn 1920 Attell was accused of being the messenger between the gangster Rothstein and players of the [[Chicago White Sox]] [[baseball]] organization, during the planning stages of the [[match fixing|fix]] of the [[1919 World Series]]. Prior to the series, Attell had been approached by former fighter [[Billy Maharg]] and former [[Major League Baseball]] pitcher [[Bill Burns (baseball)|\"Sleepy\" Bill Burns]] in their bid to get Rothstein to financially back the fix. The [[Black Sox scandal]] was considered a major outrage in sports and Attell's name appeared in newspaper headlines related to the scandal. He and many White Sox players were formally charged with several counts, including fixing the event, however Rothstein was never charged. All were eventually acquitted at trial, but Major League Baseball banned them from participating in baseball activities at any level.

A copy of his passport also gives his birth year as 1883, and the 1900 U.S. Census gives his age as 17. Growing up in a mostly [[Irish people|Irish]] neighborhood, he was often involved in fights with neighborhood boys. He said as a kid, he sometimes had up to 10 bouts each day.

These species possess a unique [[Electroreception|electroreceptive]] organ known as ''[[ampullae of Lorenzini]]'' which can detect a slight variation in electric potential.  These organs are made up of mucus-filled canals that connect from the skin's pores to small sacs within the animal's flesh that are also filled with mucus.  The ampullae of Lorenzini are capable of detecting DC currents and have been proposed to be used in the sensing of the weak electric fields of prey and predators. These organs could also possibly sense magnetic fields, by means of [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]: as a conductor moves through a magnetic field an electric potential is generated. In this case the conductor is the animal moving through a magnetic field, and the potential induced depends on the time varying rate of flux through the conductor according to\n<center><math>V_{ind}=-\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}</math>.</center>\nThese organs detect very small fluctuations in the potential difference between the pore and the base of the electroreceptor sack. An increase in potential results in a decrease in the rate of nerve activity, and a decrease in potential results in an increase in the rate of nerve activity. This is analogous to the behavior of a current carrying conductor; with a fixed channel resistance, an increase in potential would decrease the amount of current detected, and vice versa.{{Clarify | date = August 2019 | reason = The two previous sentences make it sound obvious, but it isn't really obvious.

Experimental techniques such as gene knockouts have allowed a closer examination of possible magnetoreception in these fruit flies. Various ''Drosophila'' strains have been trained to respond to magnetic fields.<ref name=\"Gegear2008\" /> In a [[Preference tests (animals)|choice test]] flies were loaded into an apparatus with two arms that were surrounded by electric coils. Current was run through each of the coils, but only one was configured to produce a 5-Gauss magnetic field at a time. The flies in this T-maze were tested on their native ability to recognize the presence of the magnetic field in an arm and on their response following training where the magnetic field was paired with a sucrose reward. Many of the strains of flies showed a learned preference for the magnetic field following training. However, when the only cryptochrome found in ''Drosophila'', type 1 Cry, is altered, either through a [[missense mutation]] or replacement of the Cry gene, the flies exhibit a loss of magnetosensitivity. Furthermore, when light is filtered to only allow wavelengths greater than 420&nbsp;nm through, ''Drosophila'' loses its trained response to magnetic fields. This response to filtered light is likely linked to the action spectrum of fly-cryptochrome which has a range from 350&nbsp;nm \u2013 400&nbsp;nm and plateaus from 430-450&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = VanVickle-Chavez | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Van Gelder | first2 = R.

These species possess a unique [[Electroreception|electroreceptive]] organ known as ''[[ampullae of Lorenzini]]'' which can detect a slight variation in electric potential.  These organs are made up of mucus-filled canals that connect from the skin's pores to small sacs within the animal's flesh that are also filled with mucus.  The ampullae of Lorenzini are capable of detecting DC currents and have been proposed to be used in the sensing of the weak electric fields of prey and predators. These organs could also possibly sense magnetic fields, by means of [[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's law]]: as a conductor moves through a magnetic field an electric potential is generated. In this case the conductor is the animal moving through a magnetic field, and the potential induced depends on the time varying rate of flux through the conductor according to\n<center><math>V_{ind}=-\\frac{d\\phi}{dt}</math>.</center>\nThese organs detect very small fluctuations in the potential difference between the pore and the base of the electroreceptor sack. An increase in potential results in a decrease in the rate of nerve activity, and a decrease in potential results in an increase in the rate of nerve activity. This is analogous to the behavior of a current carrying conductor; with a fixed channel resistance, an increase in potential would decrease the amount of current detected, and vice versa.{{Clarify | date = August 2019 | reason = The two previous sentences make it sound obvious, but it isn't really obvious.

These results, though interesting, do not conclusively establish that ''Tochuina'' uses magnetic fields in magnetoreception. These experiments do not include a control for the activation of the Rubens' coil in the reversed magnetic field experiments.

Various ''Drosophila'' strains have been trained to respond to magnetic fields.<ref name=\"Gegear2008\" /> In a [[Preference tests (animals)|choice test]] flies were loaded into an apparatus with two arms that were surrounded by electric coils. Current was run through each of the coils, but only one was configured to produce a 5-Gauss magnetic field at a time. The flies in this T-maze were tested on their native ability to recognize the presence of the magnetic field in an arm and on their response following training where the magnetic field was paired with a sucrose reward. Many of the strains of flies showed a learned preference for the magnetic field following training. However, when the only cryptochrome found in ''Drosophila'', type 1 Cry, is altered, either through a [[missense mutation]] or replacement of the Cry gene, the flies exhibit a loss of magnetosensitivity. Furthermore, when light is filtered to only allow wavelengths greater than 420&nbsp;nm through, ''Drosophila'' loses its trained response to magnetic fields. This response to filtered light is likely linked to the action spectrum of fly-cryptochrome which has a range from 350&nbsp;nm \u2013 400&nbsp;nm and plateaus from 430-450&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = VanVickle-Chavez | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Van Gelder | first2 = R.

However, because of the descriptive nature of this study, alternative explanations (e.g., the sun compass) could not be excluded.  In a follow-up study, researchers analyzed body orientations of ruminants in localities where the geomagnetic field is disturbed by high-voltage power lines to determine how local variation in magnetic fields may affect orientation behaviour.  This was done by using satellite and aerial images of herds of cattle and field observations of grazing roe deer.  Body orientation of both species was random on pastures under or near power lines.  Moreover, cattle exposed to various magnetic fields directly beneath or in the vicinity of power lines trending in various magnetic directions exhibited distinct patterns of alignment.  The disturbing effect of the power lines on body alignment diminished with the distance from the conductors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Burda | first1 = H. | last2 = Begalla | first2 = S. | last3 = \u010cerven\u00fd | first3 = J. | last4 = Neefa | first4 = J. | last5 = N\u011bmecd | first5 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields disrupt magnetic alignment of ruminants | journal = Proc.

Cryptochromes have been observed in various organisms including birds and humans, but does not answer the question of night-time navigation. Iron-based systems have also been observed in birds, and if proven, could form a magnetoreceptive basis for many species including turtles. Electromagnetic induction has not been observed nor tested in non-aquatic animals. Additionally, it remains likely that two or more complementary mechanisms play a role in magnetic field detection in animals. Of course, this potential dual mechanism theory raises the question, to what degree is each method responsible for the stimulus, and how do they produce a signal in response to the low magnetic field of the Earth?<ref name=\"Rodgers, C. T. 20092\"/>\n\nThen there is the distinction of magnetic usage. Some species may only be able to sense a magnetic compass to find north and south, while others may only be able to discern between the equator and the pole. Although the ability to sense direction is important in migratory navigation, many animals also have the ability to sense small fluctuations in earth's magnetic field to compute coordinate maps with a resolution of a few kilometers or better.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=J.L. |year=2008 |title=Animal navigation: The evolution of magnetic orientation |journal=Current Biology |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=R482\u2013R48 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.03.052 |pmid=18522823}}</ref> For a magnetic map, the receptor system would have to be able to discern tiny differences in the surrounding magnetic field to develop a sufficiently detailed magnetic map. This is not out of the question, as many animals have the ability to sense small fluctuations in the earth's magnetic field. This is not out of the question biologically, but physically has yet to be explained. For example, birds such as the homing pigeon are believed to use the magnetite in their beaks to detect magnetic signposts and thus, the magnetic sense they gain from this pathway is a possible map.<ref name=\"Rodgers, C. T. 20092\" /> Yet, it has also been suggested that homing pigeons and other birds use the visually mediated cryptochrome receptor as a compass.<ref name=\"Rodgers, C.
