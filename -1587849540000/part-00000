{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

It was originally developed by [[Gary A. Kildall]]'s [[Digital Research]] and derived from [[Concurrent PC DOS]] 6.0, which was an advanced successor of [[CP/M-86]]. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including [[#Novell DOS|Novell DOS]] and [[#OpenDOS|Caldera OpenDOS]].\n\n==History==\n===Origins in CP/M===\n[[Digital Research]]'s original [[CP/M]] for the 8-bit [[Intel 8080]]- and [[Zilog Z80|Z-80]]-based systems spawned numerous spin-off versions, most notably [[CP/M-86]] for the [[Intel 8086]]/[[Intel 8088|8088]] family of processors. Although CP/M had dominated the market, and was shipped with the vast majority of non-proprietary-architecture personal computers, the [[IBM PC]] in 1981 brought the beginning of what was eventually to be a massive change.\n\n[[IBM]] originally approached Digital Research, seeking an [[x86]] version of CP/M. However, there were disagreements over the contract, and IBM withdrew. Instead, a deal was struck with [[Microsoft]], who purchased another operating system, [[86-DOS]], from [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP). This became Microsoft [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM PC DOS]]. 86-DOS' command structure and application programming interface imitated that of CP/M. Digital Research threatened legal action, claiming PC DOS/MS-DOS to be too similar to CP/M. IBM settled by agreeing to sell Digital Research's x86 version of CP/M, [[CP/M-86]], alongside PC DOS. However, PC DOS sold for $40 while CP/M-86 had a $240 price tag. The proportion of PC buyers prepared to spend six times as much to buy CP/M-86 was very small, and the availability of compatible application software, at first decisively in Digital Research's favor, was only temporary.<ref name=\"podtech\"/>\n\nDigital Research fought a long losing battle to promote CP/M-86 and its multi-tasking multi-user successors [[MP/M-86]] and [[Concurrent CP/M-86]], and eventually decided that they could not beat the Microsoft-IBM lead in application software availability, so they modified Concurrent CP/M-86 to allow it to run the same applications as MS-DOS and PC DOS.\n\nThis was shown publicly in December 1983<ref name=\"DRI_1984_PCMODE\"/> and shipped in March 1984 as [[Concurrent DOS 3.1]] (a.k.a. CDOS with [[Basic Disk Operating System|BDOS]] 3.1) to hardware vendors.<ref name=\"DRI_1984_CDOS31\"/> While Concurrent DOS continued to evolve in various flavours over the years to eventually become [[Multiuser DOS]] and [[REAL/32]], it was not specifically tailored for the desktop market and too expensive for single-user applications. Therefore, over time two attempts were made to sideline the product.\n\nIn 1985, Digital Research developed [[DOS Plus 1.0]] to [[DOS Plus 2.1|2.1]], a stripped-down and modified single-user derivative of [[Concurrent DOS 4.1]] and [[Concurrent DOS 5.0|5.0]], which ran applications for both platforms, and allowed switching between several tasks<ref name=\"DOS Plus\"/><ref name=\"Wein_2009_DOSPLUS\"/> as did the original CP/M-86. Its DOS compatibility was limited, and Digital Research made another attempt, this time a native DOS system.<ref name=\"Wein_2009_DOSPLUS\"/> This new disk operating system was launched in 1988 as DR DOS.\n\nAlthough DRI was based in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]] and later in [[Monterey, California]], the work on DOS Plus started in [[Newbury, Berkshire]], in the UK, where Digital Research Europe had its OEM Support Group located since 1983. Beginning in 1986, most of the operating system work on [[Concurrent DOS 386]] and [[Concurrent DOS XM|XM]], [[Multiuser DOS]], DR DOS and PalmDOS was done in Digital Research's European Development Centre (EDC) in [[Hungerford, Berkshire]]. Later on some work was also done by Digital Research GmbH in [[Munich]], Germany.\n\n===First DR DOS version===\nAs requested by several [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s, Digital Research started a plan to develop a new DOS operating system addressing the shortcomings left by MS-DOS in 1987.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> Of particular importance was a million dollar deal with [[Kazuhiko Nishi|Kazuhiko \"Kay\" Nishi]] of [[ASCII Corporation]], who had previously been instrumental in opening the Japanese OEM market for Microsoft.<ref name=\"Wein_2009_DOSPLUS\"/> The first DR DOS version was released on May 28, 1988.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> Version numbers were chosen to reflect features relative to MS-DOS; the first version promoted to the public was DR DOS 3.31,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> which offered features comparable to [[Compaq MS-DOS 3.31]] with large disk support ([[FAT16B]] a.k.a. \"BIGDOS\"). DR DOS 3.31 reported itself as \"IBM PC DOS 3.31\", while the internal BDOS ([[Basic Disk Operating System]]) kernel version was reported as 6.0, single-user nature, reflecting its origin as derivative of [[Concurrent DOS 6.0]] with the multitasking and multiuser capabilities as well as CP/M [[Application programming interface|API]] support stripped out and the [[XIOS]] replaced by an IBM-compatible [[DOS-BIOS]]. The system files were named [[DRBIOS.SYS]] (for the DOS-BIOS) and [[DRBDOS.SYS]] (for the BDOS kernel), the disk OEM label used was \"DIGITAL\u2420\".\n\nDR DOS offered some extended command line tools with command line help, verbose error messages, sophisticated [[command history|command line history]] and editing ([[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]] directive) as well as support for file and directory passwords built right into the kernel. It was also cheaper to license than MS-DOS, and was ROMable right from the start. The ROMed version of DR DOS was also named ROS (ROM Operating System).<ref name=\"Infoword_1988\"/> DRI was approached by a number of PC manufacturers who were interested in a third-party DOS, which prompted several updates to the system.\n\nAt this time, MS-DOS was only available to OEMs bundled with hardware. Consequently, DR DOS achieved some immediate success when it became possible for consumers to buy it through normal [[retail]] channels beginning with version 3.4.\n\nKnown versions are DR DOS 3.31 (BDOS 6.0, June 1988, OEM only), 3.32 (BDOS 6.0, August 17, 1988, OEM only), 3.33 (BDOS 6.0, September 1, 1988, OEM only), 3.34 (BDOS 6.0, OEM only), 3.35 (BDOS 6.0, October 21, 1988, OEM only), 3.40 (BDOS 6.0, January 25, 1989), 3.41 (BDOS 6.3, June 1989, OEM and retail). Like MS-DOS, most of them were produced in several variants for different hardware. While most OEMs kept the DR DOS name designation, one OEM version{{which|date=January 2020}} is known to have been called EZ-DOS 3.41.\n\n{{further|Comparison of DOS operating systems}}\n\n==={{anchor|5.0}}DR DOS 5.0===\nDR DOS version 5.0 (code-named \"Leopard\") was released in May 1990,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/><!-- or August 1990<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\"/> --> still reporting itself as \"PC DOS 3.31\" for compatibility purposes, but internally indicating a single-user BDOS 6.4 kernel. (Version 4 was skipped to avoid being associated with the relatively unpopular [[MS-DOS 4.0]].) This introduced [[ViewMAX]], a [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]-based [[GUI]] file management shell.<ref name=\"CW_1990_DR5\"/><ref name=\"Rosch_1991_DR5\"/> ViewMAX's startup screen would present the slogan \"Digital Research - We make computers work\".<ref name=\"Digital_Research_1990_We_Make_Computers_Work\"/><ref name=\"Elliott_2013_ViewMAX1\"/><ref name=\"Elliott_2013_ViewMAX2\"/> DR DOS 5.0 also introduced the patented [[BatteryMAX]] power management system, bundled disk-caching software (DRCACHE), a remote file transfer tool (FILELINK), a cursor shape configuration utility (CURSOR), and offered a vastly improved memory management system (MemoryMAX).<ref name=\"CW_1990_DR5\"/><ref name=\"Rosch_1991_DR5\"/> For compatibility purposes, the DR DOS 5.0 system files were now named [[IBMBIO.COM]] (for the DOS-BIOS) and [[IBMDOS.COM]] (for the BDOS kernel) and due to the advanced loader in the boot sector could be physically stored anywhere on disk.<ref name=\"Rosch_1991_DR5\"/> The OEM label in the boot sectors was changed to \"IBM\u2420\u24203.3\".\n\n[[File:Carry-i-front-and-rear.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Front and rear views of the ''[[Carry-I]]'' book-size diskless workstation, bundled with DR DOS 5.0, based on an [[Intel 80286]] processor and produced by Taiwan's [[Flytech Technology]] circa 1991.]]\n\nDR DOS 5.0 was the first DOS to include load-high capabilities. The kernel and data structures such as disk buffers could be [[relocation (computer science)|relocate]]d in the [[High Memory Area]] (HMA), the first 64 KB of [[extended memory]] which are accessible in [[real mode]]. This freed up the equivalent amount of critical \"base\" or [[conventional memory]], the first 640 KB of the PC's RAM \u2013 the area in which all DOS applications run.<ref name=\"Rosch_1991_DR5\"/>\n\nAdditionally, on [[Intel 80386]] machines, DR DOS's EMS memory manager allowed the operating system to load DOS device drivers into upper memory blocks, further freeing base memory.\n\nDR DOS 5.0 was the first DOS to integrate such functionality into the base OS (loading device drivers into [[upper memory block]]s was already possible using third-party software like [[QEMM]]). This allowed it, on 286 systems with supported chipsets and on 386 systems, to provide significantly more free conventional memory than any other DOS. Once drivers for a mouse, multimedia hardware and a network stack were loaded, an MS-DOS/PC DOS machine typically might only have had 300 to 400 KB of free conventional memory \u2013 too little to run much late-1980s software. In contrast to this, DR DOS 5.0, with a little manual tweaking, could load all this and still keep all of its conventional memory free \u2013 allowing for some necessary DOS data structures, as much as 620 KB out of the 640 KB. With MEMMAX +V, the conventional memory region could even be extended into unused portions of the graphics adapter card typically providing another 64 to 96 KB more free DOS memory.\n\nBecause DR DOS left so much conventional memory available, some old programs utilizing certain address wrapping techniques failed to run properly as they were now loaded unexpectedly (or, under MS-DOS, \"impossibly\") low in memory \u2013 inside the first 64 KB segment (known as \"[[low memory]]\"). Therefore, DR DOS 5.0's new MEMMAX -L command worked around this by pre-allocating a [[chunking (computing)|chunk]] of memory at the start of the memory map in order for programs to load above this barrier (but with less usable conventional memory then). By default, MEMMAX was configured for +L, so that applications could take advantage of the extra memory.\n\n==={{anchor|6.0|6.0/V}}DR DOS 6.0 / Competition from Microsoft===\n[[File:ManualDRDOS60.jpg|thumb|Novell DR DOS 6.0 manual]]\nFaced with substantial competition in the DOS arena, [[Microsoft]] responded with an announcement of a yet-to-be released MS-DOS 5.0 in May 1990.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> This would be released in June 1991<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> and include similar advanced features to those of DR DOS.<ref name=\"Dryfoos_1991_DOS5\"/> It included matches of the DR's enhancements in memory management.<ref name=\"Dryfoos_1991_DOS5\"/>\n\nAlmost immediately in September 1991, Digital Research responded with DR DOS 6.0,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> code-named \"Buxton\". DR DOS 6.0, while already at BDOS level 6.7 internally, would still report itself as \"IBM PC DOS 3.31\" to normal DOS applications for compatibility purposes.\n\nThis bundled in [[SuperStor]] on-the-fly disk compression, to maximize available hard disk space, and file deletion tracking and undelete functionality by Roger A. Gross.\n\nDR DOS 6.0 also included a task-switcher named TASKMAX<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\" /> with support for the industry-standard task-switching API<!-- INT 2Fh/4Bh --><ref name=\"Caldera_1997_Multi\" /> to run multiple applications at the same time. In contrast to Digital Research's Multi-user DOS (successor of Concurrent DOS in the multi-user products line), which would run DOS applications in pre-emptively multitasked virtual DOS machines, the DR DOS 6.0 task switcher would freeze background applications until brought back into the foreground. While it ran on x86-machines, it was able to swap to XMS memory on 286+ machines.<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\" /> TASKMAX did support some [[Copy & Paste]] facility between applications.<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\" />\n\nVia the task-switcher API, graphical user interfaces such as [[ViewMAX]]<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\" /> or [[PC/GEOS]] could register as the task manager menu and thereby replace the TASKMAX text mode menu, so that users could switch between tasks from within a GUI.\n\nMicrosoft responded with MS-DOS 6.0, which again matched some features of DR DOS 6.0.\n\nIn April 1991, a pre-release version of [[Windows 3.1]] was found to return a non-fatal error message if it detected a non-Microsoft DOS.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> This check came to be known as the [[AARD code]].<ref name=\"Chappell_AARD\"/><ref name=\"Egbert_1998\"/> It was a simple matter for Digital Research to patch DR DOS 6.0 to circumvent the AARD code 'authenticity check' in the Windows 3.1 beta by rearranging the order of two internal tables in memory (with no changes in functionality), and the patched version, named \"business update\", was on the streets within six weeks of the release of Windows 3.1.<ref name=\"CW_1992\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_History\"/> With the detection code disabled, Windows ran perfectly under DR DOS and its successor Novell DOS. The code was present but disabled in the released version of Windows 3.1.<ref name=\"DDJ\"/>\n\nIn July 1992, [[Digital Research Japan]] released DR DOS 6.0/V, a Japanese [[DOS/V]] compatible version of DR DOS 6.0.<ref name=\"Timeline_2014_DOSV\"/><ref name=\"DRDOS60V_ViewMAX\"/> A Korean version appears to have been available as well.\n\n==={{anchor|1.0}}PalmDOS===\nIn 1992 Digital Research, still under its old name but already bought by Novell in July 1991,<ref name=\"BW_1991\"/><ref name=\"Scott_1991_Merger\"/> also embarked on a spin-off product code-named \"Merlin\" and later released as NetWare PalmDOS 1, which, as its name implies, was a very resource-light DR DOS 6.0 derivative aimed at the emerging [[Palmtop]]/[[PDA]] market.<ref name=\"CW_1992_PalmDOS\"/>\n\nPalmDOS was the first operating system in the family to sport the new BDOS 7.0 kernel with native DOS compatible internal data structures instead of emulations thereof. Replacing the DOS emulation on top of a CP/M kernel by a true DOS compatible kernel helped a lot in improving compatibility with some applications using some of DOS' internal data structures and also was the key in reducing the resident size of the kernel code even further\u2014a particular requirement for the PDA market. On the other hand, introducing a genuine Current Directory Structure (CDS) imposed a limit on the depth of [[working directory|working directories]] down to 66 characters (as in MS-DOS/PC DOS), whereas previous issues of DR DOS had no such limitation due to their internal organization of directories as relative links to parent directories instead of as absolute paths. PalmDOS still reported itself as \"PC DOS 3.31\" to applications in order to keep the kernel small and not run into compatibility problems with Windows, which would expect the [[DOSMGR]] API to be implemented for any DOS version since 5.0.\n\nAs well as a ROM-executing kernel, PalmDOS had palmtop-type support for features such as [[PCMCIA]] [[PC Card]]s (with [[DOS Protected Mode Services|DPMS]] support), power management ([[BatteryMAX]] and the [[$IDLE$]] device driver with its patented dynamic idle detection<ref name=\"Dynamic_Idle_Detection\"/> by Gross and John P. Constant), [[MINIMAX]] task switcher support for [[PIM (DOS technology)|PIM]] (Personal Information Modules) applications stored and executed from ROM via [[XIP]] ([[Execute-In-Place]]), etc.\n\nThe PCMCIA stack for PalmDOS was partially written by [[Ian H. S. Cullimore]].\n\n==={{anchor|Novell DOS|7|Multi}}Novell DOS 7 / Contribution by Novell===\n[[File:Novell DOS 7 screenshot.png|alt=A screenshot of Novell DOS 7|thumb|A typical command line in Novell DOS 7]]\n'''Novell DOS''' was [[Novell]] Corporation's name for DR DOS during the period when Novell sold DR DOS, after the acquisition of Digital Research in 1991.<ref name=\"sdtimes novell v microsoft\"/><ref name=\"pcmag novell dos\"/><ref name=\"Scott_1991_Merger\"/><ref name=\"BW_1991\"/><ref name=\"Allchin_1992\"/> Regarding features and performance, it was typically at least one release ahead of [[MS-DOS]].<ref name=\"nytimes rivals boost\"/> In 1993, [[PC DOS 6.1]], [[MS-DOS 6.2]] and [[PC DOS 6.3]] were trumped by Novell's {{nowrap|DOS 7}}.<ref name=\"extremetech msdos 30\"/>\n\nNovell CEO [[Robert J.

(This was part of a massive and ultimately disastrous spending spree for Novell: they bought [[WordPerfect]] Corporation at about the same time, some of [[Borland]]'s products, and invested heavily in [[Unix]] as well.) The planned \"DR DOS 7.0\", internally named \"Panther\", intended to trump Microsoft's troubled MS-DOS 6.0, was repeatedly delayed, while Novell was working on an optionally loadable Unix-like multi-user security extension (with, if loaded, file commands like [[ATTRIB (DOS command)|ATTRIB]], [[BACKUP (DOS command)|BACKUP]], [[DELPURGE]], [[MOVE (DOS command)|MOVE]], [[TOUCH (DOS command)|TOUCH]], [[TREE (DOS command)|TREE]], [[UNDELETE (DOS command)|UNDELETE]], [[XCOPY (DOS command)|XCOPY]], [[XDEL]] and [[XDIR]] supporting an otherwise disabled /U:name command line option to select specific users or groups,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> compatible with Multiuser DOS) and two new graphical user interfaces ([[ViewMAX 3]], a derivative of GEM, and \"[[Star Trek project|Star Trek]]\", a true port of Apple's [[System 7|System 7.1]] to run under the new DR DOS multitasker named \"Vladivar\").\n\nWhen DR DOS eventually arrived in December 1993 (with localized versions released in March 1994), renamed Novell DOS 7 (a.k.a. \"NWDOS\"), and without these three components, it was a disappointment to some. It was larger and lacked some finishing touches.<ref name=\"Goodman_1994\"/>\n\nIn Germany, Novell DOS 7 was aggressively marketed with the slogan \"{{lang|de|Trau keinem DOS unter 7}}\" (''Don't trust any DOS below 7'') in the press and with free demo floppies in computer magazines.<ref name=\"ASW_1994_Novell_DOS_7\"/><ref name=\"Hill_1994_Interview\"/> The campaign aimed at 20% of the DOS market and resulted in about 1.5 million copies sold until February 1994 and more than 3000 dealers interested to carry the product.<ref name=\"ASW_1994_Novell_DOS_7\"/><ref name=\"Hill_1994_Interview\"/> Novell DOS 7 was available through various OEMs, a dedicated mail order shop and authorized dealers.<ref name=\"ASW_1994_Novell_DOS_7\"/>\n\nA major functional addition was Novell's second attempt at a peer-to-peer networking system, [[Personal NetWare]] (PNW). This was better than its predecessor, [[NetWare Lite]] (NWL), but it was incompatible with Microsoft's networking system, now growing popular with support in [[Windows for Workgroups]], [[OS/2]], and [[Windows NT]]. A considerable amount of manual configuration was needed to get both to co-exist on the same PC, and Personal NetWare never achieved much success.\n\nSince Novell DOS 7 implemented the DOSMGR API and internal data structures had been updated, its BDOS 7.2 kernel could report with a DOS version of 6.0 and OEM ID \"IBM\" without risking compatibility problems with Windows. Most tools would report this as \"PC DOS 6.1\", because IBM PC DOS 6.1 also reported as DOS 6.0 to applications.\n\nNovell DOS 7 introduced much advanced memory management including new support for DPMI ([[DOS Protected Mode Interface]]) and DPMS ([[DOS Protected Mode Services]]) as well as more flexible loadhigh options. It also introduced support for \"true\" pre-emptive multitasking of multiple DOS applications in [[virtual DOS machine]]s (VDM), a component originally named MultiMAX. This was similar to Multiuser DOS, but now on the basis of a natively DOS compatible environment, similar to Windows 386 Enhanced Mode, but without a GUI. By default, the bundled TASKMGR would behave similar to the former DR DOS 6.0 TASKMAX. However, if [[EMM386]] was loaded with the option /MULTI, EMM386 would load a natively 32-bit 386 Protected Mode operating system core providing API support for pre-emptive multitasking, multi-threading, hardware virtualization and domain management of virtual DOS machines. This API could be used by DR DOS-aware applications. If TASKMGR was run later on, it would use this API to instance the current 16-bit DOS system environment, create virtual DOS machines and run applications in them instead of using its own Real Mode task-switcher support. The multitasker was compatible with Windows, so that tasks started before launching Windows could be seen as tasks under Windows as well.\n\nNovell DOS 7 and Personal NetWare 1.0 also shipped with [[NetWars]], a network-enabled 3D [[arcade game]].\n\nNovell DOS 7 and Personal NetWare required several bug-fix releases (D70xyy with x=language, yy=number) and were not completely stable when the next development occurred. With beta versions of Microsoft's \"[[Chicago (Microsoft)|Chicago]]\" (what would later become Windows 95) in sight, Novell wound down further development on Novell DOS 7 in September 1994<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> and stopped maintenance in January 1996 after more than 15 updates.\n\n==={{anchor|Caldera|Lineo|OpenDOS|DRFAT32|WINGLUE|7.01|7.02|7.03|7.04|7.05|7.06|7.07}}After Novell===\nWhen [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] approached Novell looking for a DOS operating system to bundle with their [[OpenLinux]] distribution,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_OpenSource\"/> Novell sold the product line off to Caldera on July 23, 1996,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> by which time it was of little commercial value to them.\n\nBetween the Caldera-owned DR-DOS and competition from IBM's PC DOS 6.3, Microsoft moved to make it impossible to use or buy the subsequent Windows version, [[Windows 95]], with any DOS product other than their own. Claimed by them to be a purely technical change, this was later to be the subject of a major [[Caldera v. Microsoft|lawsuit]] brought in [[Salt Lake City]] by Caldera with the help of the [[Canopy Group]].<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_Fullstory_Tech\"/> Microsoft lawyers tried repeatedly to have the case dismissed but without success. Immediately after the completion of the pre-trial deposition stage (where the parties list the evidence they intend to present), there was an out-of-court settlement on January 7, 2000 for an undisclosed sum.<ref name=\"BBC_CalderaMicrosoft\"/><ref name=\"Gomes_2000_Settlement\"/> This was revealed in November 2009 to be $280 million.<ref name=\"Groklaw_2009_NovellWP\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2009_Memorandum\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_Microsoft_2000_Settlement\"/><ref name=\"Gomes_2000_Settlement\"/>\n\nIn August 1996, the US-based Caldera, Inc. was approached by Roger A. Gross, one of the original DR-DOS engineers, with a proposal to restart DR-DOS development and to make Windows 95 run on DR-DOS which would help the court case. Following a meeting in September 1996 in [[Lindon, Utah|Lindon]], Utah, between Gross, Ransom H. Love, [[Bryan Wayne Sparks]] and [[Raymond John Noorda]], Gross was hired and tasked to set up a new subsidiary in the UK. On September 10, 1996, Caldera announced the coming release of OpenDOS (COD) and their intent to also release the source code to the system,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_OpenSource\"/> and Caldera UK Ltd. was incorporated on September 20, 1996.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_UK\"/> Gross hired some of the original developers of the operating system from the Novell EDC as well as some new talents to continue work on the operating system in a converted barn at the periphery of [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], Hampshire, UK, nearby the former Digital Research and Novell EDC. Besides other improvements and enhancements all over the system, a string of new key features were added subsequently over the course of the next two years, including a [[TCP/IP]] stack (derived from [[LAN WorkPlace for DOS]] / [[NetWare Mobile]]), a graphical 32-bit DOS Protected Mode [[HTML 3.2]] web-browser [[DR-WebSpyder]] (originally based on source code from the [[Arachne (web browser)|Arachne]] web browser by [[Michal Pol\u00e1k (programmer)|Michal Pol\u00e1k]]) with LAN and modem dialup, a [[POSIX]] [[Pthreads]] extension to the multi-tasker by Andy T. Wightman, [[long filename]] (LONGNAME) support by Edward N. Hill, Jr., as well as [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] and [[FAT32]] support (DRFAT32) by Matthias R. Paul. Gross also hired Andrew Schulman (who had been, with Geoff Chappell, instrumental in identifying the [[AARD code]] in 1992) to work as a consultant and, in Andover, assist Paul in his work on \"WinGlue\", a secret project to create a version of DR-DOS compatible with Windows 95, [[Windows 98|98]] and [[Windows 98 SE|98 SE]] and replace its MS-DOS 7.xx component.<ref name=\"Cebit_1998_Winglue\"/><ref name=\"Lea_1998_Satellite\"/> This was demonstrated at [[CeBIT]] in March 1998,<ref name=\"Cebit_1998_Winglue\"/><ref name=\"Lea_1998_Satellite\"/> and later, in a small team, developed into \"WinBolt\", both versions of DR-DOS, which remained unreleased {{As of|2018|lc=on}}, but played an important role in the [[Caldera v. Microsoft|court case]].<ref name=\"Caldera_Fullstory_Tech\"/><ref name=\"Romano_1998_Winbolt\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_W4\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_RMD\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_HMA7\"/>\n\nCaldera UK officially released Caldera OpenDOS 7.01 on February 3, 1997, but this version was just Novell DOS 7 update 10 (as of December 1994) compiled only with the necessary adaptations to incorporate the new name in display messages as well as in [[environment variable]] and file names. It was missing a year's worth of patches which had been developed for the Novell DOS updates 11 (January 1995) to 15.2 (January 1996).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> This was due to parts of the Novell DOS sources having been lost at Novell meanwhile.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> Consequently, this version still reported an internal BDOS version of 7.2, identical to Novell DOS 7. The new suite also lacked the SETFIFO command, which had been added with one of the Novell DOS updates, as well as [[Fifth Generation Systems|Fifth Generation]]'s [[Search&amp;Destroy]] virus scanner and [[FastBack Plus 2.0]] utility, which previously came bundled with Novell DOS. Instead it came bundled with a newer version of [[PNUNPACK]] and brought a much advanced version of [[Advanced NetWars|NetWars]].<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\nParts of OpenDOS 7.01 were released as [[open-source software|open source]]<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_OpenSource\"/> in form of the M.R.S. kit (for Machine Readable Sources) in May 1997, but with [[software license|license]] terms mostly incompatible with existing [[open-source license]]s. The source was then [[proprietary software|closed]] again as Gross felt this would undermine the commercial aspirations of the system.\n\nAfter beta releases in September and November 1997, the next official release came in December 1997, with the name changed to Caldera DR-OpenDOS 7.02, soon followed by a further release in March 1998, when the DR-DOS name returned as Caldera DR-DOS 7.02,<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_Doctor\"/> now for the first time written with a hyphen. Version 7.02 (now reporting itself as BDOS 7.3) incorporated improved BIOS and BDOS issues, developed by Paul,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Brown_RBIL\"/> adding many new boot and configuration options, integrating many compatibility enhancements, bug-fixes and optimizations for size and speed, and re-implementing all fixes of the missing Novell DOS updates.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Brown_RBIL\"/> The BIOS improved the coexistence of DR-DOS with [[Windows 9x]] and its support for third-party disk compression drivers such as Microsoft's [[DriveSpace]].<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_COMMAND\"/> It introduced a diagnostics mode (activated by [[Scroll Lock]]),<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/> integrated debugger support (with [[DEBUG (CONFIG.SYS directive)|DEBUG=ON]] and a debugger loaded before or from within CONFIG.SYS)<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> and more flexible CONFIG.SYS tracing capabilities via the {{keypress|F5}}/{{keypress|F6}}/{{keypress|F7}}/{{keypress|F8}} hotkeys<!-- NB. partial {{keypress|F5}} and {{keypress|F8}} support existed earlier. --> and the [[TRACE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|TRACE]] and [[TIMEOUT (CONFIG.SYS directive)|TIMEOUT]] commands<!-- NB. TIMEOUT was not new, but significantly enhanced with this version. -->,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/> thereby also improving the integration of alternative command line shells such as [[4DOS]].<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/><ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> Together with LOADER, SYS /DR:ext and the [[CHAIN (CONFIG.SYS directive)|CHAIN]] directive, it brought enhanced multi-configuration support for [[DCONFIG.SYS|DR/D/CONFIG.ext]] files<!-- NB. Neither of this was completely new, but the concept was significantly expanded with 7.02. --><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_CHAIN\"/> and came with enhancements to the BASIC-like CONFIG.SYS language<!-- NB. This configuration language already existed in previous versions of DR-DOS, but was significantly extended with 7.02, with added commands and parameters as well as behavioural changes. --> for more powerful boot menus, convenient user interaction<ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/> and programmatical acting upon conditions ([[CPU386 (CONFIG.SYS directive)|CPU386]]), return codes and error levels ([[ERROR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|ERROR]], [[ONERROR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|ONERROR]]).<!-- NB. ERROR and ONERROR were not new, but significantly enhanced with this version. --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> It also allowed to change the [[SCROLLOCK (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SCROLLOCK]], [[CAPSLOCK (CONFIG.SYS directive)|CAPSLOCK]], [[INSERT (CONFIG.SYS directive)|INSERT]] and [[VERIFY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|VERIFY]] settings as well as the [[SWITCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHAR]], [[YESCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|YESCHAR]],<!-- YESCHAR was not new, but was expanded with this release --> [[NOCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|NOCHAR]] and [[RESUMECHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|RESUMECHAR]] characters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/> Various behavioural details could be controlled with new parameters /Q (Quiet), /L (Lowercase), /Y (Yes) and /S (Switch) for [[SWITCHES (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHES]].<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> Further, it provided optional support for a LPT4: device and allowed to configure the built-in [[COM1 (CONFIG.SYS directive)|COMx:]] and [[LPT1 (CONFIG.SYS directive)|LPTx:]] devices as well as to change the [[PRN (CONFIG.SYS directive)|PRN:]] and [[AUX (CONFIG.SYS directive)|AUX:]] defaults.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> The handling of environment variables in CONFIG.SYS was improved and new load-high facilities included such as the [[HIFILES (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HIFILES]]/[[FILESHIGH (CONFIG.SYS directive)|FILESHIGH]] and [[HIFCBS (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HIFCBS]]/[[FCBSHIGH (CONFIG.SYS directive)|FCBSHIGH]] options to relocate file handles and FCB structures into UMBs, which typically gave between 1 and 4 KB (and up to 15 KB) more free conventional memory compared to previous versions, or the [[HISHELL (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISHELL]]/[[SHELLHIGH (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SHELLHIGH]] SIZE directive to control the pre-allocation of HMA memory for [[COMMAND.COM]], which helped to avoid memory fragmentation and thereby typically gave between 5 and 8 KB more continuous HMA memory for HMA-capable third-party drivers<!-- such as ANSIPLUS --> to work with in conjunction with third-party command line shells<!-- such as 4DOS -->, which could not load into the HMA as COMMAND.COM with its /MH option.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/> At a reduced memory footprint version 7.02 also brought an enhanced [[National Language Support|NLS]] 4.xx sub-system by Paul to allow multiple, distributed and possibly user-configured COUNTRY.SYS files to be used by the system at the same time in a hierarchical model.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_Enhancements\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/> This also gave dynamic parser support for MS-DOS/PC DOS COUNTRY.SYS file formats in addition to DR-DOS' own COUNTRY.SYS formats,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_Enhancements\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_CODEPAGE\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> and it introduced support for the [[ISO 8601]] international date format<ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/> (including automatic detection) and the then-new [[Euro currency]].<ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/> Some DR-DOS files such as IBMBIO.COM, IBMDOS.COM and COUNTRY.SYS carried misleading file extensions for compatibility reasons; with DR-DOS 7.02 they were enhanced to incorporate a [[fat binary]]-style safety feature devised by Paul so that they would exit gracefully when called inappropriately.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/> DR-DOS 7.02 was fully [[Year 2000 problem|Year 2000]] compliant and provided special support to work with buggy system BIOSes. It also came with an updated [[FDISK]], which could partition and format FAT32 volumes (but not yet work with LBA). The sources of the Novell patches for the external tools and drivers had meanwhile been found in Germany and could thus be retro-fitted into the system as well, so that DR-DOS 7.02 finally not only caught up with Novell DOS 7, but was a true step forward. The release was followed by various updates in June, August and September 1998.\n\nThe updated internal BDOS version number introduced a new problem: some legacy third-party applications with special support for Novell DOS, which were no longer being updated, stopped working. [[SETVER]] already allowed Novell DOS to disguise itself as DOS versions by file name and globally and, specifying a magic sub-version of 255, it would even disable its own internal BDOS version check in order to cope with programs specifically probing for \"DR-DOS\".<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> The modified kernel and SETVER driver by Paul would, in an hierarchical model, also support load paths in order to distinguish between multiple executables of the same file name, and it introduced an extended mode, in which SETVER could not only fake DOS versions, but also BDOS kernel versions.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> Sub-versions of 128 to 255 would be reported as DOS sub-versions 0 to 127 to applications, but with the BDOS version check disabled, while sub-versions 100 to 127 could be used to fake different BDOS versions,<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> whereas the DOS revision number (typically set to 0 in a static, pre-boot patchable data structure) would be taken as the reported sub-version instead, so that SETVER /G /X 6.114 would allow versions of DR-DOS since 7.02 to still report themselves as a \"DOS 6.0\" and with a faked BDOS version 7.2 (114 decimal = 72 hexadecimal), thereby masquerading as Novell DOS 7 / OpenDOS 7.01.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/>\n\nWhile otherwise beneficial, the new HIFILES triggered a compatibility problem in the DOS-UP feature of the third-party memory manager QEMM 8, which was hard-wired to expect a [[chunking (computing)|chunk]] of five handle structures in conventional memory under DR-DOS (as with previous versions up to 7.01), whereas version 7.02 by design left eight handles in low memory when loading high files in order to maintain full compatibility with older versions of Windows 3.xx.<ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/> Compatibility with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 had not been affected by this. A maintenance fix was devised to patch a single byte in IBMBIO.COM in order to switch the behaviour and optionally re-invoke the old chunking. This freed some 150 bytes of conventional memory and enabled full compatibility with DOS-UP, but at the same time broke compatibility with older versions of Windows 3.xx when using the HIFILES feature, and vice versa. The patch named IBMBIO85.SCR continued to work with newer versions of DR-DOS.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_IBMBIO85\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_IBMBIO85_106\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2003_IBMBIO85_108\"/>\n\nIn August 1998<ref name=\"Jones_2004\"/><!-- NB. Caldera Thin Clients was incorporated in August 1998, and Caldera Systems on 1998-08-21. Press release was on 1998-09-02, but contracts date 1998-09-01. --> the US-based Caldera, Inc. created two new subsidiaries, [[Caldera Systems]], Inc. for the Linux business, and [[Caldera Thin Clients]], Inc. for the embedded and thin-client market.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_Subsidiaries\"/>\n\nAnother version, DR-DOS 7.03 (still with BDOS 7.3 and reporting itself to applications as \"PC DOS 6.0\" for compatibility purposes), was pre-released at Christmas 1998 and then officially released on January 6, 1999 by Caldera UK. It came with significantly improved memory managers (in particular enhanced DPMI support in conjunction with the multitasker) and other enhancements, such as added DEVLOAD and DRMOUSE utilities, but a changed [[FAT OEM label|OEM label]] in the boot sector of volumes formatted under DR-DOS could also cause problems under other operating systems (which can be circumvented by NOVOLTRK).<ref name=\"Paul_2002_OEM\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_OEM\"/> DR-DOS 7.03 would become the last version of DR-DOS also tailored for desktop use.<!-- so far, 2018 -->\n\nCaldera, Inc.<!-- or Caldera Thin Clients, Inc. --> wanted to relocate the DR-DOS business into the US and closed the highly successful UK operation<ref name=\"Richardson_1999_Ball\"/><ref name=\"Collins_2000\"/> in February 1999<ref name=\"Lea_1999_UK\"/> after Gross resigned and set up iCentrix to develop the [[MarioNet split web browser]]. Development was then moved into the US (which never worked out due to a total lack of expertise in this field at Caldera US),<ref name=\"Lea_1999_UK\"/> and the DR-DOS line fell to its branch company, Caldera Thin Clients, which was renamed [[Lineo]], Inc. on July 20, 1999.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Lineo\"/><ref name=\"Richardson_1999_Ball\"/> DR-WebSpyder was renamed [[Embrowser]] and was said to be ported to Linux.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Lineo\"/> Lineo re-released DR-DOS 7.03 in June and September 1999, still branded as \"Caldera DR-DOS\"<ref name=\"History\"/> and without any changes, but otherwise focussed on [[Linux]] for embedded systems, based on a stripped-down version of OpenLinux named [[Embedix]].<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Lineo\"/><ref name=\"Richardson_1999_Ball\"/>\n\nAmong the latest and independently developed versions of DR-DOS were OEM DR-DOS 7.04 (as of August 19, 1999)<ref name=\"Paul_2001_IBMBIO85_106\"/> and 7.05 (as of November 30, 1999), still branded as \"Caldera DR-DOS\".<ref name=\"Moriy_autoexec\"/><ref name=\"moriy_config\"/> These were variants of the system consisting only of the kernel and command shell. With a specialized native implementation of FAT32 and large hard disk support they could be found bundled with [[Ontrack]]'s Easy Recovery 5 in 2000, replacing the dynamically-loadable DRFAT32 redirector driver, which still came with Easy Recovery 4.<ref name=\"ct_2000\" /><ref name=\"OnTrack_1999_ER\" /> They were also used for [[Seagate Technology]]'s [[SeaTools]]<ref name=\"reimagery\"/> and the CD imaging software [[Nero Burning ROM]]. While still reporting a BDOS 7.3 internally, these were the first versions to report themselves as \"PC DOS 7.10\" to applications in order to indicate integrated FAT32 support. Designed to be mostly backwards-compatible, the DR-DOS 7.04/7.05 IBMBIO.COM could be combined with the DR-DOS 7.03 IBMDOS.COM in order to give the desktop-approved DR-DOS 7.03 kernel LBA capabilities and work with drives larger than 8 GB. For specific OEM requirements, DR-DOS 7.06 (as of December 14, 1999)<ref name=\"Paul_2003_IBMBIO85_108\"/> by Wightman combined the kernel files into a single binary executable, so that, similar to [[IO.SYS]] of [[Windows 98]], it could be booted by MS-DOS 7.10 [[boot sector]]s (but no longer by DR-DOS boot sectors). DR-DOS 7.07 (with BDOS 7.4/7.7) by Paul introduced new [[Booting|bootstrap]] loaders and updated disk tools in order to combine support for [[Cylinder-head-sector|CHS]] and LBA disk access, the [[FAT12]], [[FAT16]] and FAT32 file systems, and the differing bootstrapping conventions of DR-DOS, PC DOS, MS-DOS, Windows<!-- dual-boot -->, [[REAL/32]] and LOADER into a single [[NEWLDR]] [[Master Boot Record|MBR]] and boot sector, so that the code would continue to load any version of DR-DOS down to 3.31 (and since DR-DOS 7.04 also with FAT32 support), but could also be used to launch the PC DOS or MS-DOS system files, including those of Windows 9x and PC DOS 7.10. At the same time the kernel could not only be booted by the new sectors, but also by any previously DR-DOS formatted disks, as well as off disks with existing PC DOS or MS-DOS boot sectors and a variety of other boot-loaders, thereby easing the coexistence and setup of [[multi-boot]] scenarios in conjunction with other operating systems.\n\n===Recent versions===\nIn 2002, Lineo was bought out, and some of Lineo's former managers purchased the name and formed a new company, DRDOS, Inc. dba [[DeviceLogics]] L.L.C. They have continued to sell DR-DOS for use in embedded systems. DR-DOS 8.0 was released on March 30, 2004 featuring FAT32 and large disk support, the ability to boot from ROM or Flash, multitasking and a DPMI memory manager. This version was based on the kernel from version 7.03.<ref name=\"freedos\"/>\n\nThe company later released DR-DOS 8.1 (with better FAT32 support) in autumn 2005. This version was instead based on OpenDOS 7.01.xx.<!-- Exact subversion xx to be determined. --> DR-DOS 8.1 was withdrawn for GPL violations (see [[#Controversies|Controversies]]).\n\nAside from selling copies of the operating system, the DRDOS, Inc. website lists a buyout option for DR-DOS; the asking price is \n{{currency|amount=25000|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}}.<ref name=\"Buyout\"/>\n\nThe OpenDOS 7.01 source code was a base for ''The DR-DOS/OpenDOS Enhancement Project'', set up in July 2002 in an attempt to bring the functionality of DR-DOS up to parity with modern PC non-Windows operating systems. The project's added native support for large disks ([[Logical block addressing|LBA]]) and the [[FAT32]] file system, and several other enhancements, including improved memory management and support for the new [[FAT32+]] file system extension which allows files of up to 256 GB in size on normal [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] partitions. DR-DOS 7.01.08 was released on July 21, 2011.<ref name=\"EDR\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\nIn October 2005, it was discovered that DR-DOS 8.1 included several utilities from [[FreeDOS]] as well as other sources, and that the kernel was an outdated version of the Enhanced DR-DOS kernel. DR DOS, Inc. failed to comply with the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) by not crediting the FreeDOS utilities to their authors and including the source code.<ref name=\"freedos\"/> After complaints from FreeDOS developers (including the suggestion to provide the source code, and hence comply with the GPL), DR DOS, Inc. instead withdrew version 8.1, and also the unaffected 8.0, from its website.\n\n==Commands==\n<!-- To be checked: JOIN -->\nAPPEND, ASSIGN, BATCH, DBG, DELQ, ERA, ERAQ, MORE and SUBST have been among the internal commands supported since DR DOS 3.31. DR DOS 5.0 removed BATCH and added HILOAD.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_DRDOS6UN\"/><ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> GOSUB, IDLE<!-- one source states 5.0+ -->, RETURN and SWITCH were added as internal commands with DR DOS 6.0.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> ASSIGN and SUBST were changed to become external commands with DR DOS 6.0.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> ECHOERR and PAUSEERR existed as internal commands in DR DOS 6.0 (and in Multiuser DOS), but were not normally enabled.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_DRDOS6UN\"/> MORE remained an internal command up to including PalmDOS, but was changed to an external command with Novell DOS 7. DBG was removed with Novell DOS 7<!--  possibly PalmDOS already? -->, LOADHIGH, LH and [[TRUENAME]]<!-- since update 8 and DR DOS 6.0 1993 --> were added as internal commands.

We even get to read the settlement agreement. It's attached as an exhibit. [\u2026] The settlement terms were sealed for all these years, but [\u2026] now that mystery is solved. [\u2026] We also find out what Caldera/[[Canopy Group|Canopy]] then paid Novell from that $280 million: $35.5 million at first, and then after Novell successfully sued Canopy in 2004, Caldera's successor-in-interest on this matter, an additional $17.7 million, according to page 16 of the Memorandum. Microsoft claims that Novell is not the real party in interest in this antitrust case, and so it can't sue Microsoft for the claims it has lodged against it, because, Microsoft says, Novell sold its antitrust claims to Caldera when it sold it DrDOS. So the exhibits are trying to demonstrate that Novell got paid in full, so to speak, via that earlier litigation. As a result, we get to read a number of documents from the Novell v. Canopy litigation. Novell responds it retained its antitrust claims in the applications market.

compatible|compatible]] [[personal computer]]s. It was originally developed by [[Gary A. Kildall]]'s [[Digital Research]] and derived from [[Concurrent PC DOS]] 6.0, which was an advanced successor of [[CP/M-86]]. As ownership changed, various later versions were produced with names including [[#Novell DOS|Novell DOS]] and [[#OpenDOS|Caldera OpenDOS]].\n\n==History==\n===Origins in CP/M===\n[[Digital Research]]'s original [[CP/M]] for the 8-bit [[Intel 8080]]- and [[Zilog Z80|Z-80]]-based systems spawned numerous spin-off versions, most notably [[CP/M-86]] for the [[Intel 8086]]/[[Intel 8088|8088]] family of processors. Although CP/M had dominated the market, and was shipped with the vast majority of non-proprietary-architecture personal computers, the [[IBM PC]] in 1981 brought the beginning of what was eventually to be a massive change.\n\n[[IBM]] originally approached Digital Research, seeking an [[x86]] version of CP/M. However, there were disagreements over the contract, and IBM withdrew. Instead, a deal was struck with [[Microsoft]], who purchased another operating system, [[86-DOS]], from [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP). This became Microsoft [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM PC DOS]]. 86-DOS' command structure and application programming interface imitated that of CP/M. Digital Research threatened legal action, claiming PC DOS/MS-DOS to be too similar to CP/M. IBM settled by agreeing to sell Digital Research's x86 version of CP/M, [[CP/M-86]], alongside PC DOS. However, PC DOS sold for $40 while CP/M-86 had a $240 price tag. The proportion of PC buyers prepared to spend six times as much to buy CP/M-86 was very small, and the availability of compatible application software, at first decisively in Digital Research's favor, was only temporary.<ref name=\"podtech\"/>\n\nDigital Research fought a long losing battle to promote CP/M-86 and its multi-tasking multi-user successors [[MP/M-86]] and [[Concurrent CP/M-86]], and eventually decided that they could not beat the Microsoft-IBM lead in application software availability, so they modified Concurrent CP/M-86 to allow it to run the same applications as MS-DOS and PC DOS.\n\nThis was shown publicly in December 1983<ref name=\"DRI_1984_PCMODE\"/> and shipped in March 1984 as [[Concurrent DOS 3.1]] (a.k.a. CDOS with [[Basic Disk Operating System|BDOS]] 3.1) to hardware vendors.<ref name=\"DRI_1984_CDOS31\"/> While Concurrent DOS continued to evolve in various flavours over the years to eventually become [[Multiuser DOS]] and [[REAL/32]], it was not specifically tailored for the desktop market and too expensive for single-user applications. Therefore, over time two attempts were made to sideline the product.\n\nIn 1985, Digital Research developed [[DOS Plus 1.0]] to [[DOS Plus 2.1|2.1]], a stripped-down and modified single-user derivative of [[Concurrent DOS 4.1]] and [[Concurrent DOS 5.0|5.0]], which ran applications for both platforms, and allowed switching between several tasks<ref name=\"DOS Plus\"/><ref name=\"Wein_2009_DOSPLUS\"/> as did the original CP/M-86. Its DOS compatibility was limited, and Digital Research made another attempt, this time a native DOS system.<ref name=\"Wein_2009_DOSPLUS\"/> This new disk operating system was launched in 1988 as DR DOS.\n\nAlthough DRI was based in [[Pacific Grove, California|Pacific Grove]] and later in [[Monterey, California]], the work on DOS Plus started in [[Newbury, Berkshire]], in the UK, where Digital Research Europe had its OEM Support Group located since 1983. Beginning in 1986, most of the operating system work on [[Concurrent DOS 386]] and [[Concurrent DOS XM|XM]], [[Multiuser DOS]], DR DOS and PalmDOS was done in Digital Research's European Development Centre (EDC) in [[Hungerford, Berkshire]]. Later on some work was also done by Digital Research GmbH in [[Munich]], Germany.\n\n===First DR DOS version===\nAs requested by several [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s, Digital Research started a plan to develop a new DOS operating system addressing the shortcomings left by MS-DOS in 1987.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> Of particular importance was a million dollar deal with [[Kazuhiko Nishi|Kazuhiko \"Kay\" Nishi]] of [[ASCII Corporation]], who had previously been instrumental in opening the Japanese OEM market for Microsoft.<ref name=\"Wein_2009_DOSPLUS\"/> The first DR DOS version was released on May 28, 1988.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> Version numbers were chosen to reflect features relative to MS-DOS; the first version promoted to the public was DR DOS 3.31,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> which offered features comparable to [[Compaq MS-DOS 3.31]] with large disk support ([[FAT16B]] a.k.a. \"BIGDOS\"). DR DOS 3.31 reported itself as \"IBM PC DOS 3.31\", while the internal BDOS ([[Basic Disk Operating System]]) kernel version was reported as 6.0, single-user nature, reflecting its origin as derivative of [[Concurrent DOS 6.0]] with the multitasking and multiuser capabilities as well as CP/M [[Application programming interface|API]] support stripped out and the [[XIOS]] replaced by an IBM-compatible [[DOS-BIOS]]. The system files were named [[DRBIOS.SYS]] (for the DOS-BIOS) and [[DRBDOS.SYS]] (for the BDOS kernel), the disk OEM label used was \"DIGITAL\u2420\".\n\nDR DOS offered some extended command line tools with command line help, verbose error messages, sophisticated [[command history|command line history]] and editing ([[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]] directive) as well as support for file and directory passwords built right into the kernel. It was also cheaper to license than MS-DOS, and was ROMable right from the start. The ROMed version of DR DOS was also named ROS (ROM Operating System).<ref name=\"Infoword_1988\"/> DRI was approached by a number of PC manufacturers who were interested in a third-party DOS, which prompted several updates to the system.\n\nAt this time, MS-DOS was only available to OEMs bundled with hardware. Consequently, DR DOS achieved some immediate success when it became possible for consumers to buy it through normal [[retail]] channels beginning with version 3.4.\n\nKnown versions are DR DOS 3.31 (BDOS 6.0, June 1988, OEM only), 3.32 (BDOS 6.0, August 17, 1988, OEM only), 3.33 (BDOS 6.0, September 1, 1988, OEM only), 3.34 (BDOS 6.0, OEM only), 3.35 (BDOS 6.0, October 21, 1988, OEM only), 3.40 (BDOS 6.0, January 25, 1989), 3.41 (BDOS 6.3, June 1989, OEM and retail). Like MS-DOS, most of them were produced in several variants for different hardware. While most OEMs kept the DR DOS name designation, one OEM version{{which|date=January 2020}} is known to have been called EZ-DOS 3.41.\n\n{{further|Comparison of DOS operating systems}}\n\n==={{anchor|5.0}}DR DOS 5.0===\nDR DOS version 5.0 (code-named \"Leopard\") was released in May 1990,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/><!-- or August 1990<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\"/> --> still reporting itself as \"PC DOS 3.31\" for compatibility purposes, but internally indicating a single-user BDOS 6.4 kernel. (Version 4 was skipped to avoid being associated with the relatively unpopular [[MS-DOS 4.0]].) This introduced [[ViewMAX]], a [[Graphics Environment Manager|GEM]]-based [[GUI]] file management shell.<ref name=\"CW_1990_DR5\"/><ref name=\"Rosch_1991_DR5\"/> ViewMAX's startup screen would present the slogan \"Digital Research - We make computers work\".<ref name=\"Digital_Research_1990_We_Make_Computers_Work\"/><ref name=\"Elliott_2013_ViewMAX1\"/><ref name=\"Elliott_2013_ViewMAX2\"/> DR DOS 5.0 also introduced the patented [[BatteryMAX]] power management system, bundled disk-caching software (DRCACHE), a remote file transfer tool (FILELINK), a cursor shape configuration utility (CURSOR), and offered a vastly improved memory management system (MemoryMAX).<ref name=\"CW_1990_DR5\"/><ref name=\"Rosch_1991_DR5\"/> For compatibility purposes, the DR DOS 5.0 system files were now named [[IBMBIO.COM]] (for the DOS-BIOS) and [[IBMDOS.COM]] (for the BDOS kernel) and due to the advanced loader in the boot sector could be physically stored anywhere on disk.<ref name=\"Rosch_1991_DR5\"/> The OEM label in the boot sectors was changed to \"IBM\u2420\u24203.3\".\n\n[[File:Carry-i-front-and-rear.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Front and rear views of the ''[[Carry-I]]'' book-size diskless workstation, bundled with DR DOS 5.0, based on an [[Intel 80286]] processor and produced by Taiwan's [[Flytech Technology]] circa 1991.]]\n\nDR DOS 5.0 was the first DOS to include load-high capabilities. The kernel and data structures such as disk buffers could be [[relocation (computer science)|relocate]]d in the [[High Memory Area]] (HMA), the first 64 KB of [[extended memory]] which are accessible in [[real mode]]. This freed up the equivalent amount of critical \"base\" or [[conventional memory]], the first 640 KB of the PC's RAM \u2013 the area in which all DOS applications run.<ref name=\"Rosch_1991_DR5\"/>\n\nAdditionally, on [[Intel 80386]] machines, DR DOS's EMS memory manager allowed the operating system to load DOS device drivers into upper memory blocks, further freeing base memory.\n\nDR DOS 5.0 was the first DOS to integrate such functionality into the base OS (loading device drivers into [[upper memory block]]s was already possible using third-party software like [[QEMM]]). This allowed it, on 286 systems with supported chipsets and on 386 systems, to provide significantly more free conventional memory than any other DOS. Once drivers for a mouse, multimedia hardware and a network stack were loaded, an MS-DOS/PC DOS machine typically might only have had 300 to 400 KB of free conventional memory \u2013 too little to run much late-1980s software. In contrast to this, DR DOS 5.0, with a little manual tweaking, could load all this and still keep all of its conventional memory free \u2013 allowing for some necessary DOS data structures, as much as 620 KB out of the 640 KB. With MEMMAX +V, the conventional memory region could even be extended into unused portions of the graphics adapter card typically providing another 64 to 96 KB more free DOS memory.\n\nBecause DR DOS left so much conventional memory available, some old programs utilizing certain address wrapping techniques failed to run properly as they were now loaded unexpectedly (or, under MS-DOS, \"impossibly\") low in memory \u2013 inside the first 64 KB segment (known as \"[[low memory]]\"). Therefore, DR DOS 5.0's new MEMMAX -L command worked around this by pre-allocating a [[chunking (computing)|chunk]] of memory at the start of the memory map in order for programs to load above this barrier (but with less usable conventional memory then). By default, MEMMAX was configured for +L, so that applications could take advantage of the extra memory.\n\n==={{anchor|6.0|6.0/V}}DR DOS 6.0 / Competition from Microsoft===\n[[File:ManualDRDOS60.jpg|thumb|Novell DR DOS 6.0 manual]]\nFaced with substantial competition in the DOS arena, [[Microsoft]] responded with an announcement of a yet-to-be released MS-DOS 5.0 in May 1990.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> This would be released in June 1991<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> and include similar advanced features to those of DR DOS.<ref name=\"Dryfoos_1991_DOS5\"/> It included matches of the DR's enhancements in memory management.<ref name=\"Dryfoos_1991_DOS5\"/>\n\nAlmost immediately in September 1991, Digital Research responded with DR DOS 6.0,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> code-named \"Buxton\". DR DOS 6.0, while already at BDOS level 6.7 internally, would still report itself as \"IBM PC DOS 3.31\" to normal DOS applications for compatibility purposes.\n\nThis bundled in [[SuperStor]] on-the-fly disk compression, to maximize available hard disk space, and file deletion tracking and undelete functionality by Roger A. Gross.\n\nDR DOS 6.0 also included a task-switcher named TASKMAX<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\" /> with support for the industry-standard task-switching API<!-- INT 2Fh/4Bh --><ref name=\"Caldera_1997_Multi\" /> to run multiple applications at the same time. In contrast to Digital Research's Multi-user DOS (successor of Concurrent DOS in the multi-user products line), which would run DOS applications in pre-emptively multitasked virtual DOS machines, the DR DOS 6.0 task switcher would freeze background applications until brought back into the foreground. While it ran on x86-machines, it was able to swap to XMS memory on 286+ machines.<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\" /> TASKMAX did support some [[Copy & Paste]] facility between applications.<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\" />\n\nVia the task-switcher API, graphical user interfaces such as [[ViewMAX]]<ref name=\"Salemi_1991_DR6\" /> or [[PC/GEOS]] could register as the task manager menu and thereby replace the TASKMAX text mode menu, so that users could switch between tasks from within a GUI.\n\nMicrosoft responded with MS-DOS 6.0, which again matched some features of DR DOS 6.0.\n\nIn April 1991, a pre-release version of [[Windows 3.1]] was found to return a non-fatal error message if it detected a non-Microsoft DOS.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> This check came to be known as the [[AARD code]].<ref name=\"Chappell_AARD\"/><ref name=\"Egbert_1998\"/> It was a simple matter for Digital Research to patch DR DOS 6.0 to circumvent the AARD code 'authenticity check' in the Windows 3.1 beta by rearranging the order of two internal tables in memory (with no changes in functionality), and the patched version, named \"business update\", was on the streets within six weeks of the release of Windows 3.1.<ref name=\"CW_1992\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Statement_of_facts\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_History\"/> With the detection code disabled, Windows ran perfectly under DR DOS and its successor Novell DOS. The code was present but disabled in the released version of Windows 3.1.<ref name=\"DDJ\"/>\n\nIn July 1992, [[Digital Research Japan]] released DR DOS 6.0/V, a Japanese [[DOS/V]] compatible version of DR DOS 6.0.<ref name=\"Timeline_2014_DOSV\"/><ref name=\"DRDOS60V_ViewMAX\"/> A Korean version appears to have been available as well.\n\n==={{anchor|1.0}}PalmDOS===\nIn 1992 Digital Research, still under its old name but already bought by Novell in July 1991,<ref name=\"BW_1991\"/><ref name=\"Scott_1991_Merger\"/> also embarked on a spin-off product code-named \"Merlin\" and later released as NetWare PalmDOS 1, which, as its name implies, was a very resource-light DR DOS 6.0 derivative aimed at the emerging [[Palmtop]]/[[PDA]] market.<ref name=\"CW_1992_PalmDOS\"/>\n\nPalmDOS was the first operating system in the family to sport the new BDOS 7.0 kernel with native DOS compatible internal data structures instead of emulations thereof. Replacing the DOS emulation on top of a CP/M kernel by a true DOS compatible kernel helped a lot in improving compatibility with some applications using some of DOS' internal data structures and also was the key in reducing the resident size of the kernel code even further\u2014a particular requirement for the PDA market. On the other hand, introducing a genuine Current Directory Structure (CDS) imposed a limit on the depth of [[working directory|working directories]] down to 66 characters (as in MS-DOS/PC DOS), whereas previous issues of DR DOS had no such limitation due to their internal organization of directories as relative links to parent directories instead of as absolute paths. PalmDOS still reported itself as \"PC DOS 3.31\" to applications in order to keep the kernel small and not run into compatibility problems with Windows, which would expect the [[DOSMGR]] API to be implemented for any DOS version since 5.0.\n\nAs well as a ROM-executing kernel, PalmDOS had palmtop-type support for features such as [[PCMCIA]] [[PC Card]]s (with [[DOS Protected Mode Services|DPMS]] support), power management ([[BatteryMAX]] and the [[$IDLE$]] device driver with its patented dynamic idle detection<ref name=\"Dynamic_Idle_Detection\"/> by Gross and John P.

Frankenberg]]'s strategy included \"major trimming\", selling off products like transactional database [[Btrieve]] and killing others such as Novell DOS and [[WordPerfect]]'s multimedia Main Street children's titles.<ref name=\"nytimes readies response\"/> Novell licensed technology from [[Stac Electronics]] for use in Novell DOS and its [[Network operating system]], [[NetWare]].<ref name=\"nytimes big losers\"/><ref name=\"Sheesley_2008\"/> Novell sold the product line off to [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] on July 23, 1996, after it approached Novell looking for a DOS operating system to bundle with its [[OpenLinux]] distribution,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/>\n\n[[Marc Perkel]] claimed to have had inspired Novell in February 1991 to buy Digital Research and develop something he envisioned as \"NovOS\".<ref name=\"Perkel_1991_NovOS\"/> [[Novell]] had actually bought Digital Research in July 1991 with a view to using DR's product line as a lever in their comprehensive strategy to break the Microsoft monopoly. (This was part of a massive and ultimately disastrous spending spree for Novell: they bought [[WordPerfect]] Corporation at about the same time, some of [[Borland]]'s products, and invested heavily in [[Unix]] as well.) The planned \"DR DOS 7.0\", internally named \"Panther\", intended to trump Microsoft's troubled MS-DOS 6.0, was repeatedly delayed, while Novell was working on an optionally loadable Unix-like multi-user security extension (with, if loaded, file commands like [[ATTRIB (DOS command)|ATTRIB]], [[BACKUP (DOS command)|BACKUP]], [[DELPURGE]], [[MOVE (DOS command)|MOVE]], [[TOUCH (DOS command)|TOUCH]], [[TREE (DOS command)|TREE]], [[UNDELETE (DOS command)|UNDELETE]], [[XCOPY (DOS command)|XCOPY]], [[XDEL]] and [[XDIR]] supporting an otherwise disabled /U:name command line option to select specific users or groups,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> compatible with Multiuser DOS) and two new graphical user interfaces ([[ViewMAX 3]], a derivative of GEM, and \"[[Star Trek project|Star Trek]]\", a true port of Apple's [[System 7|System 7.1]] to run under the new DR DOS multitasker named \"Vladivar\").\n\nWhen DR DOS eventually arrived in December 1993 (with localized versions released in March 1994), renamed Novell DOS 7 (a.k.a. \"NWDOS\"), and without these three components, it was a disappointment to some. It was larger and lacked some finishing touches.<ref name=\"Goodman_1994\"/>\n\nIn Germany, Novell DOS 7 was aggressively marketed with the slogan \"{{lang|de|Trau keinem DOS unter 7}}\" (''Don't trust any DOS below 7'') in the press and with free demo floppies in computer magazines.<ref name=\"ASW_1994_Novell_DOS_7\"/><ref name=\"Hill_1994_Interview\"/> The campaign aimed at 20% of the DOS market and resulted in about 1.5 million copies sold until February 1994 and more than 3000 dealers interested to carry the product.<ref name=\"ASW_1994_Novell_DOS_7\"/><ref name=\"Hill_1994_Interview\"/> Novell DOS 7 was available through various OEMs, a dedicated mail order shop and authorized dealers.<ref name=\"ASW_1994_Novell_DOS_7\"/>\n\nA major functional addition was Novell's second attempt at a peer-to-peer networking system, [[Personal NetWare]] (PNW). This was better than its predecessor, [[NetWare Lite]] (NWL), but it was incompatible with Microsoft's networking system, now growing popular with support in [[Windows for Workgroups]], [[OS/2]], and [[Windows NT]]. A considerable amount of manual configuration was needed to get both to co-exist on the same PC, and Personal NetWare never achieved much success.\n\nSince Novell DOS 7 implemented the DOSMGR API and internal data structures had been updated, its BDOS 7.2 kernel could report with a DOS version of 6.0 and OEM ID \"IBM\" without risking compatibility problems with Windows. Most tools would report this as \"PC DOS 6.1\", because IBM PC DOS 6.1 also reported as DOS 6.0 to applications.\n\nNovell DOS 7 introduced much advanced memory management including new support for DPMI ([[DOS Protected Mode Interface]]) and DPMS ([[DOS Protected Mode Services]]) as well as more flexible loadhigh options. It also introduced support for \"true\" pre-emptive multitasking of multiple DOS applications in [[virtual DOS machine]]s (VDM), a component originally named MultiMAX. This was similar to Multiuser DOS, but now on the basis of a natively DOS compatible environment, similar to Windows 386 Enhanced Mode, but without a GUI. By default, the bundled TASKMGR would behave similar to the former DR DOS 6.0 TASKMAX. However, if [[EMM386]] was loaded with the option /MULTI, EMM386 would load a natively 32-bit 386 Protected Mode operating system core providing API support for pre-emptive multitasking, multi-threading, hardware virtualization and domain management of virtual DOS machines. This API could be used by DR DOS-aware applications. If TASKMGR was run later on, it would use this API to instance the current 16-bit DOS system environment, create virtual DOS machines and run applications in them instead of using its own Real Mode task-switcher support. The multitasker was compatible with Windows, so that tasks started before launching Windows could be seen as tasks under Windows as well.\n\nNovell DOS 7 and Personal NetWare 1.0 also shipped with [[NetWars]], a network-enabled 3D [[arcade game]].\n\nNovell DOS 7 and Personal NetWare required several bug-fix releases (D70xyy with x=language, yy=number) and were not completely stable when the next development occurred. With beta versions of Microsoft's \"[[Chicago (Microsoft)|Chicago]]\" (what would later become Windows 95) in sight, Novell wound down further development on Novell DOS 7 in September 1994<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> and stopped maintenance in January 1996 after more than 15 updates.\n\n==={{anchor|Caldera|Lineo|OpenDOS|DRFAT32|WINGLUE|7.01|7.02|7.03|7.04|7.05|7.06|7.07}}After Novell===\nWhen [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] approached Novell looking for a DOS operating system to bundle with their [[OpenLinux]] distribution,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_OpenSource\"/> Novell sold the product line off to Caldera on July 23, 1996,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/> by which time it was of little commercial value to them.\n\nBetween the Caldera-owned DR-DOS and competition from IBM's PC DOS 6.3, Microsoft moved to make it impossible to use or buy the subsequent Windows version, [[Windows 95]], with any DOS product other than their own. Claimed by them to be a purely technical change, this was later to be the subject of a major [[Caldera v. Microsoft|lawsuit]] brought in [[Salt Lake City]] by Caldera with the help of the [[Canopy Group]].<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_Suit\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_Fullstory_Tech\"/> Microsoft lawyers tried repeatedly to have the case dismissed but without success. Immediately after the completion of the pre-trial deposition stage (where the parties list the evidence they intend to present), there was an out-of-court settlement on January 7, 2000 for an undisclosed sum.<ref name=\"BBC_CalderaMicrosoft\"/><ref name=\"Gomes_2000_Settlement\"/> This was revealed in November 2009 to be $280 million.<ref name=\"Groklaw_2009_NovellWP\"/><ref name=\"Microsoft_2009_Memorandum\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_Microsoft_2000_Settlement\"/><ref name=\"Gomes_2000_Settlement\"/>\n\nIn August 1996, the US-based Caldera, Inc. was approached by Roger A. Gross, one of the original DR-DOS engineers, with a proposal to restart DR-DOS development and to make Windows 95 run on DR-DOS which would help the court case. Following a meeting in September 1996 in [[Lindon, Utah|Lindon]], Utah, between Gross, Ransom H. Love, [[Bryan Wayne Sparks]] and [[Raymond John Noorda]], Gross was hired and tasked to set up a new subsidiary in the UK. On September 10, 1996, Caldera announced the coming release of OpenDOS (COD) and their intent to also release the source code to the system,<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_OpenSource\"/> and Caldera UK Ltd. was incorporated on September 20, 1996.<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_UK\"/> Gross hired some of the original developers of the operating system from the Novell EDC as well as some new talents to continue work on the operating system in a converted barn at the periphery of [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], Hampshire, UK, nearby the former Digital Research and Novell EDC. Besides other improvements and enhancements all over the system, a string of new key features were added subsequently over the course of the next two years, including a [[TCP/IP]] stack (derived from [[LAN WorkPlace for DOS]] / [[NetWare Mobile]]), a graphical 32-bit DOS Protected Mode [[HTML 3.2]] web-browser [[DR-WebSpyder]] (originally based on source code from the [[Arachne (web browser)|Arachne]] web browser by [[Michal Pol\u00e1k (programmer)|Michal Pol\u00e1k]]) with LAN and modem dialup, a [[POSIX]] [[Pthreads]] extension to the multi-tasker by Andy T. Wightman, [[long filename]] (LONGNAME) support by Edward N. Hill, Jr., as well as [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] and [[FAT32]] support (DRFAT32) by Matthias R. Paul. Gross also hired Andrew Schulman (who had been, with Geoff Chappell, instrumental in identifying the [[AARD code]] in 1992) to work as a consultant and, in Andover, assist Paul in his work on \"WinGlue\", a secret project to create a version of DR-DOS compatible with Windows 95, [[Windows 98|98]] and [[Windows 98 SE|98 SE]] and replace its MS-DOS 7.xx component.<ref name=\"Cebit_1998_Winglue\"/><ref name=\"Lea_1998_Satellite\"/> This was demonstrated at [[CeBIT]] in March 1998,<ref name=\"Cebit_1998_Winglue\"/><ref name=\"Lea_1998_Satellite\"/> and later, in a small team, developed into \"WinBolt\", both versions of DR-DOS, which remained unreleased {{As of|2018|lc=on}}, but played an important role in the [[Caldera v. Microsoft|court case]].<ref name=\"Caldera_Fullstory_Tech\"/><ref name=\"Romano_1998_Winbolt\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_W4\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_RMD\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2002_HMA7\"/>\n\nCaldera UK officially released Caldera OpenDOS 7.01 on February 3, 1997, but this version was just Novell DOS 7 update 10 (as of December 1994) compiled only with the necessary adaptations to incorporate the new name in display messages as well as in [[environment variable]] and file names. It was missing a year's worth of patches which had been developed for the Novell DOS updates 11 (January 1995) to 15.2 (January 1996).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> This was due to parts of the Novell DOS sources having been lost at Novell meanwhile.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> Consequently, this version still reported an internal BDOS version of 7.2, identical to Novell DOS 7. The new suite also lacked the SETFIFO command, which had been added with one of the Novell DOS updates, as well as [[Fifth Generation Systems|Fifth Generation]]'s [[Search&amp;Destroy]] virus scanner and [[FastBack Plus 2.0]] utility, which previously came bundled with Novell DOS. Instead it came bundled with a newer version of [[PNUNPACK]] and brought a much advanced version of [[Advanced NetWars|NetWars]].<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\nParts of OpenDOS 7.01 were released as [[open-source software|open source]]<ref name=\"Caldera_1996_OpenSource\"/> in form of the M.R.S. kit (for Machine Readable Sources) in May 1997, but with [[software license|license]] terms mostly incompatible with existing [[open-source license]]s. The source was then [[proprietary software|closed]] again as Gross felt this would undermine the commercial aspirations of the system.\n\nAfter beta releases in September and November 1997, the next official release came in December 1997, with the name changed to Caldera DR-OpenDOS 7.02, soon followed by a further release in March 1998, when the DR-DOS name returned as Caldera DR-DOS 7.02,<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_Doctor\"/> now for the first time written with a hyphen. Version 7.02 (now reporting itself as BDOS 7.3) incorporated improved BIOS and BDOS issues, developed by Paul,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Brown_RBIL\"/> adding many new boot and configuration options, integrating many compatibility enhancements, bug-fixes and optimizations for size and speed, and re-implementing all fixes of the missing Novell DOS updates.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Brown_RBIL\"/> The BIOS improved the coexistence of DR-DOS with [[Windows 9x]] and its support for third-party disk compression drivers such as Microsoft's [[DriveSpace]].<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_COMMAND\"/> It introduced a diagnostics mode (activated by [[Scroll Lock]]),<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/> integrated debugger support (with [[DEBUG (CONFIG.SYS directive)|DEBUG=ON]] and a debugger loaded before or from within CONFIG.SYS)<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> and more flexible CONFIG.SYS tracing capabilities via the {{keypress|F5}}/{{keypress|F6}}/{{keypress|F7}}/{{keypress|F8}} hotkeys<!-- NB. partial {{keypress|F5}} and {{keypress|F8}} support existed earlier. --> and the [[TRACE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|TRACE]] and [[TIMEOUT (CONFIG.SYS directive)|TIMEOUT]] commands<!-- NB.

Neither of this was completely new, but the concept was significantly expanded with 7.02. --><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_CHAIN\"/> and came with enhancements to the BASIC-like CONFIG.SYS language<!-- NB. This configuration language already existed in previous versions of DR-DOS, but was significantly extended with 7.02, with added commands and parameters as well as behavioural changes. --> for more powerful boot menus, convenient user interaction<ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/> and programmatical acting upon conditions ([[CPU386 (CONFIG.SYS directive)|CPU386]]), return codes and error levels ([[ERROR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|ERROR]], [[ONERROR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|ONERROR]]).<!-- NB. ERROR and ONERROR were not new, but significantly enhanced with this version. --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> It also allowed to change the [[SCROLLOCK (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SCROLLOCK]], [[CAPSLOCK (CONFIG.SYS directive)|CAPSLOCK]], [[INSERT (CONFIG.SYS directive)|INSERT]] and [[VERIFY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|VERIFY]] settings as well as the [[SWITCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHAR]], [[YESCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|YESCHAR]],<!-- YESCHAR was not new, but was expanded with this release --> [[NOCHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|NOCHAR]] and [[RESUMECHAR (CONFIG.SYS directive)|RESUMECHAR]] characters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_YESCHAR\"/> Various behavioural details could be controlled with new parameters /Q (Quiet), /L (Lowercase), /Y (Yes) and /S (Switch) for [[SWITCHES (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SWITCHES]].<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> Further, it provided optional support for a LPT4: device and allowed to configure the built-in [[COM1 (CONFIG.SYS directive)|COMx:]] and [[LPT1 (CONFIG.SYS directive)|LPTx:]] devices as well as to change the [[PRN (CONFIG.SYS directive)|PRN:]] and [[AUX (CONFIG.SYS directive)|AUX:]] defaults.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/> The handling of environment variables in CONFIG.SYS was improved and new load-high facilities included such as the [[HIFILES (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HIFILES]]/[[FILESHIGH (CONFIG.SYS directive)|FILESHIGH]] and [[HIFCBS (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HIFCBS]]/[[FCBSHIGH (CONFIG.SYS directive)|FCBSHIGH]] options to relocate file handles and FCB structures into UMBs, which typically gave between 1 and 4 KB (and up to 15 KB) more free conventional memory compared to previous versions, or the [[HISHELL (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISHELL]]/[[SHELLHIGH (CONFIG.SYS directive)|SHELLHIGH]] SIZE directive to control the pre-allocation of HMA memory for [[COMMAND.COM]], which helped to avoid memory fragmentation and thereby typically gave between 5 and 8 KB more continuous HMA memory for HMA-capable third-party drivers<!-- such as ANSIPLUS --> to work with in conjunction with third-party command line shells<!-- such as 4DOS -->, which could not load into the HMA as COMMAND.COM with its /MH option.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/> At a reduced memory footprint version 7.02 also brought an enhanced [[National Language Support|NLS]] 4.xx sub-system by Paul to allow multiple, distributed and possibly user-configured COUNTRY.SYS files to be used by the system at the same time in a hierarchical model.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_Enhancements\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/> This also gave dynamic parser support for MS-DOS/PC DOS COUNTRY.SYS file formats in addition to DR-DOS' own COUNTRY.SYS formats,<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_Enhancements\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_CPI\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_CODEPAGE\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> and it introduced support for the [[ISO 8601]] international date format<ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/> (including automatic detection) and the then-new [[Euro currency]].<ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/> Some DR-DOS files such as IBMBIO.COM, IBMDOS.COM and COUNTRY.SYS carried misleading file extensions for compatibility reasons; with DR-DOS 7.02 they were enhanced to incorporate a [[fat binary]]-style safety feature devised by Paul so that they would exit gracefully when called inappropriately.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_COUNTRY\"/> DR-DOS 7.02 was fully [[Year 2000 problem|Year 2000]] compliant and provided special support to work with buggy system BIOSes. It also came with an updated [[FDISK]], which could partition and format FAT32 volumes (but not yet work with LBA). The sources of the Novell patches for the external tools and drivers had meanwhile been found in Germany and could thus be retro-fitted into the system as well, so that DR-DOS 7.02 finally not only caught up with Novell DOS 7, but was a true step forward. The release was followed by various updates in June, August and September 1998.\n\nThe updated internal BDOS version number introduced a new problem: some legacy third-party applications with special support for Novell DOS, which were no longer being updated, stopped working. [[SETVER]] already allowed Novell DOS to disguise itself as DOS versions by file name and globally and, specifying a magic sub-version of 255, it would even disable its own internal BDOS version check in order to cope with programs specifically probing for \"DR-DOS\".<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> The modified kernel and SETVER driver by Paul would, in an hierarchical model, also support load paths in order to distinguish between multiple executables of the same file name, and it introduced an extended mode, in which SETVER could not only fake DOS versions, but also BDOS kernel versions.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> Sub-versions of 128 to 255 would be reported as DOS sub-versions 0 to 127 to applications, but with the BDOS version check disabled, while sub-versions 100 to 127 could be used to fake different BDOS versions,<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/> whereas the DOS revision number (typically set to 0 in a static, pre-boot patchable data structure) would be taken as the reported sub-version instead, so that SETVER /G /X 6.114 would allow versions of DR-DOS since 7.02 to still report themselves as a \"DOS 6.0\" and with a faked BDOS version 7.2 (114 decimal = 72 hexadecimal), thereby masquerading as Novell DOS 7 / OpenDOS 7.01.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_NEW703\"/>\n\nWhile otherwise beneficial, the new HIFILES triggered a compatibility problem in the DOS-UP feature of the third-party memory manager QEMM 8, which was hard-wired to expect a [[chunking (computing)|chunk]] of five handle structures in conventional memory under DR-DOS (as with previous versions up to 7.01), whereas version 7.02 by design left eight handles in low memory when loading high files in order to maintain full compatibility with older versions of Windows 3.xx.<ref name=\"Paul_2000_CONFIG\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/> Compatibility with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 had not been affected by this. A maintenance fix was devised to patch a single byte in IBMBIO.COM in order to switch the behaviour and optionally re-invoke the old chunking. This freed some 150 bytes of conventional memory and enabled full compatibility with DOS-UP, but at the same time broke compatibility with older versions of Windows 3.xx when using the HIFILES feature, and vice versa. The patch named IBMBIO85.SCR continued to work with newer versions of DR-DOS.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_OD-A3\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_IBMBIO85\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2001_IBMBIO85_106\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2003_IBMBIO85_108\"/>\n\nIn August 1998<ref name=\"Jones_2004\"/><!-- NB. Caldera Thin Clients was incorporated in August 1998, and Caldera Systems on 1998-08-21. Press release was on 1998-09-02, but contracts date 1998-09-01. --> the US-based Caldera, Inc. created two new subsidiaries, [[Caldera Systems]], Inc. for the Linux business, and [[Caldera Thin Clients]], Inc. for the embedded and thin-client market.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_Subsidiaries\"/>\n\nAnother version, DR-DOS 7.03 (still with BDOS 7.3 and reporting itself to applications as \"PC DOS 6.0\" for compatibility purposes), was pre-released at Christmas 1998 and then officially released on January 6, 1999 by Caldera UK. It came with significantly improved memory managers (in particular enhanced DPMI support in conjunction with the multitasker) and other enhancements, such as added DEVLOAD and DRMOUSE utilities, but a changed [[FAT OEM label|OEM label]] in the boot sector of volumes formatted under DR-DOS could also cause problems under other operating systems (which can be circumvented by NOVOLTRK).<ref name=\"Paul_2002_OEM\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2004_OEM\"/> DR-DOS 7.03 would become the last version of DR-DOS also tailored for desktop use.<!-- so far, 2018 -->\n\nCaldera, Inc.<!-- or Caldera Thin Clients, Inc. --> wanted to relocate the DR-DOS business into the US and closed the highly successful UK operation<ref name=\"Richardson_1999_Ball\"/><ref name=\"Collins_2000\"/> in February 1999<ref name=\"Lea_1999_UK\"/> after Gross resigned and set up iCentrix to develop the [[MarioNet split web browser]]. Development was then moved into the US (which never worked out due to a total lack of expertise in this field at Caldera US),<ref name=\"Lea_1999_UK\"/> and the DR-DOS line fell to its branch company, Caldera Thin Clients, which was renamed [[Lineo]], Inc. on July 20, 1999.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Lineo\"/><ref name=\"Richardson_1999_Ball\"/> DR-WebSpyder was renamed [[Embrowser]] and was said to be ported to Linux.<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Lineo\"/> Lineo re-released DR-DOS 7.03 in June and September 1999, still branded as \"Caldera DR-DOS\"<ref name=\"History\"/> and without any changes, but otherwise focussed on [[Linux]] for embedded systems, based on a stripped-down version of OpenLinux named [[Embedix]].<ref name=\"Caldera_1999_Lineo\"/><ref name=\"Richardson_1999_Ball\"/>\n\nAmong the latest and independently developed versions of DR-DOS were OEM DR-DOS 7.04 (as of August 19, 1999)<ref name=\"Paul_2001_IBMBIO85_106\"/> and 7.05 (as of November 30, 1999), still branded as \"Caldera DR-DOS\".<ref name=\"Moriy_autoexec\"/><ref name=\"moriy_config\"/> These were variants of the system consisting only of the kernel and command shell. With a specialized native implementation of FAT32 and large hard disk support they could be found bundled with [[Ontrack]]'s Easy Recovery 5 in 2000, replacing the dynamically-loadable DRFAT32 redirector driver, which still came with Easy Recovery 4.<ref name=\"ct_2000\" /><ref name=\"OnTrack_1999_ER\" /> They were also used for [[Seagate Technology]]'s [[SeaTools]]<ref name=\"reimagery\"/> and the CD imaging software [[Nero Burning ROM]]. While still reporting a BDOS 7.3 internally, these were the first versions to report themselves as \"PC DOS 7.10\" to applications in order to indicate integrated FAT32 support. Designed to be mostly backwards-compatible, the DR-DOS 7.04/7.05 IBMBIO.COM could be combined with the DR-DOS 7.03 IBMDOS.COM in order to give the desktop-approved DR-DOS 7.03 kernel LBA capabilities and work with drives larger than 8 GB. For specific OEM requirements, DR-DOS 7.06 (as of December 14, 1999)<ref name=\"Paul_2003_IBMBIO85_108\"/> by Wightman combined the kernel files into a single binary executable, so that, similar to [[IO.SYS]] of [[Windows 98]], it could be booted by MS-DOS 7.10 [[boot sector]]s (but no longer by DR-DOS boot sectors). DR-DOS 7.07 (with BDOS 7.4/7.7) by Paul introduced new [[Booting|bootstrap]] loaders and updated disk tools in order to combine support for [[Cylinder-head-sector|CHS]] and LBA disk access, the [[FAT12]], [[FAT16]] and FAT32 file systems, and the differing bootstrapping conventions of DR-DOS, PC DOS, MS-DOS, Windows<!-- dual-boot -->, [[REAL/32]] and LOADER into a single [[NEWLDR]] [[Master Boot Record|MBR]] and boot sector, so that the code would continue to load any version of DR-DOS down to 3.31 (and since DR-DOS 7.04 also with FAT32 support), but could also be used to launch the PC DOS or MS-DOS system files, including those of Windows 9x and PC DOS 7.10. At the same time the kernel could not only be booted by the new sectors, but also by any previously DR-DOS formatted disks, as well as off disks with existing PC DOS or MS-DOS boot sectors and a variety of other boot-loaders, thereby easing the coexistence and setup of [[multi-boot]] scenarios in conjunction with other operating systems.\n\n===Recent versions===\nIn 2002, Lineo was bought out, and some of Lineo's former managers purchased the name and formed a new company, DRDOS, Inc. dba [[DeviceLogics]] L.L.C. They have continued to sell DR-DOS for use in embedded systems. DR-DOS 8.0 was released on March 30, 2004 featuring FAT32 and large disk support, the ability to boot from ROM or Flash, multitasking and a DPMI memory manager. This version was based on the kernel from version 7.03.<ref name=\"freedos\"/>\n\nThe company later released DR-DOS 8.1 (with better FAT32 support) in autumn 2005. This version was instead based on OpenDOS 7.01.xx.<!-- Exact subversion xx to be determined. --> DR-DOS 8.1 was withdrawn for GPL violations (see [[#Controversies|Controversies]]).\n\nAside from selling copies of the operating system, the DRDOS, Inc. website lists a buyout option for DR-DOS; the asking price is \n{{currency|amount=25000|code=USD|fmt=gaps|linked=no}}.<ref name=\"Buyout\"/>\n\nThe OpenDOS 7.01 source code was a base for ''The DR-DOS/OpenDOS Enhancement Project'', set up in July 2002 in an attempt to bring the functionality of DR-DOS up to parity with modern PC non-Windows operating systems. The project's added native support for large disks ([[Logical block addressing|LBA]]) and the [[FAT32]] file system, and several other enhancements, including improved memory management and support for the new [[FAT32+]] file system extension which allows files of up to 256 GB in size on normal [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] partitions. DR-DOS 7.01.08 was released on July 21, 2011.<ref name=\"EDR\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\nIn October 2005, it was discovered that DR-DOS 8.1 included several utilities from [[FreeDOS]] as well as other sources, and that the kernel was an outdated version of the Enhanced DR-DOS kernel. DR DOS, Inc. failed to comply with the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) by not crediting the FreeDOS utilities to their authors and including the source code.<ref name=\"freedos\"/> After complaints from FreeDOS developers (including the suggestion to provide the source code, and hence comply with the GPL), DR DOS, Inc. instead withdrew version 8.1, and also the unaffected 8.0, from its website.\n\n==Commands==\n<!-- To be checked: JOIN -->\nAPPEND, ASSIGN, BATCH, DBG, DELQ, ERA, ERAQ, MORE and SUBST have been among the internal commands supported since DR DOS 3.31.

We even get to read the settlement agreement. It's attached as an exhibit. [\u2026] The settlement terms were sealed for all these years, but [\u2026] now that mystery is solved. [\u2026] We also find out what Caldera/[[Canopy Group|Canopy]] then paid Novell from that $280 million: $35.5 million at first, and then after Novell successfully sued Canopy in 2004, Caldera's successor-in-interest on this matter, an additional $17.7 million, according to page 16 of the Memorandum. Microsoft claims that Novell is not the real party in interest in this antitrust case, and so it can't sue Microsoft for the claims it has lodged against it, because, Microsoft says, Novell sold its antitrust claims to Caldera when it sold it DrDOS. So the exhibits are trying to demonstrate that Novell got paid in full, so to speak, via that earlier litigation. As a result, we get to read a number of documents from the Novell v. Canopy litigation. Novell responds it retained its antitrust claims in the applications market.

It was made 11 smaller localities, called union councils, which were in turn divided into several neighborhoods.  \n\n==History==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]], and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Lyari Town.

It was made 11 smaller localities, called Union Council, which were in turn divided into several neighborhoods.  \n\n==History==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]], and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Lyari Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced.

It offers a wide variety of international destinations. The airport, connected to the [[Costa del Sol]], has a daily link with twenty cities in Spain and over one hundred cities in Europe. Direct flights also operate to Africa, the Middle East and also to North America in the summer season. Airlines with a base at the airport are [[Air Europa]], [[Norwegian (airline)|Norwegian]], [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Ryanair]] and [[Vueling]].\n\n==History and development==\n[[File:Torre aeropuerto M\u00e1laga.jpg|thumbnail|Control tower at M\u00e1laga Airport, built in 2002]]\n[[File:M\u00e1laga Airport (5104285139).jpg|thumb|M\u00e1laga Airport]]\n[[File:Airport View.JPG|thumb|Another view of the airport]]\nM\u00e1laga Airport is one of the oldest Spanish airports that has stayed in its original location.\n\nM\u00e1laga Airport opened on 9 March 1919. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}  After test flights, the first scheduled air service from M\u00e1laga began on 1 September 1919 when [[Didier Daurat]] began regular flights between [[Toulouse]], [[Barcelona]], [[Alicante]], [[Tangier]] and [[Casablanca]].\n\nThe single runway was extended in the 1960s, and a new terminal was erected in the centre of the site. During this period of development, new navigational equipment was installed, including radar system at the end of the decade, in 1970.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe airport was given its current title in 1965. In 1968 a new passenger terminal was opened. In 1972 a second passenger terminal was opened to cater specifically for non-scheduled traffic. An increase in companies offering [[package holiday]]s (around 30 by 1965) meant that this type of traffic was providing an increasing proportion of the airport's business. The terminal was very similar to the ones that were built in [[Palma de Mallorca Airport|Palma de Mallorca]], [[Alicante Airport|Alicante]], [[Ibiza Airport|Ibiza]] and [[Girona Airport|Girona]].\n\nOn 30 November 1991, a new passenger terminal opened at the airport which is today's Terminal 2. It was designed by [[Ricardo Bofill]]. Almost all services moved their operations to this terminal when it opened with the exception of checking in.\n[[File:Terminal 3 M\u00e1laga Airport 06.jpg|thumb|Terminal 3 M\u00e1laga Airport]]\nIn 1995, the old passenger building was converted into a general aviation terminal, and a new hangar for large aircraft maintenance was built to the north of the airport site. Also constructed was a terminal specifically catering for cargo traffic a year later, along with a hangar for maintenance of big aircraft. In 1997 an enlargement of the parking of gates was built and fuel systems were added at all the gates.\n\nThe airport's domestic departures section once had the head office of [[Binter Mediterraneo]].<ref>\"World Airline Directory.\" ''[[Flight International]]''. 26 March-1 April 1997.

However, due to their routes being unpopular, the base was closed in 2007. In March 2007, [[Clickair]] opened a base at M\u00e1laga after announcing a new route to Barcelona. The base has remained since the airline merged with [[Vueling]].\n\nOn 26 February 2009, [[\u00c1ndalus L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas]] started operations from M\u00e1laga, but then ceased operations in August 2010. This was the only airline that had their main base at M\u00e1laga, until [[Helitt L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas]] opened their base in late 2011. On 16 December 2009, low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] announced a base at this airport. This would be their 38th base with an additional 19 routes, bringing Ryanair's total routes from M\u00e1laga to 39. The base opened on 23 June 2010. An extra route to [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]] was announced after the planned opening of their Barcelona base.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, the new Terminal 3 was completed. It was opened by [[King Juan Carlos]] of Spain, opening to public use the following day. On 10 September 2010, the suburban railway station at M\u00e1laga Airport was opened, providing access to catch a train to M\u00e1laga from Terminal 3.\n\nIn November 2011, [[Helitt L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas]] opened their base at M\u00e1laga, operating flights to [[Melilla Airport]] as well as opening additional routes. The company ceased operations in November 2014.\n\nOn 17 May 2012, the first commercial landings on the second runway took place for the first time. The first aircraft to use it was a PA-28 private 4 seated single engine light aircraft and the first commercial flight was Transavia Flight HV6115 from Amsterdam, operated by a Boeing 737-800. A total of 44 aircraft landed on the new runway. The runway was placed into service after the airport obtained the safety clearance of Civil Aviation on 30 April 2012.

The Airport consists of three piers or docks used by airlines: Pier B (with 13 gates, 7 with airbridges) and Pier C (with 10 gates, 7 with airbridges) in Terminal 2, and Pier D (with 20 gates, 12 with airbridges) in Terminal 3. Pier B is used for non-European traffic (as well as Schengen flights on the lower level), Pier C is used by non-Schengen Traffic and Pier D is used for Schengen Traffic. Flights to the UK and Ireland use both Pier B and Pier C. [[EasyJet]], [[EasyJet Switzerland]] & [[Ryanair]] flights check in at Terminal 2 whilst all others use Terminal 3. The terminals have a total of 164 check-in desks, and have a total of 48 boarding gates of which 26 have airbridges.\n\n===Terminal 1===\nTerminal 1 (styled as T1) opened on 30 June 1972 and was used for flights to non-Schengen destinations, along with flights to Ceuta and Mellila. On 16 March 2010, flights to non-Schengen destinations moved to Pier C in Terminal 3 and flights to Ceuta and Mellila moved to Pier D, leaving Terminal 1 operating no flights, although [[Jet2.com]] continued to checked in flights there for a short time but moved to Terminal 2 shortly afterwards. The terminal has now been closed to the public.\n\nThe terminal 1 baggage hall was shown in the episode \"The Return of the Seven: Part 1\" in series 2 of [[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]].\n\n===Terminal 2===\n[[File:Malaga aeropuerto.jpg|thumbnail|Terminal 2]]\nTerminal 2 (styled as T2) was opened on 30 November 1991, known as the [[Pablo Ruiz Picasso]] terminal. The building was designed by architect [[Ricardo Bofill]], and was built to be operated in combination with the pre-existing passenger terminal. It has three floors and a basement, the second floor is for departures and the ground floor is for arrivals. The first floor is used for the lower level for Pier B, and for alleyways leading to arrivals. The basement is for the rental-car pickup desks. To complete the terminal, a building was built for car parking and rental cars, which were built right next to the entrance of the departures and arrivals lounges.\n\nDevelopment work was completed on the terminal in 2008. The original structure leading to Pier C in departures was demolished and replaced with a temporary structure to allow building work for Terminal 3 to be completed in its place. The temporary structure was closed and removed once Terminal 3 opened and Pier C is now accessed from Terminal 3.\n\nWork in the terminal had to be done before the new terminal opened. Because terminal 1 was due to close, all of the gate numbers had to be changed. The only gate that kept its original gate number was B16. The last flight to use the original gate numbers, was an [[Aer Lingus]] flight to [[London Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]]. When Terminal 3 opened, the old arrivals waiting area was converted to a passengers transfer between terminals in the arrivals hall where three extra [[baggage carousel]]s have since been added.\n\nTerminal 2 has been refurbished since Terminal 3 has opened costing around \u20ac2.5 million.<ref name=\"airport-technology.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/malaga/|title=Malaga Airport New Terminal Building, Costa Del Sol - Airport Technology|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> The arrivals floor of Terminal 2 was refurbished in early 2011, and all the ceilings were painted between late 2013 and mid 2014. There is also currently work on the old shopping area, currently closed off. In September 2017 it was announced that Terminal 2 was to undergo a further refurbishment costing \u20ac8.4 million. This includes the improvements of the toilet facilities, new flooring and the repainting of the exterior of the building.<ref>[http://blog.altavistaproperty.com/malaga-airport-t2-refurbishment/ Malaga T2 Refurbishment]</ref> Pier C closed for refurbishment on 12 November 2018 and reopened in on 18 March 2019 while Pier B is due to be refurbished in Winter 2019.<ref>[https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/malaga/2018/11/09/aena-invertira-50-millones-euros/1045928.html]</ref>\n\n===Terminal 3===\n[[File:M\u00e1laga airport dock D.jpg|thumb|Pier D, opened on 15 March 2010]]\nTerminal 3 (styled as T3) is a new terminal at M\u00e1laga Airport.

Fairbanks. The terminal was built to increase tourism around the Costa Del Sol, and to expand the airport due to increasing number of passengers. It is adjacent to Terminal 2 and has an area of 250,000m\u00b2, which is more than double the size of Terminal 2. It has 86 check in counters, numbered 301 to 386, 20 new boarding gates, twelve which will have airbridges and 12 baggage reclaim carousels; nine European Union, two non-European Union and one special baggage reclaim carousel.\n\nThe terminal has more than doubled capacity to 30 million passengers or 9,000 an hour, is expected to double the number of flights and the 12,813,764 passengers handled during 2008,<ref>\n{{cite web\n|author=\n|title=M\u00e1laga opens Terminal 3 to double capacity\n|date=13 April 2010\n|url=http://www.anna.aero/2010/04/13/malaga-opens-terminal-3-and-invites-ryanair-to-establish-base/\n|publisher=anna.aero Airline News & Analysis\n}}\n</ref> and this has increased further since the new runway was completed.\n\n===General aviation terminal===\nThe general aviation terminal at M\u00e1laga Airport (also known as the private aviation terminal) is located next to the [[N-340]] motorway, and close by runway 31.

It offers a wide variety of international destinations. The airport, connected to the [[Costa del Sol]], has a daily link with twenty cities in Spain and over one hundred cities in Europe. Direct flights also operate to Africa, the Middle East and also to North America in the summer season. Airlines with a base at the airport are [[Air Europa]], [[Norwegian (airline)|Norwegian]], [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Ryanair]] and [[Vueling]].\n\n==History and development==\n[[File:Torre aeropuerto M\u00e1laga.jpg|thumbnail|Control tower at M\u00e1laga Airport, built in 2002]]\n[[File:M\u00e1laga Airport (5104285139).jpg|thumb|M\u00e1laga Airport]]\n[[File:Airport View.JPG|thumb|Another view of the airport]]\nM\u00e1laga Airport is one of the oldest Spanish airports that has stayed in its original location.\n\nM\u00e1laga Airport opened on 9 March 1919. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}  After test flights, the first scheduled air service from M\u00e1laga began on 1 September 1919 when [[Didier Daurat]] began regular flights between [[Toulouse]], [[Barcelona]], [[Alicante]], [[Tangier]] and [[Casablanca]].\n\nThe single runway was extended in the 1960s, and a new terminal was erected in the centre of the site. During this period of development, new navigational equipment was installed, including radar system at the end of the decade, in 1970.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe airport was given its current title in 1965. In 1968 a new passenger terminal was opened. In 1972 a second passenger terminal was opened to cater specifically for non-scheduled traffic. An increase in companies offering [[package holiday]]s (around 30 by 1965) meant that this type of traffic was providing an increasing proportion of the airport's business. The terminal was very similar to the ones that were built in [[Palma de Mallorca Airport|Palma de Mallorca]], [[Alicante Airport|Alicante]], [[Ibiza Airport|Ibiza]] and [[Girona Airport|Girona]].\n\nOn 30 November 1991, a new passenger terminal opened at the airport which is today's Terminal 2. It was designed by [[Ricardo Bofill]]. Almost all services moved their operations to this terminal when it opened with the exception of checking in.\n[[File:Terminal 3 M\u00e1laga Airport 06.jpg|thumb|Terminal 3 M\u00e1laga Airport]]\nIn 1995, the old passenger building was converted into a general aviation terminal, and a new hangar for large aircraft maintenance was built to the north of the airport site. Also constructed was a terminal specifically catering for cargo traffic a year later, along with a hangar for maintenance of big aircraft.

However, due to their routes being unpopular, the base was closed in 2007. In March 2007, [[Clickair]] opened a base at M\u00e1laga after announcing a new route to Barcelona. The base has remained since the airline merged with [[Vueling]].\n\nOn 26 February 2009, [[\u00c1ndalus L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas]] started operations from M\u00e1laga, but then ceased operations in August 2010. This was the only airline that had their main base at M\u00e1laga, until [[Helitt L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas]] opened their base in late 2011. On 16 December 2009, low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] announced a base at this airport. This would be their 38th base with an additional 19 routes, bringing Ryanair's total routes from M\u00e1laga to 39. The base opened on 23 June 2010. An extra route to [[Barcelona Airport|Barcelona]] was announced after the planned opening of their Barcelona base.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, the new Terminal 3 was completed. It was opened by [[King Juan Carlos]] of Spain, opening to public use the following day. On 10 September 2010, the suburban railway station at M\u00e1laga Airport was opened, providing access to catch a train to M\u00e1laga from Terminal 3.\n\nIn November 2011, [[Helitt L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas]] opened their base at M\u00e1laga, operating flights to [[Melilla Airport]] as well as opening additional routes. The company ceased operations in November 2014.\n\nOn 17 May 2012, the first commercial landings on the second runway took place for the first time. The first aircraft to use it was a PA-28 private 4 seated single engine light aircraft and the first commercial flight was Transavia Flight HV6115 from Amsterdam, operated by a Boeing 737-800. A total of 44 aircraft landed on the new runway. The runway was placed into service after the airport obtained the safety clearance of Civil Aviation on 30 April 2012.

It also has a General Aviation Terminal and a Cargo Terminal. Passengers can interchange between Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 both landside and airside. The Airport consists of three piers or docks used by airlines: Pier B (with 13 gates, 7 with airbridges) and Pier C (with 10 gates, 7 with airbridges) in Terminal 2, and Pier D (with 20 gates, 12 with airbridges) in Terminal 3. Pier B is used for non-European traffic (as well as Schengen flights on the lower level), Pier C is used by non-Schengen Traffic and Pier D is used for Schengen Traffic. Flights to the UK and Ireland use both Pier B and Pier C. [[EasyJet]], [[EasyJet Switzerland]] & [[Ryanair]] flights check in at Terminal 2 whilst all others use Terminal 3. The terminals have a total of 164 check-in desks, and have a total of 48 boarding gates of which 26 have airbridges.\n\n===Terminal 1===\nTerminal 1 (styled as T1) opened on 30 June 1972 and was used for flights to non-Schengen destinations, along with flights to Ceuta and Mellila. On 16 March 2010, flights to non-Schengen destinations moved to Pier C in Terminal 3 and flights to Ceuta and Mellila moved to Pier D, leaving Terminal 1 operating no flights, although [[Jet2.com]] continued to checked in flights there for a short time but moved to Terminal 2 shortly afterwards. The terminal has now been closed to the public.\n\nThe terminal 1 baggage hall was shown in the episode \"The Return of the Seven: Part 1\" in series 2 of [[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]].\n\n===Terminal 2===\n[[File:Malaga aeropuerto.jpg|thumbnail|Terminal 2]]\nTerminal 2 (styled as T2) was opened on 30 November 1991, known as the [[Pablo Ruiz Picasso]] terminal. The building was designed by architect [[Ricardo Bofill]], and was built to be operated in combination with the pre-existing passenger terminal. It has three floors and a basement, the second floor is for departures and the ground floor is for arrivals. The first floor is used for the lower level for Pier B, and for alleyways leading to arrivals. The basement is for the rental-car pickup desks. To complete the terminal, a building was built for car parking and rental cars, which were built right next to the entrance of the departures and arrivals lounges.\n\nDevelopment work was completed on the terminal in 2008. The original structure leading to Pier C in departures was demolished and replaced with a temporary structure to allow building work for Terminal 3 to be completed in its place. The temporary structure was closed and removed once Terminal 3 opened and Pier C is now accessed from Terminal 3.\n\nWork in the terminal had to be done before the new terminal opened. Because terminal 1 was due to close, all of the gate numbers had to be changed. The only gate that kept its original gate number was B16. The last flight to use the original gate numbers, was an [[Aer Lingus]] flight to [[London Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]]. When Terminal 3 opened, the old arrivals waiting area was converted to a passengers transfer between terminals in the arrivals hall where three extra [[baggage carousel]]s have since been added.\n\nTerminal 2 has been refurbished since Terminal 3 has opened costing around \u20ac2.5 million.<ref name=\"airport-technology.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/malaga/|title=Malaga Airport New Terminal Building, Costa Del Sol - Airport Technology|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> The arrivals floor of Terminal 2 was refurbished in early 2011, and all the ceilings were painted between late 2013 and mid 2014. There is also currently work on the old shopping area, currently closed off. In September 2017 it was announced that Terminal 2 was to undergo a further refurbishment costing \u20ac8.4 million. This includes the improvements of the toilet facilities, new flooring and the repainting of the exterior of the building.<ref>[http://blog.altavistaproperty.com/malaga-airport-t2-refurbishment/ Malaga T2 Refurbishment]</ref> Pier C closed for refurbishment on 12 November 2018 and reopened in on 18 March 2019 while Pier B is due to be refurbished in Winter 2019.<ref>[https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/malaga/2018/11/09/aena-invertira-50-millones-euros/1045928.html]</ref>\n\n===Terminal 3===\n[[File:M\u00e1laga airport dock D.jpg|thumb|Pier D, opened on 15 March 2010]]\nTerminal 3 (styled as T3) is a new terminal at M\u00e1laga Airport.

The Board of Directors, who supported President Donald Trump, disliked that and fired him for his criticisms of Trump and the Senate Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA).  -->\n\n==Leadership==\nFor twenty years, the company was run by Dr. Molina's son, J.
