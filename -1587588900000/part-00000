He argued that [[aggregate demand]] (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high [[unemployment]]. Keynes advocated the use of [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy|monetary]] policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic [[recession]]s and [[depression (economics)|depressions]]. He detailed these ideas in his magnum opus, ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', published in 1936. In the mid to late-1930s, leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy recommendations.

His father, [[John Neville Keynes]], was an economist and a lecturer in [[moral science]]s at the University of Cambridge and his mother [[Florence Ada Keynes]] a local social reformer. Keynes was the first born, and was followed by two more children \u2013 Margaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and [[Geoffrey Keynes]] in 1887. Geoffrey became a surgeon and Margaret married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist [[Archibald Hill]].\n\nAccording to the  [[economic historian]] and biographer [[Robert Skidelsky]], Keynes's parents were loving and attentive. They remained in the same house throughout their lives, where the children were always welcome to return. Keynes would receive considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of [[Great Depression]] in 1929. Keynes's mother made her children's interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, \"because she could grow up with her children, they never outgrew home\".<ref name=\"SkidelP1\" >\n{{cite book |last=Skidelsky |first=Robert |title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883\u20131946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman |year=2003 |isbn=0330488678 |pages= 14, 43\u201346, 456, 263, 834|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1889 at the age of five and a half, Keynes started at the kindergarten of the [[Perse School for Girls]] for five mornings a week. He quickly showed a talent for arithmetic, but his health was poor leading to several long absences. He was tutored at home by a governess, Beatrice Mackintosh, and his mother. In January 1892, at eight and a half, he started as a day pupil at [[St Faith's School|St Faith's]] preparatory school. By 1894, Keynes was top of his class and excelling at mathematics. In 1896, St Faith's headmaster, Ralph Goodchild, wrote that Keynes was \"head and shoulders above all the other boys in the school\" and was confident that Keynes could get a scholarship to Eton.<ref>'''Sources''':\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.stfaiths.co.uk/old-fidelians/old-fidelian-profiles-2/john-maynard-keynes|title=John Maynard Keynes \u2013 St Faith's School Website|website=St Faith's School Website|access-date=2016-04-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530200318/http://www.stfaiths.co.uk/old-fidelians/old-fidelian-profiles-2/john-maynard-keynes|archivedate=30 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}\n*{{cite book|last=Deane|first=Phyllis|title=The Life and Times of J.

According to [[Skidelsky]], the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of [[World War I]] provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation to each other and life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.<ref name = \"SkidelP1\" />\n\n==Career==\nIn October 1908, Keynes's [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]] career began as a clerk in the [[India Office]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=11879|date=6 November 1906  |page=1124}}</ref> He enjoyed his work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and resigned his position to return to Cambridge and work on [[probability theory]], at first privately funded only by two [[University don|dons]] at the university \u2013 his father and the economist [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Arthur Pigou]].\n\nBy 1909 Keynes had published his first professional economics article in ''The Economic Journal'', about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India.{{r|\"Minksky\"}} He founded the [[Political Economy Club (1909)|Political Economy Club]], a weekly discussion group.

While he did not formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes traveled to London at the government's request a few days before hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of [[Hard money (policy)|specie]] payments \u2013 the [[convertibility]] of [[banknotes]] into gold \u2013 but with Keynes's help the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (then [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]) was persuaded that this would be a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was necessary.\n\nIn January 1915, Keynes took up an official government position at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. Among his responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and its continental allies during the war and the acquisition of scarce currencies. According to economist [[Robert Lekachman]], Keynes's \"nerve and mastery became legendary\" because of his performance of these duties, as in the case where he managed to assemble \u2013 with difficulty \u2013 a small supply of Spanish [[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s.\n\nThe secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government. But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last= Spiegel\n| first= Henry William\n| title= The Growth of Economic Thought\n| year= 1991\n| page= 602\n| isbn= 0-8223-0973-4\n| publisher=Duke University Press\n| location= Durham, UK\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOn the introduction of [[military conscription]] in 1916, he applied for exemption as a [[conscientious objector]], which was effectively granted conditional upon continuing his government work.\n\nIn the 1917 King's [[Birthday Honours]], Keynes was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] for his wartime work,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30111 |supp=y|page=5456|date=1 June 1917}}</ref> and his success led to the appointment that would have a huge effect on Keynes's life and career; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles peace conference]].

Keynes was initially wary of the \"Welsh Wizard,\" preferring his rival [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]], but was impressed with Lloyd George at Versailles; this did not prevent Keynes from painting a scathing picture of the then-prime minister in his ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace|Economic Consequences of the Peace]]''.]]\n\nKeynes's experience at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent [[World War I reparations|Germany's compensation payments]] being set so high it would traumatize innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries \u2013 thus hurting not just Germany's economy but that of the wider world.\n\nUnfortunately for Keynes, conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 coupon election]] were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations. Their place was taken by the [[Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)|Heavenly Twins]] \u2013 the judge [[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Lord Sumner]] and the banker [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Lord Cunliffe]] whose nickname derived from the \"astronomically\" high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany. Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes.\n\nThe three principal players at Versailles were Britain's Lloyd George, France's [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] and America's [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]].<ref name = \"origins\">\n{{cite book\n|first = Frank\n|last= McDonough\n|pages = 43\u201346\n|title = The Origins of the First and Second World Wars\n|year=1997\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|isbn=1-4051-0664-6}}\n</ref>\nIt was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.\n\nLloyd George did, however, win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though not as high as those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain.\n\nWilson initially favored relatively lenient treatment of Germany \u2013 he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.\n\nTowards the end of the conference, Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. It involved the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown the entire cost of European reconstruction on the United States.\n\nLloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds and led to his resignation from the Treasury.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883\u20131946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-48867-8\n|pages= 217\u2013220, 245, 260\u2013265, 283, 342\u2013355\n|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn June 1919 he turned down an offer to become chairman of the [[British Bank of Northern Commerce]], a job that promised a salary of \u00a32000 in return for a morning per week of work.\n\nKeynes's analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book, ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'', published in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policonomics.com/keynes/ |title=John Maynard Keynes |publisher=Policonomics |accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> This work has been described as Keynes's best book, where he was able to bring all his gifts to bear \u2013 his passion as well as his skill as an economist.

However the historian [[Ruth Henig]] claims that \"most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Ruth|title=Versailles and After, 1919-1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqInX6qQPyUC&pg=PA65|edition=second|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-79873-5|page=65}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Sally |last=Marks |title=Mistakes and Myths: The Allies, Germany, and the Versailles Treaty, 1918\u20131921 |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |date=September 2013 |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=632\u2013659 |jstor=10.1086/670825 |doi=10.1086/670825 |quote=For nearly forty years, historians of twentieth-century diplomacy have argued that the Versailles treaty was more reasonable than its reputation suggests and that it did not of itself cause the Depression, the rise of Hitler, or World War II\" (p. 632).

In fact, the historian [[Stephen A. Schuker]] demonstrates in ''American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919\u201333'', that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German out payments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War [[Marshall Plan]].\n\nSchuker also shows that, in the years after Versailles, Keynes became an informal reparations adviser to the German government, wrote one of the major German reparation notes, and supported the hyperinflation on political grounds.  Nevertheless, ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' gained Keynes international fame, even though it also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishment \u2013 it was not until after the outbreak of the Second World War that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\n===In the 1920s===\n[[Image:Gold Bars.jpg|thumb|right| Keynes argued against a return to the [[gold standard]] at parity with pre-war sterling valuation after [[World War I]]]]\nKeynes had completed his ''[[A Treatise on Probability]]'' before the war but published it in 1921.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of [[probability theory]], championing the important view that ''probabilities'' were no more or less than [[truth value]]s intermediate between simple truth and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, ''c'', in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor\n[[Alfred Marshall]] which [[Joseph Schumpeter]] called \"the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read.\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last=Schumpeter\n|first=Joseph\n|title= Ten Great Economists\n|year=2003\n|page= 271\n|isbn=1-932512-09-8\n|publisher=Simon Publications\n}}\n</ref>\nMarshall's widow was \"entranced\" by the memorial, while [[Lytton Strachey]] rated it as one of Keynes's \"best works\".<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\nIn 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with ''A Revision of the Treaty''.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> He attacked the post-World War I deflation policies with ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'' in 1923<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> \u2013 a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of [[Pound sterling|sterling]] to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> During the 1920s Keynes's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion \u2013 according to [[Hyman Minsky]] one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was \"muddled\".<ref name = \"Minksky\" /> The ''Tract'' had also called for an end to the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the [[gold standard]], as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favor of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor [[Winston Churchill]] to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry. Keynes responded by writing ''The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill'' and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\n===During the Great Depression===\n[[Image:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Depression]] with its periods of worldwide economic hardship formed the backdrop against which the [[Keynesian Revolution]] took place. The image is ''[[Florence Owens Thompson]]'' by photographer [[Dorothea Lange]] taken in March 1936.]]\n{{wikiquote|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}\n\nKeynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money, and prices back in the 1920s.<ref name=\"50 greats\" /> The work, ''[[A Treatise on Money|Treatise on Money]]'', was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested \u2013 which can happen if interest rates are too high \u2013 then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial [[index (economics)|indices]] for representing an accurate \u2013 or indeed meaningful \u2013 indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular, he criticized the justification of Britain's return to the [[gold standard]] in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the [[wholesale price index]]. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and labor.\n\nKeynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the [[Great Depression]]. He believed that budget deficits during [[recession]]s were a good thing and a natural product of an economic slump. He wrote, \"For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as the present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill.\"<ref name=\"Cassidy2011\">{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|authorlink = John Cassidy (journalist)|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011|url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/the-demand-doctor}}</ref>\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier effect]]. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky]], helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 [[London Economic Conference]] opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.<ref name = \"Skid30s\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883\u20131946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-488678|pages= 494\u2013500, 504, 509\u2013510\n|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}</ref>\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?169138-1/john-maynard-keynes-fighting-freedom ''Booknotes'' interview with Robert Skidelsky on ''John Maynard Keynes: Fighting for Freedom, 1937\u20131946'', 28 April 2002], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nKeynesian-like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention, and Keynes was deliberately silent about the [[Economy of Nazi Germany#Pre-war economy: 1933\u20131939|successful efforts of Germany]] as he was dismayed by its imperialist ambitions and its treatment of Jews.<ref name = \"Skid30s\" /> Apart from Great Britain, Keynes's attention was primarily focused on the United States.

The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a \"special case\" that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in [[Say's law]], which, simply put, states that \"[[supply creates its demand]]\", and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Nominal rigidity|price stickiness]] &mdash; the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue that it is rational for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of \"[[aggregate demand]]\" and \"[[aggregate supply]]\" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria &mdash; and in those cases, it is on the state, not the market, that economies must depend for their salvation.\n\n[[File:Keynes caricature Low 1934.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], 1934]]\n\nThe ''General Theory'' argues that demand, not supply, is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can enhance employment and total income ''only'' by ''first'' increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low-employment equilibrium. The demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.<ref name = \"SkidelP2\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883\u20131946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-488678\n|pages= 530, 572, 586, 750, 789, 833|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}</ref>\nThe book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on [[public works]]. \"Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth,\" he wrote in 1928. \"With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments.

Among others, [[Hyman Minsky]] and [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] economists have argued that as result, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the [[IS\u2013LM model]] (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas).<ref name=\"Minksky\"/><ref name=\"K rev. and critics\" /> Keynes began to recover in 1939, but for the rest of his life his professional energies were directed largely towards the practical side of economics: the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]].\n\nIn the ''General Theory'' and later, Keynes responded to the socialists who argued, especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against one another, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], and later to the creation of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and eventually the [[World Trade Organization]]) were aimed to give effect to this vision.<ref>See [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nAlthough Keynes has been widely criticized \u2013 especially by members of the [[Chicago school of economics]] \u2013 for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Universal Man'' Richard Davenport-Hines Collins 2015</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right| Keynes (right) and the US representative [[Harry Dexter White]] at the inaugural meeting of the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s Board of Governors in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in 1946]]\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Keynes argued in ''[[How To Pay For The War|How to Pay for the War]]'', published in 1940, that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than [[deficit spending]], in order to avoid [[inflation]]. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channeling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post-war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings. In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the [[Bank of England]], and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35279|page=5489|date=19 September 1941}}<br />{{London Gazette|issue=35511|page=1540|date=3 April 1942}}</ref> In June 1942, Keynes was rewarded for his service with a [[hereditary peer]]age in the King's Birthday Honours.<ref name=\"TheLondon\">{{London Gazette|issue=35586|page=2475|date=5 June 1942}}</ref> On 7 July his title was [[The London Gazette|gazetted]] as \"'''Baron Keynes''', of Tilton, in the County of [[Sussex]]\" and he took his seat in the [[House of Lords]] on the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] benches.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35623|page=2987|date=7 July 1942}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory began to look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, as leader of the British delegation and chairman of the [[World Bank]] commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the [[Bretton Woods system]]. The Keynes plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the [[bancor]], and new global institutions \u2013 a world [[central bank]] and the [[International Clearing Union]]. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses.<ref>Marie Christine Duggan (2013) \"Taking Back Globalization: A China-United States Counterfactual Using Keynes's 1941 International Clearing Union.\" RRPE, Vol. 45, No. 4 https://www.academia.edu/21885358/Taking_Back_Globalization_A_China-United_States_Counterfactual_Using_Keyness_1941_International_Clearing_Union</ref> The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of [[Harry Dexter White]].

Keynes had written against the folly of allowing \"decadent and selfish\" speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War II the public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label \"[[Gnomes of Z\u00fcrich]]\" being typical of how they were described during this period. International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods. According to the journalists [[Larry Elliott]] and [[Dan Atkinson]], 1968 was the pivotal year when power shifted in favour of private agents such as currency speculators. As the key 1968 event Elliott and Atkinson picked out America's suspension of the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which they identified as the beginning of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.<ref name=\"failedgods\" >\n{{cite book\n|author1=Larry Elliott\n|author2=Dan Atkinson\n|title=The Gods That Failed: How Blind Faith in Markets Has Cost Us Our Future\n|year=2008\n|isbn=978-1-84792-030-0\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/godsthatfailedho0000elli_s7v0/page/78 78]\n|publisher=The Bodley Head Ltd\n|url=https://archive.org/details/godsthatfailedho0000elli_s7v0/page/78\n}}\n</ref>\n\nCriticisms of Keynes's ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his ''General Theory''. For economists such as [[Hyman Minsky]], Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the [[Phillips curve]] which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968, Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last=Friedman\n|first=Milton\n|date=March 1968\n|title=The Role of Monetary Policy\n|journal=[[American Economic Review]]\n}}\n</ref>\nFriedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once \u2013 a phenomenon that soon became known as [[stagflation]]. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other [[Monetarism|monetarists]] trained in the [[Chicago school of economics]], by the [[Lucas critique]] and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School.<ref name=\"K rev. and critics\" /> So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.<ref name = \"Blinder\" >\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~blinder/papers/01WE.pdf\n|title= Keeping the Keynesian Faith\n|publisher=Princeton University\n|author=Alan Blinder\n|date = June 2001\n|accessdate=27 June 2009\n|authorlink= Alan Blinder\n}}\n</ref>\n\nKeynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics \u2013 by 1979 they had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy.<ref name=\"K rev. and critics\"/> However, many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|title=The End of the Age of Milton Friedman\n|accessdate=13 November 2008\n|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-madrick/the-end-of-the-age-of-mil_b_94228.html\n|work=The Huffington Post\n|first=Jeff\n|last=Madrick\n|date=8 April 2008\n}}\n</ref>\nNot all academics accepted the criticism against Keynes \u2013 Minsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, and that it was unfortunate that this branch of economics had even continued to be called \"Keynesian\".<ref name = \"Minksky\" /> Writing in ''[[The American Prospect]]'', [[Robert Kuttner]] argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of [[capital control]]s, which allowed [[capital flight]] from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to [[Gresham's law]] phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong currencies).<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|url=http://prospect.org/article/capital-rues\n|title= Capital Rues\n|journal=The American Prospect\n|author=Robert Kuttner\n|authorlink=Robert Kuttner\n|date = 23 October 2008\n|accessdate=23 November 2011\n}} Reviewing ''Capital Rules: The Construction of Global Finance'', by [[Rawi Abdelal]], Harvard University Press, and ''The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing From Crisis to Sustainability'', by [[James Gustave Speth]], Yale University Press</ref>\nHistorian [[Peter Pugh]] has stated that a key cause of the economic problems afflicting America in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the [[Vietnam War]], which was against Keynesian advice.<ref name = \"forBeginners\">\n{{cite book\n|author1=Peter Pugh  |author2=Chris Garratt\n |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Keynes for Beginners\n|year=1993\n|page= 155\n|isbn=1-874166-13-7\n|publisher=Icon\n}}\n</ref>\n\nA more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend them against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian framework \u2013 the resulting body of work largely composing [[New Keynesian economics]].

In the 1920s, Keynes was seen as anti-establishment and was mainly attacked from the right. In the \"red 1930s\", many young economists favoured [[Marxism|Marxist]] views, even in Cambridge,<ref name = \"Minksky\"/> and while Keynes was engaging principally with the right to try to persuade them of the merits of more progressive policy, the most vociferous criticism against him came from the left, who saw him as a supporter of capitalism.

After a trip to Russia, he wrote in his ''Short View of Russia'' that there is \"beastliness on the Russian and Jewish natures when, as now, they are allied together\". He also wrote that \"out of the cruelty and stupidity of the Old Russia nothing could ever emerge, but (...) beneath the cruelty and stupidity of the New Russia a speck of the ideal may lie hid\", which together with other comments may be construed as [[Anti-Russian sentiment|anti-Russian]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].<ref>''A Short View of Russia'', Essays in Persuasion, (London 1932) John Maynard Keynes, 297\u2013312</ref>\n\nSome critics have sought to show that Keynes had sympathy with [[Nazism]], and a number of writers described him as antisemitic.

The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by \"creating\" additional \"international money\", and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium.

Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union.

His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]], then editor of [[The Economist]], \"If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money |version=Second Edition |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons |year=1948 |page=336 }}</ref>\n \nThese ideas were informed by events prior to the [[Great Depression]] when \u2013 in the opinion of Keynes and others \u2013 international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.<ref>{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages= 368\u201372}}</ref>\n\t\nInfluenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade.

However, in more recent years, since the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]] in 1971, with the increasing influence of [[Monetarist]] schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns \u2013 and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses \u2013 have largely disappeared from [[mainstream economics]] discourse<ref>{{cite book |author=Krugman, P  |author2=Wells, R |year=2006 |title=Economics |publisher=Worth Publishers }}</ref> and Keynes' insights have slipped from view.<ref>{{cite book |author=Duncan, R |title=The Dollar Crisis: Causes, Consequences, Cures |url=https://archive.org/details/dollarcrisiscaus00dunc_0 |url-access=registration |year=2005 |publisher=Wiley }}</ref> They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]].<ref name=\"monb_Clea\">{{Cite web |title=Clearing Up This Mess |author=Monbiot, George |work=George Monbiot Website |date=2008-11-18 |access-date=2019-09-05 |url=https://www.monbiot.com/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123161345/http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2008/11/18/clearing-up-this-mess/ |archivedate=23 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Duncan Grant with John Maynard Keynes.jpg|thumb|Painter [[Duncan Grant]] (left) with Keynes]]\n\n===Relationships===\nKeynes's early romantic and sexual relationships were exclusively with men.<ref name=\"New York Times\">\n{{cite news\n|accessdate=20 May 2008\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/skidelsky-keynes.html\n|title=The man who made us all Keynesians\n|work=The New York Times\n|date=11 May 1986\n|author=Robert L.

He wanted shorter working hours and longer holidays for all.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nKeynes was interested in literature in general and drama in particular and supported the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre]] financially, which allowed the institution to become one of the major British stages outside London.<ref name=\"ES\" />\n\nKeynes's interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the [[Royal Opera House]] at [[Covent Garden]] and the Ballet Company at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]]. During [[World War II|the war]], as a member of CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure government funds to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and was its founding chairman in 1946. From the start, the two organisations that received the largest grants from the new body were the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells.\n\nLike several other notable British authors of his time, Keynes was a member of the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. [[Virginia Woolf]]'s biographer tells an anecdote of how Virginia Woolf, Keynes, and [[T. S.

His assets were nearly wiped out following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], which he did not foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of \u00a3500,000 \u2013 equivalent to about \u00a320.5 million ($27.1 million) in 2018. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various good causes and his ethic which made him reluctant to sell on a falling market, in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.<ref>See ''John Maynard Keynes'' by Skidelsky (2003), pp. 520\u201321, p. 563 and especially p. 565 where Keynes is quoted as \"It is the duty of a serious investor to accept the depreciation of his holding with equanimity ... any other policy is anti-social, destructive of confidence and incompatible with the working of the economic system.\"</ref>\n\nKeynes built up a substantial collection of fine art, including works  by [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Edgar Degas]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Georges Seurat]] (some of which can now be seen at the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]]).<ref name=\"ES\" /> He enjoyed collecting books; he collected and protected many of [[Isaac Newton]]'s papers.

Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet he always refused to run for office himself, despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role in defining the party's economic policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref name = \"SkidelP1\" />\n\nIn 1939 Keynes had the option to enter Parliament as an independent MP with the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|University of Cambridge seat]]. A by-election for the seat was to be held due to the illness of an elderly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Tory]], and the master of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]] had obtained agreement that none of the major parties would field a candidate if Keynes chose to stand. Keynes declined the invitation as he felt he would wield greater influence on events if he remained a free agent.<ref name = \"clarke\"/>\n\nKeynes was a proponent of [[eugenics]]. He served as director of the [[Galton Institute|British Eugenics Society]] from 1937 to 1944. As late as 1946, shortly before his death, Keynes declared eugenics to be \"the most important, significant and, I would add, genuine branch of sociology which exists.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Keynes, John Maynard|year=1946|title=The Galton lecture, 1946: Presentation of the society's gold medal|journal=Eugenics Review|volume=38|issue=1|pages=39\u201340|pmc=2986310|pmid=21260495|quote=On February I4th, I946, before a large gathering of Fellows, Members and guests at Manson house, London, Lord Keynes, On behalf of the Eugenics Society, presented the first Galton Medal...

He argued that [[aggregate demand]] (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high [[unemployment]]. Keynes advocated the use of [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy|monetary]] policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic [[recession]]s and [[depression (economics)|depressions]]. He detailed these ideas in his magnum opus, ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', published in 1936. In the mid to late-1930s, leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy recommendations. Almost all [[capitalism|capitalist]] governments had done so by the end of the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946. As a leader of the British delegation, Keynes participated in the design of the international economic institutions established after the end of [[World War II]] but was overruled by the American delegation on several aspects.\n\nKeynes's influence started to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the [[stagflation]] that plagued the [[Anglo-America]]n economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by [[Milton Friedman]] and other [[Monetarism|monetarist]]s,<ref>{{cite book|last=Krugman|first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman|title=Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in the Age of Diminished Expectations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmvijkDrEcC&pg=PA43|year=1995|publisher=W.W.

His father, [[John Neville Keynes]], was an economist and a lecturer in [[moral science]]s at the University of Cambridge and his mother [[Florence Ada Keynes]] a local social reformer. Keynes was the first born, and was followed by two more children \u2013 Margaret Neville Keynes in 1885 and [[Geoffrey Keynes]] in 1887. Geoffrey became a surgeon and Margaret married the Nobel Prize-winning physiologist [[Archibald Hill]].\n\nAccording to the  [[economic historian]] and biographer [[Robert Skidelsky]], Keynes's parents were loving and attentive. They remained in the same house throughout their lives, where the children were always welcome to return. Keynes would receive considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of [[Great Depression]] in 1929. Keynes's mother made her children's interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, \"because she could grow up with her children, they never outgrew home\".<ref name=\"SkidelP1\" >\n{{cite book |last=Skidelsky |first=Robert |title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883\u20131946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman |year=2003 |isbn=0330488678 |pages= 14, 43\u201346, 456, 263, 834|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1889 at the age of five and a half, Keynes started at the kindergarten of the [[Perse School for Girls]] for five mornings a week. He quickly showed a talent for arithmetic, but his health was poor leading to several long absences. He was tutored at home by a governess, Beatrice Mackintosh, and his mother. In January 1892, at eight and a half, he started as a day pupil at [[St Faith's School|St Faith's]] preparatory school. By 1894, Keynes was top of his class and excelling at mathematics. In 1896, St Faith's headmaster, Ralph Goodchild, wrote that Keynes was \"head and shoulders above all the other boys in the school\" and was confident that Keynes could get a scholarship to Eton.<ref>'''Sources''':\n*{{Cite web|url=http://www.stfaiths.co.uk/old-fidelians/old-fidelian-profiles-2/john-maynard-keynes|title=John Maynard Keynes \u2013 St Faith's School Website|website=St Faith's School Website|access-date=2016-04-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530200318/http://www.stfaiths.co.uk/old-fidelians/old-fidelian-profiles-2/john-maynard-keynes|archivedate=30 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}\n*{{cite book|last=Deane|first=Phyllis|title=The Life and Times of J.

According to [[Skidelsky]], the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of [[World War I]] provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation to each other and life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.<ref name = \"SkidelP1\" />\n\n==Career==\nIn October 1908, Keynes's [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]] career began as a clerk in the [[India Office]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=11879|date=6 November 1906  |page=1124}}</ref> He enjoyed his work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and resigned his position to return to Cambridge and work on [[probability theory]], at first privately funded only by two [[University don|dons]] at the university \u2013 his father and the economist [[Arthur Cecil Pigou|Arthur Pigou]].\n\nBy 1909 Keynes had published his first professional economics article in ''The Economic Journal'', about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India.{{r|\"Minksky\"}} He founded the [[Political Economy Club (1909)|Political Economy Club]], a weekly discussion group. Also in 1909, Keynes accepted a lectureship in economics funded personally by [[Alfred Marshall]]. Keynes's earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition.\n\nIn 1911 Keynes was made the editor of ''[[The Economic Journal]]''.

While he did not formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes traveled to London at the government's request a few days before hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of [[Hard money (policy)|specie]] payments \u2013 the [[convertibility]] of [[banknotes]] into gold \u2013 but with Keynes's help the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (then [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]) was persuaded that this would be a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was necessary.\n\nIn January 1915, Keynes took up an official government position at the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. Among his responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and its continental allies during the war and the acquisition of scarce currencies. According to economist [[Robert Lekachman]], Keynes's \"nerve and mastery became legendary\" because of his performance of these duties, as in the case where he managed to assemble \u2013 with difficulty \u2013 a small supply of Spanish [[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s.\n\nThe secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government. But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last= Spiegel\n| first= Henry William\n| title= The Growth of Economic Thought\n| year= 1991\n| page= 602\n| isbn= 0-8223-0973-4\n| publisher=Duke University Press\n| location= Durham, UK\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOn the introduction of [[military conscription]] in 1916, he applied for exemption as a [[conscientious objector]], which was effectively granted conditional upon continuing his government work.\n\nIn the 1917 King's [[Birthday Honours]], Keynes was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] for his wartime work,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30111 |supp=y|page=5456|date=1 June 1917}}</ref> and his success led to the appointment that would have a huge effect on Keynes's life and career; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles peace conference]]. He was also appointed Officer of the Belgian [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31928 |supp=y|page=6175|date=1 June 1920}}</ref>\n\n===Versailles peace conference===\n{{Main|Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)}}\n\n[[Image:David Lloyd George 1902.jpg|thumb|Keynes's colleague, [[David Lloyd George]]. Keynes was initially wary of the \"Welsh Wizard,\" preferring his rival [[H. H. Asquith|Asquith]], but was impressed with Lloyd George at Versailles; this did not prevent Keynes from painting a scathing picture of the then-prime minister in his ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace|Economic Consequences of the Peace]]''.]]\n\nKeynes's experience at [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent [[World War I reparations|Germany's compensation payments]] being set so high it would traumatize innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit her ability to buy exports from other countries \u2013 thus hurting not just Germany's economy but that of the wider world.\n\nUnfortunately for Keynes, conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 coupon election]] were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations. Their place was taken by the [[Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)|Heavenly Twins]] \u2013 the judge [[John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Lord Sumner]] and the banker [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Lord Cunliffe]] whose nickname derived from the \"astronomically\" high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany. Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes.\n\nThe three principal players at Versailles were Britain's Lloyd George, France's [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] and America's [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]].<ref name = \"origins\">\n{{cite book\n|first = Frank\n|last= McDonough\n|pages = 43\u201346\n|title = The Origins of the First and Second World Wars\n|year=1997\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|isbn=1-4051-0664-6}}\n</ref>\nIt was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.\n\nLloyd George did, however, win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though not as high as those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain.\n\nWilson initially favored relatively lenient treatment of Germany \u2013 he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.\n\nTowards the end of the conference, Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. It involved the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown the entire cost of European reconstruction on the United States.\n\nLloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds and led to his resignation from the Treasury.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883\u20131946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-48867-8\n|pages= 217\u2013220, 245, 260\u2013265, 283, 342\u2013355\n|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn June 1919 he turned down an offer to become chairman of the [[British Bank of Northern Commerce]], a job that promised a salary of \u00a32000 in return for a morning per week of work.\n\nKeynes's analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book, ''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]'', published in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policonomics.com/keynes/ |title=John Maynard Keynes |publisher=Policonomics |accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref> This work has been described as Keynes's best book, where he was able to bring all his gifts to bear \u2013 his passion as well as his skill as an economist. In addition to economic analysis, the book contained pleas to the reader's sense of [[compassion]]:\n\n{{quote|I cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended either on our pledges or on economic facts.

However the historian [[Ruth Henig]] claims that \"most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Ruth|title=Versailles and After, 1919-1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqInX6qQPyUC&pg=PA65|edition=second|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-79873-5|page=65}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Sally |last=Marks |title=Mistakes and Myths: The Allies, Germany, and the Versailles Treaty, 1918\u20131921 |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |date=September 2013 |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=632\u2013659 |jstor=10.1086/670825 |doi=10.1086/670825 |quote=For nearly forty years, historians of twentieth-century diplomacy have argued that the Versailles treaty was more reasonable than its reputation suggests and that it did not of itself cause the Depression, the rise of Hitler, or World War II\" (p. 632).

In fact, the historian [[Stephen A. Schuker]] demonstrates in ''American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919\u201333'', that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German out payments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War [[Marshall Plan]].\n\nSchuker also shows that, in the years after Versailles, Keynes became an informal reparations adviser to the German government, wrote one of the major German reparation notes, and supported the hyperinflation on political grounds.  Nevertheless, ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' gained Keynes international fame, even though it also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishment \u2013 it was not until after the outbreak of the Second World War that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\n===In the 1920s===\n[[Image:Gold Bars.jpg|thumb|right| Keynes argued against a return to the [[gold standard]] at parity with pre-war sterling valuation after [[World War I]]]]\nKeynes had completed his ''[[A Treatise on Probability]]'' before the war but published it in 1921.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of [[probability theory]], championing the important view that ''probabilities'' were no more or less than [[truth value]]s intermediate between simple truth and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, ''c'', in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor\n[[Alfred Marshall]] which [[Joseph Schumpeter]] called \"the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read.\"<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last=Schumpeter\n|first=Joseph\n|title= Ten Great Economists\n|year=2003\n|page= 271\n|isbn=1-932512-09-8\n|publisher=Simon Publications\n}}\n</ref>\nMarshall's widow was \"entranced\" by the memorial, while [[Lytton Strachey]] rated it as one of Keynes's \"best works\".<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\nIn 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with ''A Revision of the Treaty''.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> He attacked the post-World War I deflation policies with ''A Tract on Monetary Reform'' in 1923<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> \u2013 a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of [[Pound sterling|sterling]] to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" /> During the 1920s Keynes's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion \u2013 according to [[Hyman Minsky]] one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was \"muddled\".<ref name = \"Minksky\" /> The ''Tract'' had also called for an end to the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the [[gold standard]], as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favor of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor [[Winston Churchill]] to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry. Keynes responded by writing ''The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill'' and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.<ref name=\"Skidel20s\" />\n\n===During the Great Depression===\n[[Image:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Depression]] with its periods of worldwide economic hardship formed the backdrop against which the [[Keynesian Revolution]] took place. The image is ''[[Florence Owens Thompson]]'' by photographer [[Dorothea Lange]] taken in March 1936.]]\n{{wikiquote|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}\n\nKeynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money, and prices back in the 1920s.<ref name=\"50 greats\" /> The work, ''[[A Treatise on Money|Treatise on Money]]'', was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested \u2013 which can happen if interest rates are too high \u2013 then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial [[index (economics)|indices]] for representing an accurate \u2013 or indeed meaningful \u2013 indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular, he criticized the justification of Britain's return to the [[gold standard]] in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the [[wholesale price index]]. He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and labor.\n\nKeynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the [[Great Depression]]. He believed that budget deficits during [[recession]]s were a good thing and a natural product of an economic slump. He wrote, \"For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as the present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill.\"<ref name=\"Cassidy2011\">{{cite news|last=Cassidy|first=John|authorlink = John Cassidy (journalist)|title=The Demand Doctor|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=10 October 2011|url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/10/the-demand-doctor}}</ref>\n\nAt the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published ''The Means to Prosperity'', which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. ''The Means to Prosperity'' contains one of the first mentions of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier effect]]. While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky]], helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 [[London Economic Conference]] opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.<ref name = \"Skid30s\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883\u20131946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-488678|pages= 494\u2013500, 504, 509\u2013510\n|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}</ref>\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?169138-1/john-maynard-keynes-fighting-freedom ''Booknotes'' interview with Robert Skidelsky on ''John Maynard Keynes: Fighting for Freedom, 1937\u20131946'', 28 April 2002], [[C-SPAN]]}}\nKeynesian-like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention, and Keynes was deliberately silent about the [[Economy of Nazi Germany#Pre-war economy: 1933\u20131939|successful efforts of Germany]] as he was dismayed by its imperialist ambitions and its treatment of Jews.<ref name = \"Skid30s\" /> Apart from Great Britain, Keynes's attention was primarily focused on the United States.

The ''General Theory'' challenged the earlier [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish [[full employment]] equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a \"special case\" that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in [[Say's law]], which, simply put, states that \"[[supply creates its demand]]\", and that in a free market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs. An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [[Nominal rigidity|price stickiness]] &mdash; the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue that it is rational for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of \"[[aggregate demand]]\" and \"[[aggregate supply]]\" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria &mdash; and in those cases, it is on the state, not the market, that economies must depend for their salvation.\n\n[[File:Keynes caricature Low 1934.jpg|left|thumb|Caricature by [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], 1934]]\n\nThe ''General Theory'' argues that demand, not supply, is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can enhance employment and total income ''only'' by ''first'' increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low-employment equilibrium. The demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.<ref name = \"SkidelP2\" >\n{{cite book\n|last=Skidelsky\n|first=Robert\n|title=John Maynard Keynes: 1883\u20131946: Economist, Philosopher, Statesman\n|year=2003\n|isbn=0-330-488678\n|pages= 530, 572, 586, 750, 789, 833|publisher=Pan MacMillan Ltd\n}}</ref>\nThe book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on [[public works]]. \"Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth,\" he wrote in 1928. \"With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments.

Among others, [[Hyman Minsky]] and [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] economists have argued that as result, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the [[IS\u2013LM model]] (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas).<ref name=\"Minksky\"/><ref name=\"K rev. and critics\" /> Keynes began to recover in 1939, but for the rest of his life his professional energies were directed largely towards the practical side of economics: the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the [[Bretton Woods Conference]].\n\nIn the ''General Theory'' and later, Keynes responded to the socialists who argued, especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against one another, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]], and later to the creation of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and eventually the [[World Trade Organization]]) were aimed to give effect to this vision.<ref>See [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nAlthough Keynes has been widely criticized \u2013 especially by members of the [[Chicago school of economics]] \u2013 for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programs of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Universal Man'' Richard Davenport-Hines Collins 2015</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:WhiteandKeynes.jpg|thumb|right| Keynes (right) and the US representative [[Harry Dexter White]] at the inaugural meeting of the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s Board of Governors in [[Savannah, Georgia]] in 1946]]\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], Keynes argued in ''[[How To Pay For The War|How to Pay for the War]]'', published in 1940, that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than [[deficit spending]], in order to avoid [[inflation]]. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channeling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post-war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings.

The Keynes plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the [[bancor]], and new global institutions \u2013 a world [[central bank]] and the [[International Clearing Union]]. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses.<ref>Marie Christine Duggan (2013) \"Taking Back Globalization: A China-United States Counterfactual Using Keynes's 1941 International Clearing Union.\" RRPE, Vol. 45, No. 4 https://www.academia.edu/21885358/Taking_Back_Globalization_A_China-United_States_Counterfactual_Using_Keyness_1941_International_Clearing_Union</ref> The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of [[Harry Dexter White]].

Keynes had written against the folly of allowing \"decadent and selfish\" speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War II the public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label \"[[Gnomes of Z\u00fcrich]]\" being typical of how they were described during this period. International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods. According to the journalists [[Larry Elliott]] and [[Dan Atkinson]], 1968 was the pivotal year when power shifted in favour of private agents such as currency speculators. As the key 1968 event Elliott and Atkinson picked out America's suspension of the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which they identified as the beginning of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.<ref name=\"failedgods\" >\n{{cite book\n|author1=Larry Elliott\n|author2=Dan Atkinson\n|title=The Gods That Failed: How Blind Faith in Markets Has Cost Us Our Future\n|year=2008\n|isbn=978-1-84792-030-0\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/godsthatfailedho0000elli_s7v0/page/78 78]\n|publisher=The Bodley Head Ltd\n|url=https://archive.org/details/godsthatfailedho0000elli_s7v0/page/78\n}}\n</ref>\n\nCriticisms of Keynes's ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his ''General Theory''. For economists such as [[Hyman Minsky]], Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the [[Phillips curve]] which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968, Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last=Friedman\n|first=Milton\n|date=March 1968\n|title=The Role of Monetary Policy\n|journal=[[American Economic Review]]\n}}\n</ref>\nFriedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once \u2013 a phenomenon that soon became known as [[stagflation]]. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the [[1973 oil crisis]]. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other [[Monetarism|monetarists]] trained in the [[Chicago school of economics]], by the [[Lucas critique]] and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School.<ref name=\"K rev. and critics\" /> So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 [[Robert Lucas, Jr.|Robert Lucas]] claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.<ref name = \"Blinder\" >\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~blinder/papers/01WE.pdf\n|title= Keeping the Keynesian Faith\n|publisher=Princeton University\n|author=Alan Blinder\n|date = June 2001\n|accessdate=27 June 2009\n|authorlink= Alan Blinder\n}}\n</ref>\n\nKeynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics \u2013 by 1979 they had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy.<ref name=\"K rev. and critics\"/> However, many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|title=The End of the Age of Milton Friedman\n|accessdate=13 November 2008\n|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-madrick/the-end-of-the-age-of-mil_b_94228.html\n|work=The Huffington Post\n|first=Jeff\n|last=Madrick\n|date=8 April 2008\n}}\n</ref>\nNot all academics accepted the criticism against Keynes \u2013 Minsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, and that it was unfortunate that this branch of economics had even continued to be called \"Keynesian\".<ref name = \"Minksky\" /> Writing in ''[[The American Prospect]]'', [[Robert Kuttner]] argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of [[capital control]]s, which allowed [[capital flight]] from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to [[Gresham's law]] phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong currencies).<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|url=http://prospect.org/article/capital-rues\n|title= Capital Rues\n|journal=The American Prospect\n|author=Robert Kuttner\n|authorlink=Robert Kuttner\n|date = 23 October 2008\n|accessdate=23 November 2011\n}} Reviewing ''Capital Rules: The Construction of Global Finance'', by [[Rawi Abdelal]], Harvard University Press, and ''The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing From Crisis to Sustainability'', by [[James Gustave Speth]], Yale University Press</ref>\nHistorian [[Peter Pugh]] has stated that a key cause of the economic problems afflicting America in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the [[Vietnam War]], which was against Keynesian advice.<ref name = \"forBeginners\">\n{{cite book\n|author1=Peter Pugh  |author2=Chris Garratt\n |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Keynes for Beginners\n|year=1993\n|page= 155\n|isbn=1-874166-13-7\n|publisher=Icon\n}}\n</ref>\n\nA more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend them against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian framework \u2013 the resulting body of work largely composing [[New Keynesian economics]].

His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Geoffrey Crowther]], then editor of [[The Economist]], \"If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money |version=Second Edition |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons |year=1948 |page=336 }}</ref>\n \nThese ideas were informed by events prior to the [[Great Depression]] when \u2013 in the opinion of Keynes and others \u2013 international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.<ref>{{cite book|author=Crowther, Geoffrey| title=An Outline of Money|version=Second Edition|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons|year=1948|pages= 368\u201372}}</ref>\n\t\nInfluenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade.

The main parking garage is being extended eastward over the CTA L tracks to add 1,500 spaces and streamline the entrance way.<ref name=\"mp\"/> In addition to the redeveloped central food court, new concession options will open in phases including a food court in Concourse A utilizing previously unused space built during the 2010 rebuild of the Gate A4A/B connecting walkway.<ref name=\"mp\"/> The program is the largest capital improvements project at the airport since the 2001 terminal redevelopment and is scheduled to be completed winter 2019-2020.\n\n==Airfield==\n[[File:MDW 5.JPG|thumb|Main Corridor at Chicago\u2013Midway.]]\n[[File:MDW 6.JPG|thumb|[[Southwest Airlines]] check-in ticket counters.]]\nAll terminals and hangars were on the square periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north\u2013south and east\u2013west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always. A short runway (13R/31L) for light aircraft was added in 1989.\n\nChicago Midway International Airport covers just over one square mile ({{convert|650|acres|disp=or}})<ref name=\"FAA\" /> and has five runways:<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.airnav.com/airport/KMDW| title = MDW FAA Information effective 11 February 2010| publisher = AirNav| date = February 11, 2010| access-date = April 6, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070416030027/http://www.airnav.com/airport/KMDW| archive-date = April 16, 2007| url-status = live}}</ref>\n* 13C/31C: {{convert|6522|x|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, air carrier runway, [[Instrument landing system|ILS]]-equipped.\n* 4R/22L: {{convert|6445|x|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, air carrier runway, ILS-equipped.\n* 4L/22R: {{convert|5507|x|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, general aviation and air taxi.\n* 13L/31R: {{convert|5141|x|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, general aviation and air taxi.

The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and the airlines ensure safety by adhering to calculated load limits and various weather minimums. Because of the displaced landing thresholds, the runways have shorter distances available for landings than for takeoffs. 13C/31C, the longest runway, only has an available landing distance of {{convert|6059|ft|m}} in the southeast direction, and {{convert|5826|ft|m}} to the northwest. The largest aircraft normally seen at Midway is the [[Boeing 757]]. Normally, commercial planes only take off from and land on runways 4R/22L and 13C/31C. The other runways are used by smaller aircraft.\n\n==Terminals==\nMidway has 43 aircraft gates on three concourses (A, B, and C).<ref name=\"visitorsguide\" /> The three concourses and their gates are:\n\n*Concourse A \u2013 17 gates (A1\u2013A3, A4a, A4b, A5, A7\u2013A12, A14\u2013A19).

Expansions were completed in the spring of 2010.\n\n===Privatization attempts===\nChicago has considered privatizing the airport, but the deals fell through in 2009 and 2013.\n\nOn April 20, 2009 a $2.5&nbsp;billion deal to [[privatize]] the airport via a 99-year lease fell through when the consortium could not put together financing. The city would have kept $125&nbsp;million in the down payment. The consortium operating under the name of Midway Investment and Development Company LLC consisted of [[Vancouver Airport Services]], [[Citigroup|Citi]] Infrastructure Investors, and Boston's [[John Hancock Insurance|John Hancock Life Insurance]]. It was awarded the contract in October 2008 by the City Council, which voted 49\u20130 to approve it. The consortium would have operated the airport and collected airport parking, concession, and passenger facility charges.

The main parking garage is being extended eastward over the CTA L tracks to add 1,500 spaces and streamline the entrance way.<ref name=\"mp\"/> In addition to the redeveloped central food court, new concession options will open in phases including a food court in Concourse A utilizing previously unused space built during the 2010 rebuild of the Gate A4A/B connecting walkway.<ref name=\"mp\"/> The program is the largest capital improvements project at the airport since the 2001 terminal redevelopment and is scheduled to be completed winter 2019-2020.\n\n==Airfield==\n[[File:MDW 5.JPG|thumb|Main Corridor at Chicago\u2013Midway.]]\n[[File:MDW 6.JPG|thumb|[[Southwest Airlines]] check-in ticket counters.]]\nAll terminals and hangars were on the square periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north\u2013south and east\u2013west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always.

The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and the airlines ensure safety by adhering to calculated load limits and various weather minimums. Because of the displaced landing thresholds, the runways have shorter distances available for landings than for takeoffs. 13C/31C, the longest runway, only has an available landing distance of {{convert|6059|ft|m}} in the southeast direction, and {{convert|5826|ft|m}} to the northwest. The largest aircraft normally seen at Midway is the [[Boeing 757]]. Normally, commercial planes only take off from and land on runways 4R/22L and 13C/31C.
