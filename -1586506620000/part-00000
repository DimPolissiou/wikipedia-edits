The roots of ''abhinaya'' appear in the ''Natyashastra'' text, which defines drama in verse 6.10 as something that aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} A performance art, asserts ''Natyashastra'', connects the artists and the audience through ''abhinaya'' (literally, \"carrying to the spectators\"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art that engages every aspect of life to glorify and give a state of joyful consciousness.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=160\n| image1=Hasthamudra8.JPG |width1=3072|height1=2304\n| image2=Hasthamudra18.JPG |width2=3072|height2=2304\n| image3=Hasthamudra11.JPG |width3=3072|height3=2304\n| image4=Hasthamudra7.JPG |width4=3072|height4=2304\n| image5=Hasthamudra19.JPG | width5=3072|height5=2304\n| image6=Hasthamudra17.JPG |width6=3072|height6=2304\n| footer=Example ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]'' \u2013 gestures as symbols in Bharatanatyam.\n}}\n\nThe communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/> In the Hindu texts on dance, the dancer successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: ''Angika'' (gestures and body language), ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm), ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\">{{cite book|author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra|title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82\u201384}}</ref> ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''bhava'' (mood, psychological states).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/>\n\nThe gestures used in Bharatanatyam are called ''Hasta'' (or ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]'').

The roots of ''abhinaya'' appear in the ''Natyashastra'' text, which defines drama in verse 6.10 as something that aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, through the medium of actor's art of communication, that helps connect and transport the individual into a sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} A performance art, asserts ''Natyashastra'', connects the artists and the audience through ''abhinaya'' (literally, \"carrying to the spectators\"), that is applying body-speech-mind and scene, wherein the actors communicate to the audience, through song and music.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=3}} Drama in this ancient Sanskrit text, thus is an art that engages every aspect of life to glorify and give a state of joyful consciousness.{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|p=5}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=160\n| image1=Hasthamudra8.JPG |width1=3072|height1=2304\n| image2=Hasthamudra18.JPG |width2=3072|height2=2304\n| image3=Hasthamudra11.JPG |width3=3072|height3=2304\n| image4=Hasthamudra7.JPG |width4=3072|height4=2304\n| image5=Hasthamudra19.JPG | width5=3072|height5=2304\n| image6=Hasthamudra17.JPG |width6=3072|height6=2304\n| footer=Example ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]'' \u2013 gestures as symbols in Bharatanatyam.\n}}\n\nThe communication through symbols is in the form of expressive gestures and pantomime set to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/> In the Hindu texts on dance, the dancer successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: ''Angika'' (gestures and body language), ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm), ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\">{{cite book|author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra|title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82\u201384}}</ref> ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''bhava'' (mood, psychological states).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p82\"/>\n\nThe gestures used in Bharatanatyam are called ''Hasta'' (or ''[[List of mudras (dance)|mudras]]''). These symbols are of three types: ''asamyuta hastas'' (single hand gestures), ''samyuta hastas'' (two hand gestures) and ''nrtta hastas'' (dance hand gestures).<ref name=\"BajajVohra2015p85\"/> Like words in a glossary, these gestures are presented in the ''nritta'' as a list or embellishment to a prelim performance.

The two gluteus maximus muscles are the largest muscles in the  human body. They are responsible for achieving the upright posture when the body is bent at the waist; maintaining the body in the upright posture by keeping the hip joints extended; and propelling the body forward via further leg (hip) extension when walking or running.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.refrence.com/science/gluteus-maximus-543e8854558908e7 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513141554/http://www.refrence.com/science/gluteus-maximus-543e8854558908e7 |archive-date=2019-05-13 |url-status=dead }}{{dead link|date=October 2019|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In the seated position, the buttocks bear the weight of the upper body and take that weight off the feet. \n\nIn many cultures, the buttocks play a role in [[sexual attraction]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The rear view: A brief and elegant history of bottoms through the ages | first = Jean-Luc | last = Hennig | year = 1995 | publisher = Souvenir | location = London | isbn = 0-285-63303-1}}</ref> Some cultures, such as that of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, have also used the buttocks as a primary target for [[corporal punishment]],<ref name=\"times18940322\">{{cite news | url = http://www.corpun.com/uks89403.htm | title = Police. | newspaper =[[The Times]] | location = London | date = 22 March 1894 | quote = \"Mr. Curtis Bennett deprecated caning on the hands and boxing the ears, and said they were exceedingly dangerous forms of punishment.

There are several connotations of buttocks in art, fashion, culture and humor. The English language is replete with many popular synonyms that range from polite colloquialisms (\"posterior\", \"backside\" or \"bottom\") to vulgar slang ([[wikt:arse#English|\"arse,\"]] [[wikt:ass#Etymology 2|\"ass,\"]] [[wikt:bum#English|\"bum,\"]] [[wikt:butt#English|\"butt,\"]] [[wikt:booty#Noun|\"booty,\"]] [[wikt:prat#Etymology 2|\"prat\"]]).\n\n==Anatomy==\nThe buttocks are formed by the masses of the gluteal muscles or \"glutes\" (the [[gluteus maximus muscle]] and the [[gluteus medius muscle]]) superimposed by a layer of [[adipose tissue|fat]]. The superior aspect of the buttock ends at the [[iliac crest]], and the lower aspect is outlined by the [[horizontal gluteal crease]]. The gluteus maximus has two insertion points: {{Frac|1|3}} superior portion of the [[linea aspera]] of the [[femur]], and the superior portion of the iliotibial tractus. The masses of the gluteus maximus muscle are separated by an intermediate [[intergluteal cleft]] or \"crack\" in which the [[Human anus|anus]] is situated.\n\nThe buttocks allow primates to sit upright without needing to rest their weight on their feet as [[quadruped|four-legged animals]] do. Females of certain species of [[baboon]] have red buttocks that blush to attract males. In the case of humans, females tend to have proportionally wider and thicker buttocks due to higher [[subcutaneous fat]] and proportionally wider [[hip]]s. In humans they also have a role in propelling the body in a forward motion and aiding bowel movement.<ref>Foundations of Osteopathic Medicine, Page 586, Anthony G. Chila - 2010</ref><ref>Recent Advances in Pediatrics, 2013 Suraj Gupte, p 141</ref>\n\nSome [[baboon]]s and all [[gibbon]]s, though otherwise [[fur]]-covered, have characteristic naked [[Callosity|callosities]] on their buttocks. While human children generally have smooth buttocks, mature males and females have varying degrees of hair growth, as on other parts of their body. Females may have hair growth in the gluteal cleft (including around the anus), sometimes extending laterally onto the lower aspect of the cheeks. Males may have hair growth over some or all of the buttocks.\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Connotations===\n{{Main|Cultural history of the buttocks}}\n[[Image:mooning.jpg|thumb|Students at [[Stanford University]] conduct a \"mass-[[mooning]]\" in May 1995]]\n\nThe English word of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin \"[[wiktionary:callipygian|callipygian]]\" indicates someone who has beautiful buttocks.\n    \nDepending on the context, exposure of the buttocks in non-intimate situations can cause feelings of embarrassment or humiliation, and embarrassment or amusement in an onlooker (see [[Debagging|pantsing]]). Willfully exposing one's own [[naked|bare]] buttocks as a protest, a provocation, or just for fun is called [[mooning]].\n\nIn many punitive traditions, the buttocks are a common target for [[corporal punishment]], which can be meted out with no risk of long-term physical harm compared with the dangers of applying it to other parts of the body, such as the hands, which could easily be damaged.<ref>Zeno Chicarilli, M.D. et al. [http://nospank.net/hands.htm \"Corporal Punishment to Children's Hands: A Statement by Medical Authorities as to the Risks\"]. NoSpank.net. 3 January 2002.</ref> Within the Victorian school system in England, the buttocks have been described as \"the place provided by nature\" for this purpose.<ref name=\"times18940322\"/> A modern-day example can be seen in some Southeast Asian countries, such as Singapore. [[Caning in Singapore]] is widely used as a form of [[judicial corporal punishment]], with male convicts being sentenced to a [[caning]] on their bare buttocks.\n\nIn Western and some other cultures, many comedians, writers and others rely on the buttocks as a source of amusement, camaraderie and fun. There are numerous colloquial terms for the buttocks.\n\nIn [[American English]], phrases use the buttocks or synonyms (especially \"butt\" and \"ass\") as a [[synecdoche]] or [[pars pro toto]] for a whole person, often with a negative connotation. For example, terminating an employee may be described as \"firing his ass\". One might say \"move your ass\" or \"haul ass\" as an exhortation to greater haste or urgency. Expressed as a function of punishment, defeat or assault becomes \"kicking one's ass\". Such phrases also may suggest a person's characteristics, e.g. difficult people are termed \"hard asses\". In America an annoying person or any source of frustration may be termed \"a pain in the ass\" (a synonym for \"a pain in the neck\"). People deemed excessively puritanical or proper may be termed \"tight asses\" (in Australia and New Zealand, \"tight arse\" refers to someone who is excessively miserly).\n\nCertain physical dispositions of the buttocks\u2014particularly size\u2014are sometimes identified, controversially, as a racial characteristic (see [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]). A famous example was the case of [[Saartjie Baartman]], the so-called \"Hottentot Venus\".\n\n===Synonyms===\n{{hatnote|See [[Wiktionary:WikiSaurus:buttocks|WikiSaurus:buttocks]] for a list of synonyms and slang words for buttocks in many languages.

Derived from a term for booty; in Spanish the term is considered vulgar and offensive, but less so in Spain than in Latin America.\n* Duffs: Ulster Irish origin\n* Dumper sometimes denotes the buttocks, especially when they are large.\n* Fanny: a socially acceptable term in print, in Canada and the United States at least, for many years before some of the bolder terms came along; and a subject of jokes, since \"Fannie\" can be a woman's name, diminutive of \"Frances\"; however, in [[British English]] ''fanny'' refers to the female genitals or [[vulva]] and is considered vulgar. The figure of a bare-bottomed lass named Fanny is ubiquitous in Provence (the southeast of France) wherever [[p\u00e9tanque]] is played: traditionally when a player loses 13 to 0 it is said that \u201cil est fanny\u201d (he's fanny), and he has to kiss the bottom of a girl called Fanny; as there is rarely an obliging Fanny, there is always a substitute picture, woodcarving or pottery so that Fanny\u2019s bottom is always available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laboulebleue.fr/fr/html/fanny.htm |title=P\u00e9tanque.

Like long underwear with the ubiquitous \"butt flap\" (used to allow baring only the bottom with a simple gesture, as for hygiene), this clothing style was acknowledged in popular media such as cartoons and comics for generations afterward.\n\nMore recently, the [[Buttock cleavage|cleavage of the buttocks]] is sometimes exposed by some women, deliberately or accidentally, as fashion dictated trousers be worn lower, as with [[hip-hugger]] pants.\n\nAn example of another attitude in an otherwise hardly exhibitionist culture is the Japanese [[fundoshi]].\n\n===In popular culture===\n<!--only entries specifically and significantly about the buttocks should go here, not every instance anyone got spanked or slapped on the bottom in a film or a TV program-->\n[[File:D6B 1320 - Got Ass?

It consists of footage of human buttocks in motion while the person walks on a turntable.\n*The 1984 [[Heavy metal music]] [[mockumentary]] ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' contained the song \"Big Bottom\" featuring the lyrics ''Big bottom, big bottom, Talk about bum cakes, my girl's got 'em, Big bottom drive me out of my mind, How could I leave this behind?'' The band performs the song using three simultaneous [[bass guitar]]s, a [[pun]] on the song title, as the bass is often colloquially referred to as the \"bottom end\" of the rock sound.\n*Numerous songs have been released which glorify this body part.  As early as 1961, the American [[Folk music|Folk]] band [[The Limeliters]] recorded the song \"Vicki Dougan\" [sic], which pays a humorous tribute to the [[pin-up]] star [[Vikki Dougan]] who wore infamously low-cut, backless [[dress]]es. A risque song for the time, the lyrics  mention her \"callipygian cleft\" by name.

In humans, the buttocks are located between the lower back and the [[perineum]].They are composed of a layer of exterior skin and  underlying [[subcutaneous]] fat superimposed on a left and right [[gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] and [[gluteus medius muscle]]. The two gluteus maximus muscles are the largest muscles in the  human body. They are responsible for achieving the upright posture when the body is bent at the waist; maintaining the body in the upright posture by keeping the hip joints extended; and propelling the body forward via further leg (hip) extension when walking or running.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.refrence.com/science/gluteus-maximus-543e8854558908e7 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513141554/http://www.refrence.com/science/gluteus-maximus-543e8854558908e7 |archive-date=2019-05-13 |url-status=dead }}{{dead link|date=October 2019|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In the seated position, the buttocks bear the weight of the upper body and take that weight off the feet. \n\nIn many cultures, the buttocks play a role in [[sexual attraction]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The rear view: A brief and elegant history of bottoms through the ages | first = Jean-Luc | last = Hennig | year = 1995 | publisher = Souvenir | location = London | isbn = 0-285-63303-1}}</ref> Some cultures, such as that of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, have also used the buttocks as a primary target for [[corporal punishment]],<ref name=\"times18940322\">{{cite news | url = http://www.corpun.com/uks89403.htm | title = Police. | newspaper =[[The Times]] | location = London | date = 22 March 1894 | quote = \"Mr. Curtis Bennett deprecated caning on the hands and boxing the ears, and said they were exceedingly dangerous forms of punishment.

There are several connotations of buttocks in art, fashion, culture and humor. The English language is replete with many popular synonyms that range from polite colloquialisms (\"posterior\", \"backside\" or \"bottom\") to vulgar slang ([[wikt:arse#English|\"arse,\"]] [[wikt:ass#Etymology 2|\"ass,\"]] [[wikt:bum#English|\"bum,\"]] [[wikt:butt#English|\"butt,\"]] [[wikt:booty#Noun|\"booty,\"]] [[wikt:prat#Etymology 2|\"prat\"]]). \n\n==Anatomy==\nThe buttocks are formed by the masses of the gluteal muscles or \"glutes\" (the [[gluteus maximus muscle]] and the [[gluteus medius muscle]]) superimposed by a layer of [[adipose tissue|fat]]. The superior aspect of the buttock ends at the [[iliac crest]], and the lower aspect is outlined by the [[horizontal gluteal crease]]. The gluteus maximus has two insertion points: {{Frac|1|3}} superior portion of the [[linea aspera]] of the [[femur]], and the superior portion of the iliotibial tractus. The masses of the gluteus maximus muscle are separated by an intermediate [[intergluteal cleft]] or \"crack\" in which the [[Human anus|anus]] is situated.\n\nThe buttocks allow primates to sit upright without needing to rest their weight on their feet as [[quadruped|four-legged animals]] do. Females of certain species of [[baboon]] have red buttocks that blush to attract males. In the case of humans, females tend to have proportionally wider and thicker buttocks due to higher [[subcutaneous fat]] and proportionally wider [[hip]]s. In humans they also have a role in propelling the body in a forward motion and aiding bowel movement.<ref>Foundations of Osteopathic Medicine, Page 586, Anthony G. Chila - 2010</ref><ref>Recent Advances in Pediatrics, 2013 Suraj Gupte, p 141</ref>\n\nSome [[baboon]]s and all [[gibbon]]s, though otherwise [[fur]]-covered, have characteristic naked [[Callosity|callosities]] on their buttocks. While human children generally have smooth buttocks, mature males and females have varying degrees of hair growth, as on other parts of their body. Females may have hair growth in the gluteal cleft (including around the anus), sometimes extending laterally onto the lower aspect of the cheeks. Males may have hair growth over some or all of the buttocks.\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Connotations===\n{{Main|Cultural history of the buttocks}}\n[[Image:mooning.jpg|thumb|Students at [[Stanford University]] conduct a \"mass-[[mooning]]\" in May 1995]]\n\nThe English word of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin \"[[wiktionary:callipygian|callipygian]]\" indicates someone who has beautiful buttocks.\n    \nDepending on the context, exposure of the buttocks in non-intimate situations can cause feelings of embarrassment or humiliation, and embarrassment or amusement in an onlooker (see [[Debagging|pantsing]]). Willfully exposing one's own [[naked|bare]] buttocks as a protest, a provocation, or just for fun is called [[mooning]].\n\nIn many punitive traditions, the buttocks are a common target for [[corporal punishment]], which can be meted out with no risk of long-term physical harm compared with the dangers of applying it to other parts of the body, such as the hands, which could easily be damaged.<ref>Zeno Chicarilli, M.D. et al. [http://nospank.net/hands.htm \"Corporal Punishment to Children's Hands: A Statement by Medical Authorities as to the Risks\"]. NoSpank.net. 3 January 2002.</ref> Within the Victorian school system in England, the buttocks have been described as \"the place provided by nature\" for this purpose.<ref name=\"times18940322\"/> A modern-day example can be seen in some Southeast Asian countries, such as Singapore. [[Caning in Singapore]] is widely used as a form of [[judicial corporal punishment]], with male convicts being sentenced to a [[caning]] on their bare buttocks.\n\nIn Western and some other cultures, many comedians, writers and others rely on the buttocks as a source of amusement, camaraderie and fun. There are numerous colloquial terms for the buttocks.\n\nIn [[American English]], phrases use the buttocks or synonyms (especially \"butt\" and \"ass\") as a [[synecdoche]] or [[pars pro toto]] for a whole person, often with a negative connotation. For example, terminating an employee may be described as \"firing his ass\". One might say \"move your ass\" or \"haul ass\" as an exhortation to greater haste or urgency. Expressed as a function of punishment, defeat or assault becomes \"kicking one's ass\". Such phrases also may suggest a person's characteristics, e.g. difficult people are termed \"hard asses\". In America an annoying person or any source of frustration may be termed \"a pain in the ass\" (a synonym for \"a pain in the neck\"). People deemed excessively puritanical or proper may be termed \"tight asses\" (in Australia and New Zealand, \"tight arse\" refers to someone who is excessively miserly).\n\nCertain physical dispositions of the buttocks\u2014particularly size\u2014are sometimes identified, controversially, as a racial characteristic (see [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]). A famous example was the case of [[Saartjie Baartman]], the so-called \"Hottentot Venus\".\n\n===Synonyms===\n{{hatnote|See [[Wiktionary:WikiSaurus:buttocks|WikiSaurus:buttocks]] for a list of synonyms and slang words for buttocks in many languages.

Other English-language examples include:\n** \"[[(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty]]\" by [[KC and the Sunshine Band]] (1976)\n** \"[[Peaches (The Stranglers song)|Peaches]]\" by [[The Stranglers]] (1977)\n** The singles \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\" and \"[[Bicycle Race]]\" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (1978)\n** \"[[Baby Got Back]]\" by [[Sir Mix-a-Lot]] (1992)\n** \"[[I See You Baby]] (Shakin' That Ass)\" by [[Groove Armada]] (1999)\n** \"[[Bootylicious]]\" by [[Destiny's Child]] (2001)\n** \"[[Pop That Booty]]\" by [[Marques Houston]] (2003)\n** \"[[My Humps]]\" (in the back and in the front) by [[The Black Eyed Peas]] (2005)\n** \"[[Ms. New Booty]]\" by [[Bubba Sparxxx]] and [[Ying Yang Twins]] (2005)\n** \"[[All About That Bass]]\" by [[Meghan Trainor]] (2014)\n*''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named the 1990s the \"Decade of the Butt\" because many buttock-related songs were released in that decade.\n*In the [[United Kingdom]] there is an annual award given to the [[male]] and [[female]] winners of the [[celebrity]] voted to have the [[Rear of the Year]] for that year.

meet]].<ref>[http://www.fina.org/H2O/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4379 Press Release 2014-19: FINA Bureau Meeting, Cancun (MEX) - March 1-2, 2014]

for these records (but were faster). Likewise more historical times by juniors were also not considered (e.g. Mary T. Meagher's 2:05.96 in the 200 m butterfly).\n\nLong Course records can be established by breaking the initial time at a meet after April 1, 2014.<ref name=\"Swimming World Magazine\">{{cite
