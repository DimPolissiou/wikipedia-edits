It was their 31st consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after they won promotion during the season 1945\u201346. They played their home games in the [[St. Jakob Stadium]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[Helmut Benthaus]] was first team manager for the eleventh consecutive season.\n\nThe [[Swiss Football Association]] had reformed the [[Swiss football league system]] that year reducing the number of teams in the Nationalliga A from 14 to 12 and increasing the Nationalliga B teams from 14 to 16. The [[1976\u201377 Nationalliga A|Nationalliga A season 1976\u201377]] was contested by the first 11 teams from the previous season and the sole promoted team [[AC Bellinzona]]. The Nationalliga A was played in two stages. The qualification phase was played by all teams in a round robin and after completion was dived into two groups. The first six teams contended in the championship group (with half the obtained points as bonus) and the positions seventh to twelfth contended the relegation group. Basel finished the qualification phase in second position with 33 points from 22 games and so entered the championship group with a bonus of 17. At the end of the championship phase [[Servette FC Gen\u00e8ve]] and Basel were level on 29 points. They therefore had to play a play-off for champions. This play-off was held at the [[Wankdorf Stadium]] in [[Bern]] in front of 55,000 supporters. Basel won the match 2\u20131, their goals being scored by [[Walter Mundschin]] and [[Arthur von Wartburg]].\n\n== Players ==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= SUI |pos=GK |name=[[Jean M\u00fcller]]

It was their 31st consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after they won promotion during the season 1945\u201346. They played their home games in the [[St. Jakob Stadium]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[Helmut Benthaus]] was first team manager for the eleventh consecutive season.\n\nThe [[Swiss Football Association]] had reformed the [[Swiss football league system]] that year reducing the number of teams in the Nationalliga A from 14 to 12 and increasing the Nationalliga B teams from 14 to 16. The [[1976\u201377 Nationalliga A|Nationalliga A season 1976\u201377]] was contested by the first 11 teams from the previous season and the sole promoted team [[AC Bellinzona]]. The Nationalliga A was played in two stages. The qualification phase was played by all teams in a round robin and after completion was dived into two groups. The first six teams contended in the championship group (with half the obtained points as bonus) and the positions seventh to twelfth contended the relegation group. Basel finished the qualification phase in second position with 33 points from 22 games and so entered the championship group with a bonus of 17. At the end of the championship phase [[Servette FC Gen\u00e8ve]] and Basel were level on 29 points. They therefore had to play a play-off for champions. This play-off was held at the [[Wankdorf Stadium]] in [[Bern]] in front of 55,000 supporters. Basel won the match 2\u20131, their goals being scored by [[Walter Mundschin]] and [[Arthur von Wartburg]].\n\n== Players ==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= SUI |pos=GK |name=[[Jean M\u00fcller]]

Wagle sought an ambassadorship to Ireland, Belize, or Belgium, or other State Department positions. She made her aspirations known in a May 7, 2018 email to a campaign operative shortly after the legislative session ended. Wagle wrote, \"I'm thinking it's an excellent time,\" to leave Kansas politics while requesting that the operative forward her cover letter and resume which included Ruffin as a reference, to an administration official. The request followed ten days after Wagle voted to establish an avenue for racetrack casinos to operate in Kansas, a change sought by Ruffin, the owner of both Wichita's Greyhound Park and [[The Woodlands (race track)|The Woodlands]] racetrack in [[Kansas City, Kansas]]. Wagle had opposed prior efforts to hold a new County vote to permit slot machines at the Wichita Greyhound Park which [[Sedgwick County, Kansas|Sedgwick County]] voters had turned down in 2007.

Tax fairness and tax equity is a top concern for Senator Wagle.\" When interviewed, Ruffin said Wagle would make a good U.S. senator, dismissing the contention that her position change regarding expanded gaming led to his support. Wagle's pitch for such an ambassadorial post came weeks after Wichita Republican congressman [[Mike Pompeo]] received U.S. Senate approval as [[United States Secretary of State]] in April 2018. Wagle's campaign spokesman said Pompeo did not have a role in promoting her candidacy to the White House: \"While she does not recall speaking to Secretary Pompeo about her interest in serving in the Administration, she did reach out to the President's team and some of their mutual friends, including Phil Ruffin, in this process.\"<ref name=abortion/>\n\n===Other political involvement===\nWagle served as a delegate to the [[1996 Republican National Convention]].

He summarizes the current Indological opinion to be that the Brhadaranyaka, Chandogya, Isha, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kena, Katha, Mundaka, and Prasna Upanishads are all pre-Buddhist and pre-Jain, while Svetasvatara and Mandukya overlap with the earliest Buddhist and Jain literature.<ref name=stephenphillips/>\n\nThe later Upanishads, numbering about 95, also called minor Upanishads, are dated from the late 1st-millennium BCE to mid 2nd-millennium CE.{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp= 5, 8\u20139}} [[Gavin Flood]] dates many of the twenty [[Yoga]] Upanishads to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period.{{Sfn|Flood|1996|p=96}} [[Patrick Olivelle]] and other scholars date seven of the twenty [[Sannyasa#Sannyasa Upanishads|Sannyasa Upanishads]] to likely have been complete sometime between the last centuries of the 1st-millennium BCE to 300 CE.{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp= 5, 8\u20139}} About half of the Sannyasa Upanishads were likely composed in 14th- to 15th-century CE.{{sfn|Olivelle|1992|pp= 5, 8\u20139}}\n\n===Geography===\nThe general area of the composition of the early Upanishads is considered as northern India. The region is bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges region, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range.<ref name=olivelleintro/> Scholars are reasonably sure that the early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]]-[[Panchala]] and [[Kosala]]-[[Videha]] together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxvii}} This region covers modern [[Bihar]], [[Nepal]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Haryana]], eastern [[Rajasthan]], and northern [[Madhya Pradesh]].<ref name=olivelleintro/>\n\nWhile significant attempts have been made recently to identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative.

Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three ''[[gunas]]'' in the Indian philosophy of [[Samkhya]].{{sfn|Chousalkar|1986|pp=130-134}}{{sfn|Wadia|1956|p=64-65}}{{refn|group=note|For instances of Platonic [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the early Upanishads see Randall.{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=197\u2013198}}}}\n\nVarious mechanisms for such a transmission of knowledge have been conjectured including Pythagoras traveling as far as India; Indian philosophers visiting Athens and meeting [[Socrates]]; Plato encountering the ideas when in exile in Syracuse; or, intermediated through Persia.{{sfn|Chousalkar|1986|pp=130-134}}{{sfn|Urwick|1920}}\n\nHowever, other scholars, such as [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]], [[John Burnet (classicist)|J.

They note that there is no historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in ''this'' life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state.{{sfn|Wadia|1956|p=64-65}} In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's [[moksha]] (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).{{sfn|Keith|2007|pp=602-603}}<ref name=wdstrappini/><ref>RC Mishra (2013), Moksha and the Hindu Worldview, Psychology & Developing Societies, Vol. 25, No. 1, pages 21-42; Chousalkar, Ashok (1986), Social and Political Implications of Concepts Of Justice And Dharma, pages 130-134</ref>\n\n==Translations==\nThe Upanishads have been translated into various languages including [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Urdu]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].{{sfn|Sharma|1985|p=20}} The [[Moghul]] Emperor [[Akbar]]'s reign (1556\u20131586) saw the first translations of the Upanishads into Persian.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1900|p=lvii}}{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1899|p=204}} His great-grandson, Sultan Mohammed [[Dara Shikoh]], produced a collection called ''Oupanekhat'' in 1656, wherein 50 Upanishads were translated from Sanskrit into [[Persian language|Persian]].{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=558-59}}\n\n[[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil Duperron]], a French Orientalist received a manuscript of the ''Oupanekhat'' and translated the Persian version into French and Latin, publishing the Latin translation in two volumes in 1801\u20131802 as ''Oupneck'hat''.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=558-59}}{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1900|p=lvii}} The French translation was never published.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1900|p=lviii}} The Latin version was the initial introduction of Upanishadic thought to Western scholars.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=558-559}} However, according to Deussen, the Persian translators took great liberties in translating the text and at times changed the meaning.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=915-916}}\n\nThe first Sanskrit to English translation of the [[Aitareya Upanishad]] was made by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Colebrooke]],<ref name=colebrook1858>See Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1858), ''[https://archive.org/details/essaysonreligio01colegoog/page/n38 <!-- pg=26 --> Essays on the religion and philosophy of the Hindus]''.

The region is bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges region, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range.<ref name=olivelleintro/> Scholars are reasonably sure that the early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]]-[[Panchala]] and [[Kosala]]-[[Videha]] together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxvii}} This region covers modern [[Bihar]], [[Nepal]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Haryana]], eastern [[Rajasthan]], and northern [[Madhya Pradesh]].<ref name=olivelleintro/>\n\nWhile significant attempts have been made recently to identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxviii}} The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxix}}\n\nCompared to the Principal Upanishads, the new Upanishads recorded in the {{IAST|Muktik\u0101}} belong to an entirely different region, probably southern India, and are considerably relatively recent.{{sfn|Deussen|1908|pp=35\u201336}} In the fourth chapter of the Kaushitaki Upanishad, a location named Kashi (modern [[Varanasi]]) is mentioned.<ref name=olivelleintro/>\n\n==Classification==\n===Muktika canon: major and minor Upanishads===\nThere are more than 200 known ''Upanishads'', one of which, the ''{{IAST|[[Muktik\u0101]]}}'' Upanishad, predates 1656 CE{{sfn|Tripathy|2010|p=84}} and contains a list of 108 canonical Upanishads,{{sfn|Sen|1937|p=19}} including itself as the last.

On occasions, the Upanishads extend the task of the Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ''[[ashvamedha]]'' allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse.

Eliot]], inspired by his reading of the Upanishads, based the final portion of his famous poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922) upon one of its verses.{{sfn|Eliot|1963}} According to [[Eknath Easwaran]], the Upanishads are snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness.{{sfn|Easwaran|2007|p=9}}\n\n[[Juan Mascar\u00f3]], a professor at the University of Barcelona and a translator of the Upanishads, states that the Upanishads represents for the Hindu approximately what the [[New Testament]] represents for the Christian, and that the message of the Upanishads can be summarized in the words, \"the kingdom of God is within you\".<ref>Juan Mascar\u00f3, The Upanishads, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0140441635}}, page 7, 146, cover</ref>\n\n[[Paul Deussen]] in his review of the Upanishads, states that the texts emphasize Brahman-Atman as something that can be experienced, but not defined.<ref name=pauldeussenreview/> This view of the soul and self are similar, states Deussen, to those found in the dialogues of Plato and elsewhere. The Upanishads insisted on oneness of soul, excluded all plurality, and therefore, all proximity in space, all succession in time, all interdependence as cause and effect, and all opposition as subject and object.<ref name=pauldeussenreview>Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyoftheupa00deusuoft#page/n167/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads] University of Kiel, T&T Clark, pages 150-179</ref> Max M\u00fcller, in his review of the Upanishads, summarizes the lack of systematic philosophy and the central theme in the Upanishads as follows,\n\n{{quote|\nThere is not what could be called a philosophical system in these Upanishads. They are, in the true sense of the word, guesses at truth, frequently contradicting each other, yet all tending in one direction. The key-note of the old Upanishads is \"know thyself,\" but with a much deeper meaning than that of the ''\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd'' of the [[Know thyself|Delphic Oracle]]. The \"know thyself\" of the Upanishads means, know thy true self, that which underlines thine Ego, and find it and know it in the highest, the eternal Self, the One without a second, which underlies the whole world.\n|[[Max M\u00fcller]]<ref name=wdstrappini>WD Strappini, {{Google books|111FAAAAYAAJ|The Upanishads|page=258}}, The Month and Catholic Review, Vol. 23, Issue 42</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Hinduism}}\n* [[100 Most Influential Books Ever Written]]\n* [[Bhagavad Gita]]\n* [[Hinduism]]\n* [[Prasthanatrayi]]\n* [[Mukhya Upanishads]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last =Brooks | first=Douglas Renfrew|title=The Secret of the Three Cities: An Introduction to Hindu Shakta Tantrism|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1990}}\n* {{Citation|title=Missionary review of the world|volume=Volume 45|last=Brown|first=Rev.

They came from the town of [[Warren, New York]], which was named in honor of Major General [[Joseph Warren]], killed at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. [[Warren Township, Lake County, Illinois|Warren Township]], formed in 1850, was also named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurnee.il.us/history/history_warren_township.html|title=Gurnee History - Warren Township|publisher=The Village of Gurnee, IL|accessdate=2007-08-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805092635/http://www.gurnee.il.us/history/history_warren_township.html|archivedate=2007-08-05}}</ref> The first settlement of Warren Township commenced in 1835 in the vicinity of the Aux Plaines River (now the [[Des Plaines River]]).\n\nIn 1835-36, a land company from New York State erected a Community House (site of the old Gurnee Grade School) to accommodate families while they were locating and getting government land grants to their farms. Near the Community House, there was a [[Ford]] used by the [[Potowatomi]] Indians for crossing the river. A floating log bridge was built in 1842. Later, both a wood and iron bridge were built.\n\nWith the erection of a permanent bridge, roads were established, and this area became the hub of the township. It was at this junction that the Milwaukee Road crossed the river from west to east, and then continued north to eventually connect Chicago to [[Milwaukee]]. This road was \"laid out\" in 1836 by three early settlers: Thomas McClure, Mark Noble, and Richard Steele. The east-west road, now known as Grand Avenue, was a main route from [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry County]] to the port of [[Waukegan]]. Stage coaches ran on this route as late as 1870.\n\nThe hamlet was originally called \"Wentworth\", after Congressman \"Long John\" Wentworth, who also served as the Republican Mayor of Chicago between 1857-1863.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio - John Wentworth|website=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000295}}</ref>  Thereafter, [[Walter S. Gurnee]], the 14th [[Mayor of Chicago]] and one of the directors of the railroad, agreed to develop a station in Wentworth, which was called \"Gurnee Station\" in honor of Mr. Gurnee. Over time, Gurnee Station became known simply as \"Gurnee\" and was incorporated as such.\n\nJust east of the bridge, at the junction of Milwaukee Road and Grand Avenue, was the Mutaw Tavern, earlier known as \"Marm Rudd's Tavern\" and more recently as the Mother Rudd House. This was a stage coach stop between Chicago and Milwaukee and was a stopover for farmers from the west traveling to Little Fort (now known as [[Waukegan]]) to barter their crops for supplies and to ship out from the ports. It also served as a stop during the [[underground railroad]]. This building was acquired by the Village of Gurnee in 1984, has been restored, and now houses the Warren Township Historical Society.\n\nIn 1974, the [[Marriott Corporation]] announced a new theme park to be constructed in the village named [[Six Flags Great America|Marriott's Great America]]. The park opened on May 29, 1976 in time with the country's [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatamericaparks.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=189|title=Great America History - Original Concepts - GREATAMERICAparks.com|website=greatamericaparks.com|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2004, Gurnee received major rainfall, causing the worst [[flash flood|flooding]] in 100 years.

They came from the town of [[Warren, New York]], which was named in honor of Major General [[Joseph Warren]], killed at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. [[Warren Township, Lake County, Illinois|Warren Township]], formed in 1850, was also named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gurnee.il.us/history/history_warren_township.html|title=Gurnee History - Warren Township|publisher=The Village of Gurnee, IL|accessdate=2007-08-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805092635/http://www.gurnee.il.us/history/history_warren_township.html|archivedate=2007-08-05}}</ref> The first settlement of Warren Township commenced in 1835 in the vicinity of the Aux Plaines River (now the [[Des Plaines River]]).\n\nIn 1835-36, a land company from New York State erected a Community House (site of the old Gurnee Grade School) to accommodate families while they were locating and getting government land grants to their farms. Near the Community House, there was a [[Ford]] used by the [[Potowatomi]] Indians for crossing the river. A floating log bridge was built in 1842. Later, both a wood and iron bridge were built.\n\nWith the erection of a permanent bridge, roads were established, and this area became the hub of the township. It was at this junction that the Milwaukee Road crossed the river from west to east, and then continued north to eventually connect Chicago to [[Milwaukee]]. This road was \"laid out\" in 1836 by three early settlers: Thomas McClure, Mark Noble, and Richard Steele. The east-west road, now known as Grand Avenue, was a main route from [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry County]] to the port of [[Waukegan]]. Stage coaches ran on this route as late as 1870.\n\nThe hamlet was originally called \"Wentworth\", after Congressman \"Long John\" Wentworth, who also served as the Republican Mayor of Chicago between 1857-1863.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio - John Wentworth|website=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000295}}</ref>  Thereafter, [[Walter S. Gurnee]], the 14th [[Mayor of Chicago]] and one of the directors of the railroad, agreed to develop a station in Wentworth, which was called \"Gurnee Station\" in honor of Mr. Gurnee. Over time, Gurnee Station became known simply as \"Gurnee\" and was incorporated as such.\n\nJust east of the bridge, at the junction of Milwaukee Road and Grand Avenue, was the Mutaw Tavern, earlier known as \"Marm Rudd's Tavern\" and more recently as the Mother Rudd House. This was a stage coach stop between Chicago and Milwaukee and was a stopover for farmers from the west traveling to Little Fort (now known as [[Waukegan]]) to barter their crops for supplies and to ship out from the ports. It also served as a stop during the [[underground railroad]]. This building was acquired by the Village of Gurnee in 1984, has been restored, and now houses the Warren Township Historical Society.\n\nIn 1974, the [[Marriott Corporation]] announced a new theme park to be constructed in the village named [[Six Flags Great America|Marriott's Great America]]. The park opened on May 29, 1976 in time with the country's [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatamericaparks.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=189|title=Great America History - Original Concepts - GREATAMERICAparks.com|website=www.greatamericaparks.com|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2004, Gurnee received major rainfall, causing the worst [[flash flood|flooding]] in 100 years.

Stroger is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In 2001, he was appointed to the [[Chicago City Council]] by [[Richard M. Daley]]. He is the son of [[John Stroger]] who served as Cook County Board president for 12 years until his death.\n\n[[2010 Cook County, Illinois elections#President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners|On February 2, 2010]], Stroger finished last in the Democratic primary for President of the Cook County Board behind [[Dorothy A.

He attended [[Gordon Tech]] and later received his bachelor's degree from [[Xavier University of Louisiana|Xavier University]] in [[New Orleans]]. Before becoming an alderman he worked as an investment banker for SBK Brooks Investment Corporation.\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1992, Stroger was elected as State Representative for the 31st District of Illinois. Stroger worked as a statistician for the Office of the Chief Judge of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]]; later he was also a jury supervisor with the Cook County Jury Commissioners. He worked for the [[Chicago Park District]] during the tenure of [[Forrest Claypool]].\n\nStroger is an active fundraiser for the [[United Negro College Fund]] and a member of the [[Young Democrats of America|Young Democrats]].\n\n===Aldermanic career===\nIn 2001 Stroger was appointed by Mayor Richard M. Daley to replace [[Lorraine Dixon]], who had died while in office. Stroger served on seven committees: Budget and Government Operations; Committees, Rules, and Ethics; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations; Police and Fire; Special Events and Cultural Affairs; and Traffic Control and Safety.\n\n===2006 County Board Presidential nomination===\nOn March 14, 2006, [[John Stroger]], Cook County Board of Commissioners president since 1994 and Todd Stroger's father, suffered a serious [[stroke]] one week before the Democratic primary.<ref name=cst001>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/stroger14.html|accessdate=2006-03-06|title=Stroger suffers apparent stroke|author=Steve Patterson|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> John Stroger eventually won the Democratic nomination, winning about 53 percent of the votes cast, defeating [[Forrest Claypool]]. For months after the elder Stroger's stroke he did not appear in public, and his family provided little information about his condition.\n\nShortly after the stroke, Todd Stroger gave noncommittal responses about the likelihood that his father would remain on the ballot. But in May, he reversed his previous stance, saying his father would return to office.<ref name=cst002>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-stroger17.html|accessdate=2006-05-17|title=Todd Stroger expects dad to stay on ballot|author=Fran Spielman|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Ultimately, John Stroger would submit his resignation. At the same time that John Stroger submitted his resignation, it was announced that alderman [[William Beavers]] would assume the County Commissioner seat while Todd Stroger, if elected, would take over the County Board presidency. This announcement came four days after the deadline for third-party candidates to file for the Board presidency race.<ref name=cst003>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-stroger30.html|accessdate=2006-06-30|title=Stroger to resign as county chief; son to run|author=Fran Spielman|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of his father's resignation, Todd Stroger emerged as the front-runner for his father's presidential seat. His main opponent was U.S. Representative [[Danny K. Davis]]. Another opponent, County Commissioner [[Bobbie Steele]], dropped out of the race shortly before party leaders chose a new candidate.<ref name=cst003 />\n\nOn July 18, 2006, the Cook County Democratic Central Committee (a collection of 80 county Democratic party leaders also known as \"ward committeemen\" or \"township committeemen\") overwhelmingly chose Todd Stroger to replace his father as the Democratic candidate for Cook County Board president for the Nov. 7, 2006 election. The following day, Steele was unanimously elected by the Board as interim president.\n\nAccording to state election officials, in July 2008, Stroger's campaign paid almost $27,000 in fines for failing to file paperwork in a timely manner. Paperwork was not filed on time for the 2006 [[election]] contributions it received along with late organization papers that were sent to the election board. The campaign also filed incomplete and late reports to the State [[Board of Elections]] during the week of July 21, 2008, so more fines are expected to be brought forth.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-todd-stroger-finesjul23,0,599437.story | title=Todd Stroger campaign hit with nearly $27,000 state fine | author=Dardick, Hal and Rick Pearson | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=2008-07-22 | accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism and response ==\n=== Hiring ===\nStroger drew fire for perceived [[nepotism]], including promoting his cousin Donna Dunnings, who had worked in the County's budget office for 16 years, to the position of the County's [[chief financial officer]].<ref name=abc001>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=politics&id=5009209|accessdate=2007-02-06|title=Stroger defends decision to hire cousin as CFO|author=Ben Bradley|publisher=ABC 7 Chicago.com}}</ref> Dunnings and Stroger received additional criticism when she received a $17,000 raise after she initially agreed to not accept a pay hike (in an attempt to help county finances).<ref name=trib999>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-strogermar25,0,2904385.story|accessdate=2008-03-27|title=Stroger cousin defends her pay raise as county chief financial officer|author=Dan Mihalopoulos|newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=March 25, 2008}}</ref> Dunnings stated that critics could have blocked the pay raise by submitting an amendment to the proposed budget \"if they were so concerned about the salary of the first African-American female CFO\".<ref name=trib999 />\n\nDunnings was later forced to resign her position after the press reported that she had posted bail for Tony Cole, a former [[University of Georgia]] basketball player and busboy whom Stroger had hired to a $60,000/year Cook County position despite Cole's having an extensive [[felony]] record. On April 16, 2009, Dunnings resigned at Stroger's request over the scandal involving the hiring of Cole as a human resources assistant in the County Highway Department. Stroger had earlier fired Cole (in [[Cook County Jail]] in connection with a domestic violence case at the time Dunnings resigned) for concealing his [[Criminal record|felony record]].<ref>[http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/04/stroger-cousin-resigns-from-county-post.html Chicago Breaking News Center - Stroger fires cousin over hiring scandal], WGN-TV, April 17, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Tax increase ===\nStroger also drew criticism when he began raising certain taxes in an effort to balance the county budget and resolve staffing issues.  In September 2007, he voiced his support for a proposal to raise the county-wide sales tax to 11 percent (an additional two cents on the dollar) to remedy a $307 million budget deficit, which would force public facilities such as [[Stroger Hospital]] to cut services or even close.<ref name=abc002>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=local&id=5683415|accessdate=2007-09-30|title=Cook County Board to vote on proposed sales tax increase|author=Sarah Schult|publisher=ABC 7 Chicago.com}}</ref> Critics of the plan included fellow Commissioners Claypool, Gorman, Peraica, and [[Michael Quigley (politician)|Mike Quigley]] who argued that spending cuts would accomplish the same purpose. Peraica additionally responded that Cook County's poorest citizens, who the tax hike is ultimately designed to serve, would find it to be the most unaffordable. Peraica's argument was seconded by then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]], who expressed his opposition to the plan.<ref name=abc002 /> Gorman was instrumental, however, in refusing to back down and she introduced a resolution to repeal the sales tax on three separate occasions, finally winning board majority support on the third effort.\n\nOn February 29, 2008, the Cook County Board, by a measure of 10-7, passed a budget initiated by Stroger. Stroger's budget contained a tax increase of 1 percentage point, the largest ever passed by Cook County, with the intent of creating more than 1,000 new County jobs. As a result of Stroger's bill, on July 1 the County sales tax increased from 0.75 percent to 1.75 percent bringing Chicago's overall sales tax to 10.25 percent, which was the highest of any major U.S. city, while the sales tax was a minimum of 8.75 percent in suburban Cook County. All five [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the County Board voted against the tax increase and they were joined by two of the twelve Democrats. Commissioners who voted against the tax increase were [[Peter N. Silvestri]], Quigley, Claypool, [[Gregg Goslin]], [[Timothy Schneider]], Peraica, and [[Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman]].<ref name=crains>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=28420|accessdate=2008-03-05|title=Cook Co.

She explained that the expected cost increase would be the result of what she described as a 'structural deficit', meaning increases in revenue being unable to match increases in expense, citing runaway health care costs among other problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbbm780.com/Stroger-s-CFO-Cousin-Defends-Steep-Tax-Hikes/1918215|accessdate=2008-04-03|title=Stroger's CFO Cousin Defends Steep Tax Hikes|author=Craig Dellimore|publisher=WBBM780.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528130800/http://www.wbbm780.com/Stroger-s-CFO-Cousin-Defends-Steep-Tax-Hikes/1918215 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-28}}</ref>  A county spokesman indicated that it would most likely happen in three or four years, well into the next county presidential term.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-county-dunnings-01apr01,1,4261275.story|accessdate=2008-04-03|title=Despite big sales tax, shortfall seen for Cook County|author=Hal Dardick|newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=April 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBecause of a number of unanswered questions and unresolved issues surrounding the county tax increase, Cook County's outlying communities, particularly [[Palatine, IL]], considered secession and threatened to do so unless an explanation was provided.

Stroger served on seven committees: Budget and Government Operations; Committees, Rules, and Ethics; Housing and Real Estate; Human Relations; Police and Fire; Special Events and Cultural Affairs; and Traffic Control and Safety.\n\n===2006 County Board Presidential nomination===\nOn March 14, 2006, [[John Stroger]], Cook County Board of Commissioners president since 1994 and Todd Stroger's father, suffered a serious [[stroke]] one week before the Democratic primary.<ref name=cst001>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/stroger14.html|accessdate=2006-03-06|title=Stroger suffers apparent stroke|author=Steve Patterson|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> John Stroger eventually won the Democratic nomination, winning about 53 percent of the votes cast, defeating [[Forrest Claypool]]. For months after the elder Stroger's stroke he did not appear in public, and his family provided little information about his condition.\n\nShortly after the stroke, Todd Stroger gave noncommittal responses about the likelihood that his father would remain on the ballot. But in May, he reversed his previous stance, saying his father would return to office.<ref name=cst002>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-stroger17.html|accessdate=2006-05-17|title=Todd Stroger expects dad to stay on ballot|author=Fran Spielman|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Ultimately, John Stroger would submit his resignation. At the same time that John Stroger submitted his resignation, it was announced that alderman [[William Beavers]] would assume the County Commissioner seat while Todd Stroger, if elected, would take over the County Board presidency. This announcement came four days after the deadline for third-party candidates to file for the Board presidency race.<ref name=cst003>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-stroger30.html|accessdate=2006-06-30|title=Stroger to resign as county chief; son to run|author=Fran Spielman|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of his father's resignation, Todd Stroger emerged as the front-runner for his father's presidential seat. His main opponent was U.S. Representative [[Danny K. Davis]]. Another opponent, County Commissioner [[Bobbie Steele]], dropped out of the race shortly before party leaders chose a new candidate.<ref name=cst003 />\n\nOn July 18, 2006, the Cook County Democratic Central Committee (a collection of 80 county Democratic party leaders also known as \"ward committeemen\" or \"township committeemen\") overwhelmingly chose Todd Stroger to replace his father as the Democratic candidate for Cook County Board president for the Nov. 7, 2006 election. The following day, Steele was unanimously elected by the Board as interim president.\n\nAccording to state election officials, in July 2008, Stroger's campaign paid almost $27,000 in fines for failing to file paperwork in a timely manner. Paperwork was not filed on time for the 2006 [[election]] contributions it received along with late organization papers that were sent to the election board. The campaign also filed incomplete and late reports to the State [[Board of Elections]] during the week of July 21, 2008, so more fines are expected to be brought forth.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-todd-stroger-finesjul23,0,599437.story | title=Todd Stroger campaign hit with nearly $27,000 state fine | author=Dardick, Hal and Rick Pearson | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=2008-07-22 | accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism and response ==\n=== Hiring ===\nStroger drew fire for perceived [[nepotism]], including promoting his cousin Donna Dunnings, who had worked in the County's budget office for 16 years, to the position of the County's [[chief financial officer]].<ref name=abc001>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=politics&id=5009209|accessdate=2007-02-06|title=Stroger defends decision to hire cousin as CFO|author=Ben Bradley|publisher=ABC 7 Chicago.com}}</ref> Dunnings and Stroger received additional criticism when she received a $17,000 raise after she initially agreed to not accept a pay hike (in an attempt to help county finances).<ref name=trib999>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-strogermar25,0,2904385.story|accessdate=2008-03-27|title=Stroger cousin defends her pay raise as county chief financial officer|author=Dan Mihalopoulos|newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=March 25, 2008}}</ref> Dunnings stated that critics could have blocked the pay raise by submitting an amendment to the proposed budget \"if they were so concerned about the salary of the first African-American female CFO\".<ref name=trib999 />\n\nDunnings was later forced to resign her position after the press reported that she had posted bail for Tony Cole, a former [[University of Georgia]] basketball player and busboy whom Stroger had hired to a $60,000/year Cook County position despite Cole's having an extensive [[felony]] record. On April 16, 2009, Dunnings resigned at Stroger's request over the scandal involving the hiring of Cole as a human resources assistant in the County Highway Department. Stroger had earlier fired Cole (in [[Cook County Jail]] in connection with a domestic violence case at the time Dunnings resigned) for concealing his [[Criminal record|felony record]].<ref>[http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2009/04/stroger-cousin-resigns-from-county-post.html Chicago Breaking News Center - Stroger fires cousin over hiring scandal], WGN-TV, April 17, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Tax increase ===\nStroger also drew criticism when he began raising certain taxes in an effort to balance the county budget and resolve staffing issues.  In September 2007, he voiced his support for a proposal to raise the county-wide sales tax to 11 percent (an additional two cents on the dollar) to remedy a $307 million budget deficit, which would force public facilities such as [[Stroger Hospital]] to cut services or even close.<ref name=abc002>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=local&id=5683415|accessdate=2007-09-30|title=Cook County Board to vote on proposed sales tax increase|author=Sarah Schult|publisher=ABC 7 Chicago.com}}</ref> Critics of the plan included fellow Commissioners Claypool, Gorman, Peraica, and [[Michael Quigley (politician)|Mike Quigley]] who argued that spending cuts would accomplish the same purpose. Peraica additionally responded that Cook County's poorest citizens, who the tax hike is ultimately designed to serve, would find it to be the most unaffordable. Peraica's argument was seconded by then-Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]], who expressed his opposition to the plan.<ref name=abc002 /> Gorman was instrumental, however, in refusing to back down and she introduced a resolution to repeal the sales tax on three separate occasions, finally winning board majority support on the third effort.\n\nOn February 29, 2008, the Cook County Board, by a measure of 10-7, passed a budget initiated by Stroger. Stroger's budget contained a tax increase of 1 percentage point, the largest ever passed by Cook County, with the intent of creating more than 1,000 new County jobs. As a result of Stroger's bill, on July 1 the County sales tax increased from 0.75 percent to 1.75 percent bringing Chicago's overall sales tax to 10.25 percent, which was the highest of any major U.S. city, while the sales tax was a minimum of 8.75 percent in suburban Cook County. All five [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] members of the County Board voted against the tax increase and they were joined by two of the twelve Democrats. Commissioners who voted against the tax increase were [[Peter N. Silvestri]], Quigley, Claypool, [[Gregg Goslin]], [[Timothy Schneider]], Peraica, and [[Elizabeth Ann Doody Gorman]].<ref name=crains>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=28420|accessdate=2008-03-05|title=Cook Co. OKs budget with sales tax hike|author=Associated Press|publisher=Chicago Business}}</ref>  Despite the 133% increase, Dunnings stated on March 31, 2008, that the budget shortfall resolved that year is expected to return.  She explained that the expected cost increase would be the result of what she described as a 'structural deficit', meaning increases in revenue being unable to match increases in expense, citing runaway health care costs among other problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbbm780.com/Stroger-s-CFO-Cousin-Defends-Steep-Tax-Hikes/1918215|accessdate=2008-04-03|title=Stroger's CFO Cousin Defends Steep Tax Hikes|author=Craig Dellimore|publisher=WBBM780.com |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080528130800/http://www.wbbm780.com/Stroger-s-CFO-Cousin-Defends-Steep-Tax-Hikes/1918215 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-28}}</ref>  A county spokesman indicated that it would most likely happen in three or four years, well into the next county presidential term.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-county-dunnings-01apr01,1,4261275.story|accessdate=2008-04-03|title=Despite big sales tax, shortfall seen for Cook County|author=Hal Dardick|newspaper=Chicago Tribune | date=April 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nBecause of a number of unanswered questions and unresolved issues surrounding the county tax increase, Cook County's outlying communities, particularly [[Palatine, IL]], considered secession and threatened to do so unless an explanation was provided. To avoid this schism, officials from Palatine and Cook County, including Stroger initially, agreed to hold a [[town hall meeting]] at [[Harper College]] on April 30 to discuss details of the hike that remain unclear.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=166344&src=1|accessdate=2008-04-03|title=Palatine will get chance to pepper Stroger|author=Kimberly Pohl|newspaper=The Daily Herald}}</ref>  However, on April 29, Stroger announced that he would not attend, accusing Palatine officials of using the meeting for political grandstanding indicating that he \"[would] not debate local Palatine elected officials who expect to exploit this opportunity to further their own political agendas\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagoist.com/2008/04/30/todd_stroger_to.php|accessdate=2008-04-30|title=Todd Stroger to Skip Palatine Meeting After All|author=Kevin Robinson|publisher=Chicagoist|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501045038/http://chicagoist.com/2008/04/30/todd_stroger_to.php|archivedate=2008-05-01}}</ref> Eventually, Stroger did attend the Town Hall, which resulted in heavy press coverage and several ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' articles refuting the claims he made while presenting there.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe tax increase was later partially rolled back by 0.5%.  {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Chicago's overall sales tax is 9.75% and suburban Cook County is at minimum 8.25%.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box |\n  before=[[Bobbie L.
