Due to associated calcifications, the imaging of patients with Peyronie's disease shows acoustic shadowing, as illustrated in figures below. Less common findings, attributed to earlier stages of the disease (still mild fibrosis), are hypoechoic lesions with focal thickening of the paracavernous tissues, echoic focal thickening of the tunica without posterior acoustic shadowing, retractile isoechoic lesions with posterior attenuation of the beam, and focal loss of the continuity of the tunica albuginea.. In the Doppler study, increased flow around the plaques can suggest inflammatory activity and the absence of flow can suggest disease stability. Ultrasound is useful for the identification of lesions and to determine their relationship with the neurovascular bundle. Individuals with Peyronie's disease can present with erectile dysfunction, often related to venous leakage, due to insufficient drainage at the site of the plaque. Although plaques are more common on the dorsum of the penis, they can also be seen on the ventral face, lateral face, or septum.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\">Originally copied from:<br>{{cite journal|last1=Fernandes|first1=Mait\u00ea Aline Vieira|last2=Souza|first2=Luis Ronan Marquez Ferreira de|last3=Cartafina|first3=Luciano Pousa|title=Ultrasound evaluation of the penis|journal=Radiologia Brasileira|volume=51|issue=4|year=2018|pages=257\u2013261|issn=1678-7099|doi=10.1590/0100-3984.2016.0152|pmid=30202130|pmc=6124582}}<br>[[Creative Commons|CC-BY]] license</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ultrasonography of orpus cavernosum calcification.jpg|Transverse ultrasound of the penis, in a ventral view, in the middle portion of the penis.

Due to associated calcifications, the imaging of patients with Peyronie's disease shows acoustic shadowing, as illustrated in figures below. Less common findings, attributed to earlier stages of the disease (still mild fibrosis), are hypoechoic lesions with focal thickening of the paracavernous tissues, echoic focal thickening of the tunica without posterior acoustic shadowing, retractile isoechoic lesions with posterior attenuation of the beam, and focal loss of the continuity of the tunica albuginea.. In the Doppler study, increased flow around the plaques can suggest inflammatory activity and the absence of flow can suggest disease stability. Ultrasound is useful for the identification of lesions and to determine their relationship with the neurovascular bundle. Individuals with Peyronie's disease can present with erectile dysfunction, often related to venous leakage, due to insufficient drainage at the site of the plaque. Although plaques are more common on the dorsum of the penis, they can also be seen on the ventral face, lateral face, or septum.<ref name=\"FernandesSouza2018\">Originally copied from:<br>{{cite journal|last1=Fernandes|first1=Mait\u00ea Aline Vieira|last2=Souza|first2=Luis Ronan Marquez Ferreira de|last3=Cartafina|first3=Luciano Pousa|title=Ultrasound evaluation of the penis|journal=Radiologia Brasileira|volume=51|issue=4|year=2018|pages=257\u2013261|issn=1678-7099|doi=10.1590/0100-3984.2016.0152|pmid=30202130|pmc=6124582}}<br>[[Creative Commons|CC-BY]] license</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ultrasonography of orpus cavernosum calcification.jpg|Transverse ultrasound of the penis, in a ventral view, in the middle portion of the penis.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland.<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s.

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

A dark-colored dye is also added to the oil, along with [[surfactant]]s and charging agents that cause the particles to take on an electric charge. This mixture is placed between two parallel, conductive plates separated by a gap of 10 to 100 [[micrometre]]s. When a voltage is applied across the two plates, the particles migrate [[electrophoresis|electrophoretically]] to the plate that bears the opposite charge from that on the particles. When the particles are located at the front (viewing) side of the display, it appears white, because the light is scattered back to the viewer by the high-index{{clarify|date=December 2019}} titania particles. When the particles are located at the rear side of the display, it appears dark, because the incident light is absorbed by the colored dye. If the rear electrode is divided into a number of small picture elements ([[pixel]]s), then an image can be formed by applying the appropriate voltage to each region of the display to create a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions.\n\nAn electrophoretic display is also known as an EPD. They are typically addressed using [[MOSFET]]-based [[thin-film transistor]] (TFT) technology. TFTs are required{{cn|date=December 2019}} to form a high-density image in an EPD.

Albert, [[Barrett Comiskey]], Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded [[E Ink Corporation]] in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with [[Philips|Philips Components]] two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to [[Prime View International]]. <blockquote>\"It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analog of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1\u20135 \u03bcm), quite distinct from the molecular-scale properties that govern the behavior of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-[[Lambertian reflectance|lambertian]] viewing characteristic, result in an 'ink on paper' look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title= An electrophoretic ink for all-printed reflective electronic displays|journal= Nature|date= 1998-07-16|issn= 0028-0836|pages= 253\u2013255|volume= 394|issue= 6690|doi= 10.1038/28349|first= Barrett|last= Comiskey|first2= J.

This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.\nOne early version of the electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white [[titanium dioxide]] particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively [[electric charge|charged]], and each one is naturally white.<ref name=\"newscientist_1\"/>\nThe screen holds microcapsules in a layer of [[liquid]] [[polymer]], sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.\nThe network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |newspaper=New Scientist |title=Roll The Presses |date=24 April 2001 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn659-roll-the-presses.html |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=John A |last1=Rogers |first2=Zhenan |last2=Bao |first3=Kirk |last3=Baldwin |first4=Ananth |last4=Dodabalapur |first5=Brian |last5=Crone |first6=V R |last6=Raju |first7=Valerie |last7=Kuck |first8=Howard |last8=Katz |first9=Karl |last9=Amundson |first10=Jay |last10=Ewing |first11=Paul |last11=Drzaic |title=Paper-like electronic displays: Large-area rubber-stamped plastic sheets of electronics and microencapsulated electrophoretic inks |date=24 April 2001 |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=4835\u20134840 |doi=10.1073/pnas.091588098 |pmid=11320233 |pmc=33123}}</ref> These are commercially referred to as Active Matrix Electrophoretic Displays (AMEPD).\n\n===Electrowetting===\n{{Main|Electrowetting}}\nElectrowetting display (EWD) is based on controlling the shape of a confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.\n\nDisplays based on [[electrowetting]] provide several attractive features. The switching between white and colored reflection is fast enough to display video content.<ref>{{citation |last=Zyga |first=Lisa |date=26 July 2010 |title=Oil-based color pixels could let you watch videos on e-paper |url=https://phys.org/news/2010-07-oil-based-pixels-videos-e-paper.html |newspaper=PhysOrg |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> It's a low-power, low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better than or equal to other reflective display types and approach the visual qualities of paper. In addition, the technology offers a unique path toward high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies.<ref>LiquaVista electrowetting display technologies http://www.liquavista.com</ref> Instead of using red, green, and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one-third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electrowetting allows for a system in which one sub-pixel can switch two different colors independently.\n\nThis results in the availability of two-thirds of the display area to reflect light in any desired color. This is achieved by building up a pixel with a stack of two independently controllable colored oil films plus a color filter.\n\nThe colors are [[CMYK color model|cyan, magenta, and yellow]], which is a subtractive system, comparable to the principle used in inkjet printing. Compared to LCD, brightness is gained because no polarisers are required.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |date=October 2, 2003 |title=The Hindu: Technology for reflective full-color display |access-date=2018-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309052402/http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |archive-date=2011-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFunctional electrowetting displays were produced by [[Liquavista]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquavista.com|title=Home - Liquavista - Electrowetting based low power, always viewable color video displays|publisher=}}</ref> [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]],<ref>[http://www.itri.org.tw/eng/news-and-events/feature-story-detail.asp?RootNodeId=050&NodeId=0502&FocusNewsNBR=52] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and [[Advanced Display Technologies]].<ref>Blankenbach K, Schmoll A, Bitman A, Bartels F and Jerosch D 2008 Novel highly reflective and bistable electrowetting displays SID J. 16 237\u201344</ref><ref>http://www.iop.org/Select/article/0960-1317/19/6/065029/jmm9_6_065029.pdf?request-id=37ba45f3-e740-4c0d-8c35-dcf2d9af1f10</ref>\n\n====Electrofluidic====\n[[Electrofluidic display]] is a variation of an electrowetting display. Electrofluidic displays place an aqueous pigment dispersion inside a tiny reservoir. The reservoir comprises <5-10% of the viewable pixel area and therefore the pigment is substantially hidden from view.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gamma Dynamic Technology|url=http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|publisher=Gamma Dynamics|accessdate=1 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303154148/http://gammadynamics.net/technology/|archive-date=3 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Voltage is used to electromechanically pull the pigment out of the reservoir and spread it as a film directly behind the viewing substrate. As a result, the display takes on color and brightness similar to that of conventional pigments printed on paper. When voltage is removed liquid surface tension causes the pigment dispersion to rapidly recoil into the reservoir. The technology can potentially provide >85 % white state reflectance for electronic paper.<ref>[https://www.nature.com/articles/nphoton.2009.66 May 2009 issue of Nature Photonics]</ref>\n\nThe core technology was invented at the Novel Devices Laboratory at the [[University of Cincinnati]].

The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on the thickness of the insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full-color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (>50 %), strong contrast (>30 %), the fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (< 0.5&nbsp;mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (>10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent. Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.\n\n===Other technologies===\nOther research efforts into e-paper have involved using [[OFET|organic transistors]] embedded into [[flexible substrate]]s,<ref name=\"organic_transistors\">{{cite journal |last1= Huitema |first1= H.

The array of pixels is divided into [[triad (monitors)|triad]]s, typically consisting of the standard cyan, magenta and yellow, in the same way as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors (although using subtractive primary colors as opposed to additive primary colors). The display is then controlled like any other electronic color display.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nElectronic paper technologies sometimes have a very low refresh rate compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCDs. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard [[mobile device]]s. An example of this limit is that a document might not be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.\n\n[[File:e-ink ghost.jpg|thumb|right|An e-ink screen showing the \"ghost\" of a prior image]]\n\nAnother limit is that a shadow of an image may be visible after refreshing parts of the screen. Such shadows are termed \"ghost images\", and the effect is termed \"ghosting\". This effect is reminiscent of [[screen burn-in]] but, unlike screen burn-in, is solved after the screen is refreshed several times. Turning every pixel white, then black, then white, helps normalize the contrast of the pixels. This is why several devices with this technology \"flash\" the entire screen white and black when loading a new image.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nE Ink Corporation of E Ink Holdings Inc. released the first colored e-ink displays to be used in a marketed product.

While the technologies used by each company provide many of the same features, each has its own distinct technological advantages. All electronic paper technologies face the following general challenges:\n\n*A method for encapsulation\n*An ink or active material to fill the encapsulation\n*Electronics to activate the ink\n\nElectronic ink can be applied to flexible or rigid materials. For flexible displays, the base requires a thin, flexible material tough enough to withstand considerable wear, such as extremely thin plastic. The method of how the inks are encapsulated and then applied to the substrate is what distinguishes each company from others. These processes are complex and are carefully guarded industry secrets. Nevertheless, making electronic paper is less complex and costly than LCDs.\n\nThere are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of [[liquid crystal display]]s, [[electrochromic]] displays, and the electronic equivalent of an [[Etch A Sketch]] at Kyushu University. Advantages of electronic paper include low power usage (power is only drawn when the display is updated), flexibility and better readability than most displays. Electronic ink can be printed on any surface, including walls, billboards, product labels and T-shirts. The ink's flexibility would also make it possible to develop [[rollable display]]s for electronic devices.\n\n[[File:Motorola F3.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The [[Motorola FONE F3|Motorola F3]] uses an e-paper display instead of an LCD.]]\n\n===Wristwatches===\nIn December 2005, [[Seiko]] released the first electronic ink based watch called the Spectrum SVRD001 wristwatch, which has a [[rollable display|flexible]] electrophoretic display<ref>[http://www.akihabaranews.com//en/news-10749-The+first+watch+that+uses+flexible+e-paper+hits+the+stores.html \"The first watch that uses flexible e-paper hits the stores\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812060102/http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-10749-The+first+watch+that+uses+flexible+e-paper+hits+the+stores.html |date=2009-08-12}}\n2005-12-01</ref> and in March 2010 Seiko released a second generation of this famous e-ink watch with an active matrix display.<ref>[http://www.seikowatches.com/baselworld/2010/precon/0402-epd.html \"Baselworld 2010 - Seiko Press Conference - Future Now, EPD Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325033542/http://www.seikowatches.com/baselworld/2010/precon/0402-epd.html |date=2010-03-25}}\n2010-04-01\n</ref> The [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] smart watch (2013) uses a low-power memory [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] manufactured by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] for its e-paper display.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Pebble%20Teardown/13319/1|title=Pebble Teardown|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nIn 2019, [[Fossil Group|Fossil]] launched a hybrid smartwatch called the Hybrid HR, integrating an always on E-ink display with physical hands and dial to simulate the look of a traditional analog watch.<ref>[https://www.cnet.com/news/fossils-new-always-on-smartwatch-looks-like-a-smarter-pebble/ \"Fossil's new always-on smartwatch looks like a smarter Pebble\"]</ref>\n\n===E-book readers===\n[[File:Bouquin \u00e9lectronique iLiad en plein soleil.jpg|thumb|[[iLiad]] e-book reader equipped with an e-paper display visible in the sunlight]]\n{{Main|Comparison of e-readers}}\nIn 2004 [[Sony]] released the [[Sony Librie|Libri\u00e9]] in Japan, the first e-book reader with an electronic paper [[E Ink]] display.

A dark-colored dye is also added to the oil, along with [[surfactant]]s and charging agents that cause the particles to take on an electric charge. This mixture is placed between two parallel, conductive plates separated by a gap of 10 to 100 [[micrometre]]s. When a voltage is applied across the two plates, the particles migrate [[electrophoresis|electrophoretically]] to the plate that bears the opposite charge from that on the particles. When the particles are located at the front (viewing) side of the display, it appears white, because the light is scattered back to the viewer by the high-index{{clarify|date=December 2019}} titania particles. When the particles are located at the rear side of the display, it appears dark, because the incident light is absorbed by the colored dye. If the rear electrode is divided into a number of small picture elements ([[pixel]]s), then an image can be formed by applying the appropriate voltage to each region of the display to create a pattern of reflecting and absorbing regions.\n\nAn electrophoretic display is also known as an EPD. They are typically addressed using [[MOSFET]]-based [[thin-film transistor]] (TFT) technology. TFTs are required{{cn|date=December 2019}} to form a high-density image in an EPD.

Albert, [[Barrett Comiskey]], Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded [[E Ink Corporation]] in 1997 to commercialize the technology.

In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to [[Prime View International]]. <blockquote>\"It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analog of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the electromigration of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1\u20135 \u03bcm), quite distinct from the molecular-scale properties that govern the behavior of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-[[Lambertian reflectance|lambertian]] viewing characteristic, result in an 'ink on paper' look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title= An electrophoretic ink for all-printed reflective electronic displays|journal= Nature|date= 1998-07-16|issn= 0028-0836|pages= 253\u2013255|volume= 394|issue= 6690|doi= 10.1038/28349|first= Barrett|last= Comiskey|first2= J.

This was essentially a reintroduction of the well-known [[electrophoresis|electrophoretic]] display technology, but microcapsules meant the display could be made on flexible plastic sheets instead of glass.\nOne early version of the electronic paper consists of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 [[micrometre|micrometer]]s across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white [[titanium dioxide]] particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively [[electric charge|charged]], and each one is naturally white.<ref name=\"newscientist_1\"/>\nThe screen holds microcapsules in a layer of [[liquid]] [[polymer]], sandwiched between two arrays of electrodes, the upper of which is transparent. The two arrays are aligned to divide the sheet into pixels, and each pixel corresponds to a pair of electrodes situated on either side of the sheet. The sheet is laminated with transparent plastic for protection, resulting in an overall thickness of 80 micrometers, or twice that of ordinary paper.\nThe network of electrodes connects to display circuitry, which turns the electronic ink 'on' and 'off' at specific pixels by applying a voltage to specific electrode pairs. A negative charge to the surface electrode repels the particles to the bottom of local capsules, forcing the black dye to the surface and turning the pixel black. Reversing the voltage has the opposite effect. It forces the particles to the surface, turning the pixel white. A more recent implementation of this concept requires only one layer of electrodes beneath the microcapsules.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |newspaper=New Scientist |title=Roll The Presses |date=24 April 2001 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn659-roll-the-presses.html |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first1=John A |last1=Rogers |first2=Zhenan |last2=Bao |first3=Kirk |last3=Baldwin |first4=Ananth |last4=Dodabalapur |first5=Brian |last5=Crone |first6=V R |last6=Raju |first7=Valerie |last7=Kuck |first8=Howard |last8=Katz |first9=Karl |last9=Amundson |first10=Jay |last10=Ewing |first11=Paul |last11=Drzaic |title=Paper-like electronic displays: Large-area rubber-stamped plastic sheets of electronics and microencapsulated electrophoretic inks |date=24 April 2001 |journal=PNAS |volume=98 |issue=9 |pages=4835\u20134840 |doi=10.1073/pnas.091588098 |pmid=11320233 |pmc=33123}}</ref> These are commercially referred to as Active Matrix Electrophoretic Displays (AMEPD).\n\n===Electrowetting===\n{{Main|Electrowetting}}\nElectrowetting display (EWD) is based on controlling the shape of a confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With no voltage applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.\n\nDisplays based on [[electrowetting]] provide several attractive features. The switching between white and colored reflection is fast enough to display video content.<ref>{{citation |last=Zyga |first=Lisa |date=26 July 2010 |title=Oil-based color pixels could let you watch videos on e-paper |url=https://phys.org/news/2010-07-oil-based-pixels-videos-e-paper.html |newspaper=PhysOrg |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref> It's a low-power, low-voltage technology, and displays based on the effect can be made flat and thin. The reflectivity and contrast are better than or equal to other reflective display types and approach the visual qualities of paper. In addition, the technology offers a unique path toward high-brightness full-color displays, leading to displays that are four times brighter than reflective LCDs and twice as bright as other emerging technologies.<ref>LiquaVista electrowetting display technologies http://www.liquavista.com</ref> Instead of using red, green, and blue (RGB) filters or alternating segments of the three primary colors, which effectively result in only one-third of the display reflecting light in the desired color, electrowetting allows for a system in which one sub-pixel can switch two different colors independently.\n\nThis results in the availability of two-thirds of the display area to reflect light in any desired color. This is achieved by building up a pixel with a stack of two independently controllable colored oil films plus a color filter.\n\nThe colors are [[CMYK color model|cyan, magenta, and yellow]], which is a subtractive system, comparable to the principle used in inkjet printing. Compared to LCD, brightness is gained because no polarisers are required.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |date=October 2, 2003 |title=The Hindu: Technology for reflective full-color display |access-date=2018-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309052402/http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2003/10/02/stories/2003100200060200.htm |archive-date=2011-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFunctional electrowetting displays were produced by [[Liquavista]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liquavista.com|title=Home - Liquavista - Electrowetting based low power, always viewable color video displays|publisher=}}</ref> [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]],<ref>[http://www.itri.org.tw/eng/news-and-events/feature-story-detail.asp?RootNodeId=050&NodeId=0502&FocusNewsNBR=52] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and [[Advanced Display Technologies]].<ref>Blankenbach K, Schmoll A, Bitman A, Bartels F and Jerosch D 2008 Novel highly reflective and bistable electrowetting displays SID J. 16 237\u201344</ref><ref>http://www.iop.org/Select/article/0960-1317/19/6/065029/jmm9_6_065029.pdf?request-id=37ba45f3-e740-4c0d-8c35-dcf2d9af1f10</ref>\n\n====Electrofluidic====\n[[Electrofluidic display]] is a variation of an electrowetting display.

The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on the thickness of the insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full-color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (>50 %), strong contrast (>30 %), the fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (< 0.5&nbsp;mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (>10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent. Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.\n\n===Other technologies===\nOther research efforts into e-paper have involved using [[OFET|organic transistors]] embedded into [[flexible substrate]]s,<ref name=\"organic_transistors\">{{cite journal |last1= Huitema |first1= H.

The array of pixels is divided into [[triad (monitors)|triad]]s, typically consisting of the standard cyan, magenta and yellow, in the same way as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors (although using subtractive primary colors as opposed to additive primary colors). The display is then controlled like any other electronic color display.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nElectronic paper technologies sometimes have a very low refresh rate compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCDs. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard [[mobile device]]s. An example of this limit is that a document might not be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.\n\n[[File:e-ink ghost.jpg|thumb|right|An e-ink screen showing the \"ghost\" of a prior image]]\n\nAnother limit is that a shadow of an image may be visible after refreshing parts of the screen. Such shadows are termed \"ghost images\", and the effect is termed \"ghosting\". This effect is reminiscent of [[screen burn-in]] but, unlike screen burn-in, is solved after the screen is refreshed several times. Turning every pixel white, then black, then white, helps normalize the contrast of the pixels. This is why several devices with this technology \"flash\" the entire screen white and black when loading a new image.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nE Ink Corporation of E Ink Holdings Inc. released the first colored e-ink displays to be used in a marketed product.

While the technologies used by each company provide many of the same features, each has its own distinct technological advantages. All electronic paper technologies face the following general challenges:\n\n*A method for encapsulation\n*An ink or active material to fill the encapsulation\n*Electronics to activate the ink\n\nElectronic ink can be applied to flexible or rigid materials. For flexible displays, the base requires a thin, flexible material tough enough to withstand considerable wear, such as extremely thin plastic. The method of how the inks are encapsulated and then applied to the substrate is what distinguishes each company from others. These processes are complex and are carefully guarded industry secrets. Nevertheless, making electronic paper is less complex and costly than LCDs.\n\nThere are many approaches to electronic paper, with many companies developing technology in this area. Other technologies being applied to electronic paper include modifications of [[liquid crystal display]]s, [[electrochromic]] displays, and the electronic equivalent of an [[Etch A Sketch]] at Kyushu University. Advantages of electronic paper include low power usage (power is only drawn when the display is updated), flexibility and better readability than most displays. Electronic ink can be printed on any surface, including walls, billboards, product labels and T-shirts. The ink's flexibility would also make it possible to develop [[rollable display]]s for electronic devices.\n\n[[File:Motorola F3.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The [[Motorola FONE F3|Motorola F3]] uses an e-paper display instead of an LCD.]]\n\n===Wristwatches===\nIn December 2005, [[Seiko]] released the first electronic ink based watch called the Spectrum SVRD001 wristwatch, which has a [[rollable display|flexible]] electrophoretic display<ref>[http://www.akihabaranews.com//en/news-10749-The+first+watch+that+uses+flexible+e-paper+hits+the+stores.html \"The first watch that uses flexible e-paper hits the stores\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812060102/http://www.akihabaranews.com/en/news-10749-The+first+watch+that+uses+flexible+e-paper+hits+the+stores.html |date=2009-08-12}}\n2005-12-01</ref> and in March 2010 Seiko released a second generation of this famous e-ink watch with an active matrix display.<ref>[http://www.seikowatches.com/baselworld/2010/precon/0402-epd.html \"Baselworld 2010 - Seiko Press Conference - Future Now, EPD Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325033542/http://www.seikowatches.com/baselworld/2010/precon/0402-epd.html |date=2010-03-25}}\n2010-04-01\n</ref> The [[Pebble (watch)|Pebble]] smart watch (2013) uses a low-power memory [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] manufactured by [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] for its e-paper display.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Pebble%20Teardown/13319/1|title=Pebble Teardown|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nIn 2019, [[Fossil Group|Fossil]] launched a hybrid smartwatch called the Hybrid HR, integrating an always on E-ink display with physical hands and dial to simulate the look of a traditional analog watch.<ref>[https://www.cnet.com/news/fossils-new-always-on-smartwatch-looks-like-a-smarter-pebble/ \"Fossil's new always-on smartwatch looks like a smarter Pebble\"]</ref>\n\n===E-book readers===\n[[File:Bouquin \u00e9lectronique iLiad en plein soleil.jpg|thumb|[[iLiad]] e-book reader equipped with an e-paper display visible in the sunlight]]\n{{Main|Comparison of e-readers}}\nIn 2004 [[Sony]] released the [[Sony Librie|Libri\u00e9]] in Japan, the first e-book reader with an electronic paper [[E Ink]] display.

In November 2008, Sony released the PRS-700BC, which incorporated a backlight and a touchscreen.\n\nIn late 2007, Amazon began producing and marketing the [[Amazon Kindle]], an e-book reader with an e-paper display. In February 2009, Amazon released the [[Kindle 2]] and in May 2009 the larger [[Kindle DX]] was announced.

Paleogeography, Paleontology, Palynology, Tectonics, and several other knids of works have been done along the Formation. The Most Studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on Late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

[[Dormettingen]] shales have been calculated biochronologically and with isochron data, giving and approximate age of 183.0 million years old, being close to the [[Pliensbachian]] boundary based on the recent revisions of the Early Jurassic Subperiods.<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/>The Toarcian and the Pliensbachian are considered as strongly constrained in terms of chronology, although that doesn\u00b4t imply that all the formations labelled to one of the two periods have to be limited; for example Lithuanian [[Neringa Formation]] whose upper strata matches with the lowermost Toarcian (183.0).<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/> The rich Shale of the foreland area of the Swabian and Franconian Alb have been recovered as part of the Posidonia, with samples that expose an age between 183.0 to 181.1, thus recovering the Lower Toarcian strata. Although the east margin of the formation has yield strata with an age of 179.7 m.a, showing the presence of the depositional environment on Middle Toarcian times.<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/>\n\n== Oil ==\n[[File:Mistelgau Fossiliengrube 29.04.10.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Former clay pit in Mistelgau]]\n\nRecent studies have shown that the petroleum generation potential of the PS is high in all studied regions due to the high TOC and Hydrogen Index.

The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]] (HPG axis) functions normally at birth and well into adult life, giving normal puberty and normal reproductive function. The HPG axis then either fails totally or is reduced to a very low level of GnRH release in adult life with no obvious cause (e.g. a pituitary tumour). This will lead to a fall in testosterone or oestrogen levels and infertility.<ref name=\"National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD)\"/><ref name=\"NIH Genetics Home Reference\">{{cite web|title=Kallmann syndrome|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/kallmann-syndrome|website=National Institutes for Health.

This occurs in an estimated 10 to 22% of people, primarily normosmic CHH cases rather than KS cases and only found in people who have undergone some form of testosterone replacement therapy. It is only normally discovered when testicular volume increases while on testosterone treatment alone and testosterone levels return to normal when treatment is stopped. This type of KS/HH rarely occurs in cases where males have had a history of un-descended testes.<ref name=\"pmid:28476224\"/><ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\nAffected individuals with KS and other forms of HH are almost invariably born with normal sexual differentiation; i.e., they are physically male or female. This is due to the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) produced by [[placenta]] at approximately 12 to 20 weeks [[gestation]] (pregnancy) which is normally unaffected by having KS or CHH.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Pediatric Endocrinology E-Book |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |page=136 |isbn=9781455759736}}</ref>\n\nPeople with KS/HH lack the surge of GnRH, LH, and FSH that normally occurs between birth and six months of age. This surge is particularly important in infant boys as it helps with testicular descent into the scrotum. The surge of GnRH/LH/FSH in non KS/HH children gives detectable levels of testosterone in boys and oestrogen and progesterone in girls. The lack of this surge can sometimes be used as a diagnostic tool if KS/HH is suspected in a newborn boy, but is not normally distinct enough for diagnosis in girls.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\n===Osteoporosis===\nOne possible side effect of having KS/CHH is the increased risk of developing secondary [[osteoporosis]] or [[osteopenia]].

Hypogonadism can occur through a number of different mechanisms. The use of the term hypogonadotropic relates to the fact that the hypogonadism found in HH is caused by a disruption in the production of the [[gonadotropin]] hormones normally released by the [[anterior pituitary gland]] known as [[luteinising hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH).<ref name=\"pmid21511493\" /><ref name=\"pmid:26934720\"/> Failure in GnRH activity can otherwise be due to the absence of the GnRH releasing neurons inside the hypothalamus. HH can occur as an isolated condition with just the LH and FSH production being affected or it can occur in combined pituitary deficiency conditions.\n\nIn the first 10 weeks of normal embryonic development, the GnRH releasing neurons migrate from their original source in the nasal region and end up inside the hypothalamus. These neurons originate in an area of the developing head, the [[olfactory placode]], that will give rise to the olfactory epithelium; they then pass through the [[cribriform plate]], along with the fibres of the olfactory nerves, and into the [[rostral forebrain]]. From there they migrate to what will become the hypothalamus.

The severity of the symptoms will also vary from case to case. Even family members will not show the same range or severity of symptoms.<ref name=\"pmid:20301509\"/><ref name=\"pmid:28476224\"/>\n\nKS/HH is most often present from birth but adult onset versions are found in both males and females. The [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis]] (HPG axis) functions normally at birth and well into adult life, giving normal puberty and normal reproductive function. The HPG axis then either fails totally or is reduced to a very low level of GnRH release in adult life with no obvious cause (e.g. a pituitary tumour). This will lead to a fall in testosterone or oestrogen levels and infertility.<ref name=\"National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD)\"/><ref name=\"NIH Genetics Home Reference\">{{cite web|title=Kallmann syndrome|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/kallmann-syndrome|website=National Institutes for Health.

This occurs in an estimated 10 to 22% of people, primarily normosmic CHH cases rather than KS cases and only found in people who have undergone some form of testosterone replacement therapy. It is only normally discovered when testicular volume increases while on testosterone treatment alone and testosterone levels return to normal when treatment is stopped. This type of KS/HH rarely occurs in cases where males have had a history of un-descended testes.<ref name=\"pmid:28476224\"/><ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\nAffected individuals with KS and other forms of HH are almost invariably born with normal sexual differentiation; i.e., they are physically male or female. This is due to the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) produced by [[placenta]] at approximately 12 to 20 weeks [[gestation]] (pregnancy) which is normally unaffected by having KS or CHH.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Mark |date=2014 |title=Pediatric Endocrinology E-Book |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |page=136 |isbn=9781455759736}}</ref>\n\nPeople with KS/HH lack the surge of GnRH, LH, and FSH that normally occurs between birth and six months of age. This surge is particularly important in infant boys as it helps with testicular descent into the scrotum. The surge of GnRH/LH/FSH in non KS/HH children gives detectable levels of testosterone in boys and oestrogen and progesterone in girls. The lack of this surge can sometimes be used as a diagnostic tool if KS/HH is suspected in a newborn boy, but is not normally distinct enough for diagnosis in girls.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\n===Osteoporosis===\nOne possible side effect of having KS/CHH is the increased risk of developing secondary [[osteoporosis]] or [[osteopenia]]. Oestrogen (females) or testosterone (males) is essential for maintaining [[bone density]].<ref name=\"pmid9024272\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo CY, Jones TH, Eastell R | title = Treatment of isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism effect on bone mineral density and bone turnover | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 82 | issue = 2 | pages = 658\u201365 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9024272 | doi = 10.1210/jc.82.2.658 }}</ref> Deficiency in either testosterone or oestrogen can increase the rate of [[bone resorption]] while at the same time slowing down the rate of [[bone formation]].

Bone density scans are recommended to monitor the bone mineral density.<ref name=\"National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD)\"/>\n\nThe bone density scan is known as a [[dual energy X-ray absorptiometry]] scan (DEXA or DXA scan). It is a simple test, taking less than 15 minutes to perform.

The term isolated GnRH deficiency (IGD) has increasingly been used to describe this group of conditions as it highlights the primary cause of these conditions and distinguishes them from other conditions such as [[Klinefelter syndrome]] or [[Turner syndrome]] which share some similar symptoms but have a different etiology.<ref name=\"pmid:21664415\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Au MG, Crowley WF, Buck CL | title = Genetic counseling for isolated GnRH deficiency | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 346 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 102\u20139 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21664415 | pmc = 3185214 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2011.05.041 }}</ref> The term hypogonadism describes a low level of circulating [[sex hormones]]; [[testosterone]] in males and [[oestrogen]] and [[progesterone]] in females. Hypogonadism can occur through a number of different mechanisms. The use of the term hypogonadotropic relates to the fact that the hypogonadism found in HH is caused by a disruption in the production of the [[gonadotropin]] hormones normally released by the [[anterior pituitary gland]] known as [[luteinising hormone]] (LH) and [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH).<ref name=\"pmid21511493\" /><ref name=\"pmid:26934720\"/> Failure in GnRH activity can otherwise be due to the absence of the GnRH releasing neurons inside the hypothalamus. HH can occur as an isolated condition with just the LH and FSH production being affected or it can occur in combined pituitary deficiency conditions.\n\nIn the first 10 weeks of normal embryonic development, the GnRH releasing neurons migrate from their original source in the nasal region and end up inside the hypothalamus. These neurons originate in an area of the developing head, the [[olfactory placode]], that will give rise to the olfactory epithelium; they then pass through the [[cribriform plate]], along with the fibres of the olfactory nerves, and into the [[rostral forebrain]]. From there they migrate to what will become the hypothalamus. Any problems with the development of the olfactory nerve fibres will prevent the progression of the GnRH releasing neurons towards the brain.<ref name=\"pmid:20940512\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Teixeira L, Guimiot F, Dod\u00e9 C, Fallet-Bianco C, Millar RP, Delezoide AL, Hardelin JP | title = Defective migration of neuroendocrine GnRH cells in human arrhinencephalic conditions | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 120 | issue = 10 | pages = 3668\u201372 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20940512 | pmc = 2947242 | doi = 10.1172/JCI43699 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosing KS and other forms of CHH is complicated by the difficulties in distinguishing between a normal constitutional delay of puberty or a case of KS/CHH.<ref name=\"pmid:23207503\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pitteloud N | title = Managing delayed or altered puberty in boys | journal = BMJ | volume = 345 | issue = Dec 3 | pages = e7913 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23207503 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e7913 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid:24836550\" /><ref name=\"pmid22392951\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Young J | title = Approach to the male patient with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 97 | issue = 3 | pages = 707\u201318 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22392951 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2011-1664 }}</ref> The diagnosis is often one of exclusion found during the workup of [[delayed puberty]].<ref name=\"Peter A.

Different formulations of testosterone are used to ensure both the [[anabolic]] and [[androgenic]] effects of testosterone are achieved.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/><ref name=\"pmid:24836550\"/> [[Nasal administration|Nasal]] testosterone delivery methods have been developed but their use in KS/CHH treatment has not been formally evaluated.<ref name=\"pmid:20301509\"/>\n\nGonadotropin therapy, in the form of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) injections, with or without the use of FSH, can also be used in male patients to induce secondary sexual characteristic development alongside possible fertility induction.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\nFor females, hormone replacement involves the use of oestrogen and progesterone. Firstly, oestrogen is used in tablet or gel form in order to maximise breast development, then a combination of oestrogen and progesterone is used.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/><ref name=\"pmid:20301509\"/> Cyclical progesterone is normally required to help keep the [[endometrium]] (lining of the [[uterus]]) healthy.<ref name=\"pmid:20301509\"/>\n\nIn males, the monitoring of treatment normally requires the measurement of serum testosterone, [[inhibin B]], [[haematocrit]] and [[prostate-specific antigen]] (PSA). If injections are used, trough levels are taken to ensure an adequate level of testosterone is achieved throughout the injection cycle.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\nIn females monitoring normally consists of measurement of oestrogen, FSH, LH, [[inhibin B]] and [[anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone]] (AMH).<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\nStandard hormone replacement therapy will not normally induce fertility in either males or females, with no testicular growth in males. Early treatment as adolescents can help with psychological well being of people with KS/CHH.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/>\n\n===Fertility treatments===\nGonadotropin therapy can be used in both male and female patients in order to achieve fertility for some people.<ref name=\"pmid:26194704\"/><ref name=\"pmid:20301509\"/>\n\nPulsatile GnRH therapy can also be used to induce fertility, especially in females, but its use is limited to a few specialist treatment centres.<ref name=\"pmid:20301509\"/>\n\nIn males with KS/CHH, infertility is primarily due the lack of [[sperm]] production within the [[testes]]. Sperm production can be achieved through either the use of GnRH administered via a micro infusion pump or through the use of gonadotropin injections ([[Human chorionic gonadotropin|hCG]], FSH, [[Human menopausal gonadotrophin|hMG]]). The time taken to achieve adequate sperm production for natural conception will vary from person to person. If the pre-treatment testes are very small and there has been a history of undescended testes it might take longer to achieve sperm production. In these cases, [[assisted reproductive technology]], such as sperm retrieval using [[testicular sperm extraction]] (TESE) and/or [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI), might be required.<ref name=\"pmid:29330225\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Maione L, Dwyer AA, Francou B, Guiochon-Mantel A, Binart N, Bouligand J, Young J | title = GENETICS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY: Genetic counseling for congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and Kallmann syndrome: new challenges in the era of oligogenism and next-generation sequencing | journal = European Journal of Endocrinology | volume = 178 | issue = 3 | pages = R55\u2013R80 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29330225 | doi = 10.1530/EJE-17-0749 }}</ref>\n\nIn females with KS/CHH, infertility is primarily due to the lack of [[Cellular differentiation|maturation]] of eggs located within the [[ovaries]].
