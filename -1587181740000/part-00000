The [[Gothic Revival]] structure was designed to serve LaGrange College when this Methodist institution relocated from Franklin to Lauderdale county and subsequently was renamed and rechartered as Florence Wesleyan University.<ref name=\"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions\">[http://www2.una.edu/universityrelations/attractions.htm \"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions,\" Office of University Relations, University of North Alabama]</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the year the structure was completed, a President's Report showed an enrollment of 180 students. The fledgling university peaked at 225 students in the early 1860s, shortly before the outbreak of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"The 175-Year March from the 19th Century into the 21st\">Steen, Robert S., \"The 175-Year March from the 19th into the 21st,\" UNA Magazine, Summer, 2005</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Wesleyan Hall was occupied by both Union and Confederate armies.<ref name=\"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions\"/> \n[[Image:William Tecumseh Sherman.jpg|right|thumb|220px|General William Tecumseh Sherman is considered the most famous Union officer to occupy Wesleyan Hall during the Civil War.]]General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] is considered the most famous Union occupant of Wesleyan Hall during the war.<ref name=\"Leo's Tale: University of North Alabama Trivia\">Smith, William E., \"Leo's Tale: University of North Alabama Trivia, Florence, AL, Shoals Heritage Publishers, 2000.</ref> In late 1864, shortly before his ill-fated involvement in the battles of [[Battle of Franklin|Franklin]] and [[Battle of Nashville|Nashville]], Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]] occupied the building.  The surrounding grounds were occupied by his troops and served as a meeting place for military personnel and townspeople for parties, dances and concerts.  Confederate Generals [[Pierre G.T. Beauregard]] and [[Stephen D. Lee]] also occupied the adjoining grounds during the war and also may have used Wesleyan Hall as their headquarters.\n\nFollowing the war, Dr. Septimus Rice was the University's sole instructor, teaching classes in the Preparatory School and holding college-level courses in Wesleyan Hall.  Despite a prolonged effort by the new Wesleyan University president, Dr. William H. Anderson, the institution continued to founder, and in 1871, the doors of Wesleyan Hall were closed.\n\nRecognizing the need for trained teachers in the post-war South, the Methodist Episcopal Church turned over Wesleyan Hall and the surrounding {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}} grounds to the state of [[Alabama]], which then chartered it as a state [[normal school]].\n\nDuring this period, the halls of Wesleyan remained unheated, so stoves were used to warm classrooms, while coal oil lamps were employed for lighting. Because of the initially small enrollment, the upper floors were used as [[dormitory|dormitories]].\n\nA dilapidated white-washed board fence stood along the perimeter of the Wesleyan grounds to prevent livestock owned by nearby townspeople from wandering onto campus. On the south side of the structure in a similar state of disrepair stood a number of old stables used to quarter horses of local country boys attending the school. A large [[cistern]] in the rear of the Wesleyan supplied the school's water supply.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the 45-year-old structure remained the only building owned by the school. The exterior of the building had changed little since its construction in 1856, bearing the same castle-like towers, battlements and top-floor [[observatory]]. Likewise, the campus adjoining Wesleyan encompassed only the original {{convert|12|acre|m2}}.\n\nA three-story building finally was added in 1909 to accommodate increased enrollment and became known as Wesleyan Annex.<ref name=\"The 175-Year March from the 19th Century into the 21st\"/>\n\n==Today==\n\nNow part of the {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=on}} University of North Alabama campus, Wesleyan Hall currently contains the departments of Geography, Psychology, and Foreign Languages.  It also houses the Geographic Research Center, a cartography lab, and a language lab.\n\nThe Department of Military Science is located in Wesleyan Annex.\n\nWesleyan also houses personal effects and mementoes of former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice and U.S. Senator [[Howell Heflin]], a native of nearby Tuscumbia.

The [[Gothic Revival]] structure was designed to serve LaGrange College when this Methodist institution relocated from Franklin to Lauderdale county and subsequently was renamed and rechartered as Florence Wesleyan University.<ref name=\"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions\">[http://www2.una.edu/universityrelations/attractions.htm \"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions,\" Office of University Relations, University of North Alabama]</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the year the structure was completed, a President's Report showed an enrollment of 180 students. The fledgling university peaked at 225 students in the early 1860s, shortly before the outbreak of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"The 175-Year March from the 19th Century into the 21st\">Steen, Robert S., \"The 175-Year March from the 19th into the 21st,\" UNA Magazine, Summer, 2005</ref>\n\nDuring the war, Wesleyan Hall was occupied by both Union and Confederate armies.<ref name=\"UNA Public and Tourist Attractions\"/> \n[[Image:William Tecumseh Sherman.jpg|right|thumb|220px|General William Tecumseh Sherman is considered the most famous Union officer to occupy Wesleyan Hall during the Civil War.]]General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] is considered the most famous Union occupant of Wesleyan Hall during the war.<ref name=\"Leo's Tale: University of North Alabama Trivia\">Smith, William E., \"Leo's Tale: University of North Alabama Trivia, Florence, AL, Shoals Heritage Publishers, 2000.</ref> In late 1864, shortly before his ill-fated involvement in the battles of [[Battle of Franklin|Franklin]] and [[Battle of Nashville|Nashville]], Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]] occupied the building.  The surrounding grounds were occupied by his troops and served as a meeting place for military personnel and townspeople for parties, dances and concerts.  Confederate Generals [[Pierre G.T. Beauregard]] and [[Stephen D. Lee]] also occupied the adjoining grounds during the war and also may have used Wesleyan Hall as their headquarters.\n\nFollowing the war, Dr. Septimus Rice was the University's sole instructor, teaching classes in the Preparatory School and holding college-level courses in Wesleyan Hall.  Despite a prolonged effort by the new Wesleyan University president, Dr. William H. Anderson, the institution continued to founder, and in 1871, the doors of Wesleyan Hall were closed.\n\nRecognizing the need for trained teachers in the post-war South, the Methodist Episcopal Church turned over Wesleyan Hall and the surrounding {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}} grounds to the state of [[Alabama]], which then chartered it as a state [[normal school]].\n\nDuring this period, the halls of Wesleyan remained unheated, so stoves were used to warm classrooms, while coal oil lamps were employed for lighting. Because of the initially small enrollment, the upper floors were used as [[dormitory|dormitories]].\n\nA dilapidated white-washed board fence stood along the perimeter of the Wesleyan grounds to prevent livestock owned by nearby townspeople from wandering onto campus. On the south side of the structure in a similar state of disrepair stood a number of old stables used to quarter horses of local country boys attending the school. A large [[cistern]] in the rear of the Wesleyan supplied the school's water supply.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the 45-year-old structure remained the only building owned by the school. The exterior of the building had changed little since its construction in 1856, bearing the same castle-like towers, battlements and top-floor [[observatory]]. Likewise, the campus adjoining Wesleyan encompassed only the original {{convert|12|acre|m2}}.\n\nA three-story building finally was added in 1909 to accommodate increased enrollment and became known as Wesleyan Annex.<ref name=\"The 175-Year March from the 19th Century into the 21st\"/>\n\n==Today==\n\nNow part of the {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=on}} University of North Alabama campus, Wesleyan Hall currently contains the departments of Geography, Psychology, and Foreign Languages.  It also houses the Geographic Research Center, a cartography lab, and a language lab.\n\nThe Department of Military Science is located in Wesleyan Annex.\n\nWesleyan also houses personal effects and mementoes of former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice and U.S. Senator [[Howell Heflin]], a native of nearby Tuscumbia.
