Modern ventilators are [[computer]]ized [[microprocessor control| microprocessor-control]]led machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated [[bag valve mask]].  Ventilators are chiefly used in [[intensive-care medicine]], [[home care]], and [[emergency medicine]] (as standalone units) and in [[anesthesiology]] (as a component of an [[anesthesia machine]]).\n\nVentilators are sometimes called \"respirators\", a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the [[Forrest Bird#Mechanical ventilators| \"Bird respirator\"]]). However, contemporary hospital and medical terminology uses the word \"[[respirator]]\" to refer to a protective face-mask.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author= Center for Devices and Radiological Health |date= 2019-02-08 |title= Personal Protective Equipment for Infection Control - Masks and N95 Respirators\n |journal= FDA \n |url= https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm\n |access-date= 2017-03-08\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Function==\nIn its simplest form, a modern [[positive pressure ventilation|positive pressure ventilator]] consists of a compressible [[air]] reservoir or turbine, air and [[oxygen]] supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \"patient circuit\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the [[lung]]s' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a [[one-way valve]] within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.\n\nVentilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled [[turbopump]].\n\nModern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small [[embedded system]] to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, [[respiratory therapists]] are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance.  In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by [[Critical care nursing | critical care]] nurses.\n\nThe patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as [[Continuous_positive_airway_pressure|continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)]] and [[non-invasive ventilation]], which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require [[intubation]], which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a [[tracheotomy]] cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.\n\n===Life-critical system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nBecause failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as [[life-critical system]]s, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their [[power-supply|power supply]]. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no [[single point of failure]] can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an [[anaesthetic machine]]). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Carolyn Y. |last2=reporterEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow |first2=closeCarolyn Y.

Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.<ref name=\"pmid18189086\" />\n\nIn 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at [[Harvard University]]. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of [[muscle relaxant]]s during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles.\n[[File:East-Radcliffe Respirator Wellcome L0001305.jpg|alt=A machine with hoses and gauges on a wheeled cart|thumb|An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle [[hub gear]] to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive [[windscreen wiper]] motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs.<ref name=\"pmid13320798\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell WR, Schuster E, Smith AC, Spalding JM |date=April 1956 |title=Radcliffe respiration pumps |journal=[[The Lancet]] |pmid=13320798 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)90597-9 |volume=270 |issue=6922 |pages=539\u201341}}</ref> Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In 1952, Roger Manley of the [[Westminster Hospital]], London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.\n\nThe 1955 release of [[Forrest Bird]]'s \"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment.<ref name=AboutBird>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=Forrest Bird invented a fluid control device, respirator & pediatric ventilator |publisher=About.com |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/Forrest_Bird.htm |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \"Bird\". It was a [[Pneumatics|pneumatic]] device and therefore required no [[electrical power]] source to operate.\n\nIn 1965, the Army Emergency Respirator was developed in collaboration with the Harry Diamond Laboratories (now part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]]) and [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]]. Its design incorporated the principle of fluid amplification in order to govern pneumatic functions. Fluid amplification allowed the respirator to be manufactured entirely without moving parts, yet capable of complex resuscitative functions.<ref>{{cite book |date=1965 |title=Army R, D & A. |publisher=Development and Engineering Directorate, HQ, U.S. Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command |url=https://books.google.com/?id=sTrO77DCgkwC&pg=RA6-PA33&lpg=RA6-PA33&dq=Army+Emergency+Respirator,+HDL#v=onepage&q=Army%20Emergency%20Respirator,%20HDL&f=false}}</ref> Elimination of moving parts increased performance reliability and minimized maintenance.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |last1=Mon |first1=George |last2=Woodward |first2=Kenneth E. |last3=Straub |first3=Henrik |last4=Joyce |first4=James |last5=Meyer |first5=James |date=1966 |title=Fluid Amplifier-Controlled Medical Devices |journal=SAE Transactions |issn=0096-736X |jstor=44554326 |volume=74 |pages=217\u2013222}}</ref> The mask is composed of a [[poly(methyl methacrylate)]] (commercially known as [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|Lucite]]) block, about the size of a pack of cards, with machined channels and a cemented or screwed-in cover plate.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |title=Army Research and Development Monthly Magazine |volume=6 |number=9 |url=https://asc.army.mil/docs/pubs/alt/archives/1965/Sep_1965.PDF}}</ref> The reduction of moving parts cut manufacturing costs and increased durability.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe bistable fluid amplifier design allowed the respirator to function as both a respiratory assistor and controller.

It was a small, silent and effective electronic ventilator, with the famous SERVO feedback system controlling what had been set and regulating delivery. For the first time, the machine could deliver the set volume in volume control ventilation.\n\nVentilators used under increased pressure (hyperbaric) require special precautions, and few ventilators can operate under these conditions.<ref name=SPUMS1998>{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=M |year=1998 |title=Ventilator function under hyperbaric conditions |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=28 |issue=2 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/5927 |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> In 1979, Sechrist Industries introduced their Model 500A ventilator, which was specifically designed for use with [[hyperbaric chamber]]s.<ref name=JHM1988>{{cite journal |vauthors=Weaver LK, Greenway L, Elliot CG |year=1988 |title=Performance of the Seachrist 500A Hyperbaric Ventilator in a Monoplace Hyperbaric Chamber |journal=Journal of Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=215\u2013225 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4377 |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref>\n\n===Microprocessor ventilators===\n[[Microprocessor control]] led to the third generation of [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) ventilators, starting with the [[Dr\u00e4gerwerk|Dr\u00e4ger]] EV-A<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00e4ger - die Geschichte des Unternehmens |language= |publisher=Dr\u00e4ger |website=Dr\u00e4ger |url=https://www.draeger.com/Corporate/Content/draeger_die_geschichte_des_unternehmens.pdf |access-date=March 22, 2020}}</ref> in 1982 in Germany which allowed monitoring the patient's [[Breathing#Respiratory_disorders|breathing curve]] on an [[LCD monitor]].

Modern ventilators are [[computer]]ized [[microprocessor control| microprocessor-control]]led machines, but patients can also be ventilated with a simple, hand-operated [[bag valve mask]].  Ventilators are chiefly used in [[intensive-care medicine]], [[home care]], and [[emergency medicine]] (as standalone units) and in [[anesthesiology]] (as a component of an [[anesthesia machine]]).\n\nVentilators are sometimes called \"respirators\", a term commonly used for them in the 1950s (particularly the [[Forrest Bird#Mechanical ventilators| \"Bird respirator\"]]). However, contemporary hospital and medical terminology uses the word \"[[respirator]]\" to refer to a protective face-mask.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author= Center for Devices and Radiological Health |date= 2019-02-08 |title= Personal Protective Equipment for Infection Control - Masks and N95 Respirators\n |journal= FDA \n |url= https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/PersonalProtectiveEquipment/ucm055977.htm\n |access-date= 2017-03-08\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Function==\nIn its simplest form, a modern [[positive pressure ventilation|positive pressure ventilator]] consists of a compressible [[air]] reservoir or turbine, air and [[oxygen]] supplies, a set of valves and tubes, and a disposable or reusable \"patient circuit\". The air reservoir is pneumatically compressed several times a minute to deliver room-air, or in most cases, an air/oxygen mixture to the patient. If a turbine is used, the turbine pushes air through the ventilator, with a flow valve adjusting pressure to meet patient-specific parameters. When over pressure is released, the patient will exhale passively due to the [[lung]]s' elasticity, the exhaled air being released usually through a [[one-way valve]] within the patient circuit called the patient manifold.\n\nVentilators may also be equipped with monitoring and alarm systems for patient-related parameters (e.g. pressure, volume, and flow) and ventilator function (e.g. air leakage, power failure, mechanical failure), backup batteries, oxygen tanks, and remote control. The pneumatic system is nowadays often replaced by a computer-controlled [[turbopump]].\n\nModern ventilators are electronically controlled by a small [[embedded system]] to allow exact adaptation of pressure and flow characteristics to an individual patient's needs. Fine-tuned ventilator settings also serve to make ventilation more tolerable and comfortable for the patient. In Canada and the United States, [[respiratory therapists]] are responsible for tuning these settings, while biomedical technologists are responsible for the maintenance.  In the United Kingdom and Europe the management of the patient's interaction with the ventilator is done by [[Critical care nursing | critical care]] nurses.\n\nThe patient circuit usually consists of a set of three durable, yet lightweight plastic tubes, separated by function (e.g. inhaled air, patient pressure, exhaled air). Determined by the type of ventilation needed, the patient-end of the circuit may be either noninvasive or invasive.\n\nNoninvasive methods, such as [[Continuous_positive_airway_pressure|continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)]] and [[non-invasive ventilation]], which are adequate for patients who require a ventilator only while sleeping and resting, mainly employ a nasal mask. Invasive methods require [[intubation]], which for long-term ventilator dependence will normally be a [[tracheotomy]] cannula, as this is much more comfortable and practical for long-term care than is larynx or nasal intubation.\n\n===Life-critical system===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nBecause failure may result in death, mechanical ventilation systems are classified as [[life-critical system]]s, and precautions must be taken to ensure that they are highly reliable, including their [[power-supply|power supply]]. Mechanical ventilators are therefore carefully designed so that no [[single point of failure]] can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an [[anaesthetic machine]]). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an anti-suffocation valve for spontaneous breathing of the patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Carolyn Y. |last2=reporterEmailEmailBioBioFollowFollow |first2=closeCarolyn Y.

Other forms of noninvasive ventilators, also used widely for polio patients, include [[Biphasic Cuirass Ventilation]], the rocking bed, and rather primitive positive pressure machines.<ref name=\"pmid18189086\" />\n\nIn 1949, John Haven Emerson developed a mechanical assister for anaesthesia with the cooperation of the anaesthesia department at [[Harvard University]]. Mechanical ventilators began to be used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care during the 1950s. Their development was stimulated both by the need to treat polio patients and the increasing use of [[muscle relaxant]]s during anaesthesia. Relaxant drugs paralyse the patient and improve operating conditions for the surgeon but also paralyse the respiratory muscles.\n[[File:East-Radcliffe Respirator Wellcome L0001305.jpg|alt=A machine with hoses and gauges on a wheeled cart|thumb|An East-Radcliffe respirator model from the mid-twentieth century]]\nIn the United Kingdom, the East Radcliffe and Beaver models were early examples. The former used a [[Sturmey-Archer]] bicycle [[hub gear]] to provide a range of speeds, and the latter an automotive [[windscreen wiper]] motor to drive the bellows used to inflate the lungs.<ref name=\"pmid13320798\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Russell WR, Schuster E, Smith AC, Spalding JM |date=April 1956 |title=Radcliffe respiration pumps |journal=[[The Lancet]] |pmid=13320798 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(56)90597-9 |volume=270 |issue=6922 |pages=539\u201341}}</ref> Electric motors were, however, a problem in the operating theatres of that time, as their use caused an explosion hazard in the presence of flammable anaesthetics such as [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[cyclopropane]]. In 1952, Roger Manley of the [[Westminster Hospital]], London, developed a ventilator which was entirely gas-driven and became the most popular model used in Europe. It was an elegant design, and became a great favourite with European anaesthetists for four decades, prior to the introduction of models controlled by electronics. It was independent of electrical power and caused no explosion hazard. The original Mark I unit was developed to become the Manley Mark II in collaboration with the Blease company, which manufactured many thousands of these units. Its principle of operation was very simple, an incoming gas flow was used to lift a weighted bellows unit, which fell intermittently under gravity, forcing breathing gases into the patient's lungs. The inflation pressure could be varied by sliding the movable weight on top of the bellows. The volume of gas delivered was adjustable using a curved slider, which restricted bellows excursion. Residual pressure after the completion of expiration was also configurable, using a small weighted arm visible to the lower right of the front panel. This was a robust unit and its availability encouraged the introduction of positive pressure ventilation techniques into mainstream European anesthetic practice.\n\nThe 1955 release of [[Forrest Bird]]'s \"Bird Universal Medical Respirator\" in the United States changed the way mechanical ventilation was performed, with the small green box becoming a familiar piece of medical equipment.<ref name=AboutBird>{{cite web |last=Bellis |first=Mary |title=Forrest Bird invented a fluid control device, respirator & pediatric ventilator |publisher=About.com |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventors/a/Forrest_Bird.htm |access-date=2009-06-04}}</ref> The unit was sold as the Bird Mark 7 Respirator and informally called the \"Bird\".

The ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' anime was written and directed by [[Hideaki Anno]], originally airing from October 1995 until March 1996. The general consensus is that the anime was groundbreaking; it explored religious, psychological, and philosophical themes, while initially appearing to be a standard [[mecha]] show. There was some debate over the controversial ending of the television series. In response, two films were made to provide an alternate ending for the show: ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth]]'', released in March 1997, and ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' released in July 1997. ''Death'' is a compilation of clips from the TV series, with some new footage added, and ''Rebirth'' comprises the first 30 minutes or so of ''End of Evangelion''.\n\nThe popularity of the show spawned numerous additional media, including video games, radio dramas, audio books, a novel, [[pachinko]] machines, and a [[tetralogy]] of films titled ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]''. Other derivative works include ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]'', ''[[Petit Eva: Evangelion@School]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse|Campus Apocalypse]]''.

Fifteen years after the Second Impact, a group of mysterious beings referred to as \"[[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angels]]\" begin appearing and pose a worldwide and existential threat to mankind. The NERV organization, a paramilitary special agency, is tasked with defeating the Angels, with the use of giant mechanical warriors known as \"[[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelions]]\" to fight them. A select group of children pilot the Evangelions, with a focus on [[Shinji Ikari]], [[Rei Ayanami]] and [[Asuka Langley Soryu]].\n\nThe backdrop of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' slowly reveals the true nature of Rei Ayanami, the Evangelions, the Angels, the NERV organization and a group known as the SEELE organization. Religious themes, include [[Christianity]] and [[Kabbalah]] references to [[Adam]], [[Lilith]] and the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The series is well known for its [[psychoanalysis]] of the characters, most heavily covered in the implementation of the Human Instrumentality Project, the secret goal of NERV and SEELE, whose result varies across different media, including the original anime, films, manga and video games.\n\n== Anime ==\n{{main|Neon Genesis Evangelion}}\n{{Nihongo|''Neon Genesis Evangelion''|\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Shin Seiki Evangerion|literally \"Gospel of a New Century\"}}, commonly referred to as ''Evangelion'' or ''Eva'', is a Japanese [[Science fantasy|science-fantasy]] [[animation]] [[Television program|series]] that first [[Broadcasting|aired]] from October 1995 to March 1996.

The ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (anime)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' anime was written and directed by [[Hideaki Anno]] and originally aired from October 1995 to March 1996. The show was groundbreaking, delving into religious, psychological and philosophical themes on an otherwise standard [[mecha]] backdrop. There was some debate over the controversial ending of the television series. In response, two films were made to provide an alternate ending for the show: ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth]]'', released in March 1997, and ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' released in July 1997. ''Death'' is a compilation of clips from the TV series, with some new footage added, and ''Rebirth'' comprises the first 30 minutes or so of ''End of Evangelion''.\n\nThe popularity of the show spawned numerous additional media, including video games, radio dramas, audio books, a novel, [[pachinko]] machines, and a [[tetralogy]] of films titled ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]''. Other derivative works include ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]'', ''[[Petit Eva: Evangelion@School]]'' and ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Campus Apocalypse|Campus Apocalypse]]''. As of June 2018, it is the 27th [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing franchise]] of all-time, with an estimated revenue of {{US$|14.9 billion|long=no}}.<ref>{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Megan |title='Pokemon' Is The Highest-Grossing Franchise Of All-Time |url=https://comicbook.com/anime/2018/06/24/pokemon-franchise-revenue-anime-media/ |accessdate=August 13, 2018 |work=ComicBook.com |date=June 23, 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Setting ==\nWorks within the ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' franchise typically have the same setting, characters and theme, but can vary in their portrayal of the storyline with alternate re-tellings of the original anime. ''Evangelion''{{'}}s fictional setting takes place after the Second Impact, a cataclysmic explosion in [[Antarctica]] which resulted in the deaths of billions and threw the Earth off its axis. Fifteen years after the Second Impact, a group of mysterious beings referred to as \"[[Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion)|Angels]]\" begin appearing and pose a worldwide and existential threat to mankind. The NERV organization, a paramilitary special agency, is tasked with defeating the Angels, with the use of giant mechanical warriors known as \"[[Evangelion (mecha)|Evangelions]]\" to fight them. A select group of children pilot the Evangelions, with a focus on [[Shinji Ikari]], [[Rei Ayanami]] and [[Asuka Langley Soryu]].\n\nThe backdrop of ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' slowly reveals the true nature of Rei Ayanami, the Evangelions, the Angels, the NERV organization and a group known as the SEELE organization. Religious themes, include [[Christianity]] and [[Kabbalah]] references to [[Adam]], [[Lilith]] and the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The series is well known for its [[psychoanalysis]] of the characters, most heavily covered in the implementation of the Human Instrumentality Project, the secret goal of NERV and SEELE, whose result varies across different media, including the original anime, films, manga and video games.\n\n== Anime ==\n{{main|Neon Genesis Evangelion}}\n{{Nihongo|''Neon Genesis Evangelion''|\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Shin Seiki Evangerion|literally \"Gospel of a New Century\"}}, commonly referred to as ''Evangelion'' or ''Eva'', is a Japanese [[Science fantasy|science-fantasy]] [[animation]] [[Television program|series]] that first [[Broadcasting|aired]] from October 1995 to March 1996.

Treated as a tool by his father, Shinji joins Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley Soryu as mankind's last hope against the mysterious beings known as the \"Angels\".

Exhibits were first situated in UNM's Rodey Hall, which was demolished in 1971. The museum moved to Scholes Hall in 1935, then to the current site in 1961. In 1972 a major construction project expanded museum facilities, which was funded by the philanthropists Dorothy and Gilbert Maxwell.<ref name=\"maxwellhistory\" /> The museum was renamed in their honor and since then, it has been recognized as an important regional museum and a nationally known research center.\n\n==Exhibits==\n\nThe museum has five exhibit areas that host permanent and changing exhibits which express the human cultural experience. The '''Ancestors''' permanent exhibit traces [[human evolution]] over four million years and features life-size models of human ancestors. The '''People of the Southwest''' permanent exhibit depicts eleven thousand years of the cultural heritage of the American Southwest and features artifacts from [[Mogollon culture#Mimbres culture|Mimbres]], [[Ancestral Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloan]], and [[Puebloan]] cultures, as well as displays on UNM field work in New Mexico, which includes a reconstruction of an excavation at [[Chaco Canyon]]. The museum's '''North Gallery''', '''Bawden Gallery''' (named after Garth Bawden, museum director 1985-2005), and the '''Ortiz Center Gathering Space''' (named for the late [[Alfonso Ortiz]], a noted UNM anthropology professor) host changing exhibits featuring artifacts from the extensive museum collection as well as traveling exhibits.

The museum was created to house and display the growing collection of artifacts gathered from field schools of archaeological research associated with the UNM Anthropology Department, the School of American Research, and the [[Museum of New Mexico]].<ref name=\"maxwellhistory\">{{cite news | publisher=Albuquerque Tribune | title=The Maxwell Museum of Anthropology celebrates 75 years | url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/28/maxwell-museum-anthropology-celebrates-75-years/ | accessdate=2008-09-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413121403/http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/28/maxwell-museum-anthropology-celebrates-75-years/ | archive-date=2008-04-13 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Frank C. Hibben]] was the first director of the museum and expanded its holdings by collecting archaeological materials from around the world and in trade with other museums. Exhibits were first situated in UNM's Rodey Hall, which was demolished in 1971. The museum moved to Scholes Hall in 1935, then to the current site in 1961. In 1972 a major construction project expanded museum facilities, which was funded by the philanthropists Dorothy and Gilbert Maxwell.<ref name=\"maxwellhistory\" /> The museum was renamed in their honor and since then, it has been recognized as an important regional museum and a nationally known research center.\n\n==Exhibits==\n\nThe museum has five exhibit areas that host permanent and changing exhibits which express the human cultural experience. The '''Ancestors''' permanent exhibit traces [[human evolution]] over four million years and features life-size models of human ancestors. The '''People of the Southwest''' permanent exhibit depicts eleven thousand years of the cultural heritage of the American Southwest and features artifacts from [[Mogollon_culture#Mimbres_culture|Mimbres]], [[Ancestral Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloan]], and [[Puebloan]] cultures, as well as displays on UNM field work in New Mexico, which includes a reconstruction of an excavation at [[Chaco Canyon]]. The museum's '''North Gallery''', '''Bawden Gallery''' (named after Garth Bawden, museum director 1985-2005), and the '''Ortiz Center Gathering Space''' (named for the late [[Alfonso Ortiz]], a noted UNM anthropology professor) host changing exhibits featuring artifacts from the extensive museum collection as well as traveling exhibits. The museum's courtyard features a {{convert|46|ft|m|sing=on}}-high [[totem pole]] brought to the museum from [[British Columbia]] in 1941.<ref name=\"maxwellhistory\" />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:TheMaxwells.jpg|Dorothy and Gilbert Maxwell c.1970\nImage:Maxwell Museum of Anthropology totempole.jpg|The Museum's totem pole\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.unm.edu/~maxwell/ Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]\n* [http://ortizctr.unm.edu/index.html The Alfonso Ortiz Center for Intercultural Studies]\n\n{{University of New Mexico}}\n\n[[Category:Museums established in 1932]]\n[[Category:University of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Museums in Albuquerque, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Native American museums in New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Native Americans in Albuquerque, New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Anthropology museums in the United States]]\n[[Category:University museums in New Mexico]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Museum_of_Anthropology"}

Holmes Museum of Anthropology''' began in 1966 as the '''Museum of Man''', at the bequest and initiation of Dr. Lowell Holmes, Professor of Anthropology at [[Wichita State University]] in [[Wichita, KS|Wichita]], [[Kansas]], United States.  Over the next 33 years it grew slowly and became known throughout the campus as a small but interesting museum. The collections and exhibitions include cultural items from around the world and archaeological objects predominantly from the American Midwest and Southwest.  In 1999, the [[anthropology]] department and the museum moved to a new location in Neff Hall.  The museum was expanded and Mr. Jerry Martin was hired as Director.  This was the first time that the museum had a professional director whose only job was to work with, and develop the museum.\n\nMartin's concept was to have the museum essentially run and operated by students as part of their museum studies training.  He raised funds to hire student staff to run the day-to-day operations of the museum under his supervision. As of the fall semester of 2006, the museum has the funds to hire five student positions. The museum has a wide range of functions.  It has exhibitions open to the public, houses a rapidly expanding collection, a support unit for the anthropology department and faculty of [[Wichita State University]], a research facility for students, a repository for United States Government archaeological collections, and the basis for a growing [[museum studies]] program. These different functions provide a very wide range of experience for the student staff.\n\n==Important collections housed at the Holmes Museum==\n\n===Asmat art collection===\n[[Image:fumerimage.jpg|thumb|right]]In 2001 the museum led an expedition into Western [[New Guinea]], where they compiled a major collection of over 950 pieces of [[Asmat people|Asmat]] tribal art.  In the fall of 2001, the museum received the [[Bakwin collection]] of nearly 120 pieces of Asmat art. Asmat art is famous for its large size, beauty, artistic quality and rarity. This collection is rapidly becoming well known. The only other comparable collections in the United States are the [[Michael Rockefeller]] Collection at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and the collection of the [[Asmat Museum of Art]] in St. Paul, MN.\n\n===Southwest pottery and ethnographic art collections===\nThe museum houses the John Morgan collection of Southwest pottery, and the Emma and John Huff collection of Southwest Jewelry. The Holmes museum also has an extensive collection of  pre-historic pottery of the American southwest.\n\n===Pre-Columbian pottery collection===\n[[Image:HolmesMuseum1.jpg|thumb|right]]The David Jackman collection consists of a large number of prehistoric Casas Grande and [[Colima]] ceramics.  In addition, there is the Aitchison collection which contains a wide range of ceramics from prehistoric Pueblo cultures as well as [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Veracruz]] and other [[Mesoamerican]] cultures.\n\n===Chinese minority clothing and ethnographic art collection===\nIn 1988 and 1989 some museum staff and volunteers traveled to China to collect clothing and ethnographical objects from the minority Chinese groups.  These trips produced an extensive collection from ethnic groups in Inner [[Mongolia]], Northwestern and Southern China, and [[Tibet]].\n\n===Archaeology collections===\nThe Anthropology Department has four different archaeology laboratories to process and research the extensive archaeology collections housed in the department and the Holmes Museum.  The collections are predominantly from [[Kansas]] and contiguous state and the Four Corners area of the American Southwest.\nThe museum is a repository for Federal Government Archaeological collections and an official Long Term Curation Facility for the Bureau of Reclamations. These collections are used by students for educational and research purposes.\n\n===Media resources collection===\nThe museum recently began a program of digitizing anthropological audio-visual material for archival purposes.  Most of the old audio tapes, 8mm and 16mm films and video tapes were created by anthropologists in the field or by missionaries. The museum's objective is to create a digitized collection of this material and make them available for research and other educational purposes.\n\n===Current exhibitions===\n[[Image:SWHolmesEX1.jpg|thumb|right]]Recently a new exhibition opened which shows the current theories on [[human evolution]] and physical diversity. One segment of the exhibit depicts [[Charles Darwin]]\u2019s round the world voyage on {{HMS|Beagle}} where he developed his theory of [[Natural Selection]]. Another segment shows the separate development of [[Apes]] and [[Man]] throughout the last 34 million years.\n\nThe second recently completed exhibition is called \u201cSouthwestern Art: A Story of Transition and Change.\u201d Located in the museum's Jackman Gallery this exhibit features the Morgan Collection of Southwest Pueblo pottery and the Mullen collection of Southwest Jewelry.  It tells the story of the importance of the railroad and tourism in the revival of Southwestern Art and how the art has become a major source of income for many Pueblo families.   The exhibit includes over 80 examples of beautiful pottery from 14 different pueblos, and jewelry and textiles from both the [[Hopi]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]].\n\n===Virtual exhibitions and websites===\n[[Image:Holmesevol2.jpg|thumb|right]]\nCurrently the museum has a website titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20061206125706/http://www.holmes.anthropology.museum/southwestpottery/index.html \u201cThrough the Eyes of the Pot: The Morgan collection of Southwest Pottery\u201d]. This site shows the pots in the Morgan collection, gives a biography of the potters and has chapters on individual pueblos.\n\nThere is also a virtual exhibit which includes home movie footage, artifacts and recollections from missionaries to the Highlands of [[Papua New Guinea]].  This interactive exhibit is called  [http://www.holmes.anthropology.museum/shawnee/main.html \"The Wagner Collection Field Journal:  1955-1969\"].  It blends oral history and multimedia to describe the observations of missionaries among the Duna, [[Hewa]] and [[Enga people|Enga]] of Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe museum has also developed a large and important website on the [[Asmat people|Asmat]] people of Papua, Indonesia titled [https://web.archive.org/web/20100625220034/http://holmes.anthropology.museum/asmat/index.html \"Art and Culture of the Asmat\"]. Using the objects in the collection, photographs, as well as audio and video clips, the site explores the art, ceremonial life and culture of the Asmat people.  Original documentary short films available on the website are also available on YouTube.\n\n==Research==\nThe Holmes Museum sponsors a wide range of research and academic programs.  There are a number of students in the museum studies program and several on-going and potential student research projects. For example: a number of students have requested to base their master's degree Projects on the Asmat collection.\n\nDuring the summer of 2003, students, led by the museum director Jerry Martin, traveled to the [[Guatemala]]n highlands to collect [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] weavings and fiesta dance masks and study their symbolism and impact on the local indigenous populations. The objects they collect will become part of the museum's expanding contemporary Mayan ethnographic collection.\n\nDuring the summer of 2007, the museum director and an anthropology graduate student returned to the Asmat region of [[New Guinea]] to produce videos to be used in an Asmat website.  This website integrates text, video and audio in order to create a multimedia educational resource for the public.  They also gathered footage in the [[Korowai people|Korowai]] cultural area.\n\n==Location and directions==\n[[Image:campus map edits.jpg|thumb|right]]The Holmes Museum is located in Neff Hall on the campus of Wichita State University.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://holmes.anthropology.museum/ Lowell.

Holmes Museum of Anthropology''' began in 1966 as the '''Museum of Man''', at the bequest and initiation of Dr. Lowell Holmes, Professor of Anthropology at [[Wichita State University]] in [[Wichita, KS|Wichita]], [[Kansas]], United States.  Over the next 33 years it grew slowly and became known throughout the campus as a small but interesting museum. The collections and exhibitions include cultural items from around the world and archaeological objects predominantly from the American Midwest and Southwest.  In 1999, the [[anthropology]] department and the museum moved to a new location in Neff Hall.  The museum was expanded and Mr. Jerry Martin was hired as Director.  This was the first time that the museum had a professional director whose only job was to work with, and develop the museum.\n\nMartin's concept was to have the museum essentially run and operated by students as part of their museum studies training.  He raised funds to hire student staff to run the day-to-day operations of the museum under his supervision. As of the fall semester of 2006, the museum has the funds to hire five student positions. The museum has a wide range of functions.  It has exhibitions open to the public, houses a rapidly expanding collection, a support unit for the anthropology department and faculty of [[Wichita State University]], a research facility for students, a repository for United States Government archaeological collections, and the basis for a growing [[museum studies]] program. These different functions provide a very wide range of experience for the student staff.\n\n==Important collections housed at the Holmes Museum==\n\n===Asmat art collection===\n[[Image:fumerimage.jpg|thumb|right]]In 2001 the museum led an expedition into Western [[New Guinea]], where they compiled a major collection of over 950 pieces of [[Asmat people|Asmat]] tribal art.  In the fall of 2001, the museum received the [[Bakwin collection]] of nearly 120 pieces of Asmat art. Asmat art is famous for its large size, beauty, artistic quality and rarity. This collection is rapidly becoming well known. The only other comparable collections in the United States are the [[Michael Rockefeller]] Collection at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and the collection of the [[Asmat Museum of Art]] in St. Paul, MN.\n\n===Southwest pottery and ethnographic art collections===\nThe museum houses the John Morgan collection of Southwest pottery, and the Emma and John Huff collection of Southwest Jewelry. The Holmes museum also has an extensive collection of  pre-historic pottery of the American southwest.\n\n===Pre-Columbian pottery collection===\n[[Image:HolmesMuseum1.jpg|thumb|right]]The David Jackman collection consists of a large number of prehistoric Casas Grande and [[Colima]] ceramics.  In addition, there is the Aitchison collection which contains a wide range of ceramics from prehistoric Pueblo cultures as well as [[Maya civilization|Mayan]], [[Veracruz]] and other [[Mesoamerican]] cultures.\n\n===Chinese minority clothing and ethnographic art collection===\nIn 1988 and 1989 some museum staff and volunteers traveled to China to collect clothing and ethnographical objects from the minority Chinese groups.  These trips produced an extensive collection from ethnic groups in Inner [[Mongolia]], Northwestern and Southern China, and [[Tibet]].\n\n===Archaeology collections===\nThe Anthropology Department has four different archaeology laboratories to process and research the extensive archaeology collections housed in the department and the Holmes Museum.  The collections are predominantly from [[Kansas]] and contiguous state and the Four Corners area of the American Southwest.\nThe museum is a repository for Federal Government Archaeological collections and an official Long Term Curation Facility for the Bureau of Reclamations. These collections are used by students for educational and research purposes.\n\n===Media resources collection===\nThe museum recently began a program of digitizing anthropological audio-visual material for archival purposes.  Most of the old audio tapes, 8mm and 16mm films and video tapes were created by anthropologists in the field or by missionaries. The museum's objective is to create a digitized collection of this material and make them available for research and other educational purposes.\n\n===Current exhibitions===\n[[Image:SWHolmesEX1.jpg|thumb|right]]Recently a new exhibition opened which shows the current theories on [[human evolution]] and physical diversity. One segment of the exhibit depicts [[Charles Darwin]]\u2019s round the world voyage on {{HMS|Beagle}} where he developed his theory of [[Natural Selection]].

The player takes on the role of the head of a minor house, swearing allegiance to one of the Great Houses of [[Westeros]], building and managing a keep and army of Sworn Swords. Players complete quests and build their holdings as solo play, making choices that influence their alignment and affect future quests.\n\nThey can also engage in [[player versus player]] conflict, both one-on-one with individual players, or as part of an Alliance in larger-scale wars. These wars are scheduled in 5-week \"cycles\", beginning with a week of low-conflict preparation, followed by three weeks of Alliance-versus-Alliance combat competing for ranks across eight of the nine major geographical areas of Westeros, and concluded with a week-long cooperative event.\n\n==Setting==\nThe game closely followed the HBO television series, with weekly content updates following the airing of each episode. Quests allowed the player to participate in major events from the story in various ways, as well an original storyline exploring your character's past and current events at your holdings.\n\nThe player selected their primary location by swearing [[fealty]] to [[House Stark]], [[House Lannister]], [[House Greyjoy]], [[House Baratheon]], [[House Targaryen]], [[House Tyrell]], [[House Tully]], or [[House Martell]]. However, the character visits many notable locations through the course of the game, including several famous places in [[Essos]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.disruptorbeam.com/games/game-of-thrones}}\n\n{{ASOIAF}}\n\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Facebook games]]\n[[Category:Google Chrome games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Upcoming video games]]\n[[Category:Video games based on A Song of Ice and Fire]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n| title     = Game of Thrones Ascent\n| image     = Game of Thrones Ascent.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| developer = [[Disruptor Beam]]\n| publisher = Disruptor Beam\n| series    = ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''\n| platforms = [[Facebook Platform]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n| released  = {{Video game release|WW|February 2013 (Beta)<ref name=\"GoTArelease\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-05-21-game-of-thrones-ascent-facebook-game-revealed|title=Game of Thrones Ascent Facebook game revealed|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2012-05-21|accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref>}}\n| genre     = [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes     = \n}}\n'''''Game of Thrones Ascent''''' was a [[strategy video game]] developed by [[Disruptor Beam]] for [[iOS]],<ref name=\"GoTA_GS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/play-this-game-of-thrones-ipad-game-while-you-wait-for-the-show-to-come-back/1100-6418564/|title=Play this Game of Thrones iPad game while you wait for the show to come back|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=2014-03-26|accessdate=2014-11-13}}</ref> [[Facebook Platform|Facebook]], [[Kongregate]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/05/22/jon-radoff-takes-game-of-thrones-to-facebook-exclusive-interview/ |title=Jon Radoff takes Game Of Thrones to Facebook|publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2012-05-23 |first=Rob |last=LeFebvre}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/game-of-thrones-facebook-social-game-327283 |title='Game of Thrones' Fans Get First Facebook Social Game |date=2012-05-21 |accessdate=2011-05-23 |publisher=Hollywood Reporter| first=John|last=Gaudiosi}}</ref> and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Winter Is Coming|date=July 17, 2014|title=Game of Thrones Ascent Launches on iPhone and Android|url=http://winteriscoming.net/2014/07/17/game-thrones-ascent-launches-iphone-android/}}</ref> The game was a 2013 Facebook Game of the Year in the Staff Picks category<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/206588/Facebook_unveils_top_games_2013_list.php |title=Facebook Unveils top games 2013 list|date=2013-09-13 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |publisher=Gamasutra| first=Kris|last=Ligman}}</ref> and a winner of a 2013 Friendie Award.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2014/01/01/massivelys-third-annual-frindie-awards/ |title=Massively's Third Annual Frindie Awards |date=2014-01-01 |accessdate=2014-01-01 |publisher=Massively.com |first=Beau |last=Hindman |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102070435/http://massively.joystiq.com/2014/01/01/massivelys-third-annual-frindie-awards/ |archive-date=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The game is an adaptation of the novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' by [[George R.

The player takes on the role of the head of a minor house, swearing allegiance to one of the Great Houses of [[Westeros]], building and managing a keep and army of Sworn Swords. Players complete quests and build their holdings as solo play, making choices that influence their alignment and affect future quests.\n\nThey can also engage in [[player versus player]] conflict, both one-on-one with individual players, or as part of an Alliance in larger-scale wars. These wars are scheduled in 5-week \"cycles\", beginning with a week of low-conflict preparation, followed by three weeks of Alliance-versus-Alliance combat competing for ranks across eight of the nine major geographical areas of Westeros, and concluded with a week-long cooperative event.\n\n==Setting==\nThe game closely followed the HBO television series, with weekly content updates following the airing of each episode. Quests allowed the player to participate in major events from the story in various ways, as well an original storyline exploring your character's past and current events at your holdings.\n\nThe player selected their primary location by swearing [[fealty]] to [[House Stark]], [[House Lannister]], [[House Greyjoy]], [[House Baratheon]], [[House Targaryen]], [[House Tyrell]], [[House Tully]], or [[House Martell]]. However, the character visits many notable locations through the course of the game, including several famous places in [[Essos]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.disruptorbeam.com/games/game-of-thrones}}\n\n{{ASOIAF}}\n\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Facebook games]]\n[[Category:Google Chrome games]]\n[[Category:IOS games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Upcoming video games]]\n[[Category:Video games based on A Song of Ice and Fire]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Ascent"}

The museum was established in 1909 by the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, an organization whose goals were to provide a free institution for the people of Houston focusing on education and science. Museum attendance totals over two million visitors each year. The museum complex consists of a central facility with four floors of natural science halls and exhibits, the Burke Baker Planetarium, the Cockrell Butterfly Center, and the Wortham Giant Screen Theatre (formerly known as the Wortham IMAX Theatre). The museum is one of the most popular in the United States and ranks just below [[New York City]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] in most attendance amongst non-[[Smithsonian]] museums.<ref>Berger, Eric. (2006, November 20).

Houston Chronicle.</ref>  Much of the museum's popularity is attributed to its large number of special or guest exhibits.\n\n==History==\nThe initial museum organization was called the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, Inc., and was created in 1909. The museum's primary collection was acquired between 1914 and 1930. This included the purchase of a natural-history collection assembled by [[Henry Philemon Attwater]] and a donation from collector John Milsaps, the latter of which formed the core of the museum's gem and mineral collection.<ref name=\"Wilson\">Wilson, Wendell E., Bartsch, Joel A., Mauthner, Mark.

In 1988, the [[Challenger Center for Space Science Education|Challenger Learning Center]] was opened in memory of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] crewmembers that were lost during the shuttle's [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|tenth mission]]. The center's aim is to teach visitors about space exploration. The Wortham IMAX Theatre and the offsite George Observatory were opened in 1989.\n\nMuseum attendance was more than one million visitors in 1990. HMNS trustees determined that new state-of-the-art facilities, additional space, and renovations to current exhibits were needed because of the increased attendance. Between 1991 and 1994, a number of exhibit halls were renovated and the expansion of the Sterling Hall of Research was completed. The Cockrell Butterfly Center and the Brown Hall of Entomology opened in July 1994.\n\n[[File:HMNSSugarLandOldCentralUnit.jpg|thumb|left|The HMNS Sugar Land satellite museum in [[Telfair, Sugar Land|Telfair]], [[Sugar Land, Texas]].]]\nIn March 2007, the museum opened the HMNS [[The Woodlands, Texas|Woodlands]] X-ploration Station, located in the Woodlands Mall.

The museum was established in 1909 by the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, an organization whose goals were to provide a free institution for the people of Houston focusing on education and science. Museum attendance totals over two million visitors each year. The museum complex consists of a central facility with four floors of natural science halls and exhibits, the Burke Baker Planetarium, the Cockrell Butterfly Center, and the Wortham Giant Screen Theatre (formerly known as the Wortham IMAX Theatre). The museum is one of the most popular in the United States and ranks just below [[New York City]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] in most attendance amongst non-[[Smithsonian]] museums.<ref>Berger, Eric. (2006, November 20).

Houston Chronicle.</ref>  Much of the museum's popularity is attributed to its large number of special or guest exhibits.\n\n==History==\nThe initial museum organization was called the Houston Museum and Scientific Society, Inc., and was created in 1909. The museum's primary collection was acquired between 1914 and 1930. This included the purchase of a natural-history collection assembled by [[Henry Philemon Attwater]] and a donation from collector John Milsaps, the latter of which formed the core of the museum's gem and mineral collection.<ref name=\"Wilson\">Wilson, Wendell E., Bartsch, Joel A., Mauthner, Mark.

The museum's now wide-ranging education programs began in 1947 and, in its second year, hosted 12,000 children.<ref>http://www.hmnspress.org/HMNS_History.aspx</ref>\n\n[[File:Morian Hall of Paleontology - Houston Museum of Natural Science 2.JPG|thumb|Morian Hall of Paleontology]]\nThe museum was officially renamed the Houston Museum of Natural Science in 1960.

In 1988, the [[Challenger Center for Space Science Education|Challenger Learning Center]] was opened in memory of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']] crewmembers that were lost during the shuttle's [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|tenth mission]]. The center's aim is to teach visitors about space exploration. The Wortham IMAX Theatre and the offsite George Observatory were opened in 1989.\n\nMuseum attendance was more than one million visitors in 1990. HMNS trustees determined that new state-of-the-art facilities, additional space, and renovations to current exhibits were needed because of the increased attendance. Between 1991 and 1994, a number of exhibit halls were renovated and the expansion of the Sterling Hall of Research was completed. The Cockrell Butterfly Center and the Brown Hall of Entomology opened in July 1994.\n\n[[File:HMNSSugarLandOldCentralUnit.jpg|thumb|left|The HMNS Sugar Land satellite museum in [[Telfair, Sugar Land|Telfair]], [[Sugar Land, Texas]].]]\nIn March 2007, the museum opened the HMNS [[The Woodlands, Texas|Woodlands]] X-ploration Station, located in the Woodlands Mall.
