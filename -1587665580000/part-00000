Sir Bindon was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1860 and had a distinguished active career until he retired in 1907 aged 65. He was thus 94 years old when appointed Chief Royal Engineer. He resigned in 1940 and died a month later aged 97.\n\nFrom 1941 until 2012 the professional head of the Corps was the Engineer-in-Chief (Army) (EinC(A)) who as 'Director of Royal Engineers', acted as the engineer advisor to the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) as well as to the [[Royal Navy]], the [[Royal Air Force]] and other government ministries on matters of military engineering on behalf of the CGS. This post was disestablished following the Strategic Defence and Security Review and responsibility for the EinC\u2019s duties split between the Commandant Royal School of Military Engineering (heritage and training), Commander 8 Engineer Brigade (force generation matters) and the Corps Colonel RE (manning matters and first point of contact with external agencies).\n\nThe Chief Royal Engineer is head of the Corps of Royal Engineers and invariably a distinguished officer of the Corps; his tenure in the post is normally for a period of five years. He is responsible for seeing that the Corps' traditions and customs are preserved and the continuity of important matters of Corps policy. He keeps the Colonel-in-Chief (Since 1952 [[Queen Elizabeth II]]) informed on Corps matters and maintains contact with engineer units in the [[Commonwealth]].

This post was disestablished following the Strategic Defence and Security Review and responsibility for the EinC\u2019s duties split between the Commandant Royal School of Military Engineering (heritage and training), Commander 8 Engineer Brigade (force generation matters) and the Corps Colonel RE (manning matters and first point of contact with external agencies).\n\nThe Chief Royal Engineer is head of the Corps of Royal Engineers and invariably a distinguished officer of the Corps; his tenure in the post is normally for a period of five years. He is responsible for seeing that the Corps' traditions and customs are preserved and the continuity of important matters of Corps policy. He keeps the Colonel-in-Chief (Since 1952 [[Queen Elizabeth II]]) informed on Corps matters and maintains contact with engineer units in the [[Commonwealth]]. He will have previously served as a Colonel Commandant and will continue to fill one of the vacancies. \n\n==Chief Royal Engineers, 1660\u20131802==\n*1660\u20131661: [[Charles Lloyd (British Army

The [[crown land]]s primarily consisted of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], an [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] according to the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the [[Margraviate of Moravia]], the [[Duchies of Silesia]], and the two [[Lusatia]]s, known as the Margraviate of Upper Lusatia and the Margraviate of Lower Lusatia, as well as other territories throughout its history.\n\nThe joint rule of ''Corona regni Bohemiae'' was legally established by decree of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] issued on 7 April 1348, on the foundation of the original [[Czech lands]] ruled by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]] until 1306. By linking the territories, the interconnection of [[crown land]]s thus no more belonged to a king or a dynasty but to the Bohemian monarchy itself, symbolically personalized by the [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]]. During the reign of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand I]] from 1526, the lands of the Bohemian Crown became a constituent part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Silesia was lost in mid-18th century, but the rest of the Lands passed to the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Cisleithania]]n half of [[Austria-Hungary]]. By the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] in 1918, the remaining Czech lands became part of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]].\n\nThe Bohemian Crown was neither a [[personal union]] nor a [[federation]] of equal members. Rather, the Kingdom of Bohemia had a higher status than the other incorporated constituent countries. There were only some common state institutions of the Bohemian Crown and they did not survive the centralization of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] under Queen [[Maria Theresa]] in the 18th century. The most important of them was the [[Bohemian Court Chancellery]] which was united with the Austrian Chancellery in 1749.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://books.google.com/books?id=b5yE3XOmY7sC&pg=PA22&dq=zem%C4%9B+koruny+%C4%8Desk%C3%A9&hl=en&ei=NXllTsG2McrbgQen0PC3Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=21&ved=0CJgBEOgBMBQ#v=onepage&q=zem%C4%9B%20koruny%20%C4%8Desk%C3%A9&f=false Geschichte der tschechischen \u00f6ffentlichen Verwaltung Karel Schelle, Ilona Schelleov\u00e1, GRIN Verlag, 2011] (in German and Czech)</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe '''Lands of the Bohemian Crown''' ({{lang-la|Corona regni Bohemiae}}) are called ''zem\u011b Koruny \u010desk\u00e9'' or simply ''Koruna \u010desk\u00e1'' ('''Crown of Bohemia''' or '''Bohemian Crown''')<ref name=nacr>{{cite web|title=The Archives of the Crown of Bohemia|url=http://www.nacr.cz/sua/cinnost/ackeng.htm|publisher=National Archive of the Czech Republic (N\u00e1rodn\u00ed archiv \u010cR)|accessdate=6 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220122442/http://nacr.cz/sua/cinnost/ackeng.htm|archive-date=20 December 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"bohemia in history\">{{cite book|editor-last=Teich|editor-first=Mikul\u00e1\u0161|editor-link=Mikul\u00e1\u0161 Teich|title=Bohemia in history|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-43155-7|page=117|edition=1. publ.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Silesia \u2013 Pearl in the Crown of Bohemia|url=http://www.ngprague.cz/en/exposition-detail/silesia-8211-pearl-in-the-crown-of-bohemia/|publisher=National Gallery in Prague (N\u00e1rodn\u00ed galerie v Praze)|accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref> and ''\u010cesk\u00e9 zem\u011b'' (i.e. '''Czech lands''') in [[Czech language]], the adjective ''\u010desk\u00fd'' referring to both \"[[Bohemia]]n\" and \"[[Czech people|Czech]]\".

Along with the title, Philip also raised the duchy to the Kingdom of Bohemia rank. The regality was ultimately confirmed by Philip's nephew the [[King of Germany|German king]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], later the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (1220\u22121250), in the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] issued in 1212.\n\nThe P\u0159emyslid king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] acquired the [[Duchy of Austria]] in 1251, the [[Duchy of Styria]] in 1261, the [[Egerland]] in 1266, the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] with the [[March of Carniola]] and the [[Windic March]] in 1269 as well as the March of [[Friuli]] in 1272. His plans to turn Bohemia into the leading [[Imperial State]] were aborted by his [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] rival King [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who seized his acquisitions and finally defeated him in the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Luxembourgs===\nIn 1306 the [[House of Luxembourg]] began producing Bohemian kings upon the extinction of the P\u0159emyslids. They significantly enlarged the Bohemian lands again, including when King [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind]] vassalized most Polish [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] dukes of [[Silesia]]. His suzerainty was acknowledged by the Polish king [[Casimir III the Great]] in the 1335 [[Treaty of Trentschin]]. John also achieved the [[enfeoffment]] with the [[Upper Lusatia]]n lands of [[Bautzen]] (1319) and [[G\u00f6rlitz]] (1329), by the [[King of Germany|German king]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]].\n[[File:Statues on Old Town Bridge Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Coats of arms of the Holy Roman Empire and the Bohemian Crown on the Tower of [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague.]]\n\nKing John's eldest son [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1346 and succeeded his father as King of Bohemia in the same year.

Beside their home [[County of Luxembourg]] itself, the dynasty held further non-contiguous Imperial fiefs in the [[Low Countries]], such as: the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg]], acquired through marriage by Charles' younger half-brother [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg|Wenceslaus of Luxembourg]] in 1355; as well as the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] purchased in 1373. As both the King of Bohemia and the Margrave of Brandenburg had been designated [[Prince-elector]]s in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the Luxembourgs held two votes in the electoral college, securing the succession of Charles's son [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]] in 1376.\n\nWith King Wenceslaus, the decline of the Luxembourg dynasty began. He himself was deposed as King of the Romans in 1400. The Duchies of Brabant, Limburg (in 1406), and even Luxembourg itself (in 1411) were ceded to the French [[House of Valois-Burgundy]]; while the Margraviate of Brandenburg passed to the [[House of Hohenzollern]] (in 1415).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Nevertheless, the joint rule of the Bohemian Lands outlived the [[Hussite Wars]] and the extinction of the Luxembourg male line upon the death of Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] in 1437.\n\n===Jagiellons===\n[[Vladislas II of Hungary|Vladislas II]] of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], son of the Polish king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]], was designated King of Bohemia in 1471, while the crown lands of Moravia, Silesia, and the Lusatias were occupied by rivaling King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary. In 1479 both kings signed the [[Treaty of Olomouc]], whereby the unity of the Bohemian crown lands was officially retained unchanged and the monarchs appointed each other as sole heir. Upon the death of King Matthias in 1490, Vladislas ruled the Bohemian crown lands and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in personal union.\n\n===Habsburgs===\n[[File:Rakousko-Uhersko 1910.PNG|thumb|Lands of the Bohemian Crown with Austria-Hungary (1910)]]\nWhen Vladislas' only son [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis]] was killed at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526 ending the Jagiellon dynasty rule in Bohemia, a convention of Bohemian nobles elected his brother-in-law, the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]], as the new king of the Bohemian crown lands. Together with the [[Archduchy of Austria]] \"hereditary lands\" and the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungarian kingdom]], they formed the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], which in the following centuries grew out of the Holy Roman Empire into a separate European power. Attempts by the Bohemian [[Protestant Reformation]] estates to build up an autonomous confederation were dashed at the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]], whereafter the administration was centralised at [[Vienna]]. Moreover, the Habsburg rulers lost the Lusatias to the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in the 1635 [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]], and also most of Silesia with Kladsko to King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the 1742 [[Treaty of Breslau]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn the Modern era, the remaining crown lands of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Austrian Silesia]] became constituent parts of the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1804, and later the [[Cisleithania]]n half of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1867.\n\nAfter [[World War I]] and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, these became the historic regions usually referred to as the [[Czech lands]] forming the [[Czech Republic]].

Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[early modern period]]s connected by [[feudalism|feudal]] relations under the [[List of Bohemian monarchs|Bohemian kings]]. The [[crown land]]s primarily consisted of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], an [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] according to the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the [[Margraviate of Moravia]], the [[Duchies of Silesia]], and the two [[Lusatia]]s, known as the Margraviate of Upper Lusatia and the Margraviate of Lower Lusatia, as well as other territories throughout its history.\n\nThe joint rule of ''Corona regni Bohemiae'' was legally established by decree of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] issued on 7 April 1348, on the foundation of the original [[Czech lands]] ruled by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]] until 1306. By linking the territories, the interconnection of [[crown land]]s thus no more belonged to a king or a dynasty but to the Bohemian monarchy itself, symbolically personalized by the [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]]. During the reign of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand I]] from 1526, the lands of the Bohemian Crown became a constituent part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Silesia was lost in mid-18th century, but the rest of the Lands passed to the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Cisleithania]]n half of [[Austria-Hungary]]. By the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]] in 1918, the remaining Czech lands became part of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]].\n\nThe Bohemian Crown was neither a [[personal union]] nor a [[federation]] of equal members. Rather, the Kingdom of Bohemia had a higher status than the other incorporated constituent countries. There were only some common state institutions of the Bohemian Crown and they did not survive the centralization of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] under Queen [[Maria Theresa]] in the 18th century.

The denotation '''Lands of the Crown of Saint Wenceslas''' (''zem\u011b Koruny svatov\u00e1clavsk\u00e9'') refers to the [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]], part of the [[regalia]] of the Bohemian monarchs.\n\n==History==\n{{For|more detailed histories|Czech lands in the High Middle Ages|Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1348\u20131526)|Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1526\u20131648)|Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1648\u20131867)|Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1867\u20131918)}}\n\n===P\u0159emyslids===\nIn the 10th and 11th century the [[Duchy of Bohemia]], together with [[Moravia]] (the [[Margraviate of Moravia]] from 1182 on), and [[K\u0142odzko Land]] were consolidated under the ruling [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]].\n\nDuke [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]] gained the hereditary royal title to the Duchy of Bohemia in 1198, from the German (anti)\u2212king [[Philip of Swabia]], for his support. Along with the title, Philip also raised the duchy to the Kingdom of Bohemia rank. The regality was ultimately confirmed by Philip's nephew the [[King of Germany|German king]] [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], later the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (1220\u22121250), in the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] issued in 1212.\n\nThe P\u0159emyslid king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] acquired the [[Duchy of Austria]] in 1251, the [[Duchy of Styria]] in 1261, the [[Egerland]] in 1266, the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] with the [[March of Carniola]] and the [[Windic March]] in 1269 as well as the March of [[Friuli]] in 1272. His plans to turn Bohemia into the leading [[Imperial State]] were aborted by his [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] rival King [[Rudolph I of Germany]], who seized his acquisitions and finally defeated him in the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n===Luxembourgs===\nIn 1306 the [[House of Luxembourg]] began producing Bohemian kings upon the extinction of the P\u0159emyslids. They significantly enlarged the Bohemian lands again, including when King [[John of Bohemia|John the Blind]] vassalized most Polish [[Silesian Piasts|Piast]] dukes of [[Silesia]]. His suzerainty was acknowledged by the Polish king [[Casimir III the Great]] in the 1335 [[Treaty of Trentschin]]. John also achieved the [[enfeoffment]] with the [[Upper Lusatia]]n lands of [[Bautzen]] (1319) and [[G\u00f6rlitz]] (1329), by the [[King of Germany|German king]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]].\n[[File:Statues on Old Town Bridge Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Coats of arms of the Holy Roman Empire and the Bohemian Crown on the Tower of [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague.]]\n\nKing John's eldest son [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1346 and succeeded his father as King of Bohemia in the same year. In 1348, Charles IV introduced the concept of the ''Crown of Bohemia'' (''Corona regni Bohemiae'' in Latin), a term which designated the whole state hereditarily ruled by the kings of Bohemia, not only its core territory of Bohemia but also the incorporated provinces.<ref name=\"radioprg\">{{cite web |last1=\u0160itler |first1=Ji\u0159\u00ed |title=From Bohemia to Czechia |url=https://www.radio.cz/en/section/letter/from-bohemia-to-czechia |website=Radio Prague International |publisher=Czech Radio |accessdate=26 January 2020 |language=en |date=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Luxembourg dynasty reached its high point, when Charles was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1355.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> By his Imperial authority he decreed that the united Bohemian lands should endure regardless of dynastic developments, even if the Luxembourgs should die out.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |last=Prinz |first=Friedrich |language=German|title=Deutsche Geschichte in Osten Europas: B\u00f6hmen und M\u00e4hren |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Deutsche_Geschichte_im_Osten_Europas_B\u00f6.html?id=MmwjAQAAIAAJ |accessdate= 25 February 2013 |year=1993 |publisher=Wolf Jobst Siedler Verlag GmbH |location=Berlin |isbn=3-88680-200-0 |page=381 |pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1367 he purchased [[Lower Lusatia]] from his stepson Margrave [[Otto V, Duke of Bavaria|Otto V of Brandenburg]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. Beside their home [[County of Luxembourg]] itself, the dynasty held further non-contiguous Imperial fiefs in the [[Low Countries]], such as: the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg]], acquired through marriage by Charles' younger half-brother [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg|Wenceslaus of Luxembourg]] in 1355; as well as the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] purchased in 1373. As both the King of Bohemia and the Margrave of Brandenburg had been designated [[Prince-elector]]s in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the Luxembourgs held two votes in the electoral college, securing the succession of Charles's son [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]] in 1376.\n\nWith King Wenceslaus, the decline of the Luxembourg dynasty began. He himself was deposed as King of the Romans in 1400. The Duchies of Brabant, Limburg (in 1406), and even Luxembourg itself (in 1411) were ceded to the French [[House of Valois-Burgundy]]; while the Margraviate of Brandenburg passed to the [[House of Hohenzollern]] (in 1415).<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Nevertheless, the joint rule of the Bohemian Lands outlived the [[Hussite Wars]] and the extinction of the Luxembourg male line upon the death of Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] in 1437.\n\n===Jagiellons===\n[[Vladislas II of Hungary|Vladislas II]] of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]], son of the Polish king [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]], was designated King of Bohemia in 1471, while the crown lands of Moravia, Silesia, and the Lusatias were occupied by rivaling King [[Matthias Corvinus]] of Hungary. In 1479 both kings signed the [[Treaty of Olomouc]], whereby the unity of the Bohemian crown lands was officially retained unchanged and the monarchs appointed each other as sole heir. Upon the death of King Matthias in 1490, Vladislas ruled the Bohemian crown lands and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in personal union.\n\n===Habsburgs===\n[[File:Rakousko-Uhersko 1910.PNG|thumb|Lands of the Bohemian Crown with Austria-Hungary (1910)]]\nWhen Vladislas' only son [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis]] was killed at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526 ending the Jagiellon dynasty rule in Bohemia, a convention of Bohemian nobles elected his brother-in-law, the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]], as the new king of the Bohemian crown lands. Together with the [[Archduchy of Austria]] \"hereditary lands\" and the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungarian kingdom]], they formed the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], which in the following centuries grew out of the Holy Roman Empire into a separate European power. Attempts by the Bohemian [[Protestant Reformation]] estates to build up an autonomous confederation were dashed at the 1620 [[Battle of White Mountain]], whereafter the administration was centralised at [[Vienna]]. Moreover, the Habsburg rulers lost the Lusatias to the [[Electorate of Saxony]] in the 1635 [[Peace of Prague (1635)|Peace of Prague]], and also most of Silesia with Kladsko to King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the 1742 [[Treaty of Breslau]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn the Modern era, the remaining crown lands of [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Austrian Silesia]] became constituent parts of the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1804, and later the [[Cisleithania]]n half of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1867.\n\nAfter [[World War I]] and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, these became the historic regions usually referred to as the [[Czech lands]] forming the [[Czech Republic]]. Austrian Silesia with the [[Hlu\u010d\u00edn Region]] is today known as [[Czech Silesia]], with the exception of eastern [[Cieszyn Silesia]] which passed to the [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1920.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Bohemian territories==\n===Crown lands===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Crown land\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Map\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Capital or important city\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Ethnic group\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Religion\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | Notes\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align: left;\" | [[File:Coat of arms of the House of Luxembourg-Bohemia.svg|30px]] [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]\n| [[Monarchy|Kingdom]]\n| [[File:Locator Bohemia within the Holy Roman Empire (1618).svg|110px]]\n| [[Prague]]\n| Bohemians ([[Czechs]])<br>[[Germans]]\n| [[Roman Catholic]]<br>[[Hussite]] (15th-17th centuries)<br>[[Anabaptist]] (15th-17th centuries)<br>[[Lutheran]]\n| Royal dignity first bestowed upon [[Vratislaus II of Bohemia]] in 1085, hereditary since 1198 under King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]]; [[Prince-elector|Electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], confirmed by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]].
