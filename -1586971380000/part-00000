The model is designed to blend practice, theory, and professionalism in all three years of law school. Students begin working with clients in the first year of law school. Writing and skills courses track the content in their substantive courses to blend theory and practice. Students also learn transactional drafting, financial literacy, and statutory and regulatory analysis during the first year.\n\nDuring the second year of law school, students specialize and continue to build on the skills they learned during their first year. The law school's concentrations include health care law, international law, national security law, and law, technology, and the arts.\n\nBeginning in 2016, a capstone semester became a hallmark of the third year. All students practice law full-time by working on cases through the Milton A. Kramer Law Clinic Center at the law school or through an externship. Students may do externships in the U.S. or abroad. A select number of students may competitively apply to spend their third year in Europe, completing a foreign LLM degree in addition to their Case JD, at no additional cost.\n\nStudents learn leadership through courses developed by faculty at Case Western's Weatherhead School of Management, and students graduate with e-portfolios of their work to share with employers.\n\n==Journals==\n[[Image:CWRU Bridge.JPG|thumb|The \"Bridge\"]]\n* ''Case Western Reserve Law Review\n* ''Canada-US Law Journal''\n* ''Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine'' (the country\u2019s sole student-edited health law journal)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/case-western-reserve-university-03123|title=USNWR Rankings}}</ref>\n* ''Case Western Reserve Journal of Law, Technology & the Internet''\n* ''[[Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law]]''\n\n== Academic Centers ==\n* Frederick K.

The model is designed to blend practice, theory, and professionalism in all three years of law school. Students begin working with clients in the first year of law school. Writing and skills courses track the content in their substantive courses to blend theory and practice. Students also learn transactional drafting, financial literacy, and statutory and regulatory analysis during the first year.\n\nDuring the second year of law school, students specialize and continue to build on the skills they learned during their first year. The law school's concentrations include health care law, international law, national security law, and law, technology, and the arts.\n\nBeginning in 2016, a capstone semester became a hallmark of the third year. All students practice law full-time by working on cases through the Milton A. Kramer Law Clinic Center at the law school or through an externship. Students may do externships in the U.S. or abroad. A select number of students may competitively apply to spend their third year in Europe, completing a foreign LLM degree in addition to their Case JD, at no additional cost.\n\nStudents learn leadership through courses developed by faculty at Case Western's Weatherhead School of Management, and students graduate with e-portfolios of their work to share with employers.\n\n==Journals==\n[[Image:CWRU Bridge.JPG|thumb|The \"Bridge\"]]\n* ''Case Western Reserve Law Review\n* ''Canada-US Law Journal''\n* ''Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine'' (the country\u2019s sole student-edited health law journal)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/case-western-reserve-university-03123|title=USNWR Rankings}}</ref>\n* ''Case Western Reserve Journal of Law, Technology & the Internet''\n* ''[[Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law]]''\n\n== Academic Centers ==\n* Frederick K.

Her parents split up when Mark was only 1 year old and she lived with her mother in Miami until the age of 9 when they moved to India so that her mother could study Thangka, a traditional Buddhist form of art. After 3 years living in a monastery in India, Mark and her mother moved to Berlin, and after graduating high school at the age of 18 she moved to New York to live with her godparents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edailybuzz.com/2019/03/12/amber-mark-wiki-bio-2019-age-height-net-worth-birthday-mother-boyfriend-social-media/|title=Amber Mark Wiki, Bio 2019: Age, Height, Net worth, Birthday, Mother, Boyfriend, Social Media.|date=March 12, 2019|work=edailybuzz.com|accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer mother, Mia, died on 3 June 2013 at the age of 60.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5Y_Mni-eU|title=Amber Mark - Monsoon (Official Video) ft.

In high school, she joined the school choir and an \u201cafter school band program\u201d. She stated in an interview that this was when she realized that being an artist was what she wanted to do.<ref>(2017, August 21) Retrieved November 19, 2019, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3pNkDnoo5k&t=102s</ref> Her mother was a huge part of her early life and one of her first songs was in dedication to her mother's passing in 2013.<ref>Ciara, H., & Calum, S.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker. Amber remembers crying after the concert was over.\n\n===2016-present:Musical career===\nMark released her debut single \"S P A C E\" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album \"3:33am\".

Then my mum passed away on June 3, at 10:23pm in 2013. Since then, I'd see threes everywhere.

Offering a discount or a refund to all purchasers is a legal [[rebate (marketing)|rebate]] and is not bribery. For example, it is legal for an employee of a Public Utilities Commission involved in electric rate regulation to accept a rebate on electric service that reduces their cost for electricity, when the rebate is available to other residential electric customers. However, giving a discount specifically to that employee to influence them to look favorably on the electric utility's rate increase applications would be considered bribery.\n\nA bribe is an illegal or unethical gift bestowed to influence the recipient's conduct.

Jefferson]]'s freezer in the August 2005 raid was shown to jurors on 8 July 2009]]\nMany types of payments or favors may be fairly or unfairly labeled as bribes: [[gratuity|tip]], [[gift]], [[sop]], [[Employee benefit|perk]], [[Price skimming|skim]], favor, [[discounts and allowances|discount]], [[waived]] fee/ticket, free food, free ad, free trip, free tickets, [[sweetheart deal]], [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback/payback]], [[funding]], inflated sale of an object or property, lucrative contract, [[donation]], [[campaign contribution]], [[fundraiser]], [[sponsorship]]/backing, higher paying job, [[stock options]], [[secret commission]], or [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] (rise of position/rank).\n\nOne must be careful of differing social and cultural norms when examining bribery. Expectations of when a monetary transaction is appropriate can differ from place to place. Political [[campaign contributions]] in the form of cash, for example, are considered criminal acts of bribery in some countries, while in the United States, provided they adhere to election law, are legal. [[Tip (gratuity)|Tipping]], for example, is considered bribery in some societies, while in others the two concepts may not be interchangeable.\n\nIn some Spanish-speaking countries, bribes are referred to as \"mordida\" (literally, \"bite\"). In Arab countries, bribes may be called [[baksheesh]] (a tip, gift, or gratuity) or \"shay\" (literally, \"tea\"). French-speaking countries often use the expressions \"dessous-de-table\" (\"under-the-table\" commissions), \"pot-de-vin\" (literally, \"wine-pot\"), or \"commission occulte\" (\"secret commission\" or \"kickback\"). While the last two expressions contain inherently a negative connotation, the expression \"dessous-de-table\" can be often understood as a commonly accepted business practice. In German, the common term is ''Schmiergeld'' (\"smoothing money\").\n\nThe offence may be divided into two great classes: the one, where a person invested with power is induced by payment to use it unjustly; the other, where power is obtained by purchasing the suffrages of those who can impart it. Likewise, the briber might hold a powerful role and control the transaction; or in other cases, a bribe may be effectively extracted from the person paying it, although this is better known as [[extortion]].\n\nThe forms that bribery take are numerous. For example, a motorist might bribe a [[police|police officer]] not to issue a ticket for speeding, a citizen seeking paperwork or utility line connections might bribe a functionary for faster service.\n\nBribery may also take the form of a [[secret commission]], a profit made by an agent, in the course of his employment, without the knowledge of his principal. Euphemisms abound for this (commission, sweetener, kick-back etc.) Bribers and recipients of bribery are likewise numerous although bribers have one common denominator and that is the financial ability to bribe.\n\nOverall, bribery is thought to be around one trillion dollars worldwide according to BBC news UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 Business \u2013 African corruption 'on the wane'|work=bbc.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422141310/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|archivedate=2009-04-22}}</ref>\n\nAs indicated on the pages devoted to [[political corruption]], efforts have been made in recent years by the international community to encourage countries to dissociate and incriminate as separate offences, active and passive bribery. From a legal point of view, active bribery can be defined for instance as ''the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage [to any public official], for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions.'' (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173) of the [[Council of Europe]]). Passive bribery can be defined as ''the request or receipt [by any public official], directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions'' (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).\n\nThe reason for this dissociation is to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal policy point of view) that bribery is not acceptable. Besides, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. Besides, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a \"fee\" to the decision maker to obtain a favourable decision.\n\nWhen examining the fact of bribe taking, we primarily need to understand that any action is affected by various elements; in addition, all these elements are interrelated. For instance, it would be wrong to indicate that the bribe-taker's motive is greediness as such, without examining causes of appearance of greediness in the personality of the particular bribe-taker. Largely, it is possible to confine oneself to the motive of greediness only in case if a bribe-taker tries to satisfy the primary (physical) needs. Yet, if money serves to satisfy secondary \u2013 psychological \u2013 needs, we should search for deeper motives of bribe taking.<ref>Krivins, A. (2018). \"The motivational peculiarities of bribe-takers\". SHS Web Conf. \nVolume 40, 2018 6th International Interdisciplinary Scientific Conference SOCIETY. HEALTH.

SCOTUS Police, Outside the Third Guantanamo Hearing (Washington, DC).jpg|thumb|Article II, Section 4 of the [[United States Constitution]]]]\n\nA grey area may exist when payments to smooth transactions are made. United States law is particularly strict in limiting the ability of businesses to pay for the awarding of contracts by foreign governments; however, the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] contains an exception for \"grease payments\"; very basically, this allows payments to officials in order to obtain the performance of ministerial acts which they are legally required to do, but may delay in the absence of such payment. In some countries, this practice is the norm, often resulting from a developing nation not having the tax structure to pay civil servants an adequate salary. Nevertheless, most economists regard bribery as a bad thing because it encourages [[rent seeking]] behaviour. A state where bribery has become a way of life is a [[kleptocracy]].\n\nRecent evidence suggests that the act of bribery can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country, region and/or tribal unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan|publisher=Bath Economic Research Papers, No 21/14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003707/http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=The Tribes that Bind: Attitudes to the Tribe and Tribal Leader in the Sudan|publisher=Bath Economic Research Papers 31/14|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206005357/http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-06}}</ref>\n\n===Tax treatment===\nThe tax status of bribes is an issue for governments since the bribery of government officials impedes the democratic process and may interfere with good government. In some countries, such bribes are considered tax-deductible payments. However, in 1996, in an effort to discourage bribery, the [[OECD|OECD Council]] recommended that member countries cease to allow the tax-deductibility of bribes to foreign officials. This was followed by the signing of the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|Anti-Bribery Convention]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm |title=OECD Anti Bribery Convention |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905072104/http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm |archivedate=2015-09-05 }}</ref> Since that time, the majority of the OECD countries which are signatories of the convention have revised their tax policies according to this recommendation and some have extended the measures to bribes paid to any official, sending the message that bribery will no longer be tolerated in the operations of the government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/ethics/ |title=OECD Anti-corruption and integrity in the public sector |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305063422/http://www.oecd.org/corruption/ethics/ |archivedate=2018-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nAs any monetary benefit received from an illegal activity such as bribery is generally considered part of one's taxable income, however, as it is criminal, some governments may refuse to accept it as income as it may mean they are a party to the activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinoymoneytalk.com/income-from-hyip-autosurf-scams-are-taxable/|title=Income from scams and bribes are also taxable|last=PinoyMoneyTalk|date=8 January 2007|website=pinoymoneytalk.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214202759/https://www.pinoymoneytalk.com/income-from-hyip-autosurf-scams-are-taxable/|archivedate=14 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Medicine==\n[[Pharmaceutical corporation]]s may seek to entice [[physician|doctors]] to favor prescribing their [[medication|drugs]] over others of comparable effectiveness.

For example, in many formerly Communist countries from what used to be the [[Eastern Bloc]] it may be customary to offer expensive gifts to doctors and nurses for the delivery of service at any level of medical care in the non-private health sector.<ref>Lewis, Mauree.

This is [[Lobbying in the United States|not illegal in the United States]] and forms a major part of [[campaign finance]], though it is sometimes referred to as the [[Money trail|money loop]]{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. However, in many European countries, a politician accepting money from a corporation whose activities fall under the sector they currently (or are campaigning to be elected to) regulate would be considered a criminal offence, for instance the \"[[Cash-for-questions affair]]\" and \"[[Cash for Honours]]\" in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nA grey area in these democracies is the so-called \"[[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]]\" in which politicians are offered highly-paid, often consultancy jobs upon their retirement from politics by the corporations they regulate while in office, in return for enacting legislation favourable to the corporation whil they are in office, a [[conflict of interest]]. Convictions for this form of bribery are easier to obtain with hard evidence, a specific amount of money linked to a specific action by the recipient of the bribe. Such evidence is frequently obtained using undercover agents, since evidence of a [[quid pro quo]] relation can often be difficult to prove. See also [[influence peddling]] and [[political corruption]].\n\nRecent evidence suggests that demands for bribes can adversely impact citizen level of trust and engagement with the political process.\n\n==Business==\n[[Image:Say no to bribes in Chipata, Zambia.jpg|thumb|A campaign to prevent bribes in [[Zambia]].]]\n{{Main|Commercial bribery}}\n\nEmployees, managers, or salespeople of a business may offer money or gifts to a potential client in exchange for business.\n\nFor example, in 2006, German prosecutors conducted a wide-ranging investigation of [[Siemens AG]] to determine if Siemens employees paid bribes in exchange for business.\n\nIn some cases where the system of law is not well-implemented, bribes may be a way for companies to continue their businesses. In the case, for example, custom officials may harass a certain firm or production plant, officially stating they are checking for irregularities, halting production or stalling other normal activities of a firm. The disruption may cause losses to the firm that exceed the amount of money to pay off the official. Bribing the officials is a common way to deal with this issue in countries where there exists no firm system of reporting these semi-illegal activities. A third party, known as a White Glove, may be involved to act as a clean middleman.\n\nSpecialist consultancies have been set up to help multinational companies and [[small and medium enterprises]] with a commitment to anti-corruption to trade more ethically and benefit from compliance with the law.\n\nContracts based on or involving the payment or transfer of bribes (\"corruption money\", \"secret commissions\", \"pots-de-vin\", \"kickbacks\") are void.<ref>International principle of law [http://www.trans-lex.org/938000 Trans-Lex.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121234720/http://trans-lex.org/938000 |date=2011-01-21 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, ''[[The Economist]]'' noted:\n\n{{quote|Bribery would be less of a problem if it wasn't also a solid investment.

Another reason for businesses to undergo external verification of their bribery prevention programs is that it means evidence can be provided to assert that all that was possible was done to prevent corruption.

There is a way for prosecutors to try people for bribery by using existing laws. Section 1346 of Title 18 can be used by prosecutors, to try people for \u2018a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right to honest services,\u2019 under the mail and wire fraud statutes. [https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-anti-bribery-and-anti-corruption-review-edition-6/1151869/united-states] Prosecutors have always successfully prosecuted private company employees for breaching a fiduciary duty and taking bribes, under Honest services fraud.\n\nThere are also cases of successful prosecution of bribery in the case of international business. The DOJ has used the Travel Act, 18 USC Section 1952 to prosecute bribery. Under the Travel Act, it is against the law, domestically and internationally, to utilize\u2018the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce\u2019 with intent to \u2018promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment or carrying on, of any unlawful activity\u2019.

However, giving a discount specifically to that employee to influence them to look favorably on the electric utility's rate increase applications would be considered bribery.\n\nA bribe is an illegal or unethical gift bestowed to influence the recipient's conduct.

Expectations of when a monetary transaction is appropriate can differ from place to place. Political [[campaign contributions]] in the form of cash, for example, are considered criminal acts of bribery in some countries, while in the United States, provided they adhere to election law, are legal. [[Tip (gratuity)|Tipping]], for example, is considered bribery in some societies, while in others the two concepts may not be interchangeable.\n\nIn some Spanish-speaking countries, bribes are referred to as \"mordida\" (literally, \"bite\"). In Arab countries, bribes may be called [[baksheesh]] (a tip, gift, or gratuity) or \"shay\" (literally, \"tea\"). French-speaking countries often use the expressions \"dessous-de-table\" (\"under-the-table\" commissions), \"pot-de-vin\" (literally, \"wine-pot\"), or \"commission occulte\" (\"secret commission\" or \"kickback\"). While the last two expressions contain inherently a negative connotation, the expression \"dessous-de-table\" can be often understood as a commonly accepted business practice. In German, the common term is ''Schmiergeld'' (\"smoothing money\").\n\nThe offence may be divided into two great classes: the one, where a person invested with power is induced by payment to use it unjustly; the other, where power is obtained by purchasing the suffrages of those who can impart it. Likewise, the briber might hold a powerful role and control the transaction; or in other cases, a bribe may be effectively extracted from the person paying it, although this is better known as [[extortion]].\n\nThe forms that bribery take are numerous. For example, a motorist might bribe a [[police|police officer]] not to issue a ticket for speeding, a citizen seeking paperwork or utility line connections might bribe a functionary for faster service.\n\nBribery may also take the form of a [[secret commission]], a profit made by an agent, in the course of his employment, without the knowledge of his principal. Euphemisms abound for this (commission, sweetener, kick-back etc.) Bribers and recipients of bribery are likewise numerous although bribers have one common denominator and that is the financial ability to bribe.\n\nOverall, bribery is thought to be around one trillion dollars worldwide according to BBC news UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 Business \u2013 African corruption 'on the wane'|work=bbc.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422141310/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|archivedate=2009-04-22}}</ref>\n\nAs indicated on the pages devoted to [[political corruption]], efforts have been made in recent years by the international community to encourage countries to dissociate and incriminate as separate offences, active and passive bribery. From a legal point of view, active bribery can be defined for instance as ''the promising, offering or giving by any person, directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage [to any public official], for himself or herself or for anyone else, for him or her to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions.'' (article 2 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173) of the [[Council of Europe]]). Passive bribery can be defined as ''the request or receipt [by any public official], directly or indirectly, of any undue advantage, for himself or herself or for anyone else, or the acceptance of an offer or a promise of such an advantage, to act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her functions'' (article 3 of the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 173)).\n\nThe reason for this dissociation is to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal policy point of view) that bribery is not acceptable. Besides, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. Besides, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a \"fee\" to the decision maker to obtain a favourable decision.\n\nWhen examining the fact of bribe taking, we primarily need to understand that any action is affected by various elements; in addition, all these elements are interrelated. For instance, it would be wrong to indicate that the bribe-taker's motive is greediness as such, without examining causes of appearance of greediness in the personality of the particular bribe-taker. Largely, it is possible to confine oneself to the motive of greediness only in case if a bribe-taker tries to satisfy the primary (physical) needs. Yet, if money serves to satisfy secondary \u2013 psychological \u2013 needs, we should search for deeper motives of bribe taking.<ref>Krivins, A. (2018). \"The motivational peculiarities of bribe-takers\". SHS Web Conf. \nVolume 40, 2018 6th International Interdisciplinary Scientific Conference SOCIETY. HEALTH.

SCOTUS Police, Outside the Third Guantanamo Hearing (Washington, DC).jpg|thumb|Article II, Section 4 of the [[United States Constitution]]]]\n\nA grey area may exist when payments to smooth transactions are made. United States law is particularly strict in limiting the ability of businesses to pay for the awarding of contracts by foreign governments; however, the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] contains an exception for \"grease payments\"; very basically, this allows payments to officials in order to obtain the performance of ministerial acts which they are legally required to do, but may delay in the absence of such payment. In some countries, this practice is the norm, often resulting from a developing nation not having the tax structure to pay civil servants an adequate salary. Nevertheless, most economists regard bribery as a bad thing because it encourages [[rent seeking]] behaviour. A state where bribery has become a way of life is a [[kleptocracy]].\n\nRecent evidence suggests that the act of bribery can have political consequences- with citizens being asked for bribes becoming less likely to identify with their country, region and/or tribal unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=Bribery and Identity: Evidence from Sudan|publisher=Bath Economic Research Papers, No 21/14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003707/http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=A.|last2=Hudson|first2=J.|year=2014|title=The Tribes that Bind: Attitudes to the Tribe and Tribal Leader in the Sudan|publisher=Bath Economic Research Papers 31/14|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206005357/http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/31-14.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-06}}</ref>\n\n===Tax treatment===\nThe tax status of bribes is an issue for governments since the bribery of government officials impedes the democratic process and may interfere with good government. In some countries, such bribes are considered tax-deductible payments. However, in 1996, in an effort to discourage bribery, the [[OECD|OECD Council]] recommended that member countries cease to allow the tax-deductibility of bribes to foreign officials. This was followed by the signing of the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|Anti-Bribery Convention]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm |title=OECD Anti Bribery Convention |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905072104/http://www.oecd.org/corruption/oecdantibriberyconvention.htm |archivedate=2015-09-05 }}</ref> Since that time, the majority of the OECD countries which are signatories of the convention have revised their tax policies according to this recommendation and some have extended the measures to bribes paid to any official, sending the message that bribery will no longer be tolerated in the operations of the government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/ethics/ |title=OECD Anti-corruption and integrity in the public sector |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305063422/http://www.oecd.org/corruption/ethics/ |archivedate=2018-03-05 }}</ref>\n\nAs any monetary benefit received from an illegal activity such as bribery is generally considered part of one's taxable income, however, as its criminal, some governments may refuse to accept it as income as it may mean they are a party to the activity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pinoymoneytalk.com/income-from-hyip-autosurf-scams-are-taxable/|title=Income from scams and bribes are also taxable|last=PinoyMoneyTalk|date=8 January 2007|website=pinoymoneytalk.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214202759/https://www.pinoymoneytalk.com/income-from-hyip-autosurf-scams-are-taxable/|archivedate=14 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Medicine==\n[[Pharmaceutical corporation]]s may seek to entice [[physician|doctors]] to favor prescribing their [[medication|drugs]] over others of comparable effectiveness.

This is [[Lobbying in the United States|not illegal in the United States]] and forms a major part of [[campaign finance]], though it is sometimes referred to as the [[Money trail|money loop]]{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. However, in many European countries, a politician accepting money from a corporation whose activities fall under the sector they currently (or are campaigning to be elected to) regulate would be considered a criminal offence, for instance the \"[[Cash-for-questions affair]]\" and \"[[Cash for Honours]]\" in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nA grey area in these democracies is the so-called \"[[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]]\" in which politicians are offered highly-paid, often consultancy jobs upon their retirement from politics by the corporations they regulate while in office, in return for enacting legislation favourable to the corporation whil they are in office, a [[conflict of interest]]. Convictions for this form of bribery are easier to obtain with hard evidence, a specific amount of money linked to a specific action by the recipient of the bribe. Such evidence is frequently obtained using undercover agents, since evidence of a [[quid pro quo]] relation can often be difficult to prove. See also [[influence peddling]] and [[political corruption]].\n\nRecent evidence suggests that demands for bribes can adversely impact citizen level of trust and engagement with the political process.\n\n==Business==\n[[Image:Say no to bribes in Chipata, Zambia.jpg|thumb|A campaign to prevent bribes in [[Zambia]].]]\n{{Main|Commercial bribery}}\n\nEmployees, managers, or salespeople of a business may offer money or gifts to a potential client in exchange for business.\n\nFor example, in 2006, German prosecutors conducted a wide-ranging investigation of [[Siemens AG]] to determine if Siemens employees paid bribes in exchange for business.\n\nIn some cases where the system of law is not well-implemented, bribes may be a way for companies to continue their businesses. In the case, for example, custom officials may harass a certain firm or production plant, officially stating they are checking for irregularities, halting production or stalling other normal activities of a firm. The disruption may cause losses to the firm that exceed the amount of money to pay off the official. Bribing the officials is a common way to deal with this issue in countries where there exists no firm system of reporting these semi-illegal activities. A third party, known as a White Glove, may be involved to act as a clean middleman.\n\nSpecialist consultancies have been set up to help multinational companies and [[small and medium enterprises]] with a commitment to anti-corruption to trade more ethically and benefit from compliance with the law.\n\nContracts based on or involving the payment or transfer of bribes (\"corruption money\", \"secret commissions\", \"pots-de-vin\", \"kickbacks\") are void.<ref>International principle of law [http://www.trans-lex.org/938000 Trans-Lex.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121234720/http://trans-lex.org/938000 |date=2011-01-21 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, ''[[The Economist]]'' noted:\n\n{{quote|Bribery would be less of a problem if it wasn't also a solid investment.

A public official is further defined as anyone who holds public or elected office. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201] Another stipulation of the law in place condemns the same kind of offering, giving, or coercing a witness in a legal case to changing their story.

Another reason for businesses to undergo external verification of their bribery prevention programs is that it means evidence can be provided to assert that all that was possible was done to prevent corruption. Companies are unable to guarantee corruption has never occurred; what they can do is provide evidence that they did their best to prevent it.\n\nThere is no federal statute under the U.S Law that prohibits or regulates any type of private or commercial bribery. There is a way for prosecutors to try people for bribery by using existing laws. Section 1346 of Title 18 can be used by prosecutors, to try people for \u2018a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right to honest services,\u2019 under the mail and wire fraud statutes. [https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-anti-bribery-and-anti-corruption-review-edition-6/1151869/united-states] Prosecutors have always successfully prosecuted private company employees for breaching a fiduciary duty and taking bribes, under Honest services fraud.\n\nThere are also cases of successful prosecution of bribery in the case of international business. The DOJ has used the Travel Act, 18 USC Section 1952 to prosecute bribery. Under the Travel Act, it is against the law, domestically and internationally, to utilize\u2018the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce\u2019 with intent to \u2018promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment or carrying on, of any unlawful activity\u2019.

It has two coastlines: a 30-km stretch on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the [[Gulf of Taranto]] between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the \"instep\" of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the \"toe\" and Apulia the \"heel\". \n\nThe region covers about {{convert|10,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. In 2010 the population was slightly under 600,000. The regional capital is [[Potenza]]. The region is divided into two provinces: [[Province of Potenza|Potenza]] and [[Province of Matera|Matera]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it//enciclopedia/basilicata|title=Basilicata nell'Enciclopedia Treccani|website=www.treccani.it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it//vocabolario/lucano|title=lucano in Vocabolario \u2013 Treccani|website=www.treccani.it}}</ref>\n\nBasilicata is an emerging tourist destination, thanks in particular to the [[Matera|city of Matera]], whose historical quarter ''[[Sassi di Matera|I Sassi]]'' was designated in 1993 as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/670|title=The Sassi and the Park of the Rupestrian Churches of Matera|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> In 2019 it was designated as the [[European Capital of Culture]] for that year.

Others argue that the name may refer to the Basilica of Acerenza, which held judicial power in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nDuring the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Ages, Basilicata was known as [[Lucania]]. This was possibly derived from \"''leukos\"'' (Greek: \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"white\", from \"''lykos''\" (Greek: \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"[[wolf]]\", or from Latin word \"''lucus''\", meaning \"[[Sacred grove|sacred wood]]\".\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Basilicata . Paesaggio presso Craco, Matera.jpg|thumb|Landscape near [[Craco]], Matera]]\n[[File:Monte Vulture 2.jpg|thumb|A view of the [[Vulture (region)|Vulture]] region]]\nBasilicata covers an extensive part of the southern [[Apennine Mountains]], between the [[Ofanto]] river in the north and the [[Pollino]] massif in the south. It is bordered on the east by a large part of the [[Bradano]] river depression, which is traversed by numerous streams and declines to the southeastern coastal plains on the [[Ionian Sea]]. The region also has a short coastline to the southwest on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] side of the peninsula.\n\nBasilicata is the most mountainous region in the south of [[Italy]], with 47% of its area of {{convert|9,992|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} covered by mountains. Of the remaining area, 45% is hilly, and 8% is made up of plains. Notable mountains and ranges include the [[Pollino]] massif, the [[Dolomiti lucane]], [[Monte Vulture]], [[Monte Alpi]], [[Monte Carmine]], [[Monti Li Foj]] and [[Toppa Pizzuta]].\n\nGeological features of the region include the volcanic formations of [[Monte Vulture]], and the seismic faults in the [[Melfi]] and [[Potenza]] areas in the north, and around Pollino in the south. Much of the region was devastated in the [[1857 Basilicata earthquake]]. More recently, the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]] destroyed many towns in the northwest of the region.\n\nThe mountainous terrain combined with weak rock and soil types makes [[landslide]]s prevalent. The lithological structure of the substratum and its chaotic tectonic deformation predispose the slope to landslides, and this problem is compounded by the lack of forested land. In common with many another Mediterranean region, Basilicata was once rich in forests, but they were largely felled and made barren during the time of Roman rule.\n\nThe variable climate is influenced by three coastlines ([[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], Ionian and Tyrrhenian) and the complexity of the region's physical features. In general, the climate is continental in the mountains and Mediterranean along the coasts.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Basilicata}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n[[File:Venosa Notarchirico.jpg|thumb|[[Venosa]], fossil elephant skeleton]]\nThe first traces of human presence in Basilicata date to the late [[Paleolithic]], with findings of ''[[Homo erectus]]''. Late [[Cenozoic]] fossils, found at [[Venosa]] and other locations, include elephants, rhinoceros and species now extinct such as a [[saber-toothed cat]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Machairodus]]''. Examples of [[rock art]] from the [[Mesolithic]] have been discovered near [[Filiano]]. From the fifth millennium, people stopped living in caves and built settlements of huts up to the rivers leading to the interior ([[Tolve]], [[Tricarico]], [[Aliano]], [[Melfi]], [[Metaponto]]). In this period, [[Homo sapiens#Anatomical modernity|anatomically modern humans]] lived by cultivating cereals and animal husbandry ([[Bovinae]] and [[Caprinae]]). [[Chalcolithic]] sites include the grottoes of [[Latronico]] and the funerary findings of the Cervaro grotto near [[Lagonegro]].\n\nThe first known stable market center of the [[Apennine culture]] on the sea, consisting of huts on the promontory of {{ill|Capo la Timpa|it|Area archeologica di Capo la Timpa|vertical-align=sup}}, near to [[Maratea]], dates to the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe first indigenous [[Iron Age]] communities lived in large villages in plateaus located at the borders of the plains and the rivers, in places fitting their breeding and agricultural activities. Such settlements include that of [[Anglona]], located between the fertile valleys of [[Agri (river)|Agri]] and [[Sinni (river)|Sinni]], of [[Siris (Magna Graecia)|Siris]] and, on the coast of the [[Ionian Sea]], of Incoronata-San Teodoro. The first presence of Greek colonists, coming from [[list of islands of Greece|the Greek islands]] and [[Anatolia]], date from the late eighth century BC.\n\nThere are virtually no traces of survival of the 11th\u20138th century BC archaeological sites of the settlements (aside from a necropolis at [[Castelluccio culture|Castelluccio]] on the coast of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]): this was perhaps caused by the increasing presence of Greek colonies, which changed the balance of the trades.\n\n===Ancient history===\n[[File:Metapontum 2013.JPG|thumb|left|[[Metaponto]], the Temple of Hera]]\nIn ancient historical times the region was originally known as [[Lucania]], named for the [[Lucanians|Lucani]], an [[Oscan language|Oscan-speaking]] population from [[central Italy]]. Their name might be derived from Greek ''leukos'' meaning \"white\", ''lykos'' (\"[[Wolf|gray wolf]]\"), or Latin ''lucus'' (\"[[sacred grove]]\"). Or more probably [[Lucania]], as much as the [[Lucius]] forename (''[[praenomen]]'') derives from the [[Latin]] word ''Lux'' (gen. ''lucis''), meaning \"[[light]]\" (<[[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*leuk-'' \"brightness\", Latin verb ''lucere'' \"to shine\"), and is a [[cognate]] of name [[Lucas (given name)|Lucas]]. Another etymology proposed is a derivation from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Lauchum'' (or ''Lauchme'') meaning \"[[king]]\", which however was transferred into Latin as ''Lucumo''.<ref>Bonfante G., Bonfante L, ''The Etruscan Language: An Introduction'', 1983, p. 59.</ref>\n\nStarting from the late eighth century BC, the Greeks established a settlement first at [[Siris (Magna Graecia)|Siris]], founded by fugitives from [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]. Then with the foundation of [[Metaponto]] from [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] colonists, they started the conquest of the whole Ionian coast. There were also indigenous [[Oenotrians|Oenotrian]] foundations on the coast, which exploited the nearby presence of Greek settlements, such as [[Velia]] and [[Policastro Bussentino|Pyxous]], for their maritime trades.\n\n[[File:Castello di melfi1.JPG|thumb|The [[Castle of Melfi]]]]\nThe first contacts between the Lucanians and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] date from the latter half of the fourth century BC. After the conquest of [[Taranto]] in 272, Roman rule was extended to the whole region: the [[Appian Way]] reached [[Brindisi]] and the colonies of Potentia (modern [[Potenza]]) and [[Grumentum]] were founded.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476, Basilicata fell to Germanic rule, which ended in the mid-6th century when the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|reconquered it]] from the [[Ostrogoths]] between 536 and 552 during the apocalyptic Byzantine-Gothic war under the leadership of Byzantine generals Belisarius and Narses. The region, deeply Christianized since as early as the 5th century, became part of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Duchy of Benevento]] founded by the invading Lombards between 571 and 590. In the following centuries, [[Saracen]] raids led part of the population to move from the plain and coastal settlements to more protected centers located on hills. The towns of [[Tricarico]] and [[Tursi]] were under Muslim rule for a short period: later the \"Saracen\" population would be expelled.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Societ\u00e0 napoletana di storia patria|title=Archivio storico per le province napoletane|url=https://archive.org/details/archiviostoricop25rdepuoft|year=1876}}</ref> The region was conquered once more for Byzantium from the Saracens and the Lombards in the late 9th century, with the campaigns of [[Nikephoros Phokas the Elder]] and his successors, and became part of the theme of [[Longobardia]]. In 968 the ''[[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]'' of [[Lucania]] was established, with the capital at Tursikon (Tursi). In 1059, Basilicata, together with the rest of much of [[southern Italy]], was conquered by the [[Italo-Normans]]. Later, it was inherited by the [[Hohenstaufen]], who were ousted in the 13th century by the [[Capetian House of Anjou]].\n\n===Modern and contemporary ages===\n[[File:Matera0009.jpg|thumb|The [[Sassi di Matera]]]]\nIn 1485, Basilicata was the seat of plotters against King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]], the so-called \"Conspiracy of the Barons\", which included the [[Sanseverino]] of Tricarico, the [[Caracciolo]] of [[Melfi]], the Gesualdo of [[Caggiano]], the {{ill|Orsini Del Balzo|it|vertical-align=sup}} of [[Altamura]] and [[Venosa]] and other anti-Aragonese families. Later, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] stripped most of the barons of their lands, replacing them with the [[House of Carafa|Carafa]], Revertera, [[Pignatelli]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] among others. After the formation of the [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)]], Basilicata also rebelled, but the revolt was suppressed. In 1663 a new province was created in Basilicata with its capital in [[Matera]].\n\nThe region became part of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in 1735. Basilicata autonomously declared its annexation to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on August 18, 1860 with the Potenza insurrection. It was during this period that the State confiscated and sold off vast tracts of Basilicata's territory formerly owned by the [[Catholic Church]]. As the new owners were a handful of wealthy aristocratic families, the average citizen did not see any immediate economic and social improvements after unification, and poverty continued unabated. This gave rise to the phenomenon of [[Brigandage in Southern Italy after 1861]], whereby the Church encouraged the local people to rise up against the nobility and the new Italian state. This strong opposition movement continued for many years. [[Carmine Crocco]] from [[Rionero in Vulture]] was the most important chief in the region and the most impressive leader in southern Italy.<ref>Eric Hobsbawm, ''Bandits'', Penguin, 1985, p. 25.</ref>\n\nIt was only really after [[World War II]] that things slowly began to improve thanks to land reform. In 1952, the inhabitants of the [[Sassi di Matera]] were rehoused by the State, but many of Basilicata's population had emigrated or were in the process of emigrating, which led to a demographic crisis from which it is still recovering.\n\nIn 1993, [[UNESCO]] declared the [[Sassi di Matera]] a [[World Heritage Site]]. Meanwhile, [[Fiat Automobiles]] established a huge factory in [[Melfi]], leading to jobs and an upsurge in the economy. In the same year the [[Pollino National Park]] was established.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Sata Melfi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fiat Automobiles|FIAT]] plant in [[Melfi]]]]\nCultivation consists mainly of sowables (especially wheat), which represent 46% of the total land.

In 1881, there were 539,258 inhabitants but by 1911 the population had decreased by 11% to 485,911, mainly as a result of emigration overseas. There was a slow increase in the population until World War II, after which there was a resurgence of emigration to other countries in Europe, which continued until 1971 and the start of another period of steady increase until 1993 (611,000 inhabitants). However, in recent years the population has decreased as a result of a new wave of migration, both towards northern Italy and to other countries in Europe, and a reduction in the birth rate.<ref name=\"circa.europa\">{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf5_pop.htm|title=Eurostat|publisher=Circa.europa.eu|date=|accessdate=26 July 2013|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303164608/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itf5_pop.htm|archivedate=3 March 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe population density is very low compared to that of Italy as a whole: 59.1 inhabitants per km\u00b2 compared to 200.4 nationwide in 2010.

It has two coastlines: a 30-km stretch on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] between Campania and Calabria, and a longer coastline along the [[Gulf of Taranto]] between Calabria and Apulia. The region can be thought of as the \"instep\" of Italy, with Calabria functioning as the \"toe\" and Apulia the \"heel\". \n\nThe region covers about {{convert|10,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. In 2010 the population was slightly under 600,000. The regional capital is [[Potenza]]. The region is divided into two provinces: [[Province of Potenza|Potenza]] and [[Province of Matera|Matera]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it//enciclopedia/basilicata|title=Basilicata nell'Enciclopedia Treccani|website=www.treccani.it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it//vocabolario/lucano|title=lucano in Vocabolario - Treccani|website=www.treccani.it}}</ref>\n\nBasilicata is an emerging tourist destination, thanks in particular to the [[Matera|city of Matera]], whose historical quarter ''[[Sassi di Matera|I Sassi]]'' was designated in 1993 as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/670|title=The Sassi and the Park of the Rupestrian Churches of Matera|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> In 2019 it was designated as the [[European Capital of Culture]] for that year. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ranked Basilicata third in its list of \"52 Places to Go in 2018\", describing it as \"Italy\u2019s best-kept secret\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/travel/places-to-visit.html|title=52 Places to Go in 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2018-01-10|access-date=21 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name probably derives from \"''[[Basileus|basilikos]]''\" ({{lang-el|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}}), which refers to the ''[[basileus]]'', the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]], who [[Catepanate of Italy|ruled the region]] for 200 years, from 536/552 to 571/590 and from 879 to 1059. Others argue that the name may refer to the Basilica of Acerenza, which held judicial power in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nDuring the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Ages, Basilicata was known as [[Lucania]]. This was possibly derived from \"''leukos\"'' (Greek: \u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"white\", from \"''lykos''\" (Greek: \u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"[[wolf]]\", or from Latin word \"''lucus''\", meaning \"[[Sacred grove|sacred wood]]\".\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Basilicata . Paesaggio presso Craco, Matera.jpg|thumb|Landscape near [[Craco]], Matera]]\n[[File:Monte Vulture 2.jpg|thumb|A view of the [[Vulture (region)|Vulture]] region]]\nBasilicata covers an extensive part of the southern [[Apennine Mountains]], between the [[Ofanto]] river in the north and the [[Pollino]] massif in the south. It is bordered on the east by a large part of the [[Bradano]] river depression, which is traversed by numerous streams and declines to the southeastern coastal plains on the [[Ionian Sea]]. The region also has a short coastline to the southwest on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] side of the peninsula.\n\nBasilicata is the most mountainous region in the south of [[Italy]], with 47% of its area of {{convert|9,992|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} covered by mountains. Of the remaining area, 45% is hilly, and 8% is made up of plains. Notable mountains and ranges include the [[Pollino]] massif, the [[Dolomiti lucane]], [[Monte Vulture]], [[Monte Alpi]], [[Monte Carmine]], [[Monti Li Foj]] and [[Toppa Pizzuta]].\n\nGeological features of the region include the volcanic formations of [[Monte Vulture]], and the seismic faults in the [[Melfi]] and [[Potenza]] areas in the north, and around Pollino in the south. Much of the region was devastated in the [[1857 Basilicata earthquake]]. More recently, the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]] destroyed many towns in the northwest of the region.\n\nThe mountainous terrain combined with weak rock and soil types makes [[landslide]]s prevalent. The lithological structure of the substratum and its chaotic tectonic deformation predispose the slope to landslides, and this problem is compounded by the lack of forested land. In common with many another Mediterranean region, Basilicata was once rich in forests, but they were largely felled and made barren during the time of Roman rule.\n\nThe variable climate is influenced by three coastlines ([[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], Ionian and Tyrrhenian) and the complexity of the region's physical features. In general, the climate is continental in the mountains and Mediterranean along the coasts.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Basilicata}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n[[File:Venosa Notarchirico.jpg|thumb|[[Venosa]], fossil elephant skeleton]]\nThe first traces of human presence in Basilicata date to the late [[Paleolithic]], with findings of ''[[Homo erectus]]''. Late [[Cenozoic]] fossils, found at [[Venosa]] and other locations, include elephants, rhinoceros and species now extinct such as a [[saber-toothed cat]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Machairodus]]''. Examples of [[rock art]] from the [[Mesolithic]] have been discovered near [[Filiano]]. From the fifth millennium, people stopped living in caves and built settlements of huts up to the rivers leading to the interior ([[Tolve]], [[Tricarico]], [[Aliano]], [[Melfi]], [[Metaponto]]). In this period, [[Homo sapiens#Anatomical modernity|anatomically modern humans]] lived by cultivating cereals and animal husbandry ([[Bovinae]] and [[Caprinae]]). [[Chalcolithic]] sites include the grottoes of [[Latronico]] and the funerary findings of the Cervaro grotto near [[Lagonegro]].\n\nThe first known stable market center of the [[Apennine culture]] on the sea, consisting of huts on the promontory of {{ill|Capo la Timpa|it|Area archeologica di Capo la Timpa|vertical-align=sup}}, near to [[Maratea]], dates to the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe first indigenous [[Iron Age]] communities lived in large villages in plateaus located at the borders of the plains and the rivers, in places fitting their breeding and agricultural activities. Such settlements include that of [[Anglona]], located between the fertile valleys of [[Agri (river)|Agri]] and [[Sinni (river)|Sinni]], of [[Siris (Magna Graecia)|Siris]] and, on the coast of the [[Ionian Sea]], of Incoronata-San Teodoro. The first presence of Greek colonists, coming from [[list of islands of Greece|the Greek islands]] and [[Anatolia]], date from the late eighth century BC.\n\nThere are virtually no traces of survival of the 11th-8th century BC archaeological sites of the settlements (aside from a necropolis at [[Castelluccio culture|Castelluccio]] on the coast of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]): this was perhaps caused by the increasing presence of Greek colonies, which changed the balance of the trades.\n\n===Ancient history===\n[[File:Metapontum 2013.JPG|thumb|left|[[Metaponto]], the Temple of Hera]]\nIn ancient historical times the region was originally known as [[Lucania]], named for the [[Lucanians|Lucani]], an [[Oscan language|Oscan-speaking]] population from [[central Italy]]. Their name might be derived from Greek ''leukos'' meaning \"white\", ''lykos'' (\"[[Wolf|gray wolf]]\"), or Latin ''lucus'' (\"[[sacred grove]]\"). Or more probably [[Lucania]], as much as the [[Lucius]] forename (''[[praenomen]]'') derives from the [[Latin]] word ''Lux'' (gen. ''lucis''), meaning \"[[light]]\" (<[[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''*leuk-'' \"brightness\", Latin verb ''lucere'' \"to shine\"), and is a [[cognate]] of name [[Lucas (given name)|Lucas]]. Another etymology proposed is a derivation from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] ''Lauchum'' (or ''Lauchme'') meaning \"[[king]]\", which however was transferred into Latin as ''Lucumo''.<ref>Bonfante G., Bonfante L, ''The Etruscan Language: An Introduction'', 1983, p. 59.</ref>\n\nStarting from the late eighth century BC, the Greeks established a settlement first at [[Siris (Magna Graecia)|Siris]], founded by fugitives from [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]]. Then with the foundation of [[Metaponto]] from [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] colonists, they started the conquest of the whole Ionian coast. There were also indigenous [[Oenotrians|Oenotrian]] foundations on the coast, which exploited the nearby presence of Greek settlements, such as [[Velia]] and [[Policastro Bussentino|Pyxous]], for their maritime trades.\n\n[[File:Castello di melfi1.JPG|thumb|The [[Castle of Melfi]]]]\nThe first contacts between the Lucanians and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] date from the latter half of the fourth century BC. After the conquest of [[Taranto]] in 272, Roman rule was extended to the whole region: the [[Appian Way]] reached [[Brindisi]] and the colonies of Potentia (modern [[Potenza]]) and [[Grumentum]] were founded.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nAfter the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476, Basilicata fell to Germanic rule, which ended in the mid-6th century when the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|reconquered it]] from the [[Ostrogoths]] between 536 and 552 during the apocalyptic Byzantine-Gothic war under the leadership of Byzantine generals Belisarius and Narses. The region, deeply Christianized since as early as the 5th century, became part of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Duchy of Benevento]] founded by the invading Lombards between 571 and 590. In the following centuries, [[Saracen]] raids led part of the population to move from the plain and coastal settlements to more protected centers located on hills. The towns of [[Tricarico]] and [[Tursi]] were under Muslim rule for a short period: later the \"Saracen\" population would be expelled.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Societ\u00e0 napoletana di storia patria|title=Archivio storico per le province napoletane|url=https://archive.org/details/archiviostoricop25rdepuoft|year=1876}}</ref> The region was conquered once more for Byzantium from the Saracens and the Lombards in the late 9th century, with the campaigns of [[Nikephoros Phokas the Elder]] and his successors, and became part of the theme of [[Longobardia]]. In 968 the ''[[theme (Byzantine district)|theme]]'' of [[Lucania]] was established, with the capital at Tursikon (Tursi). In 1059, Basilicata, together with the rest of much of [[southern Italy]], was conquered by the [[Italo-Normans]]. Later, it was inherited by the [[Hohenstaufen]], who were ousted in the 13th century by the [[Capetian House of Anjou]].\n\n===Modern and contemporary ages===\n[[File:Matera0009.jpg|thumb|The [[Sassi di Matera]]]]\nIn 1485, Basilicata was the seat of plotters against King [[Ferdinand I of Naples]], the so-called \"Conspiracy of the Barons\", which included the [[Sanseverino]] of Tricarico, the [[Caracciolo]] of [[Melfi]], the Gesualdo of [[Caggiano]], the {{ill|Orsini Del Balzo|it|vertical-align=sup}} of [[Altamura]] and [[Venosa]] and other anti-Aragonese families. Later, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] stripped most of the barons of their lands, replacing them with the [[House of Carafa|Carafa]], Revertera, [[Pignatelli]] and [[Colonna family|Colonna]] among others. After the formation of the [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)]], Basilicata also rebelled, but the revolt was suppressed. In 1663 a new province was created in Basilicata with its capital in [[Matera]].\n\nThe region became part of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in 1735. Basilicata autonomously declared its annexation to the [[Kingdom of Italy]] on August 18, 1860 with the Potenza insurrection. It was during this period that the State confiscated and sold off vast tracts of Basilicata's territory formerly owned by the [[Catholic Church]]. As the new owners were a handful of wealthy aristocratic families, the average citizen did not see any immediate economic and social improvements after unification, and poverty continued unabated. This gave rise to the phenomenon of [[Brigandage in Southern Italy after 1861]], whereby the Church encouraged the local people to rise up against the nobility and the new Italian state. This strong opposition movement continued for many years. [[Carmine Crocco]] from [[Rionero in Vulture]] was the most important chief in the region and the most impressive leader in southern Italy.<ref>Eric Hobsbawm, ''Bandits'', Penguin, 1985, p. 25.</ref>\n\nIt was only really after [[World War II]] that things slowly began to improve thanks to land reform. In 1952, the inhabitants of the [[Sassi di Matera]] were rehoused by the State, but many of Basilicata's population had emigrated or were in the process of emigrating, which led to a demographic crisis from which it is still recovering.\n\nIn 1993, [[UNESCO]] declared the [[Sassi di Matera]] a [[World Heritage Site]]. Meanwhile, [[Fiat Automobiles]] established a huge factory in [[Melfi]], leading to jobs and an upsurge in the economy. In the same year the [[Pollino National Park]] was established.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Sata Melfi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fiat Automobiles|FIAT]] plant in [[Melfi]]]]\nCultivation consists mainly of sowables (especially wheat), which represent 46% of the total land.

At that time he adopted the doctrines of the sifatiyya, those of Ahlu-s-Sunnah. He left Basra and came to Baghdad, taking fiqh from the Shafi`i jurist Abu Ishaq al-Marwazi (d. 340). He devoted the next twenty-four years to the refutation of \"the Mu`tazila, the Rafida, the Jahmiyya, the Khawarij, and the rest of the various kinds of innovators\" in the words of al-Khatib. His student Bundar related that his yearly expenditure was a meagre seventeen dirhams. His three best-known disciples were al-B\u0101hil\u012b, a\u1e63-\u1e62u\u02bfl\u016bk\u012b, and Ibn Muj\u0101hid, all of whom transmitted the doctrines of their master to what later became the flourishing school of Khor\u0101s\u0101n.

[[Muhammad]] told him that he had not commanded him to forsake [[Kalam]], he had only told him to support the traditions narrated from him ([[Muhammad]]).

At that time he adopted the doctrines of the sifatiyya, those of Ahlu-s-Sunnah. He left Basra and came to Baghdad, taking fiqh from the Shafi`i jurist Abu Ishaq al-Marwazi (d. 340). He devoted the next twenty-four years to the refutation of \"the Mu`tazila, the Rafida, the Jahmiyya, the Khawarij, and the rest of the various kinds of innovators\" in the words of al-Khatib. His student Bundar related that his yearly expenditure was a meagre seventeen dirhams. His three best-known disciples were al-B\u0101hil\u012b, a\u1e63-\u1e62u\u02bfl\u016bk\u012b, and Ibn Muj\u0101hid, all of whom transmitted the doctrines of their master to what later became the flourishing school of Khor\u0101s\u0101n. After al-Ash\u02bfar\u012b died, his disciples slowly disentangled the main lines of doctrine that eventually became the stamp of the Ash\u02bfarite school.\n\nAl-Ash'ari saw [[Muhammad]] in a dream 3 times in Ramadan.

The start of the 21st century saw Greece become one of the most successful countries in the contest, with ten top-ten results between 2001 and 2013, including third-place finishes for [[Antique (duo)|Antique]] in {{escyr|2001}} (with 2005 winner Paparizou as lead singer), [[Sakis Rouvas]] in {{escyr|2004}} and [[Kalomira]] in {{escyr|2008}}.\n\nIn the last six contests (2014\u201319), Greece has not reached the top ten, including twice failing to qualify from the semi-final to the grand final ({{escyr|2016}}, {{escyr|2018}}).\n\n==History==\nBefore Greece as a country participated in the contest, singers from Greece have represented other countries. These singers were [[Jimmy Makulis]] ({{escyr|1961}}) for [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austria]], [[Yovanna]] ({{escyr|1965}}) for [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Switzerland]], and [[Nana Mouskouri]] ({{escyr|1963}}) and [[Vicky Leandros]] ({{escyr|1967}} and {{escyr|1972}}) for [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourg]].\n\nAfter debuting in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 contest]], Greece did not participate in {{escyr|1975}} for \"unknown reasons\" according to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]], but it was later discovered that it was in protest of Turkey's debut and its [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogaegreece.com/node/150|title=EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 1975|publisher=OGAE Greece|language=Greek|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Raycoff|first=Ivan|author2=Robert Deayom Tobin|title=A Song for Europe|date=July 2007|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 978-0-7546-5878-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+song+for+europe&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U0r2r9IklIU3MfJf6wIZOWTlbgE4A#PPR18,M1|location=[[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]}}</ref>\nGreece was disqualified from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982]] after it was revealed that Themis Adamantidis was to sing \"Sarantapente Kopelies\" (\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 \u039a\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2), a previously released song.

The following year, ERT announced that it would not return at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]] due to financial reasons.\n\nThirty-one years after its debut, Greece won for the first time in 2005 with [[Elena Paparizou]] singing \"[[My Number One]]\", which at the time tied for the record for the most number of ''twelve points'' allocated to a song (ten in total) along with [[Katrina and the Waves]]' [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] \"[[Love Shine A Light]]\". The song also made Greece the first country not a member of [[Big Four (Eurovision)|Big Four]] to win the contest without going through a semifinal. After Eurovision, the song topped the charts in Greece, [[Cyprus]] as well as [[Sweden]] and entered the top ten in [[Romania]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]], [[Belgium]], as well as the [[United States|American]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] Chart. In 2005, Eurovision held a commemorative program, [[Congratulations (Eurovision)|Congratulations]], to celebrate 50 years of the contest, in which \"My Number One\" came fourth in a vote for the show's most popular entry, behind \"[[Hold Me Now (Johnny Logan song)|Hold Me Now]]\" (1987), \"[[Nel blu dipinto di blu]]\" (1958) and [[ABBA]]'s \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" (1974).\n\nBefore Greece's win, the highest score was third place, achieved by duo [[Antique (duo)|Antique]] (of which Elena Paparizou was a member) in 2001 with \"[[Die for You (Antique song)|Die for You]]\" and then again by [[Sakis Rouvas]] in 2004 with \"[[Shake It (Sakis Rouvas song)|Shake It]]\". Greece's least successful result was at 16th place in the 2016 semi-final with the song \"[[Utopian Land]]\" by [[Argo (band)|Argo]], with 44 points.\n\nIn 2006, the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|51st Eurovision Song Contest]] was held in [[Athens]], i\u03bd  the O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall, Greece, following Elena Paparizou's victory the previous year. The two hosts were popular singer, and former contestant, [[Sakis Rouvas]] and [[Greek American]] presenter [[Maria Menounos]]. The singer representing Greece in their own country was popular [[Greek Cypriot]] artist [[Anna Vissi]].\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, ERT had selected high-profile artists internally and set up national finals to choose the song, while in [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]] and [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] it held a televised national final to choose both the song and performer. For the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, ERT was able to secure a high-profile artist once again and planned a national final to choose the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ert.gr/en/c/7/406752.asp|title=\u039f \u03a3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a1\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 EUROVISION|publisher=[[Ellinik\u00ed Radiofon\u00eda Tile\u00f3rasi|ERT]] |date=2008-07-16 |accessdate=2008-07-16|author=ERT Staff|language=Greek}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The song voted by the public was \"[[This Is Our Night]]\", another song performed by Sakis Rouvas on the show.\n\nGreece has been one of the most successful countries in the Eurovision Song Contest in the 21st century, ten times finishing in the top-ten,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7376968.stm |title=Eurovision vote 2008: Top 10|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-05-25|author=Osborn, Michael|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> including ninth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], seventh in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]], third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], seventh in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], eighth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] and seventh in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]]. After [[Eleftheria Eleftheriou]] placed 17th in {{escyr|2012}} with her song \"[[Aphrodisiac (song)|Aphrodisiac]]\", Greece achieved its 10th top-ten result of the century and 18th in total in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013|2013]], finishing sixth with the song \"Alcohol is Free\". In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]], Greece finished in 20th place, which, along with 1998, were the country's worst result in the contest at that time. Greece was one of only three countries (along with Romania and Russia) to have never failed to qualify from the semifinals since their 2004 introduction (2004\u201315). In addition, Greece also qualified from the 1996 audio-only pre-qualifying round. In {{escyr|2015}}, Greece failed to reach the top-ten for the third time in four years, finishing 19th.\n\nFrom 2013 through 2015, the music channel [[MAD TV (Greece)|MAD]] produced the Greek national final.\n\nFor 2016, ERT selected the Eurovision entry internally. They selected the band Argo with the song \"Utopian Land\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2016/03/10/greece-argo-release-eurovision-song-utopian-land/116162/|title=Greece: Argo release Eurovision song \"Utopian Land\"|last=Vasileiadis|first=George|website=Eurovision 2016 Predictions, Polls, Odds, Rankings {{!}} wiwibloggs|access-date=2016-03-27}}</ref> For the first time since the semi-finals were introduced in 2004, Greece failed to qualify for the final. They finished 16th in the first semi-final.\n\nIn 2017, ERT selected the composer [[Dimitris Kontopoulos]] and the choreographer [[Fokas Evangelinos]] internally. They chose [[Demy (singer)|Demy]] for representing Greece in Kiev. ERT agreed, and on the 6 March 2017, Greece chose their song via a national final. Three songs were competed: \"Angels\", \"[[This Is Love (Demy song)|This Is Love]]\" and \"When The Morning Comes Around\". The final result was combined by 70% from televoting and by 30% from international juries from nine countries. Finally, \"[[This Is Love (Demy song)|This Is Love]]\" gained 70% and won the national final. At Eurovision, she qualified for the Grand Final, where she finished in 19th place with 77 points.\n\n== Voting ==\n{{Quote box |width=50% |align=right |quote= \"Cyprus and Greece are commonly accused of favouring each other and of all the countries, statistics suggest they are the most likely to vote for each other.

They just don't care.'&nbsp;\"|source= Ruth Alexander, \"The maths of Eurovision voting\", ''[[BBC News]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7408216.stm|work=[[BBC News]] |date=2008-05-19 |title=The maths of Eurovision voting|author=Alexander, Ruth|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref>}}\n\nGreece is famous for, especially in recent years, always giving twelve points to [[Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest|Cyprus]] and always receiving twelve points from Cyprus. This is one of many examples of the bloc voting seen in contest which also occurs between [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]], [[Balkan]], [[Scandinavia]]n, ex-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Baltic states|Baltic]] countries. In the case of Greece and Cyprus, the exchange of twelve points is probably because the majority of Cypriot citizens are Greeks thus sharing linguistic ties (speaking [[Greek (language)|Greek]]) and musical taste. Furthermore, Greece and Cyprus share the same music industry. This was not always the case, as until 1997 (and, for Greece and Cyprus, 1998), all the votes were given by juries, who may be less biased by diaspora or neighbourly influence than televoters. While Greece and Cyprus did exchange top marks a few times (1987, 1994, and 1997 all saw an exchange of twelves), there were also several years where one or the other didn't receive the twelve. In 1983, only the second time Greece and Cyprus competed together, Greece awarded the Cypriot entry no points for the first and only time (the only occasion in which one of the two didn't vote for the other when they had the ability to). However, between 1997 and 2013 (excepting the contests from 1999-2000, which Greece didn't compete in, and 2001, which Cyprus didn't compete in), the two countries always gave each other twelve points if presented the opportunity.\nDue to the controversies caused by political voting, two semi-finals were introduced for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 Contest]] in which Cyprus and Greece were unable to vote for each other in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7400508.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Sweden tipped to win Eurovision|date=2008-05-20|author=Osborn, Michael|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> In the build-up to the 2008 contest, however, the artists representing Greece and Cyprus jointly held a successful warm-up party at the [[Eurovision Song Contest#Parties and Euroclub|Euroclub]], attended by 17 other delegations from the contest and 1500 guests attracted by the promised \"confluence of the Greek-Cypriot sound\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/11553|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519185537/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/11553|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-19|title=Greece-Cyprus party hugely successful|author=Floras, Stella|date=2008-05-17|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> However, for the first time since 1990, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] Greece and Cyprus did not give each other 12 points, with Greece giving [[Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest|Cyprus]] 10 points and [[Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest|Cyprus]] giving Greece only 8 points, and curiously both countries gave the maximum to Italy. It was also the first time since 1996 that one of the two hadn't given the other twelve (with the exceptions of 1985 and 1990, one of the two countries gave the other twelve points every year).\n{{clear}}\n\n== Popularity of the contest ==\nUntil 2001, Greece was seen as one of the least successful countries in the contest,{{by whom|date=November 2019}} and therefore the interest of Greek people in the contest was relatively low. Since [[Antique (band)|Antique's]] third place in 2001, the contest has grown into one of the most popular events in Greece with an estimated five million viewers each year.  The high expectations of the Greek public has led to seeing the contest as a \"national affair\" of very big importance, and this has caused controversy. The Greek viewers expect their singers to qualify from the semi-final to the final and place inside the Top 10, except from one 17th place: in 2012 for the first time since the introduction of the semifinals failed to place in the Top 10 in Baku. In 2013 Greece was again in top 10 finishing 6th. They are the second most successful country, behind [[Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Russia]], in the contest between 2000 and 2009, with one win and three third places. Since 2014 their performance has declined, having failed to finish in the top 10 six consecutive years. In 2016, Greece failed to qualify for the first time since the introduction of the semifinals in 2004 with the group [[Argo]], breaking their qualification record. This was the first year Greece was absent from the final since 2000. Greece failed to qualify for the final again in 2018.\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following table lists the forty entries which have competed for Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n{|

The start of the 21st century saw Greece become one of the most successful countries in the contest, with ten top-ten results between 2001 and 2013, including third-place finishes for [[Antique (duo)|Antique]] in {{escyr|2001}} (with 2005 winner Paparizou as lead singer), [[Sakis Rouvas]] in {{escyr|2004}} and [[Kalomira]] in {{escyr|2008}}.\n\nIn the last six contests (2014\u201319), Greece has not reached the top ten, including twice failing to qualify from the semi-final to the grand final ({{escyr|2016}}, {{escyr|2018}}).\n\n==History==\nBefore Greece as a country participated in the contest, singers from Greece have represented other countries. These singers were [[Jimmy Makulis]] ({{escyr|1961}}) for [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austria]], [[Yovanna]] ({{escyr|1965}}) for [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Switzerland]], and [[Nana Mouskouri]] ({{escyr|1963}}) and [[Vicky Leandros]] ({{escyr|1967}} and {{escyr|1972}}) for [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourg]].\n\nAfter debuting in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 contest]], Greece did not participate in {{escyr|1975}} for \"unknown reasons\" according to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]], but it was later discovered that it was in protest of Turkey's debut and its [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogaegreece.com/node/150|title=EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 1975|publisher=OGAE Greece|language=Greek|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Raycoff|first=Ivan|author2=Robert Deayom Tobin|title=A Song for Europe|date=July 2007|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 978-0-7546-5878-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+song+for+europe&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U0r2r9IklIU3MfJf6wIZOWTlbgE4A#PPR18,M1|location=[[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]}}</ref>\nGreece was disqualified from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1982]] after it was revealed that Themis Adamantidis was to sing \"Sarantapente Kopelies\" (\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 \u039a\u03bf\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2), a previously released song.

The following year, ERT announced that it would not return at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000]] due to financial reasons.\n\nThirty-one years after its debut, Greece won for the first time in 2005 with [[Elena Paparizou]] singing \"[[My Number One]]\", which at the time tied for the record for the most number of ''twelve points'' allocated to a song (ten in total) along with [[Katrina and the Waves]]' [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] \"[[Love Shine A Light]]\". The song also made Greece the first country not a member of [[Big Four (Eurovision)|Big Four]] to win the contest without going through a semifinal. After Eurovision, the song topped the charts in Greece, [[Cyprus]] as well as [[Sweden]] and entered the top ten in [[Romania]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]], [[Belgium]], as well as the [[United States|American]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] Chart. In 2005, Eurovision held a commemorative program, [[Congratulations (Eurovision)|Congratulations]], to celebrate 50 years of the contest, in which \"My Number One\" came fourth in a vote for the show's most popular entry, behind \"[[Hold Me Now (Johnny Logan song)|Hold Me Now]]\" (1987), \"[[Nel blu dipinto di blu]]\" (1958) and [[ABBA]]'s \"[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]\" (1974).\n\nBefore Greece's win, the highest score was third place, achieved by duo [[Antique (duo)|Antique]] (of which Elena Paparizou was a member) in 2001 with \"[[Die for You (Antique song)|Die for You]]\" and then again by [[Sakis Rouvas]] in 2004 with \"[[Shake It (Sakis Rouvas song)|Shake It]]\". Greece's least successful result was at 16th place in the 2016 semi-final with the song \"[[Utopian Land]]\" by [[Argo (band)|Argo]], with 44 points.\n\nIn 2006, the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|51st Eurovision Song Contest]] was held in [[Athens]], i\u03bd  the O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall, Greece, following Elena Paparizou's victory the previous year. The two hosts were popular singer, and former contestant, [[Sakis Rouvas]] and [[Greek American]] presenter [[Maria Menounos]]. The singer representing Greece in their own country was popular [[Greek Cypriot]] artist [[Anna Vissi]].\n\nFrom 2004 to 2006, ERT had selected high-profile artists internally and set up national finals to choose the song, while in [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]] and [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] it held a televised national final to choose both the song and performer. For the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, ERT was able to secure a high-profile artist once again and planned a national final to choose the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.ert.gr/en/c/7/406752.asp|title=\u039f \u03a3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a1\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 EUROVISION|publisher=[[Ellinik\u00ed Radiofon\u00eda Tile\u00f3rasi|ERT]] |date=2008-07-16 |accessdate=2008-07-16|author=ERT Staff|language=Greek}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The song voted by the public was \"[[This Is Our Night]]\", another song performed by Sakis Rouvas on the show.\n\nGreece has been one of the most successful countries in the Eurovision Song Contest in the 21st century, ten times finishing in the top-ten,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7376968.stm |title=Eurovision vote 2008: Top 10|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2008-05-25|author=Osborn, Michael|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> including ninth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], seventh in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]], third in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], seventh in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], eighth in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] and seventh in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]].

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014]], Greece finished in 20th place, which, along with 1998, were the country's worst result in the contest at that time. Greece was one of only three countries (along with Romania and Russia) to have never failed to qualify from the semifinals since their 2004 introduction (2004\u201315). In addition, Greece also qualified from the 1996 audio-only pre-qualifying round.

They chose [[Demy (singer)|Demy]] for representing Greece in Kiev. ERT agreed, and on the 6 March 2017, Greece chose their song via a national final. Three songs were competed: \"Angels\", \"[[This Is Love (Demy song)|This Is Love]]\" and \"When The Morning Comes Around\". The final result was combined by 70% from televoting and by 30% from international juries from nine countries. Finally, \"[[This Is Love (Demy song)|This Is Love]]\" gained 70% and won the national final.

This is one of many examples of the bloc voting seen in contest which also occurs between [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]], [[Balkan]], [[Scandinavia]]n, ex-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Baltic states|Baltic]] countries. In the case of Greece and Cyprus, the exchange of twelve points is probably because the majority of Cypriot citizens are Greeks thus sharing linguistic ties (speaking [[Greek (language)|Greek]]) and musical taste. Furthermore, Greece and Cyprus share the same music industry. This was not always the case, as until 1997 (and, for Greece and Cyprus, 1998), all the votes were given by juries, who may be less biased by diaspora or neighbourly influence than televoters. While Greece and Cyprus did exchange top marks a few times (1987, 1994, and 1997 all saw an exchange of twelves), there were also several years where one or the other didn't receive the twelve. In 1983, only the second time Greece and Cyprus competed together, Greece awarded the Cypriot entry no points for the first and only time (the only occasion in which one of the two didn't vote for the other when they had the ability to). However, between 1997 and 2013 (excepting the contests from 1999-2000, which Greece didn't compete in, and 2001, which Cyprus didn't compete in), the two countries always gave each other twelve points if presented the opportunity.\nDue to the controversies caused by political voting, two semi-finals were introduced for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 Contest]] in which Cyprus and Greece were unable to vote for each other in the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7400508.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Sweden tipped to win Eurovision|date=2008-05-20|author=Osborn, Michael|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> In the build-up to the 2008 contest, however, the artists representing Greece and Cyprus jointly held a successful warm-up party at the [[Eurovision Song Contest#Parties and Euroclub|Euroclub]], attended by 17 other delegations from the contest and 1500 guests attracted by the promised \"confluence of the Greek-Cypriot sound\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/11553|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519185537/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/11553|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-19|title=Greece-Cyprus party hugely successful|author=Floras, Stella|date=2008-05-17|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-05-22}}</ref> However, for the first time since 1990, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] Greece and Cyprus did not give each other 12 points, with Greece giving [[Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest|Cyprus]] 10 points and [[Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest|Cyprus]] giving Greece only 8 points, and curiously both countries gave the maximum to Italy. It was also the first time since 1996 that one of the two hadn't given the other twelve (with the exceptions of 1985 and 1990, one of the two countries gave the other twelve points every year).\n{{clear}}\n\n== Popularity of the contest ==\nUntil 2001, Greece was seen as one of the least successful countries in the contest,{{by whom|date=November 2019}} and therefore the interest of Greek people in the contest was relatively low. Since [[Antique (band)|Antique's]] third place in 2001, the contest has grown into one of the most popular events in Greece with an estimated five million viewers each year.  The high expectations of the Greek public has led to seeing the contest as a \"national affair\" of very big importance, and this has caused controversy. The Greek viewers expect their singers to qualify from the semi-final to the final and place inside the Top 10, except from one 17th place: in 2012 for the first time since the introduction of the semifinals failed to place in the Top 10 in Baku. In 2013 Greece was again in top 10 finishing 6th. They are the second most successful country, behind [[Russia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Russia]], in the contest between 2000 and 2009, with one win and three third places. Since 2014 their performance has declined, having failed to finish in the top 10 six consecutive years. In 2016, Greece failed to qualify for the first time since the introduction of the semifinals in 2004 with the group [[Argo]], breaking their qualification record. This was the first year Greece was absent from the final since 2000. Greece failed to qualify for the final again in 2018.\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following table lists the forty entries which have competed for Greece in the Eurovision Song
