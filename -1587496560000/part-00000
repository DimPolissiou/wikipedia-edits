Churu, like an oasis, situated in the middle of the shifting golden sand dunes, opens the gate to the [[Thar Desert]].\n\nBefore India's independence in 1947, it was a part of [[Bikaner State]]. The district came into existence in 1948, comprising three [[Tehsils of India|tehsils]] - Churu, Rajgarh and Taranagar, when the administration of Bikaner State was reorganized. Now there are six tehsils, comprising Churu, Sadulpur, Ratangarh, Sujangarh, Sardarsahar and Taranagar.\n\n==Economy==\nAs about 8 [[Tehsil]]s lie in Churu district with more than 900 villages along with 248 panchayats and about 2 million population, the economy of the town and surrounding area is mainly based on animal husbandry and hand embroidery work done by women. Due to the climatic conditions, the scope of agriculture is very low in Churu. Many women here are engaged in hand embroidery.\n\nThe main source of income for the people living in rural areas of Churu is from dairy.\nChuru has a small market for a few agricultural produce of the area. The town has an Agricultural Produce Market Committee. The [[Food Corporation of India]] has its warehouses in Churu. The town is the main supply point for surrounding villages.\n\nThere is no medium or large size industry in the industrial area.

His daughter Adelaide married to Romano di Gentile [[Orsini (family)|Orsini]], who added the city to the family fiefs.\n\nThe county of [[Pitigliano]]-Sorano fought against the [[Republic of Siena]], but was forced to accept its suzerainty from 1417.

The fortress, due to its strategic position, was frequently attacked; it was also the seat of fratricidal fights between the Orsini.
