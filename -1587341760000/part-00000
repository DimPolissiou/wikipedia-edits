Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but otherwise did minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The system initially weakened while crossing the state and emerging into the Atlantic, but surface observations along the North Carolina coastline supported peak winds around 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) as the storm accelerated northeast; it is possible the cyclone possessed hurricane-force winds offshore.

On October&nbsp;8, a northward-moving tropical depression spawned from a tropical wave well east of the Lesser Antilles, eventually transitioning into an extratropical system on October&nbsp;14. The season's final tropical cyclone was a nearly stationary tropical depression that persisted in the central Caribbean Sea between October&nbsp;25\u201329.

Because technologies such as [[weather satellite|satellite monitoring]] were not available until the 1960s, historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As a result of a [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project|reanalysis project]] which analyzed the season in 2012, a tropical storm and a hurricane were added to [[HURDAT]]; the official intensities and tracks of storms were also revised. The year's first storm formed on July&nbsp;29 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the final system, a hurricane, dissipated over open ocean on October&nbsp;21.\n\nMost of the season's storms arose from the [[subtropics]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was a focus for storm activity; four storms reached the Canadian province as [[extratropical cyclone]]s. Two of these were the remnants of hurricanes; the [[#Hurricane Four|first]] inflicted $1.5&nbsp;million in damage on the apple crop in the [[Annapolis Valley]], and the [[#Hurricane Eight|second]] tore up four [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]] and sank or grounded several ships. A [[#Tropical Storm Ten|short-lived tropical storm in October]] caused the wettest 48-hour period in the history of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans, Louisiana]], with {{cvt|16.65|in|mm}} of rainfall, causing the city's most destructive flood since the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]]. A [[#Tropical Storm Seven|tropical storm]] striking parts of the [[United States Gulf Coast|U.S. Gulf Coast]] was blamed for the season's only two deaths, but otherwise did minor damage. The season's strongest storm was estimated to have produced [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 125&nbsp;mph (205&nbsp;km/h); it did not affect any landmasses, remaining over the more central longitudes of the Atlantic.\n\n==Systems==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2017 till:01/11/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/2017\n\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(\u226462_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:C1     value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h)\n  id:C2     value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46)  legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h)\n  id:C3     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h)\n  id:C4     value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13)  legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h)\n  id:C5     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:29/07/2017 till:01/08/2017 color:TS text:\"One (TS)\"\n  from:01/08/2017 till:04/08/2017 color:TD text:\"TD\"\n  from:02/08/2017 till:09/08/2017 color:TS text:\"Two (TS)\"\n  from:24/08/2017 till:02/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Three (TS)\"\n  from:09/09/2017 till:14/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Four (C2)\"\n  from:10/09/2017 till:12/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Five (TS)\"\n  from:13/09/2017 till:19/09/2017 color:C3 text:\"Six (C3)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:16/09/2017 till:21/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Seven (C1)\"\n  from:20/09/2017 till:26/09/2017 color:C2 text:\"Eight (C2)\"\n  from:26/09/2017 till:28/09/2017 color:TS text:\"Nine (TS)\"\n  from:02/10/2017 till:04/10/2017 color:TS text:\"Ten (TS)\"\n  from:19/10/2017 till:21/10/2017 color:C1 text:\"Eleven (C1)\"\n\n  bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/2017 till:31/07/2017 text:July\n  from:01/08/2017 till:31/08/2017 text:August\n  from:01/09/2017 till:30/09/2017 text:September\n  from:01/10/2017 till:31/10/2017 text:October\nTextData =\n   pos:(570,30)\n   text:\"(From the\"\n   pos:(618,30)\n   text:\"[[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]])\"\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\n===Tropical Storm One===\n{{Infobox Hurricane Small\n|Basin=Atl\n|Image=Tropical Storm One surface analysis 31 July 1937.png\n|Track=1937 Atlantic tropical storm 1 track.png\n|Formed=July 29\n|Dissipated=August 1\n|1-min winds=60\n|Pressure=996\n}}\nIn late July, a [[stationary front]] was draped across the northeastern [[Gulf of Mexico]].

Initially, dishwashers were sold as standalone or portable devices, but with the development of the wall-to-wall [[countertop]] and standardized height cabinets, dishwashers began to be marketed with standardized sizes and shapes, integrated underneath the kitchen countertop as a modular unit with other kitchen appliances.\n\nBy the 1970s, dishwashers had become commonplace in domestic residences in North America and Western Europe. By 2012, over 75 percent of homes in the United States and Germany had dishwashers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon-today.co.uk/fnews.cfm?id=168&headline=The%20History%20of%20the%20Dishwasher|title=The History of the Dishwasher|publisher=Yellow Advertiser|accessdate=2013-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217185319/http://www.basildon-today.co.uk/fnews.cfm?id=168&headline=The%20History%20of%20the%20Dishwasher|archive-date=2014-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, manufacturers began offering various new [[energy conservation]] features in dishwashers.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Janeway|first1=Kimberly|title=5 Things to Know When Replacing a Dishwasher|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/dishwashers/replacing-a-dishwasher-what-to-know/|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=9 December 2016}}</ref> One feature was use of \"soil sensors\", which was a computerized tool in the dishwasher which measured food particles coming from dishes.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> When the dishwasher had cleaned the dishes to the point of not releasing more food particles, then the soil sensor would report the dishes being cleaned.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> The sensor operated with another innovation of using variable washing time.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> If dishes were especially dirty, then the dishwasher would run for a longer time than if the sensor detected them to be clean.

Commercial dishwashers are rated as plates per hour. The rating is based on standard-sized plates of the same size. The same can be said for commercial glass washers, as they are based on standard glasses, normally pint glasses.\n\n===Layout===\n\nPresent-day machines feature a drop-down front panel door, allowing access to the interior, which usually contains two or sometimes three pull-out racks; racks can also be referred to as \"baskets\". In older U.S. models from the 1950s, the entire tub rolled out when the machine latch was opened, and loading as well as removing washable items was from the top, with the user reaching deep into the compartment for some items. Youngstown Kitchens, which manufactured entire kitchen cabinets and sinks, offered a tub-style dishwasher, which was coupled to a conventional kitchen sink as one unit. Most present-day machines allow for placement of dishes, silverware, tall items and cooking utensils in the lower rack, while glassware, cups and saucers are placed in the upper rack. One notable exception were dishwashers produced by the Maytag Corporation from the late sixties until the early nineties. These machines were designed for loading glassware, cups and saucers in the lower rack, while plates, silverware, and tall items were placed into the upper rack. This unique design allowed for a larger capacity and more flexibility in loading of dishes and pots and pans. Today, \"dish drawer\" models eliminate the inconvenience of the long reach that was necessary with older full-depth models. \"Cutlery baskets\" are also common. A [[drawer dishwasher]], first introduced by [[Fisher & Paykel]] in 1997, is a variant of the dishwasher in which the baskets slide out with the door in the same manner as a drawer [[filing cabinet]], with each drawer in a double-drawer model being able to operate independently of the other.\n\nThe inside of a dishwasher in the North American market is either [[stainless steel]] or [[plastic]]. Stainless steel tubs resist [[hard water]], and preserve heat to dry dishes more quickly. They also come at a premium price. Older models used baked [[porcelain enamel|enamel]] tubs, while some used a [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] coating bonded to a steel tub, which provided protection of the tub from acidic foods and provided some sound attenuation. European-made dishwashers feature a stainless steel interior as standard, even on low-end models. The same is true for a built-in [[water softener]].\n\n===Washing elements===\n\nEuropean dishwashers almost universally use two or three spray arms which are fed from the bottom and back wall of the dishwasher leaving both racks unimpeded and also such models tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for exposed elements in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use exposed elements in the base of the dishwasher. Some North American machines, primarily those designed by General Electric, use a wash tube, often called a wash-tower, to direct water from the bottom of the dishwasher to the top dish rack. Some dishwashers, including many models from [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] and [[KitchenAid]], use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher and directs water to a second wash arm beneath the upper rack, this allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model [[Frigidaire]] dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).\n\n===Features===\n[[File:Geschirrspuelertv.ogg|thumb|Clear model of a running dishwasher]]\n\nMid- to higher-end North American dishwashers often come with hard food disposal units, which behave like miniature [[garbage disposal unit|garbage (waste) disposal units]] that eliminate large pieces of food waste from the wash water. One manufacturer that is known for omitting hard food disposals is [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], a German brand; however, Bosch does so in order to reduce noise. If the larger items of food waste are removed before placing in the dishwasher, pre-rinsing is not necessary even without integrated waste disposal units.\n\nMany new dishwashers feature [[microprocessor]]-controlled, [[sensor]]-assisted wash cycles that adjust the wash duration to the number of dirty dishes (sensed by changes in water [[temperature]]) or the amount of dirt in the rinse water (sensed chemically or optically). This can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load. In such dishwashers the [[electromechanical]] [[rotary switch]] often used to control the washing cycle is replaced by a microprocessor, but most sensors and [[valve]]s are still required. However, pressure switches (some dishwashers use a pressure switch and flow meter) are not required in most microprocessor controlled dishwashers as they use the motor and sometimes a rotational position sensor to sense the resistance of water; when it senses there is no [[cavitation]] it knows it has the optimal amount of water. A [[bimetallic strip|bimetal switch]] or [[wax motor]] opens the detergent door during the wash cycle.\n\nSome dishwashers include a child-lockout feature to prevent accidental starting or stopping of the wash cycle by children. A child lock can sometimes be included to prevent young children from opening the door during a wash cycle. This prevents accidents with hot water and strong detergents used during the wash cycle.\nIn fact, almost all modern dishwashers in the market now come with child lock. This is something more like trendy thing and secures as well.\n\n==Process==\n\n===Energy use and water temperatures===\nIn the European Union, the energy consumption of a dishwasher for a standard usage is shown on a [[European Union energy label]]. In the United States, the energy consumption of a dishwasher is defined using the [[energy factor]].\n\nMost consumer dishwashers use a 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F) thermostat in the sanitizing process. During the final rinse cycle, the heating element and wash pump are turned on, and the cycle timer (electronic or electromechanical) is stopped until the thermostat is tripped. At this point, the cycle timer resumes and will generally trigger a drain cycle within a few timer increments.\n\nMost consumer dishwashers use 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F) rather than 83&nbsp;\u00b0C (181&nbsp;\u00b0F) for reasons of burn risk, energy and water consumption, total cycle time, and possible damage to plastic items placed inside the dishwasher. With new advances in detergents, lower water temperatures (50\u201355&nbsp;\u00b0C / 122\u2013131&nbsp;\u00b0F) are needed to prevent premature decay of the enzymes used to eat the grease and other build-ups on the dishes.\n\nIn the US, residential dishwashers can be certified to a [[NSF International]] testing protocol which confirms the cleaning and sanitation performance of the unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.org/consumer/residential_appliances/index.asp?program=ResidentialApp |title=NSF Consumer Information: Residential Appliances and Other Products for the Home |publisher=Nsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Drying===\nThe heat inside the dishwasher dries the contents after the final hot rinse; the final rinse adds a small amount of rinse-aid to the hot water, as this improves drying significantly by reducing the inherent surface tension of the water. Plastic and non-stick items form drops with smaller surface area<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/ask/curiosities/curiosities-why-does-plastic-dry-slower-than-glass/article_31d0e21a-34df-11e1-bdb3-001871e3ce6c.html | title=Curiosities: Why does plastic dry slower than glass?}}</ref> and may not dry properly compared to china and glass, which also store more heat that better evaporate the little water that remains on them. Some dishwashers incorporate a fan to improve drying. Older dishwashers with a visible heating element (at the bottom of the wash cabinet, below the bottom basket) may use the heating element to improve drying; however, this uses more energy.\n\nNorth American dishwashers tend to use heat-assisted drying via an exposed element. European machines and some high end North American machines use passive methods for drying \u2013 a stainless steel interior helps this process and some models use heat exchange technology between the inner and outer skin of the machine to cool the walls of the interior and speed up drying. Most dishwashers feature a drying sensor and as such, a dish-washing cycle is always considered complete when a drying indicator, usually in the form of an illuminated \"end\" light, or in more modern models on a digital display or audible sound, exhibits to the operator that the washing and drying cycle is now over.\n\nGovernmental agencies often recommend air-drying dishes by either disabling or stopping the drying cycle to save energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.es_at_home_tips_renters10 |title=Top 10 Tips for Renters: ENERGY STAR |publisher=Energystar.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between dishwashers and hand washing==\n\n===Dishwasher detergent===\n{{Main|Dishwasher detergent}}\n[[File:Detergent tablet.jpg|thumb|A detergent tablet]]\nDishwashers are designed to work using specially formulated [[dishwasher detergent]]. Over time, many regions have banned the use of [[phosphates in detergent]] and phosphorus-based compounds. They were previously used because they have properties that aid in effective cleaning. The concern was the increase in [[algal bloom]]s in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels (see [[eutrophication]]).<ref name=\"Kogawa 2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Kogawa|first1=Ana Carolina|last2=Cernic|first2=Beatriz Gamberini|last3=do Couto|first3=Leandro Giovanni Domingos|last4=Salgado|first4=H\u00e9rida Regina Nunes|title=Synthetic detergents: 100 years of history|journal=Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal|volume=25|issue=6|pages=934\u2013938|date=February 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jsps.2017.02.006|pmid=28951681|pmc=5605839}}</ref> Seventeen US states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates in dish detergent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030201805.html |title=Md.

Detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans (although detergents are typically formulated for local markets), and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all dishwasher detergents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geappliances.com/appliances/dishwashers/why-is-there-white-film-on-glassware-dishes-dishwasher-interior.htm |title=Phosphate Free Dishwasher Detergent Leaves Dishes Dirty |publisher=GE Appliances |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, rinse aids have contained [[nonylphenol]] and nonylphenol ethoxylates. These have been banned in the European Union by EU Directive 76/769/EEC.\n\nIn some regions depending on water hardness a dishwasher might function better with the use of a [[dishwasher salt]].\n\n===Glassware===\nGlassware washed by dishwashing machines can develop a white [[haze]] on the surface over time. This may be caused by any or all of the below processes, of which only the first is reversible:\n; Deposition of minerals: Calcium carbonate ([[limescale]]) in hard water can deposit on surfaces when water dries. The deposits can be dissolved by vinegar or another acid.\n; Silicate filming, etching, and accelerated crack corrosion: This film starts as an iridescence or \"oil-film\" effect on glassware, and progresses into a \"milky\" or \"cloudy\" appearance (which is not a deposit) that cannot be polished off or removed like limescale. It is formed because the detergent is strongly alkaline (basic) and [[Sodium silicate#Properties|glass dissolves slowly in alkaline aqueous solution]]. It becomes less soluble in the presence of silicates in the water (added as anti-metal-corrosion agents in the dishwasher detergent). Since the cloudy appearance is due to nonuniform glass dissolution, it is (somewhat paradoxically) ''less'' marked if dissolution is higher, i.e. if a silicate-free detergent is used; also, in certain cases, the etching will primarily be seen in areas that have microscopic surface cracks as a result of the items' manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/F/20033788.html |title=Lehigh-Unilever study sheds light on mystery of cloudy wineglasses |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03538.x |last1=Sharma |first1=Anju |last2=Jain |first2=Himanshu |last3=Carnali |first3=Joseph O. |last4=Lugo |first4=Guillermo Manuel |title=Influence of the Manufacturing Process on Corrosion Behavior of Soda-Lime-Silicate Glassware |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118861292/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121107001214/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118861292/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-07|accessdate= 2010-06-09 |volume=86 |pages=1669\u20131676 |year=2003 |issue=10}}</ref> Limitation of this undesirable reaction is possible by controlling water hardness, detergent load and temperature. The type of glass is an important factor in determining if this effect is a problem. Some dishwashers can reduce this etching effect by automatically dispensing the correct amount of detergent throughout the wash cycle based on the level of water hardness programmed.\n; Dissolution of lead: Lead in [[lead crystal]] can be converted into a soluble form by the high temperatures and strong alkali detergents of dishwashers, which could endanger the health of subsequent users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1997/7/97.07.05.x.html |title=''Lead Contamination In Our Environment'' |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Other materials===\nOther materials besides glass are also harmed by the strong detergents, strong agitation, and high temperatures of dishwashers, especially on a hot wash cycle when temperatures can reach 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=\"huffpo\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/wash-dishes_n_7232216.html |title=You Should Pretty Much NEVER Wash Your Dishes By Hand.

Glued items, such as hollow-handle knives or wooden [[cutting board]]s, will melt or soften in a dishwasher; high temperatures and moisture damage wood. High temperatures damage many plastics, especially in the bottom rack close to an exposed [[heating element]] (many newer dishwashers have a concealed heating element away from the bottom rack entirely). Squeezing plastic items into small spaces may cause the plastic to distort in shape. [[Cast iron]] [[cookware and bakeware|cookware]] is normally seasoned with oil or grease and heat, which causes the oil or grease to be absorbed into the pores of the cookware, thereby giving a smooth relatively non-stick cooking surface which is stripped off by the combination of alkali based detergent and hot water in a dishwasher.\n \nKnives and other cooking tools that are made of [[carbon steel]], semi-stainless steels like D2, or specialized, highly hardened cutlery steels like ZDP189 corrode in the extended moisture bath of dishwashers, compared to briefer baths of hand washing. Cookware is made of [[austenite|austenitic]] stainless steels, which are more stable.\n \nItems contaminated by chemicals such as wax, cigarette ash, poisons, mineral oils, wet paints, oiled tools, furnace filters, etc. can contaminate a dishwasher, since the surfaces inside small water passages cannot be wiped clean as surfaces are in hand-washing, so contaminants remain to affect future loads. Objects contaminated by [[solvent]]s may explode in a dishwasher.\n\n===Environmental comparison===\nDishwashers use less water, and therefore less fuel to heat the water, than hand washing, except for small quantities washed in wash bowls without running water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/05/05/why-you-shouldnt-wash-your-dishes-by-hand/ |title=Why you shouldn't wash your dishes by hand |last=Mooney |first=Chris |date=2015-05-05 |website=Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref name=\"star\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/dishwashers/dishwasher_hand_washing |title=Dishwasher vs. Hand Washing Dishes |website=www.energystar.gov |language=en |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref name=\"rodale\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/home/best-way-to-wash-dishes |title=8 Mistakes You're Making Every Time You Wash The Dishes |date=2017-09-05 |website=Rodale's Organic Life |language=en |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref>\n\nHand-washing techniques vary by individual.

Washing is conducted with 65\u201371&nbsp;\u00b0C / 150\u2013160&nbsp;\u00b0F temperatures and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide the machine 82&nbsp;\u00b0C / 180&nbsp;\u00b0F \"final rinse\" temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer. This distinction labels the machines as either \"high-temp\" or \"low-temp\".\n\nSome commercial dishwashers work similarly to a commercial [[car wash]], with a pulley system that pulls the rack through a small chamber (known widely as a \"rack conveyor\" systems). Single-rack washers require an operator to push the rack into the washer, close the doors, start the cycle, and then open the doors to pull out the cleaned rack, possibly through a second opening into an unloading area.\n\nIn the UK, the [[British Standards Institution]] set standards for dishwashers. In the US, [[NSF International]] (an independent not-for-profit organization) sets the standards for wash and rinse time along with minimum water temperature for chemical or hot-water sanitizing methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsf.org/business/food_equipment/standards.asp?program=FoodEqu |title=NSF article on dishwashers |publisher=Nsf.org |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522024446/http://www.nsf.org/business/food_equipment/standards.asp?program=FoodEqu |archivedate=2012-05-22 }}</ref> There are many types of commercial dishwashers including under-counter, single tank, conveyor, flight type, and carousel machines.\n\nCommercial dishwashers often have significantly different plumbing and operations than a home unit, in that there are often separate spray arms for washing and rinsing/sanitizing. The wash water is heated with an in-tank electric heat element and mixed with a cleaning solution, and is used repeatedly from one load to the next. The wash tank usually has a large strainer basket to collect food debris, and the strainer may not be emptied until the end of the day's kitchen operations.\n\nWater used for rinsing and sanitizing is generally delivered directly through building water supply, and is not reusable. The used rinse water empties into the wash tank reservoir, which dilutes some of the used wash water and causes a small amount to drain out through an overflow tube. The system may first rinse with pure water only and then sanitize with an additive solution that is left on the dishes as they leave the washer to dry.\n\nAdditional soap is periodically added to the main wash water tank, from either large soap concentrate tanks or dissolved from a large solid soap block, to maintain wash water cleaning effectiveness.\n\n==Alternative uses==\n\nDishwashers can be used to cook foods at low temperatures, including turkey,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-thanksgiving-2013-cook-turkey-dishwasher-20131120-story.html |title=How to cook your holiday turkey in the dishwasher |last=Harris |first=By Jenn |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\nsalmon, beef, veal, tuna, shrimp, asparagus, spinach, pears, noodles, and couscous.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/08/25/214799882/dishwasher-cooking-make-your-dinner-while-cleaning-the-plates |title=Dishwasher Cooking: Make Your Dinner While Cleaning The Plates |date=2013-08-25 |work=National Public Radio |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cucinare in lavastoviglie : gusto, sostenibilit\u00e0 e risparmio con un metodo rivoluzionario |last=Lisa. |first=Casali |date=2011 |publisher=Gribaudo |isbn=9788858004340 |location=Milano |oclc=898508940}}</ref>\nThe foods are generally sealed in canning jars or oven bags since even a dishwasher cycle without soap can deposit residual soap and rinse aid from previous cycles on unsealed foods.<ref name=\"cr\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.news4jax.com/consumer/consumer-reports/things-you-should-never-put-in-the-dishwasher |title=Things you should never put in the dishwasher |last=Kimbleton |first=Nikki |date=2018-08-13 |work=Consumer Reports |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDishwashers also have been documented to be used to clean potatoes, other root vegetables, garden tools, sneakers or trainers,\nsilk flowers,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/home/dishwasher-hacks-t101125 |title=Did you know your dishwasher could do this?! |work=NBC |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\nsome sporting goods, plastic hairbrushes, baseball caps, plastic toys, toothbrushes, flip-flops,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.co.uk/house-and-home/household-advice/a662041/the-best-way-to-load-your-dishwasher/ |title=The best way to load your dishwasher |date=2017-05-10 |work=The Good Housekeeping Institute |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-GB}}</ref>\ncontact lens cases, a mesh filter from a range hood, refrigerator shelves and bins,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/home/17-surprising-items-you-can-throw-dishwasher-t117880 |title=Yes, you can wash golf balls in the dishwasher (and other surprising things) |work=NBC |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\ntoothbrush holder, pet bowls and pet toys.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/home-garden/la-hm-cleaning-your-kitchen-20180825-story.html |title=Turns out your kitchen (not the bathroom!) is the grossest place in the house |last=Herman |first=Valli |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>\nCleaning vegetables and plastics is controversial since vegetables can be contaminated by soap and rinse aid from previous cycles and the heat of most standard dishwashers can cause BPA or phthalates to leech out of plastic products.<ref name=\"cr\"/>.

Once the wash is finished, the water is drained, more hot water enters the tub by means of an electro-mechanical [[solenoid valve]], and the rinse cycle begins. After the rinse cycle finishes and the water is drained, the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. Typically a [[rinse aid|rinse-aid]], a chemical to reduce surface tension of the water, is used to reduce water spots from [[hard water]] or other reasons.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mCgcrvvRIucC&pg=PA62&dq=dishwasher+rinse+aid#v=onepage&q=dishwasher%20rinse%20aid&f=false|title=Handbook of Detergents, Part E: Applications|last=Zoller|first=Uri|date=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1574447576|location=|pages=60\u201362|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to domestic units, industrial dishwashers are available for use in commercial establishments such as hotels and restaurants, where many dishes must be cleaned.

Initially, dishwashers were sold as standalone or portable devices, but with the development of the wall-to-wall [[countertop]] and standardized height cabinets, dishwashers began to be marketed with standardized sizes and shapes, integrated underneath the kitchen countertop as a modular unit with other kitchen appliances.\n\nBy the 1970s, dishwashers had become commonplace in domestic residences in North America and Western Europe. By 2012, over 75 percent of homes in the United States and Germany had dishwashers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basildon-today.co.uk/fnews.cfm?id=168&headline=The%20History%20of%20the%20Dishwasher|title=The History of the Dishwasher|publisher=Yellow Advertiser|accessdate=2013-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217185319/http://www.basildon-today.co.uk/fnews.cfm?id=168&headline=The%20History%20of%20the%20Dishwasher|archive-date=2014-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1990s, manufacturers began offering various new [[energy conservation]] features in dishwashers.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Janeway|first1=Kimberly|title=5 Things to Know When Replacing a Dishwasher|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/dishwashers/replacing-a-dishwasher-what-to-know/|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=9 December 2016}}</ref> One feature was use of \"soil sensors\", which was a computerized tool in the dishwasher which measured food particles coming from dishes.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> When the dishwasher had cleaned the dishes to the point of not releasing more food particles, then the soil sensor would report the dishes being cleaned.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> The sensor operated with another innovation of using variable washing time.<ref name=\"Janeway December 2016\"/> If dishes were especially dirty, then the dishwasher would run for a longer time than if the sensor detected them to be clean.

Portable dishwashers exist in 45 and 60&nbsp;cm (Europe) or {{cvt|18|and|24|in|cm}} (US) widths, with casters and attached countertops. There are also dishwashers available in sizes according to the European [[gastronorm]] standard.<ref>[https://www.cs-catering-equipment.co.uk/catering-appliances/dishwashers-glass-washers Commercial Dishwashers & Glasswashers | CS Catering Equipment]</ref> Dishwashers may come in standard or tall tub designs; standard tub dishwashers have a service kickplate beneath the dishwasher door that allows for simpler maintenance and installation, but tall tub dishwashers have approximately 20% more capacity and better [[Soundproofing|sound dampening]] from having a continuous front door.\n\nThe international standard for the capacity of a dishwasher is expressed as standard [[place setting]]s. Commercial dishwashers are rated as plates per hour. The rating is based on standard-sized plates of the same size. The same can be said for commercial glass washers, as they are based on standard glasses, normally pint glasses.\n\n===Layout===\n\nPresent-day machines feature a drop-down front panel door, allowing access to the interior, which usually contains two or sometimes three pull-out racks; racks can also be referred to as \"baskets\". In older U.S. models from the 1950s, the entire tub rolled out when the machine latch was opened, and loading as well as removing washable items was from the top, with the user reaching deep into the compartment for some items. Youngstown Kitchens, which manufactured entire kitchen cabinets and sinks, offered a tub-style dishwasher, which was coupled to a conventional kitchen sink as one unit. Most present-day machines allow for placement of dishes, silverware, tall items and cooking utensils in the lower rack, while glassware, cups and saucers are placed in the upper rack. One notable exception were dishwashers produced by the Maytag Corporation from the late sixties until the early nineties. These machines were designed for loading glassware, cups and saucers in the lower rack, while plates, silverware, and tall items were placed into the upper rack. This unique design allowed for a larger capacity and more flexibility in loading of dishes and pots and pans. Today, \"dish drawer\" models eliminate the inconvenience of the long reach that was necessary with older full-depth models. \"Cutlery baskets\" are also common. A [[drawer dishwasher]], first introduced by [[Fisher & Paykel]] in 1997, is a variant of the dishwasher in which the baskets slide out with the door in the same manner as a drawer [[filing cabinet]], with each drawer in a double-drawer model being able to operate independently of the other.\n\nThe inside of a dishwasher in the North American market is either [[stainless steel]] or [[plastic]]. Stainless steel tubs resist [[hard water]], and preserve heat to dry dishes more quickly. They also come at a premium price. Older models used baked [[porcelain enamel|enamel]] tubs, while some used a [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] coating bonded to a steel tub, which provided protection of the tub from acidic foods and provided some sound attenuation. European-made dishwashers feature a stainless steel interior as standard, even on low-end models. The same is true for a built-in [[water softener]].\n\n===Washing elements===\n\nEuropean dishwashers almost universally use two or three spray arms which are fed from the bottom and back wall of the dishwasher leaving both racks unimpeded and also such models tend to use inline water heaters, removing the need for exposed elements in the base of the machine that can melt plastic items near to them. Many North American dishwashers tend to use exposed elements in the base of the dishwasher. Some North American machines, primarily those designed by General Electric, use a wash tube, often called a wash-tower, to direct water from the bottom of the dishwasher to the top dish rack. Some dishwashers, including many models from [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] and [[KitchenAid]], use a tube attached to the top rack that connects to a water source at the back of the dishwasher and directs water to a second wash arm beneath the upper rack, this allows full use of the bottom rack. Late-model [[Frigidaire]] dishwashers shoot a jet of water from the top of the washer down into the upper wash arm, again allowing full use of the bottom rack (but requiring that a small funnel on the top rack be kept clear).\n\n===Features===\n[[File:Geschirrspuelertv.ogg|thumb|Clear model of a running dishwasher]]\n\nMid- to higher-end North American dishwashers often come with hard food disposal units, which behave like miniature [[garbage disposal unit|garbage (waste) disposal units]] that eliminate large pieces of food waste from the wash water. One manufacturer that is known for omitting hard food disposals is [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], a German brand; however, Bosch does so in order to reduce noise. If the larger items of food waste are removed before placing in the dishwasher, pre-rinsing is not necessary even without integrated waste disposal units.\n\nMany new dishwashers feature [[microprocessor]]-controlled, [[sensor]]-assisted wash cycles that adjust the wash duration to the number of dirty dishes (sensed by changes in water [[temperature]]) or the amount of dirt in the rinse water (sensed chemically or optically). This can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load. In such dishwashers the [[electromechanical]] [[rotary switch]] often used to control the washing cycle is replaced by a microprocessor, but most sensors and [[valve]]s are still required. However, pressure switches (some dishwashers use a pressure switch and flow meter) are not required in most microprocessor controlled dishwashers as they use the motor and sometimes a rotational position sensor to sense the resistance of water; when it senses there is no [[cavitation]] it knows it has the optimal amount of water. A [[bimetallic strip|bimetal switch]] or [[wax motor]] opens the detergent door during the wash cycle.\n\nSome dishwashers include a child-lockout feature to prevent accidental starting or stopping of the wash cycle by children. A child lock can sometimes be included to prevent young children from opening the door during a wash cycle. This prevents accidents with hot water and strong detergents used during the wash cycle.\n\n==Process==\n\n===Energy use and water temperatures===\nIn the European Union, the energy consumption of a dishwasher for a standard usage is shown on a [[European Union energy label]]. In the United States, the energy consumption of a dishwasher is defined using the [[energy factor]].\n\nMost consumer dishwashers use a 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F) thermostat in the sanitizing process. During the final rinse cycle, the heating element and wash pump are turned on, and the cycle timer (electronic or electromechanical) is stopped until the thermostat is tripped. At this point, the cycle timer resumes and will generally trigger a drain cycle within a few timer increments.\n\nMost consumer dishwashers use 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F) rather than 83&nbsp;\u00b0C (181&nbsp;\u00b0F) for reasons of burn risk, energy and water consumption, total cycle time, and possible damage to plastic items placed inside the dishwasher. With new advances in detergents, lower water temperatures (50\u201355&nbsp;\u00b0C / 122\u2013131&nbsp;\u00b0F) are needed to prevent premature decay of the enzymes used to eat the grease and other build-ups on the dishes.\n\nIn the US, residential dishwashers can be certified to a [[NSF International]] testing protocol which confirms the cleaning and sanitation performance of the unit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.org/consumer/residential_appliances/index.asp?program=ResidentialApp |title=NSF Consumer Information: Residential Appliances and Other Products for the Home |publisher=Nsf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Drying===\nThe heat inside the dishwasher dries the contents after the final hot rinse; the final rinse adds a small amount of rinse-aid to the hot water, as this improves drying significantly by reducing the inherent surface tension of the water. Plastic and non-stick items form drops with smaller surface area<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/ask/curiosities/curiosities-why-does-plastic-dry-slower-than-glass/article_31d0e21a-34df-11e1-bdb3-001871e3ce6c.html | title=Curiosities: Why does plastic dry slower than glass?}}</ref> and may not dry properly compared to china and glass, which also store more heat that better evaporate the little water that remains on them. Some dishwashers incorporate a fan to improve drying. Older dishwashers with a visible heating element (at the bottom of the wash cabinet, below the bottom basket) may use the heating element to improve drying; however, this uses more energy.\n\nNorth American dishwashers tend to use heat-assisted drying via an exposed element. European machines and some high end North American machines use passive methods for drying \u2013 a stainless steel interior helps this process and some models use heat exchange technology between the inner and outer skin of the machine to cool the walls of the interior and speed up drying. Most dishwashers feature a drying sensor and as such, a dish-washing cycle is always considered complete when a drying indicator, usually in the form of an illuminated \"end\" light, or in more modern models on a digital display or audible sound, exhibits to the operator that the washing and drying cycle is now over.\n\nGovernmental agencies often recommend air-drying dishes by either disabling or stopping the drying cycle to save energy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.es_at_home_tips_renters10 |title=Top 10 Tips for Renters: ENERGY STAR |publisher=Energystar.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Differences between dishwashers and hand washing==\n\n===Dishwasher detergent===\n{{Main|Dishwasher detergent}}\n[[File:Detergent tablet.jpg|thumb|A detergent tablet]]\nDishwashers are designed to work using specially formulated [[dishwasher detergent]]. Over time, many regions have banned the use of [[phosphates in detergent]] and phosphorus-based compounds. They were previously used because they have properties that aid in effective cleaning. The concern was the increase in [[algal bloom]]s in waterways caused by increasing phosphate levels (see [[eutrophication]]).<ref name=\"Kogawa 2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Kogawa|first1=Ana Carolina|last2=Cernic|first2=Beatriz Gamberini|last3=do Couto|first3=Leandro Giovanni Domingos|last4=Salgado|first4=H\u00e9rida Regina Nunes|title=Synthetic detergents: 100 years of history|journal=Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal|volume=25|issue=6|pages=934\u2013938|date=February 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jsps.2017.02.006|pmid=28951681|pmc=5605839}}</ref> Seventeen US states have partial or full bans on the use of phosphates in dish detergent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/02/AR2007030201805.html |title=Md.

Detergent companies claimed it is not cost effective to make separate batches of detergent for the states with phosphate bans (although detergents are typically formulated for local markets), and so most have voluntarily removed phosphates from all dishwasher detergents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geappliances.com/appliances/dishwashers/why-is-there-white-film-on-glassware-dishes-dishwasher-interior.htm |title=Phosphate Free Dishwasher Detergent Leaves Dishes Dirty |publisher=GE Appliances |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, rinse aids have contained [[nonylphenol]] and nonylphenol ethoxylates. These have been banned in the European Union by EU Directive 76/769/EEC.\n\nIn some regions depending on water hardness a dishwasher might function better with the use of a [[dishwasher salt]].\n\n===Glassware===\nGlassware washed by dishwashing machines can develop a white [[haze]] on the surface over time. This may be caused by any or all of the below processes, of which only the first is reversible:\n; Deposition of minerals: Calcium carbonate ([[limescale]]) in hard water can deposit on surfaces when water dries. The deposits can be dissolved by vinegar or another acid.\n; Silicate filming, etching, and accelerated crack corrosion: This film starts as an iridescence or \"oil-film\" effect on glassware, and progresses into a \"milky\" or \"cloudy\" appearance (which is not a deposit) that cannot be polished off or removed like limescale. It is formed because the detergent is strongly alkaline (basic) and [[Sodium silicate#Properties|glass dissolves slowly in alkaline aqueous solution]]. It becomes less soluble in the presence of silicates in the water (added as anti-metal-corrosion agents in the dishwasher detergent). Since the cloudy appearance is due to nonuniform glass dissolution, it is (somewhat paradoxically) ''less'' marked if dissolution is higher, i.e. if a silicate-free detergent is used; also, in certain cases, the etching will primarily be seen in areas that have microscopic surface cracks as a result of the items' manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/F/20033788.html |title=Lehigh-Unilever study sheds light on mystery of cloudy wineglasses |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1151-2916.2003.tb03538.x |last1=Sharma |first1=Anju |last2=Jain |first2=Himanshu |last3=Carnali |first3=Joseph O. |last4=Lugo |first4=Guillermo Manuel |title=Influence of the Manufacturing Process on Corrosion Behavior of Soda-Lime-Silicate Glassware |journal=Journal of the American Ceramic Society |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118861292/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121107001214/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118861292/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-11-07|accessdate= 2010-06-09 |volume=86 |pages=1669\u20131676 |year=2003 |issue=10}}</ref> Limitation of this undesirable reaction is possible by controlling water hardness, detergent load and temperature. The type of glass is an important factor in determining if this effect is a problem. Some dishwashers can reduce this etching effect by automatically dispensing the correct amount of detergent throughout the wash cycle based on the level of water hardness programmed.\n; Dissolution of lead: Lead in [[lead crystal]] can be converted into a soluble form by the high temperatures and strong alkali detergents of dishwashers, which could endanger the health of subsequent users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1997/7/97.07.05.x.html |title=''Lead Contamination In Our Environment'' |publisher=Yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20}}</ref>\n\n===Other materials===\nOther materials besides glass are also harmed by the strong detergents, strong agitation, and high temperatures of dishwashers, especially on a hot wash cycle when temperatures can reach 75&nbsp;\u00b0C (167&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref name=\"huffpo\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/wash-dishes_n_7232216.html |title=You Should Pretty Much NEVER Wash Your Dishes By Hand.

Glued items, such as hollow-handle knives or wooden [[cutting board]]s, will melt or soften in a dishwasher; high temperatures and moisture damage wood. High temperatures damage many plastics, especially in the bottom rack close to an exposed [[heating element]] (many newer dishwashers have a concealed heating element away from the bottom rack entirely). Squeezing plastic items into small spaces may cause the plastic to distort in shape. [[Cast iron]] [[cookware and bakeware|cookware]] is normally seasoned with oil or grease and heat, which causes the oil or grease to be absorbed into the pores of the cookware, thereby giving a smooth relatively non-stick cooking surface which is stripped off by the combination of alkali based detergent and hot water in a dishwasher.\n \nKnives and other cooking tools that are made of [[carbon steel]], semi-stainless steels like D2, or specialized, highly hardened cutlery steels like ZDP189 corrode in the extended moisture bath of dishwashers, compared to briefer baths of hand washing. Cookware is made of [[austenite|austenitic]] stainless steels, which are more stable.\n \nItems contaminated by chemicals such as wax, cigarette ash, poisons, mineral oils, wet paints, oiled tools, furnace filters, etc. can contaminate a dishwasher, since the surfaces inside small water passages cannot be wiped clean as surfaces are in hand-washing, so contaminants remain to affect future loads. Objects contaminated by [[solvent]]s may explode in a dishwasher.\n\n===Environmental comparison===\nDishwashers use less water, and therefore less fuel to heat the water, than hand washing, except for small quantities washed in wash bowls without running water.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/05/05/why-you-shouldnt-wash-your-dishes-by-hand/ |title=Why you shouldn't wash your dishes by hand |last=Mooney |first=Chris |date=2015-05-05 |website=Washington Post |language=en-US |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref name=\"star\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.energystar.gov/products/appliances/dishwashers/dishwasher_hand_washing |title=Dishwasher vs. Hand Washing Dishes |website=www.energystar.gov |language=en |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref><ref name=\"rodale\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rodalesorganiclife.com/home/best-way-to-wash-dishes |title=8 Mistakes You're Making Every Time You Wash The Dishes |date=2017-09-05 |website=Rodale's Organic Life |language=en |access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref>\n\nHand-washing techniques vary by individual. According to a peer-reviewed study in 2003, hand washing and drying of an amount of dishes equivalent to a fully loaded automatic dishwasher (no [[cookware and bakeware|cookware or bakeware]]) could use between {{convert|20|and|300|L|gal}} of water and between 0.1 and 8 kWh of energy, while the numbers for energy-efficient automatic dishwashers were {{convert|15|-|22|L|gal}} and 1 to 2 kWh, respectively.

Washing is conducted with 65\u201371&nbsp;\u00b0C / 150\u2013160&nbsp;\u00b0F temperatures and sanitation is achieved by either the use of a booster heater that will provide the machine 82&nbsp;\u00b0C / 180&nbsp;\u00b0F \"final rinse\" temperature or through the use of a chemical sanitizer. This distinction labels the machines as either \"high-temp\" or \"low-temp\".\n\nSome commercial dishwashers work similarly to a commercial [[car wash]], with a pulley system that pulls the rack through a small chamber (known widely as a \"rack conveyor\" systems). Single-rack washers require an operator to push the rack into the washer, close the doors, start the cycle, and then open the doors to pull out the cleaned rack, possibly through a second opening into an unloading area.\n\nIn the UK, the [[British Standards Institution]] set standards for dishwashers. In the US, [[NSF International]] (an independent not-for-profit organization) sets the standards for wash and rinse time along with minimum water temperature for chemical or hot-water sanitizing methods.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsf.org/business/food_equipment/standards.asp?program=FoodEqu |title=NSF article on dishwashers |publisher=Nsf.org |accessdate=2012-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522024446/http://www.nsf.org/business/food_equipment/standards.asp?program=FoodEqu |archivedate=2012-05-22 }}</ref> There are many types of commercial dishwashers including under-counter, single tank, conveyor, flight type, and carousel machines.\n\nCommercial dishwashers often have significantly different plumbing and operations than a home unit, in that there are often separate spray arms for washing and rinsing/sanitizing. The wash water is heated with an in-tank electric heat element and mixed with a cleaning solution, and is used repeatedly from one load to the next. The wash tank usually has a large strainer basket to collect food debris, and the strainer may not be emptied until the end of the day's kitchen operations.\n\nWater used for rinsing and sanitizing is generally delivered directly through building water supply, and is not reusable. The used rinse water empties into the wash tank reservoir, which dilutes some of the used wash water and causes a small amount to drain out through an overflow tube. The system may first rinse with pure water only and then sanitize with an additive solution that is left on the dishes as they leave the washer to dry.\n\nAdditional soap is periodically added to the main wash water tank, from either large soap concentrate tanks or dissolved from a large solid soap block, to maintain wash water cleaning effectiveness.\n\n==Alternative uses==\n\nDishwashers can be used to cook foods at low temperatures, including turkey,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-thanksgiving-2013-cook-turkey-dishwasher-20131120-story.html |title=How to cook your holiday turkey in the dishwasher |last=Harris |first=By Jenn |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-12-20}}</ref>\nsalmon, beef, veal, tuna, shrimp, asparagus, spinach, pears, noodles, and couscous.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/08/25/214799882/dishwasher-cooking-make-your-dinner-while-cleaning-the-plates |title=Dishwasher Cooking: Make Your Dinner While Cleaning The Plates |date=2013-08-25 |work=National Public Radio |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cucinare in lavastoviglie : gusto, sostenibilit\u00e0 e risparmio con un metodo rivoluzionario |last=Lisa. |first=Casali |date=2011 |publisher=Gribaudo |isbn=9788858004340 |location=Milano |oclc=898508940}}</ref>\nThe foods are generally sealed in canning jars or oven bags since even a dishwasher cycle without soap can deposit residual soap and rinse aid from previous cycles on unsealed foods.<ref name=\"cr\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.news4jax.com/consumer/consumer-reports/things-you-should-never-put-in-the-dishwasher |title=Things you should never put in the dishwasher |last=Kimbleton |first=Nikki |date=2018-08-13 |work=Consumer Reports |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDishwashers also have been documented to be used to clean potatoes, other root vegetables, garden tools, sneakers or trainers,\nsilk flowers,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/home/dishwasher-hacks-t101125 |title=Did you know your dishwasher could do this?! |work=NBC |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\nsome sporting goods, plastic hairbrushes, baseball caps, plastic toys, toothbrushes, flip-flops,<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.co.uk/house-and-home/household-advice/a662041/the-best-way-to-load-your-dishwasher/ |title=The best way to load your dishwasher |date=2017-05-10 |work=The Good Housekeeping Institute |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-GB}}</ref>\ncontact lens cases, a mesh filter from a range hood, refrigerator shelves and bins,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.today.com/home/17-surprising-items-you-can-throw-dishwasher-t117880 |title=Yes, you can wash golf balls in the dishwasher (and other surprising things) |work=NBC |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en}}</ref>\ntoothbrush holder, pet bowls and pet toys.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/home-garden/la-hm-cleaning-your-kitchen-20180825-story.html |title=Turns out your kitchen (not the bathroom!) is the grossest place in the house |last=Herman |first=Valli |access-date=2018-12-20 |language=en-US}}</ref>\nCleaning vegetables and plastics is controversial since vegetables can be contaminated by soap and rinse aid from previous cycles and the heat of most standard dishwashers can cause BPA or phthalates to leech out of plastic products.<ref name=\"cr\"/>.

{"title_page": "Catholic societies of the Church of England", "text_new": "The '''Catholic societies of the Church of England''' are associations within the [[Church of England]] which follow in the tradition of [[Anglo-Catholicism]]. They may be devotional, theological, or pilgrimage-focused, in nature. Many trace their origins to the Anglican catholic revival of the [[Oxford Movement]] era.\n\nAlthough many, especially the older ones, make specific reference to the Church of England in their foundation documents, the vast majority today extend their membership and influence to all member churches of the wider [[Anglican Communion]],<ref>See, for example, the [http://www.confraternity.org.uk reference] of CBS to international membership.</ref> and often also to those non-Anglican churches that are in full communion with the See of Canterbury (for example, through the [[Porvoo Communion]]).\n\n==Origins==\nThe various societies were founded for many different reasons. Some have specific focuses, such as an emphasis on [[Mariology]], or on liturgical questions (including the [[Blessed Sacrament]]), supporting vocations amongst those who share Anglo-catholic ideology, promoting study, encouraging devotion, or promoting pilgrimage to different sacred sites (especially those associated with [[Our Lady of Walsingham]]).\n\nIn the nineteenth century, many of the older societies had a role in supporting both clergy and laity who found their Anglo-catholic practices or beliefs challenged through the civil courts by Protestant organisations, as part of the then current disagreement concerning [[ritualism in the Church of England]]. Those prosecuted ranged from relatively unknown parochial clergy (such as Fr [[Arthur Tooth]]) to prominent leading churchmen of the day (such as Bishop [[Edward King (bishop of Lincoln)|Edward King]]). [[The Church Union]] is an example of a society founded to provide legal and moral support to those Anglo-Catholics persecuted for their beliefs. Today these organisations have assumed different objectives.\n\n==Ordination of women==\nThe issue of the [[ordination of women in the Anglican Communion]] has caused disagreement amongst Anglicans, including those of the Anglo-Catholic tradition, and these differences of opinion have had repercussions for the Catholic societies. Some societies have declared that their membership is open only to male priests, or those opposed to the ordination of women. Other societies have been founded specifically to cater for those who are open to, or support, women's ordination. Some (such as the [[Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament]]) have publicly declared that they are open to membership from those opposed to or in favour of women's ordination, but for the sake of internal unity will only permit male priests to hold office in the society, or to preside at the society's meetings and liturgies.\n\nAn umbrella organisation entitled Catholic Societies in the Church of England has been founded to unite those societies which oppose the ordination of women. This article is not about that umbrella organisation, but reflects the full range of Anglo-Catholic societies regardless of their views on women's ordination.\n\n==Current societies==\nThe catholic societies in this table are currently active in the life of the Church of England, and (in most cases) other Anglican provinces.\n\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=20% |Society\n!

Brain capacity varied widely depending on the population, ranging from {{cvt|546\u20131251|cc}}, and maximum brain size was likely achieved early on in life, equating to a shorter childhood and reduced parental care compared to modern humans. Size also ranged widely from {{cvt|146\u2013185|cm|ftin|sigfig=1}} in height and {{cvt|40\u201368|kg}} in weight. ''H. erectus'' men and women may have been roughly the same size like modern humans, which could indicate [[monogamy]] in line with general trends exhibited in primates. Skin colour potentially varied with location.\n\n''H. erectus'' is associated with the [[Acheulean]] stone tool [[industry (archaeology)|industry]], and is thought to have been the earliest human ancestor capable of using fires, hunting and gathering in coordinated groups, caring for injured or sick group members, seafaring, and possibly art-making. Sites generally show consumption of medium to large animals, such as [[bovine]]s or [[elephant]]s, and a high reliance on meat is associated with increasing brain size. Though groups were more social than ancestor species, ''H. erectus'' does not appear to have been anatomically capable of speech, though it is postulated they communicated using some [[proto-language]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Naming===\n{{see|Trinil 2}}\n[[File:Pithecanthropus erectus-PeterMaas Naturalis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Java Man]]]]\nThe first remains, [[Java Man]], were described by Dutch anatomist [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]] in 1893, who set out to look for the \"[[missing link (human evolution)|missing link]]\" between apes and humans in Southeast Asia, because he believed [[gibbon]]s to be the closest living relatives to humans in accordance with the \"[[Out of Asia]]\" hypothesis. ''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright. However, few scientists recognized it as a \"missing link\", and, consequently, Dubois' discovery had been largely disregarded.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Homo erectus adult female - head model - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Forensic reconstruction of an adult female ''Homo erectus''.<ref>Reconstruction by [[John Gurche]] (2010), [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]], based on [[KNM ER 3733]] and [[KNM ER 992|992]].\nAbigail Tucker, \"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html?c=y&page=2&navigation=next#IMAGES A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces]\", Smithsonian.com, 25 February 2010.</ref>]]\nIn 1921, two teeth from [[Zhoukoudian]], China discovered by [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]] had prompted widely publicized interest.<ref name=\"doorKnock1\">{{cite news |title=The First Knock at the Door |publisher=Peking Man Site Museum |quote=In the summer of 1921, Dr. J.G.

However, it is also plausible that the energy-expensive guts decreased in size in ''H. erectus'', because the large ape gut is used to synthesize fat by fermenting plant matter which was replaced by dietary animal fat, allowing more energy to be diverted to brain growth. This would have increased brain size indirectly while maintaining the same caloric requirements of ancestor species. ''H. erectus'' may have also been the first to use a [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] food collecting strategy as a response to the increasing dependence on meat.

Enamel prevents the tooth from breaking from hard foods, but impedes shearing through tough foods. The [[Mandible#Body|bodies of the mandibles]] of ''H. erectus'', and all early ''Homo'', are thicker than those of modern humans and all living apes. The mandibular body resists torsion from the [[bite force]] or chewing, meaning their jaws could produce unusually powerful stresses while eating, but is unclear what this indicates in regard to diet. Nonetheless, the mandibular bodies of ''H. erectus'' are somewhat thinner than those of early ''Homo''. The premolars and molars also have a higher frequency of pits than ''H. habilis'', suggesting ''H. erectus'' ate more brittle foods (which cause pitting). These all indicate that the ''H. erectus'' mouth was less capable of processing hard foods and more at shearing through tougher foods, thus reducing the variety of foods it could process. However, tools were likely used to process hard foods, thus affecting the chewing apparatus, and this combination may have instead increased dietary flexibility (though this does not equate to a highly varied diet).

Though groups were more social than ancestor species, ''H. erectus'' does not appear to have been anatomically capable of speech, though it is postulated they communicated using some [[proto-language]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Naming===\n{{see|Trinil 2}}\n[[File:Pithecanthropus erectus-PeterMaas Naturalis.jpg|thumb|left|[[Java Man]]]]\nThe first remains, [[Java Man]], were described by Dutch anatomist [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]] in 1893, who set out to look for the \"[[missing link (human evolution)|missing link]]\" between apes and humans in Southeast Asia, because he believed [[gibbon]]s to be the closest living relatives to humans in accordance with the \"[[Out of Asia]]\" hypothesis. ''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright. However, few scientists recognized it as a \"missing link\", and, consequently, Dubois' discovery had been largely disregarded.{{Sfn|Swisher|Curtis|Lewin|2000|p=70}}\n\n[[File:Homo erectus adult female - head model - Smithsonian Museum of Natural History - 2012-05-17.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Forensic reconstruction of an adult female ''Homo erectus''.<ref>Reconstruction by [[John Gurche]] (2010), [[Smithsonian Museum of Natural History]], based on [[KNM ER 3733]] and [[KNM ER 992|992]].\nAbigail Tucker, \"[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/A-Closer-Look-at-Evolutionary-Faces.html?c=y&page=2&navigation=next#IMAGES A Closer Look at Evolutionary Faces]\", Smithsonian.com, 25 February 2010.</ref>]]\nIn 1921, two teeth from [[Zhoukoudian]], China discovered by [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]] had prompted widely publicized interest.<ref name=\"doorKnock1\">{{cite news |title=The First Knock at the Door |publisher=Peking Man Site Museum |quote=In the summer of 1921, Dr. J.G.

However, it is also plausible that the energy-expensive guts decreased in size in ''H. erectus'', because the large ape gut is used to synthesize fat by fermenting plant matter which was replaced by dietary animal fat, allowing more energy to be diverted to brain growth. This would have increased brain size indirectly while maintaining the same caloric requirements of ancestor species. ''H. erectus'' may have also been the first to use a [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] food collecting strategy as a response to the increasing dependence on meat.

Enamel prevents the tooth from breaking from hard foods, but impedes shearing through tough foods. The [[Mandible#Body|bodies of the mandibles]] of ''H. erectus'', and all early ''Homo'', are thicker than those of modern humans and all living apes. The mandibular body resists torsion from the [[bite force]] or chewing, meaning their jaws could produce unusually powerful stresses while eating, but is unclear what this indicates in regard to diet. Nonetheless, the mandibular bodies of ''H. erectus'' are somewhat thinner than those of early ''Homo''. The premolars and molars also have a higher frequency of pits than ''H. habilis'', suggesting ''H. erectus'' ate more brittle foods (which cause pitting). These all indicate that the ''H. erectus'' mouth was less capable of processing hard foods and more at shearing through tougher foods, thus reducing the variety of foods it could process. However, tools were likely used to process hard foods, thus affecting the chewing apparatus, and this combination may have instead increased dietary flexibility (though this does not equate to a highly varied diet).

The most notable feature of the moth is its large, purplish [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] on its two [[hindwing]]s. The eyespots give it its name \u2013 from the Greek myth of the cyclops [[Polyphemus]]. The species was first described by [[Pieter Cramer]] in 1776. The species is widespread in continental North America, with local populations found throughout subarctic [[Canada]] and the United States. The caterpillar can eat 86,000 times its weight at emergence in a little less than two months.\n\n==Life cycle==\nThe life cycle of the moth is much like that of any other Saturniidae species. It lays flat, light-brown eggs on the leaves of a number of host plants, including: ''[[Betula]]'' (birch), ''[[Salix]]'' (willow), ''[[Quercus]]'' (oak), ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'' (maple), ''[[Carya (genus)|Carya]]'' (hickory), ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'' (beech), ''[[Gleditsia triacanthos]]'' (honey locust), ''[[Juglans]]'' (walnut), ''[[Pyrus]]'' (pear and quince), ''[[Prunus]]'' (plum, peach, apricot, cherry, etc.), ''[[Sassafras]]'', ''[[Citrus]]'', and ''[[Ulmus americana]]'' (American elm).\n\nWhen the eggs hatch, small yellow caterpillars emerge. As the caterpillars age, they molt five times (the fifth being into a pupa). Each [[instar]] is slightly different, but on their fifth and final instar, they become bright green with silver spots on their sides. They feed heavily on their host plant and can grow up to 3\u20134&nbsp;in long. They then spin [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s of brown [[silk]], usually wrapped in leaves of the host plant.\n\nTwo broods generally hatch each year throughout the United States, one in early spring and one in late summer. The moths [[eclose]] and then must pump their wings with fluid ([[hemolymph]]) to extend them. The females emit [[pheromones]], which the male can detect through his large, plumose (feathery) [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Males can fly for miles to reach a female. After the moths mate, the female spends the majority of the remainder of her life laying eggs, while the male may mate several more times. Adults of this family of moths have [[vestigial]] mouths, meaning their mouth parts have been reduced. Because of this, they do not eat and only live as adults for less than one week.\n\nIn captivity, this moth is much more difficult to breed than other American saturniids such as ''[[Hyalophora cecropia]]'', ''[[Callosamia promethea]]'', or ''[[Actias luna]]''. Kept in a cage, the male and female tend to ignore each other, unless a food plant (particularly oak leaves) is present.{{Citation needed|reason=Would like to see some supporting evidence to back this up|date=September 2019}}\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Antheraea polyphemus eggs sjh.JPG|Eggs\nImage:Antheraea polyphemus 1st instar sjh.JPG|First-[[instar]] caterpillar reared on [[post oak]]\nImage:AntheraeaPolyphemusCaterpillar.jpg|Caterpillar in Virginia, United States\nImage:Antheraeapolyphemusmating.jpg|Adults mating\nFile:Polyphemus moth underside.jpg|Underside viewed through a window\nFile:Polyphemus moth topside.jpg|Topside after falling off window\n</gallery>\n\n==Sexual dimorphism==\n[[Image:Antheraea polyphemus variation sjh.JPG|thumb|right|Variation in adults]]\nDifferentiating between sexes of this species is very easy. The most obvious difference is the plumose [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Males have very bushy antennae while females have moderately less bushy antennae. The male's antennae are used to detect pheromones released by unmated females. Another difference is that the females are slightly larger in the abdomen due to carrying eggs. A surprising amount of variation occurs within this species. Color patterns can range from a reddish cinnamon to a dark brown, but are almost always a shade of brown.\n\nIn the late 1950s, amateur [[lepidopterist]] [[Gary Botting]] hybridized the Polyphemus moth (then known as ''Telea polyphemus'') with ''[[Antheraea yamamai]]'' from Japan and, later, ''Antheraea mylitta'' from India by transferring the pheromone-producing scent sacs from female \"''T. polyphemus''\" to the ''[[Antheraea]]'' females and allowing ''T. polyphemus'' males to mate with them. The resultant hybrids were displayed in his winning U.S. National Science Fair exhibit \"Intergeneric hybridization among giant silk moths\". After Botting consulted with genetic statistician [[J.B.S. Haldane]] and his wife, entomologist [[Helen Spurway]], the Polyphemus moth was reclassified, becoming ''Antheraea polyphemus''.\n\n==Conservation==\nParasitic insects \u2013 such as the [[parasitoid wasp]] \u2013 lay their eggs in or on the young caterpillars. These then hatch into larvae that consume the insides of the caterpillars. Once the caterpillars pupate, the larvae themselves pupate, killing the Polyphemus pupa. The ''[[Compsilura concinnata]]'' tachinid fly, introduced to North America to control gypsy moth, is one particular known threat to the North American native Polyphemus moth.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://wiki.bugwood.org/uploads/Ch2.pdf| title= The Effects of ''Compsilura concinnata'', an Introduced Generalist Tachinid, on Non-Target Species in North America: A Cautionary Tale |last1= Elkinton| first1= J. S.| last2= Boettner| first2= G. H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Squirrel]]s have also been known to consume the pupae of Polyphemus moths, decreasing the population greatly. Pruning of trees and leaving outdoor lights on at night can also be detrimental to the moths.\n\n==Response to threats==\nThe Polyphemus moth uses [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]]s to protect itself from [[predator]]s. One of its most distinctive mechanisms is a [[distraction display]] that serves to confuse, or simply distract, predators. This involves the large [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]s on its hindwings, which give the moth its name (from the cyclops [[Polyphemus]] in Greek mythology). Eyespots are also startle patterns, a subform of distraction patterns, used for [[camouflage]] via deceptive and blending [[animal coloration|coloration]]. Most startle patterns are brightly colored areas on the outer body of already camouflaged animals. (Another example of the use of startle patterns is the gray [[tree frog]], with its bright-yellow leggings. When it leaps, a flash of bright yellow appears on its hind legs, usually startling the predator away from its [[prey]].)

The most notable feature of the moth is its large, purplish [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots]] on its two [[hindwing]]s. The eyespots give it its name \u2013 from the Greek myth of the cyclops [[Polyphemus]]. The species was first described by [[Pieter Cramer]] in 1776. The species is widespread in continental North America, with local populations found throughout subarctic [[Canada]] and the United States. The caterpillar can eat 86,000 times its weight at emergence in a little less than two months.\n\n==Life cycle==\nThe life cycle of the moth is much like that of any other Saturniidae species. It lays flat, light-brown eggs on the leaves of a number of host plants, including: ''[[Betula]]'' (birch), ''[[Salix]]'' (willow), ''[[Quercus]]'' (oak), ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'' (maple), ''[[Carya (genus)|Carya]]'' (hickory), ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'' (beech), ''[[Gleditsia triacanthos]]'' (honey locust), ''[[Juglans]]'' (walnut), ''[[Pyrus]]'' (pear and quince), ''[[Prunus]]'' (plum, peach, apricot, cherry, etc.), ''[[Sassafras]]'', ''[[Citrus]]'', and ''[[Ulmus americana]]'' (American elm).\n\nWhen the eggs hatch, small yellow caterpillars emerge. As the caterpillars age, they molt five times (the fifth being into a pupa). Each [[instar]] is slightly different, but on their fifth and final instar, they become bright green with silver spots on their sides.  They feed heavily on their host plant and can grow up to 3\u20134&nbsp;in long. They then spin [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]s of brown [[silk]], usually wrapped in leaves of the host plant.\n\nTwo broods generally hatch each year throughout the United States, one in early spring and one in late summer.  The moths [[eclose]] and then must pump their wings with fluid ([[hemolymph]]) to extend them. The females emit [[pheromones]], which the male can detect through his large, plumose (feathery) [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Males can fly for miles to reach a female. After the moths mate, the female spends the majority of the remainder of her life laying eggs, while the male may mate several more times.  Adults of this family of moths have [[vestigial]] mouths, meaning their mouth parts have been reduced. Because of this, they do not eat and only live as adults for less than one week.\n\nIn captivity, this moth is much more difficult to breed than other American saturniids such as ''[[Hyalophora cecropia]]'', ''[[Callosamia promethea]]'', or ''[[Actias luna]]''. Kept in a cage, the male and female tend to ignore each other, unless a food plant (particularly oak leaves) is present.{{Citation needed|reason=Would like to see some supporting evidence to back this up|date=September 2019}}\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Antheraea polyphemus eggs sjh.JPG|Eggs\nImage:Antheraea polyphemus 1st instar sjh.JPG|First-[[instar]] caterpillar reared on [[post oak]]\nImage:AntheraeaPolyphemusCaterpillar.jpg|Caterpillar in Virginia, United States\nImage:Antheraeapolyphemusmating.jpg|Adults mating\nFile:Polyphemus moth underside.jpg|Underside viewed through a window\nFile:Polyphemus moth topside.jpg|Topside after falling off window\n</gallery>\n\n==Sexual dimorphism==\n[[Image:Antheraea polyphemus variation sjh.JPG|thumb|right|Variation in adults]]\nDifferentiating between sexes of this species is very easy. The most obvious difference is the plumose [[antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Males have very bushy antennae while females have moderately less bushy antennae. The male's antennae are used to detect pheromones released by unmated females.  Another difference is that the females are slightly larger in the abdomen due to carrying eggs. A surprising amount of variation occurs within this species. Color patterns can range from a reddish cinnamon to a dark brown, but are almost always a shade of brown.\n\nIn the late 1950s, amateur [[lepidopterist]] [[Gary Botting]] hybridized the Polyphemus moth (then known as ''Telea polyphemus'') with ''[[Antheraea yamamai]]'' from Japan and, later, ''Antheraea mylitta'' from India by transferring the pheromone-producing scent sacs from  female \"''T. polyphemus''\" to the ''[[Antheraea]]'' females and allowing ''T. polyphemus'' males to mate with them. The resultant hybrids were displayed in his winning U.S. National Science Fair exhibit \"Intergeneric hybridization among giant silk moths\". After Botting consulted with genetic statistician [[J.B.S. Haldane]] and his wife, entomologist [[Helen Spurway]], the Polyphemus moth was reclassified, becoming ''Antheraea polyphemus''.\n\n==Conservation==\nParasitic insects \u2013 such as the [[parasitoid wasp]] \u2013 lay their eggs in or on the young caterpillars. These then hatch into larvae that consume the insides of the caterpillars. Once the caterpillars pupate, the larvae themselves pupate, killing the Polyphemus pupa. The ''[[Compsilura concinnata]]'' tachinid fly, introduced to North America to control gypsy moth, is one particular known threat to the North American native Polyphemus moth.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://wiki.bugwood.org/uploads/Ch2.pdf| title= The Effects of ''Compsilura concinnata'', an Introduced Generalist Tachinid, on Non-Target Species in North America: A Cautionary Tale |last1= Elkinton| first1= J. S.| last2= Boettner| first2= G. H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Squirrel]]s have also been known to consume the pupae of Polyphemus moths, decreasing the population greatly. Pruning of trees and leaving outdoor lights on at night can also be detrimental to the moths.\n\n==Response to threats==\nThe Polyphemus moth uses [[Antipredator adaptation|defense mechanism]]s to protect itself from [[predator]]s. One of its most distinctive mechanisms is a [[distraction display]] that serves to confuse, or simply distract, predators.  This involves the large [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]s on its hindwings, which give the moth its name (from the cyclops [[Polyphemus]] in Greek mythology). Eyespots are also startle patterns, a subform of distraction patterns, used for [[camouflage]] via deceptive and blending [[animal coloration|coloration]].  Most startle patterns are brightly colored areas on the outer body of already camouflaged animals. (Another example of the use of startle patterns is the gray [[tree frog]], with its bright-yellow leggings. When it leaps, a flash of bright yellow appears on its hind legs, usually startling the predator away from its [[prey]].) Distraction patterns are believed to be a form of [[automimicry|mimicry]], meant to misdirect predators by markings on the moths' [[Insect wing|wings]].  The pattern on the hindwings of the Polyphemus moth resembles that on the head of the [[great horned owl]] (''Bubo virginianus'').\n\n==References==\n\n<references />\n{{cite web | author=Brands, S.
